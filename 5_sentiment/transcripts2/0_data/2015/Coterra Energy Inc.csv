Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining Cabot's fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. I do have members of the executive group with me today. And also, the forward-looking statements included in the morning's pr",2285,"Okay. Thank you very much, Gary. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining Cabot's fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. I do have members of the executive group with me today. And also, the forward-looking statements included in the morning's press release do apply to my comments. As you did see in the morning's press release, 2014 marked another successful year for Cabot Oil & Gas, as we generated top tier growth in production, reserves, earnings, cash flow, despite continued price challenges in the Marcellus, coupled with a deteriorating oil price environment during the second half of the year. 
Going over a couple of bullet points. Cabot generated record production volumes of 532 Bcfe, an increase of 29% over '13 levels and an increase of 32% when adjusting for the sale of the Mid-Continent and West Texas assets in 2013. This included record liquids production that increased 55% year-over-year when adjusting for the 2013 asset sales. 
Net income, excluding select item for the year, was $405 million or $0.97 per share, an increase of 36% over '13. And operating cash flows for the year were $1.2 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year. This growth in earnings and cash flow was driven primarily by our strong production growth, combined with a 16% year-over-year decrease in unit cost. 
The company did take a non-cash after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of approximately $487 million related to the impairment of certain non-core properties, primarily in East Texas due to the significant decline in commodity prices and the decision not to pursue further activity in these legacy operating areas at this point in time. As a reminder, these assets were focus of the company prior to our development of the Marcellus to Eagle Ford and have not seen any meaningful levels of drilling activity since 2010. So there was no impact to the company's reserve report. 
I would also like to highlight that during the year, we purchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock and added approximately 40,000 net acres in our Eagle Ford position, all while we maintained a strong balance sheet with conservative leverage, metrics and over $1.3 billion of available borrowing capacity under our current facility at year end. 
On our proved reserves, in addition to this strong operational and financial performance during the year, we also generated significant growth in the year-end proved reserves, which increased 36% to over 4 point -- excuse me, 7.4 Tcfe. Cabot's all sourced finding and development cost for the year was $0.71 for Mcfe. This is particularly impressive given that over 43% of our 2014 capital was allocated to our oil properties in Eagle Ford that by nature are more capital intensive. Excluding the purchase of reserves in play associated with our Eagle Ford acquisition last year, the total company finding and development cost was $0.65 per Mcfe. 
In the Marcellus, our all sources finding development cost was $0.43 per Mcf, highlighting the capital efficiency of our wells in the Northeast PA. Obviously, one of the components is that our wells in this area do deliver very strong EURs. The Cabot's average EUR for the 2014 program on proved developed wells was over 18 Bcf, up from the 16.9 Bcf for our '13 program. As a result of our continued performance improvements, we have also increased our reserve bookings on locations in the Marcellus from an EUR of 10 Bcf to 11 Bcf per well. Our proved developed percentage increased from 59% in '13 to 61% in '14, highlighting our fairly conservative philosophy regarding our reserve bookings. For example, we booked a modest 0.7 offset pad location for each of our proved developed wells in the Marcellus at year-end. Our year-end reserves were 60 -- excuse me, 96% natural gas, down from the 97% in '13, which was driven by 100% increase in our liquids reserve base. Approximately 89% of our proved reserves are located in the Marcellus shale. 
I would also like to highlight that the Department of Environmental Protection released the production data for the second half of 2014 this week. And once again, Cabot dominated the list with the top 16 wells in the stake. 
Now let's move to our '15 program. While our '14 operational performance are in the rearview mirror, the results do highlight Cabot's ability to deliver strong results in a challenged price environment. However, we are immune to the market conditions the entire industry is currently facing. On our third quarter earnings call in October of last year, I laid out the company's initial 2015 program, which was predicated on realized natural gas price and oil prices of $2.80 and $88, respectively. As you all are aware, the operating environment the industry is facing has changed drastically since our call less than 4 months ago. While much of the focus over the last few months has been on the declining oil price, we have also experienced a fairly meaningful decline in the natural gas prices, including the regional index prices in Appalachia [indiscernible] what we are seeing in the major U.S. oil basis, Cabot and its peers have done an excellent job of finding an abundant supply of resources in the Marcellus. And as a result, supply-demand balance is currently at a sink. Until we see the rebalancing of the market, which reduced activity -- with the reduced activity, which I think is currently underway, I believe the industry will continue to see pricing pressures on both oil and gas. As you will recall, in the fourth quarter of last year, we saw a significant increase in natural gas supply on the 3 major pipes in our area, which included a 15% sequential increase in Cabot's volume in anticipation of winter. However, winter demand did not materialize as we all would have expected. And as a result, we have seen the local interface in January and February set at levels significantly  lower than our initial forecast. 
In response to this lower commodity price environment, we have adjusted our 2015 program with a focus on protecting the balance sheet and maximizing our return on investment while still managing our growth profile. Despite the change in our absolute levels of activity in 2015, our strategy remains unchanged. A focus on aligning our capital spending to be primarily funded by operating cash flows, focus our drilling efforts on maintaining our acreage position and optimizing operating efficiencies and the retention of our high-quality employee base. This strategy has positioned us a favorably leading into this commodity cycle. And we believe this strategy will allow us to exit the cycle extremely well-positioned. 
Company updated capital budget for 2015 is $900 million, which is a 42% decrease compared to our initial budget. Approximately 80% of the program will be directed towards drilling and completion activity, with 60% allocated to the Marcellus and 40% allocated to the Eagle Ford. 
In the Marcellus, we are currently operating 5 rigs with plans to decrease to 3 rigs by the end of the second quarter. Based on this level of activity, we expect to drill approximately 70 net wells and place 65 to 70 wells on production during the year. Given the backlog of wells we carried into 2015 and our anticipated level of activity during the year, we expect to exit the year with approximately 45 wells in the queue for 2016. Despite drilling longer laterals in '15, we expect well cost average between $6 million and $6.5 million as a result of operating efficiencies and the service cost reductions that we have received to date. However, as we are all aware, this is a dynamic market and our expectation is that as commodity prices remain depressed for a sustained period of time and the level of activity industrywide continues to decline, we will likely see a further reduction in cost. 
In the Eagle Ford, we are currently operating 3 rigs with plans to decrease to 1 rig by the end of the second quarter. Given where oil prices are currently, our focus is solely on lease maintenance and meeting all drilling obligations. Based on our planned rig count for the year, we expect to drill approximately 45 net wells and place 40 to 45 wells on production during the year. Again, given our backlog of wells that we carried into '15, our anticipated level of activity during the year, we expect to exit '15 with approximately 20 wells teed up ready for 2016. Similar to the Marcellus, we expect well cost for the year to average between $6 million and $6.5 million with an opportunity for further cost reductions as we move through the year. 
We remain excited about what we have seen so far in our 90,000-acre net position, which is all contiguous. However, in light of the current price environment, we believe the prudent decision is to maintain all of the acreage and wait until sustained recovery prices before we start accelerating activities in the future. Based on this updated operating program, we have adjusted our production guidance range for the year to 10% to 18%, which includes 50% to 60% growth in liquids production. This guidance range assumes a modest level of fulfillment to the Marcellus in anticipation of maintenance and high line pressures at certain points during the year. Additionally, we have also included of price-related curtailments in this guidance to account for those periods where price simply does not meet our threshold. Obviously, the natural question would be how much and what price we would take these actions. For competitive reasons, we will not disclose specifics. But I will say that our production profile for the year assumes entire volumes in the first quarter with a reduction in the second and third quarters and increasing again in the fourth quarter. The realized commodity prices used in this updated budget to make our $900 million program were $0.45 per Mcf, $2.45 for our natural gas and $55 per barrel for oil. This includes the impact of our natural gas hedges, which covers about 28% of our natural gas volumes at the midpoint of our updated guidance range. Also, for the full year, approximately 50% of our sales, gas sales, are price at 3 major indices in Northeast PA, which is Tennessee, Leidy and Millennium. Under these assumptions, our operating program would result in a very small level of ad spend, allowing us to maintain the same financial strength we demonstrated prior to this down cycle while still providing double-digit growth and generating returns. Some of you may find -- or may have questions about 2016, given our reduced level of activity this first year. First, let me say that our internal model shows continued growth in 2016 with the level of growth dependent upon factors that we'll certainly understand better as 2015 progresses. However, once you factor how commodity price environment evolves throughout 2015, we do anticipate similar operational and supply reductions by other operators in Northeast PA and reaction to the current prices and our expectation is that this will ultimately result in a rationalization of the supply and demand dynamics in our area. Given the expectation for our tapering of supply growth, coupled with new takeaway capacities in the Northeast, that's Leidy Southeast expansion and the [indiscernible] Eastside expansion that's coming online in the second half of the year, we will remain flexible with our program if the market wants us to make changes. Given the productivity and the low capital intensity of our wells in the Marcellus, we are well-positioned to adjust our operations in short order. As a reminder, we grew to our current production levels by never operating more than 6 rigs in the Marcellus. And given the anticipated backlog of 65 wells companywide at year-end 2015, we do have plenty of optionality to accelerate completions in the second half of the year as we see fit. As I mentioned earlier, our plan is to maintain our high quality employee base and we believe that positions us very well in the light -- in the event of a quick recovery. 
Another key factor that will drive '16 growth and enhance program returns will be the anticipated in-service of Constitution Pipeline, which is currently planned for the second half of 2016. Cabot has 500 million a day of capacity on this pipeline. So the timing of when this pipeline comes online will obviously have an impact on 2016 production levels. As a quick update on Constitution, there were a few significant accomplishments at the end of last year that bear repeating. As you are aware, on December 2, 2014, the FERC issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity, approving the Constitution Pipeline. In addition, on December 24, the New York BBC issued a formal notice of complete application regarding the final permits necessary from New York. We're currently awaiting the conclusion of the New York state public comment period, which is scheduled on February 27, 2015. Moving forward, we are hopeful to receive our final permits from New York during the second quarter and immediately file for the implementation and construction plan with the FERC with construction beginning this summer. 
So in summary, I've covered many topics. We are well-positioned to adapt and succeed in this price environment. I think it's clear, our asset base and our disciplined focus itself to allowing us to generate returns at these price levels that maybe many other operators will not -- or may not experience. And despite the current market conditions, we remain committed to delivering long-term shareholder value and certainly maintaining our strong balance sheet. Gary, with those comments, I'll turn it back over to you to queue up some questions."

But we have submitted all the permits. We submitted our original permits back in August of '13. There has been significant dialogue between Williams, the operator of the pipeline, not only the FERC but also the New York DEC. The protocol in moving through this process is that the DEC has made the determination as I mentioned on the 24th of December that we have fulfilled our obligation to give them all of the information they need to deem the project complete. With that though, there comes a public comment period. And that public comment period, we are in this period of time and it ends at the end of this month. Subsequent to that, the expectation is with no new issues that would have -- that have not come up over the last couple of years, that the New York DEC will grant a final permit.

The application process in New York and Pennsylvania for that matter over course we're finished in Pennsylvania, has been pretty much what we expected as a little bit longer than anticipated, but the process for this. And by getting the notice of complete application, it does signal that the New York DEC has all the information they need to issue the final permits. And the process we're in now is standard and operating procedure, where public comments are welcome based on the action that New York DEC took. In terms of getting construction started, Williams will file an implementation plan with FERC, probably next month. And then an implementation plan will include permits from all the agencies involved, including ones that FERC issued. And it will be complemented with the final permit from the New York once that's issued. When FERC gives that final determination, they'll issue a notice to proceed with construction. At that point, construction can begin. So it allows moving pieces but you really cannot dig dirt until all the pieces are all in place."

We bought that the differentials and we all realized the loss of $45, $50 on a per barrel. And we have reacted with a reduction in our activity, i.e. capital that translates into the number of wells drilled and completed, just purely based on that commodity price assumptions and maintaining our cash flow neutral program. And looking at Constitution and looking at, as I mentioned, the queue that we have built up of 40, 45 wells that we'll have at the end of 2015, we are going to be in good shape to be able to build our volumes into the expected commissioning date of '15. We continue to see efficiencies as we've reported from our '13 program to our '14 program. We expect continued efficiency gains in our '15 program, which I think is going to translate into maybe higher IPs and higher EURs, which would allow for a more rapid increase in the amount deliverability leading up to Constitution. I think again, a point to illustrate is the fact that in one of the premier gas fields in the entire world and an area that's growing probably faster than any other place that I'm aware of in the world is the County area in Pennsylvania. And all of the Marcellus, Cabot had the top 16 wells in the entire field. So I think that speaks volumes on our ability to be able to grow into the additional 500 million a day that is our volumes on Constitution in a fairly quick order and I might add without a lot of capital intensity."

But again, as being the singular focus, our strong need at this particular period of time, it is not that. But certainly, it's an idea that we kick around, and we look at and we build out a base on to be able to understand the markets out there in the longer-term.

However, every incremental amount of gas that we would produce in the Marcellus goes into the indices that are the most challenged right now.

So that is 1 component to the lower volumes that I've alluded to in the second and third quarter. The other is just putting a soft spot in our guidance for low gas prices.

But we move up from 1 location to the other and everything is set up and ready to go. So they keep their equipment and personnel running 24/7 and very efficient.

And again, whatever -- the rest of the market does is -- and what service cost realizations they see is going to be all unique and individual. But we are seeing fairly significant cost reductions."

Actually, the 650 million a day because Southwest is part of that Constitution Pipeline being 650 million a day capacity. Or would it be an incremental volume that would flow into the pipe.

But there's a lot of projects planned in the Atlantic -- mid-Atlantic states. And in Pennsylvania, there's been a push to in conjunction with the ISO in that area to build some power generation and feed it with local supply. So we're looking at projects that are close by at Susquehanna County or have direct routes, pipeline routes, that we can reach these projects. I think the -- some of the planners of these -- and we did mention the Panda project. They probably have 4 or 5 other projects that are well along the way in terms of planning locations and permitting and financing and so forth. Most of these guys get their power deal done first, in other words, access to the grid. And then they come to gas suppliers. And they have their wish list and we have our wish list and we try to work through those and come to terms. There's 4 or 5 [ph] power generators off the system that we're working with as well. And there are some off Tennessee system and there are some of the Leidy system. This is going to be a profit that goes on probably in the next 5 to 10 years, even, just a lot of opportunity for power generation with natural gas with coal retirements and with coal switching and oil switching. It's a piece of the demand puzzle and it's very active and very dynamic. And we're situated in the Northeast corner. We're probably the closest supplier to market there is. And so we're comfortable with these kinds of markets. And we're probably announcing, if we are to be successful in the next year or 2 on some of these projects."

Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining Cabot's fourth quarter and year end earnings call. I do have members of the executive group with me today. And also, the forward-looking statements included in the morning's pr",2303,"Okay. Thank you very much, Gary. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining Cabot's fourth quarter and year end earnings call. I do have members of the executive group with me today. And also, the forward-looking statements included in the morning's press release do apply to my comments. As you did see in the morning's press release, 2014 marked another successful year for Cabot Oil & Gas, as we generated top tier growth in production, reserves, earnings, cash flow, despite continued price challenges in the Marcellus, coupled with a deteriorating oil price environment during the second half of the year. 
Going over a couple of bullet points. Cabot generated record production volumes of 532 Bcfe, an increase of 29% over '13 levels and an increase of 32% when adjusting for the sale of the Mid-Continent and West Texas assets in 2013. This included record liquids production that increased 55% year-over-year when adjusting for the 2013 asset sales. 
Net income, excluding select item for the year, was $405 million or $0.97 per share, an increase of 36% over '13. And operating cash flows for the year were $1.2 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year. This growth in earnings and cash flow was driven primarily by our strong production growth, combined with a 16% year-over-year decrease in unit cost. 
The company did take a non-cash after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of approximately $487 million related to the impairment of certain non-core properties, primarily in East Texas due to the significant decline in commodity prices and the decision not to pursue further activity in these legacy operating areas at this point in time. As a reminder, these assets were the focus of the company prior to our development of the Marcellus and Eagle Ford and have not seen any meaningful levels of drilling activity since 2010. So there was no impact to the company's reserve report. 
I would also like to highlight that during the year we purchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock and added approximately 40,000 net acres in our Eagle Ford position, all while we maintained a strong balance sheet with conservative leverage, metrics and over $1.3 billion of available borrowing capacity under our current facility at year end. 
On our proved reserves, in addition to this strong operational and financial performance during the year, we also generated significant growth in the year end proved reserves, which increased 36% to over 4 point -- excuse me, 7.4 Tcfe. Cabot's all source finding and development cost for the year was $0.71 per Mcfe. This is particularly impressive given that over 43% of our 2014 capital was allocated to our oil properties in Eagle Ford that by nature are more capital intensive. Excluding the purchase of reserves in plays associated with our Eagle Ford acquisition last year, the total company finding and development cost was $0.65 per Mcfe. 
In the Marcellus, our all sources finding development cost was $0.43 per Mcf, highlighting the capital efficiency of our wells in the Northeast PA. Obviously, one of the components is that our wells in this area do deliver very strong EURs. The Cabot's average EUR for the 2014 program on proved developed wells was over 18 Bcf, up from the 16.9 Bcf for our '13 program. As a result of our continued performance improvements, we have also increased our reserve bookings on PUD locations in the Marcellus from an EUR of 10 Bcf to 11 Bcf per well. Our proved developed percentage increased from 59% in '13 to 61% in '14, highlighting our fairly conservative philosophy regarding our reserve bookings. For example, we booked a modest 0.7 offset PUD locations for each of our proved developed wells in the Marcellus at year end. 
Our year-end reserves were 60 -- excuse me, 96% natural gas, down from the 97% in '13, which was driven by 100% increase in our liquids reserve base. Approximately 89% of our proved reserves are located in the Marcellus shale. 
I would also like to highlight that the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection released the production data for the second half of 2014 this week. And once again, Cabot dominated the list with the top 16 wells in the stake. 
Now let's move to our '15 program. While our '14 operational financial performance are in the rearview mirror, the results do highlight Cabot's ability to deliver strong results in a challenged price environment. However, we are immune to the market conditions the entire industry is currently facing. On our third quarter earnings call in October of last year, I laid out the company's initial 2015 program, which was predicated on realized natural gas price and oil prices of $2.80 and $88, respectively. As you all are aware, the operating environment the industry is facing has changed drastically since our call less than 4 months ago. While much of the focus over the last few months has been on the declining oil price, we have also experienced a fairly meaningful decline in the natural gas prices, including the regional index prices in Appalachia, no different than what we are seeing in the major U.S. oil basins. Cabot and its peers have done an excellent job of finding an abundant supply of resources in the Marcellus. And as a result, supply-demand balance is currently at a synch. Until we see the rebalancing of the market, which reduced activity -- with the reduced activity, which I think is currently underway, I believe the industry will continue to see pricing pressures on both oil and gas. 
As you will recall, in the fourth quarter of last year we saw a significant increase in natural gas supply on the 3 major pipes in our area, which included a 15% sequential increase in Cabot's volume in anticipation of winter. However, winter demand did not materialize as we all would have expected. And as a result, we have seen the local interface in January and February set at levels significantly  lower than our initial forecast. 
In response to this lower commodity price environment, we have adjusted our 2015 program with a focus on protecting the balance sheet and maximizing our return on investment while still managing our growth profile. Despite the change in our absolute levels of activity in 2015, our strategy remains unchanged. A focus on aligning our capital spending to be primarily funded by operating cash flows, focus our drilling efforts on maintaining our acreage position and optimizing operating efficiencies and the retention of our high-quality employee base. This strategy has positioned us favorably leading into this commodity cycle. And we believe this strategy will allow us to exit the cycle extremely well positioned. 
Company updated capital budget for 2015 is $900 million, which is a 42% decrease compared to our initial budget. Approximately 80% of the program will be directed towards drilling and completion activity, with 60% allocated to the Marcellus and 40% allocated to the Eagle Ford. 
In the Marcellus, we are currently operating 5 rigs with plans to decrease to 3 rigs by the end of the second quarter. Based on this level of activity, we expect to drill approximately 70 net wells and place 65 to 70 wells on production during the year. Given the backlog of wells we carried into 2015 and our anticipated level of activity during the year, we expect to exit the year with approximately 45 wells in the queue for 2016. Despite drilling longer laterals in '15, we expect well cost average between $6 million and $6.5 million as a result of operating efficiencies and the service cost reductions that we have received to date. However, as we are all aware, this is a dynamic market and our expectation is that commodity prices remain depressed for a sustained period of time and the level of activity industry-wide continues to decline, we will likely see a further reduction in cost. 
In the Eagle Ford, we are currently operating 3 rigs with plans to decrease to 1 rig by the end of the second quarter. Given where oil prices are currently, our focus is solely on lease maintenance and meeting all drilling obligations. Based on our planned rig count for the year, we expect to drill approximately 45 net wells and place 40 to 45 wells on production during the year. Again, given our backlog of wells that we carried into '15, our anticipated level of activity during the year, we expect to exit '15 with approximately 20 wells teed up ready for 2016. Similar to the Marcellus, we expect well cost for the year to average between $6 million and $6.5 million with an opportunity for further cost reductions as we move through the year. 
We remain excited about what we have seen so far in our 90,000-acre net position, which is all contiguous. However, in light of the current price environment, we believe the prudent decision is to maintain all of the acreage and wait until a sustained recovery in prices before we start accelerating activities in the future. Based on this updated operating program, we have adjusted our production guidance range for the year to 10% to 18%, which includes 50% to 60% growth in liquids production. This guidance range assumes a modest level of curtailment to the Marcellus in anticipation of maintenance and high line pressures at certain points during the year. 
Additionally, we have also included a wedge of price-related curtailments in this guidance to account for those periods where price simply does not meet our threshold. Obviously, the natural question would be how much and what price we would take these actions. For competitive reasons, we will not disclose specifics but I will say that our production profile for the year assumes entire volumes in the first quarter with a reduction in the second and third quarters and increasing again in the fourth quarter. The realized commodity prices used in this updated budget to make our $900 million program were $0.45 per Mcf, $2.45 for our natural gas and $55 per barrel for oil. This includes the impact of our natural gas hedges, which covers about 28% of our natural gas volumes at the midpoint of our updated guidance range. 
Also for the full year, approximately 50% of our sales, gas sales, are priced at 3 major indices in Northeast PA, which is Tennessee, Leidy and Millennium. Under these assumptions, our operating program would result in a very small level of our spend, allowing us to maintain the same financial strength we demonstrated prior to this down cycle while still providing double-digit growth and generating returns. Some of you may find -- or may have questions about 2016, given our reduced level of activity this first year. First let me say that our internal model shows continued growth in 2016 with the level of growth dependent upon factors that will certainly be understand better as 2015 progresses. However, once you factor how the commodity price environment evolves throughout 2015, we do anticipate similar operational and supply reductions by other operators in Northeast PA in reaction to the current prices and our expectation is that this will ultimately result in a rationalization of the supply and demand dynamics in our area. 
Given the expectation for our tapering of supply growth, coupled with new takeaway capacities in the Northeast, that's Leidy Southeast expansion and the TICO Eastside expansion that's coming online in the second half of the year, we will remain flexible with our program if the market wants us to make changes. Given the productivity and the low capital intensity of our wells in the Marcellus, we are well-positioned to adjust our operations in short order. As a reminder, we grew to our current production levels by never operating more than 6 rigs in the Marcellus. And given the anticipated backlog of 65 wells company-wide at year end 2015, we do have plenty of optionality to accelerate completions in the second half of the year as we see fit. As I mentioned earlier, our plan is to maintain our high quality employee base and we believe that positions us very well in the light -- in the event of a quick recovery. 
Another key factor that will drive '16 growth and enhance program returns will be the anticipated in-service of Constitution Pipeline, which is currently planned for the second half of 2016. Cabot has 500 million a day of capacity on this pipeline. So the timing of when this pipeline comes online will obviously have an impact on 2016 production levels. As a quick update, on Constitution there were a few significant accomplishments at the end of last year that bear repeating. As you are aware, on December 2, 2014, the FERC issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, approving the Constitution Pipeline. In addition, on December 24, the New York DEC issued a formal notice of complete application regarding the final permits necessary from New York. We're currently awaiting the conclusion of the New York state public comment period, which is scheduled in on February 27, 2015. Moving forward, we are hopeful to receive our final permits from New York during the second quarter and immediately file for the implementation and construction plan with the FERC with construction beginning this summer. 
So in summary, I've covered many topics. We are well-positioned to adapt and succeed in this price environment. I think it's clear, our asset base and our disciplined focus lends itself to allowing us to generate returns at these price levels that maybe many other operators will not -- or may not experience. And despite the current market conditions, we remain committed to delivering our long-term shareholder value and certainly maintaining our strong balance sheet. Gary, with those comments, I'll turn it back over to you to queue up some questions."

Doug, just to add a few points to that. The application process in New York and Pennsylvania for that matter and of course we're finished in Pennsylvania, has been pretty much what we expected, it's taking a little bit longer than we expected but the process is what it is and by getting the notice of complete application, it does signal that the New York DEC has all the information they need to issue the final permit. And the process we're in now is the standard and operating procedure, where public comments are welcome based on the action that New York DEC took. In terms of getting construction started, Williams will file an implementation plan with FERC, probably next month. And then an implementation plan will include permits from all the agencies involved, including the ones that FERC issued. And it will be complemented with the final permit from New York once that's issued. When FERC gives that final determination, they'll issue a notice to proceed with construction. At that point, construction can begin. So it allows moving pieces but you really cannot dig dirt until all the pieces are in place."

And looking at Constitution and looking at, as I mentioned, the queue that we have built up of 40, 45 wells that we'll have at the end of 2015, we are going to be in good shape to be able to build our volumes into the expected commissioning date of '15. We continue to see efficiencies as we've reported from our '13 program to our '14 program. We expect continued efficiency gains in our '15 program, which I think is going to translate into maybe higher IPs and higher EURs, which would allow for a more rapid increase in the amount of deliverability leading up to Constitution. I think again, a point to illustrate is the fact that in one of the premier gas fields in the entire world in an area that's growing probably faster than any other place that I'm aware of in the world is the 6-county area in Pennsylvania. And all of the Marcellus, Cabot had the top 16 wells in the entire field.

I think selling into like low cost market is -- or a low value market is going to be rationalized a little bit. But what occurs during the high [ph] shoulder months would be some pressure up on the pipelines. And during that period of time, it can back gas off the market, even though there's been a number of projects to compress and to mitigate the line pressures in the past. So that is 1 component to the lower volumes that I've alluded to in the second and third quarter. The other is just putting a soft spot in our guidance for low gas prices. If we see low gas prices, we're just not going to give our gas away and we would take gas off the market. So that's the reason -- nothing operational except for the midstream part of the operation to give us that well."

We have a very efficient operation from the standpoint of the service providers. And I'll talk about frac crews as being the highest percentage of any one completed well besides the rigs. But we move from 1 location to the other and everything is set up and ready to go. So they keep their equipment and personnel running 24/7 and very efficient. And I think that is attractive to them. But you look at the reduction that we've referenced already. And we go from, say, a $7 million well to a $6 million to $6.5 million well.

In the future, we would expect in the pipes that Jeff has been talking about that are on the drawing board and moving forward and have expected commissioning dates with those pipes and allowing additional gas or gas to get out of that particular area and also those 3 pipes in particular is going to allow, certainly, different dynamics going forward than we're experiencing today. I can't predict exactly what the impact is going to be on supply side or the demand side, let's say, at the end of 2017. But I can say that we are going to have a significant level of additional volumes of our gas that would be seeking and priced in different markets than we're experiencing today. So operationally, Marshall, you can still have operational floors and pressures on pipes based on the amount of volume running through them. But I think the opportunity to -- and the flexibility that additional pipes is going to afford us in the future is going to be fairly significant."

Or would it be an incremental volume that we flow into the pipe. And that decision, Matt, is going to be a combination of price point and the ability to diverse the amount of gas that is flowing into those of 3 pipes with some of the new pipes that are coming online, i.e. Leidy, Southeast, the impact on those 3 pipes, the TICO expansion and some of the other smaller projects that Jeff mentioned, so I can say this though. But from a planning standpoint, we're going to be prepared to have incremental volumes going into the Constitution pipeline.

But there's a lot of projects planned in the Atlantic -- Mid-Atlantic states. And in Pennsylvania, there's been a push to in conjunction with the ISO in that area to build some power generation and feed it with the local supply. So we're looking at projects that are close by at Susquehanna County or have direct routes, pipeline routes, that we can reach these projects. I think the -- some of the planners of these, and we did mention the Panda project, they probably have 4 or 5 other projects that are well on the way in terms of planning locations and permitting and financing and so forth. But most of these guys are -- they get their power deal done first, in other words, access to the grid. And then they come to gas suppliers. And they have their wish list and we have our wish list and we try to work through those and come to terms. There's 4 or 5 power generators off the [indiscernible] system that we're working with as well. And there are some off the Tennessee system and there are some of the Leidy system. This is going to be a profit that goes on probably in the next 5 to 10 years, even, just a lot of opportunity for power generation with natural gas with coal retirements and with coal switching and oil switching. So it's a piece of the demand puzzle and it's very active and very dynamic. And where we're situated in the Northeast corner, we're probably the closest supplier to market there is.

Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining Cabot's fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. I do have members of the executive group with me today. And also, the forward-looking statements included in the morning's press release do apply to my comments. As you did see in the morning's press release, 2014 marked another successful year for Cabot Oil & Gas, as we generated top tier growth in production, reserves, earnings, cash flow, despite continued price challenges in the Marcellus, coupled with a deteriorating oil price environment during the second half of the year. 
Going over a couple of bullet points. Cabot generated record production volumes of 532 Bcfe, an increase of 29% over '13 levels and an increase of 32% when adjusting for the sale of the Mid-Continent and West Texas assets in 2013. This included record liquids production that increased 55% year-over-year when adjusting for the 2013 asset sales. 
Net income, excluding select items for the year, was $405 million or $0.97 per share, an increase of 36% over '13. And operating cash flows for the year was $1.2 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year. This growth in earnings and cash flow was driven primarily by our strong production growth, combined with a 16% year-over-year decrease in unit cost. 
The company did take a non-cash after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of approximately $487 million related to the impairment of certain non-core properties, primarily in East Texas, due to the significant decline in commodity prices and the decision not to pursue further activity in these legacy operating areas at this point in time. As a reminder, these assets were the focus of the company prior to our development of the Marcellus and Eagle Ford and have not seen any meaningful levels of drilling activity since 2010. So there was no impact to the company's reserve report. 
I would also like to highlight that during the year we purchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock and added approximately 40,000 net acres in our Eagle Ford position, all while we maintained a strong balance sheet with conservative leverage, metrics and over $1.3 billion of available borrowing capacity under our current facility at year end. 
On our proved reserves, in addition to this strong operational and financial performance during the year, we also generated significant growth in the year end proved reserves, which increased 36% to over 4 point -- excuse me, 7.4 Tcfe. Cabot's all source finding and development cost for the year was $0.71 per Mcfe. This is particularly impressive given that over 43% of our 2014 capital was allocated to our oil properties in Eagle Ford that by nature are more capital intensive. Excluding the purchase of reserves in plays associated with our Eagle Ford acquisition last year, the total company finding and development cost was $0.65 per Mcfe. 
In the Marcellus, our oil sources finding development cost was $0.43 per Mcf, highlighting the capital efficiency of our wells in the Northeast PA. Obviously, one of the components is that our wells in this area do deliver very strong EURs. The Cabot's average EUR for the 2014 program on proved developed wells was over 18 Bcf, up from the 16.9 Bcf for our '13 program. As a result of our continued performance improvements, we have also increased our reserve bookings on PUD locations in the Marcellus from an EUR of 10 Bcf to 11 Bcf per well. Our proved developed percentage increased from 59% in '13 to 61% in '14, highlighting our fairly conservative philosophy regarding our reserve bookings. For example, we booked a modest 0.7 offset PUD locations for each of our proved developed wells in the Marcellus at year end. 
Our year-end reserves were 60 -- excuse me, 96% natural gas, down from the 97% in '13, which was driven by 100% increase in our liquids reserve base. Approximately 89% of our proved reserves are located in the Marcellus shale. 
I would also like to highlight that the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection released the production data for the second half of 2014 this week. And once again, Cabot dominated the list with the top 16 wells in the state. 
Now let's move to our '15 program. While our '14 operational financial performance are in the rearview mirror, the results do highlight Cabot's ability to deliver strong results in a challenged price environment. However, we aren't immune to the market conditions the entire industry is currently facing. On our third quarter earnings call in October of last year, I laid out the company's initial 2015 program, which was predicated on realized natural gas price and oil prices of $2.80 and $88, respectively. As you all are aware, the operating environment the industry is facing has changed drastically since our call less than 4 months ago. While much of the focus over the last few months has been on the declining oil price, we have also experienced a fairly meaningful decline in the natural gas prices, including the regional index prices in Appalachia. No different than what we are seeing in the major U.S. oil basins, Cabot and its peers have done an excellent job of finding an abundant supply of resources in the Marcellus. And as a result, supply-demand balance is currently at a synch. Until we see the rebalancing of the market, which reduced activity -- with the reduced activity, which I think is currently under way, I believe the industry will continue to see pricing pressures on both oil and gas. 
As you will recall, in the fourth quarter of last year we saw a significant increase in natural gas supply on the 3 major pipes in our area, which included a 15% sequential increase in Cabot's volume in anticipation of winter. However, winter demand did not materialize as we all would have expected. And as a result, we have seen the local indices in January and February set at levels significantly  lower than our initial forecast. 
In response to this lower commodity price environment, we have adjusted our 2015 program with a focus protecting the balance sheet and maximizing our return on investment, while still managing our growth profile. Despite the change in our absolute levels of activity in 2015, our strategy remains unchanged. A focus on aligning our capital spending to be primarily funded by operating cash flows, focus our drilling efforts on maintaining our acreage position and optimizing operating efficiencies and the retention of our high-quality employee base. This strategy has positioned us favorably leading into this commodity cycle. And we believe this strategy will allow us to exit the cycle extremely well positioned. 
Company updated capital budget for 2015 is $900 million, which is a 42% decrease compared to our initial budget. Approximately 80% of the program will be directed towards drilling and completion activity, with 60% allocated to the Marcellus and 40% allocated to the Eagle Ford. 
In the Marcellus, we are currently operating 5 rigs, with plans to decrease to 3 rigs by the end of the second quarter. Based on this level of activity, we expect to drill approximately 70 net wells and place 65 to 70 wells on production during the year. Given the backlog of wells we carried into 2015 and our anticipated level of activity during the year, we expect to exit the year with approximately 45 wells in the queue for 2016. Despite drilling longer laterals in '15, we expect well costs to average between $6 million and $6.5 million as a result of operating efficiencies and the service cost reductions that we have received to date. However, as we are all aware, this is a dynamic market and our expectation is that if commodity prices remain depressed for a sustained period of time and the level of activity industry-wide continues to decline, we will likely see a further reduction in cost. 
In the Eagle Ford, we are currently operating 3 rigs with plans to decrease to 1 rig by the end of the second quarter. Given where oil prices are currently, our focus is solely on lease maintenance and meeting all drilling obligations. Based on our planned rig count for the year, we expect to drill approximately 45 net wells and place 40 to 45 wells on production during the year. Again, given our backlog of wells that we carried into '15, our anticipated level of activity during the year, we expect to exit '15 with approximately 20 wells teed up, ready for 2016. Similar to the Marcellus, we expect well costs for the year to average between $6 million and $6.5 million, with an opportunity for further cost reductions as we move through the year. 
We remain excited about what we have seen so far in our 90,000-acre net position, which is all contiguous. However, in light of the current price environment, we believe the prudent decision is to maintain all of the acreage and wait until a sustained recovery in prices before we start accelerating activities in the future. Based on this updated operating program, we have adjusted our production guidance range for the year to 10% to 18%, which includes 50% to 60% growth in liquids production. This guidance range assumes a modest level of curtailment in the Marcellus in anticipation of maintenance and high line pressures at certain points during the year. 
Additionally, we have also included a wedge of price-related curtailments in this guidance to account for those periods where price simply does not meet our threshold. Obviously, the natural question would be how much and what price we would take these actions. For competitive reasons, we will not disclose specifics, but I will say that our production profile for the year assumes higher volumes in the first quarter with a reduction in the second and third quarters and increasing again in the fourth quarter. The realized commodity prices used in this updated budget to make our $900 million program were $0.45 per Mcf, $2.45 for our natural gas and $55 per barrel for oil. This includes the impact of our natural gas hedges, which covers about 28% of our natural gas volumes at the midpoint of our updated guidance range. 
Also for the full year, approximately 50% of our sales, gas sales, are priced at 3 major indices in Northeast PA, which is Tennessee, Leidy and Millennium. Under these assumptions, our operating program would result in a very small level of outspend, allowing us to maintain the same financial strength we demonstrated prior to this down cycle, while still providing double-digit growth and generating returns. Some of you may find -- or may have questions about 2016, given our reduced level of activity this first year. First let me say that our internal model shows continued growth in 2016, with the level of growth dependent upon factors that will certainly be understand better as 2015 progresses. However, one key factor is how the commodity price environment evolves throughout 2015. We do anticipate similar operational and supply reductions by other operators in Northeast PA in reaction to the current prices, and our expectation is that this will ultimately result in a rationalization of the supply and demand dynamics in our area. 
Given an expectation for our tapering of supply growth, coupled with new takeaway capacities in the Northeast, that's the Leidy Southeast expansion and the TICO Eastside expansion that's coming online in the second half of the year, we will remain flexible with our program if the market warrants us to make changes. Given the productivity and the low capital intensity of our wells in the Marcellus, we are well-positioned to adjust our operations in short order. As a reminder, we grew to our current production levels by never operating more than 6 rigs in the Marcellus. And given the anticipated backlog of 65 wells company-wide at year end 2015, we do have plenty of optionality to accelerate completions in the second half of the year as we see fit. As I mentioned earlier, our plan is to maintain a high-quality employee base and we believe that positions us very well in the light -- in the event of a quick recovery. 
Another key factor that will drive '16 growth and enhance program returns will be the anticipated in-service of Constitution Pipeline, which is currently planned for the second half of 2016. Cabot has 500 million a day of capacity on this pipeline. So the timing of when this pipeline comes online will obviously have an impact on 2016 production levels. As a quick update on Constitution, there were a few significant accomplishments at the end of last year that bear repeating. As you are aware, on December 2, 2014, the FERC issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, approving the Constitution Pipeline. In addition, on December 24, the New York DEC issued a formal notice of complete application regarding the final permits necessary from New York. We're currently awaiting the conclusion of the New York State public comment period, which is scheduled in on February 27, 2015. Moving forward, we are hopeful to receive our final permits from New York during the second quarter and immediately file for the implementation and construction plan with the FERC, with construction beginning this summer. 
So in summary, I've covered many topics. We are well-positioned to adapt and succeed in this price environment. I think it's clear, our asset base and our disciplined focus lends itself to allowing us to generate returns at these price levels that maybe many other operators will not -- or may not experience. And despite the current market conditions, we remain committed to delivering our long-term shareholder value and certainly maintaining our strong balance sheet. Gary, with those comments, I'll turn it back over to you to tee up some questions."

But we have submitted all the permits. We submitted our original permits back in August of '13. There has been significant dialogue between Williams, the operator of the pipeline, not only the FERC but also the New York DEC. The protocol in moving through this process is that the DEC has made the determination, as I mentioned on the 24th of December, that we have fulfilled our obligation to give them all of the information they need to deem the project complete. With that, though, there comes a public comment period. And that public comment period, we are in at this period of time and it ends at the end of this month. Subsequent to that, the expectation is with no new issues that would have -- that have not come up over the last couple of years, that the New York DEC will grant a final permit. And then that would allow us to make the application to FERC to begin construction."

The application process in New York and Pennsylvania, for that matter, of course we're finished in Pennsylvania, has been pretty much what we expected, it's taking a little bit longer than we expected but the process is what it is. And by getting the notice of complete application, it does signal that the New York DEC has all the information they need to issue the final permit. And the process we're in now is the standard and operating procedure, where public comments are welcome based on the action that New York DEC took. In terms of getting construction started, Williams will file an implementation plan with FERC, probably next month. And that implementation plan will include permits from all the agencies involved, including the ones that FERC issued. And it will be complemented with the final permit from New York once that's issued. When FERC gives that final determination, they'll issue a Notice to Proceed with construction. At that point, construction can begin. So it's a lot of moving pieces but you really cannot dig dirt until all the pieces are in place."

We've looked at the differentials and we all realized the loss of $45, $50 on a per barrel. And we have reacted with a reduction in our activity, i.e., capital that translates into the number of wells drilled and completed, just purely based on that commodity price assumptions and maintaining our cash flow neutral program. And looking at Constitution and looking at, as I've mentioned, the queue that we had built up of 40, 45 wells that we'll have at the end of 2015, we are going to be in good shape to be able to build our volumes into the expected commissioning date of '15. We continue to see efficiencies as we've reported from our '13 program to our '14 program. We expect continued efficiency gains in our '15 program, which I think is going to translate into maybe higher IPs and higher EURs, which would allow for a more rapid increase in the amount of deliverability leading up to Constitution. I think, again, a point to illustrate is the fact that in one of the premier gas fields in the entire world in an area that's growing probably faster than any other place that I'm aware of in the world is the 6-county area in Pennsylvania. In all of the Marcellus, Cabot had the top 16 wells in the entire field. So I think that speaks volumes on our ability to be able to grow into the additional 500 million a day that is our volumes on Constitution in a fairly quick order and, I might add, without a lot of capital intensity."

But again, to think about our long-term runway and to position us to take advantage of an uptick in the oil market, for example, I think it is prudent for us to look at what type of area where we might want to be in, in the long-term and how we might want to position and how we create that position. But again, as it being a singular focus or a strong need at this particular period of time, it is not that. But certainly, it's an idea that we kick around and we look at and we build database on to be able to understand the markets out there in the longer term. So if we move around the balance of commodity, i.e., more oil versus our 60 -- our 96% gas versus 4% oil, it will be a long-term view and we'll take advantage of it.

And that new acreage we acquired in the Eagle Ford had near-term lease expirations that required drilling activity. And so our balance of capital with bringing it down to kind of our cash flow level just dictated, based on the acreage capture in the Eagle Ford, how much activity we were going to have in that particular area. And in regard to where that places our -- our activity in the Marcellus, we have ample supply to sell into the market that would give us a growth profile greater than what we have represented in our guidance. However, every incremental amount of gas that we would produce in the Marcellus goes into the indices that are the most challenged right now. So to grow into that with additional drilling, even though we are, yes, recognizing very good returns, it still boils down to the balancing act between our cash flow and the amount of activity that's necessary for our maintenance program. So that's the balance that we see short term being our '15 program."

I think selling into a low-cost market is -- or a low-value market is going to be rationalized a little bit. But what occurs during the, i.e., shoulder months would be some pressure up on the pipelines. And during that period of time, it can back gas off the market, even though there's been a number of projects to compress and to mitigate the line pressures in the past. So that is 1 component to the lower volumes that I've alluded to in the second and third quarter. The other is just putting a soft spot in our guidance for low gas prices. If we see low gas prices, we're just not going to give our gas away and we would take gas off the market. So that's the reason.

I guess what we've heard from other operators in Appalachia is that unlike some of the oil-producing basins, there wasn't really excess margins that service companies were generating last year.

And the -- each service provider can be a little bit unique on what their ultimate goal is. Some would prefer to capture margin and some would prefer to keep their equipment and their personnel busy and they would sacrifice margin. So our operation is a very consolidated acreage position. We have a very efficient operation from the standpoint of the service providers. And I'll talk about frac crews just as being the highest percentage of any one completed well besides the rigs. But we move from 1 location to the other and everything is set up and ready to go. So they keep their equipment and personnel running 24/7 and very efficient. And I think that is attractive to them. But you look at the reduction that we've referenced already. And we go from, say, a $7 million well to a $6 million to a $6.5 million well. We're already seeing those incremental reductions in service cost. And again, whatever the rest of the market does is -- and what service cost realizations they see is going to be all unique and individual.

Actually, it would be 650 million a day because Southwest is part of that Constitution Pipeline being a 650-million-a-day capacity. Or would it be incremental volumes that we flow into the pipe. And that decision, Matt, is going to be a combination of price point and the ability to diverse the amount of gas that is flowing into those of 3 pipes with some of the new pipes that are coming online, i.e., Leidy, Southeast, the impact on those 3 pipes, the TICO expansion and some of the other smaller projects that Jeff mentioned.

And potentially, what commodity price you'd need to see at this point, given service cost to add rigs back to that market?"

But there's a lot of projects planned in the Atlantic -- Middle-Atlantic states. And in Pennsylvania, there's been a push to in conjunction with the ISO in that area to build some power generation and feed it with local supplies. So we're looking at projects that are close by Susquehanna County or have direct routes, pipeline routes, that we can reach these projects. I think the -- some of the planners of these, and we did mention the Panda project, they probably have 4 or 5 other projects that are well on the way in terms of planning locations and permitting and financing and so forth. But most of these guys are -- they get their power deal done first, in other words, access to the grid and then come to gas suppliers. And they have their wish list and we have our wish list and we try to work through those and come to terms. There's 4 or 5 power generators off the Iroquois system that we're working with as well. And there are some off the Tennessee system and there are some off the Leidy system. This is going to be a profit that goes on probably in the next 5 to 10 years even. Just a lot of opportunity for power generation with natural gas with coal retirements and with coal switching and oil switching. So it's a piece of the demand puzzle and it's very active and very dynamic. And where we're situated, in the Northeast corner, we're probably the closest supply to market there is. And so we're comfortable with these kinds of markets. And we'll be probably announcing, if we are successful, in the next year or 2 on some of these projects."

I think the New York DEC has run a very careful and thorough examination of the route and the issues and listening to the concerns of surface owners.

Thank you for joining us today for the Cabot first quarter call. With me today, as usual, are several of our management team. Before we start, the standard regarding forward-looking statements do apply to my comments",2123,"Thank you, Ben, and good morning, all. Thank you for joining us today for the Cabot first quarter call. With me today, as usual, are several of our management team. Before we start, the standard regarding forward-looking statements do apply to my comments today. I would first like to touch upon a few financial and operating highlights from the first quarter that were outlined in this morning's press release. First -- excuse me, equivalent net production for the first quarter was slightly above 1.9 Bcfe per day, an increase of 43% over the prior year's comparable quarter and a sequential increase of 15% over the fourth quarter. Of particular note, our daily liquids production for the quarter increased 132% compared to the prior year's comparable quarter and 20% sequential -- sequentially over the fourth quarter, highlighting the success of our team in the Eagle Ford. 
Net income excluding select items for the quarter was $49 million or $0.12 per share and discretionary cash flow for the quarter was $240 million. Both of these items decreased relative to the first quarter of '14 due to a 34% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 55% decline in realized oil prices. 
On the coal side, our team continues to work hard and deliver on driving down unit cost, which is evidenced by the 10% decline in cash unit cost to $1.22 per Mcfe. I think that decline is even more impressive when considering that we have increased the percentage of all focused activity in our mix, which typically is more costly to operate on a per unit basis. 
Additionally, we reaffirm guidance, even with the planned curtailment, which is, I think, the right economic decision. In the Marcellus, our operational results for the quarter exceeded expectations. The company averaged over 2 Bcf per day of gross Marcellus production, which is 1.7 Bcf per day at net production, an increase, as mentioned previously, of 43% over last year's comparable quarter. We competed 19 wells and played 17 wells on oil production, which drove the 16% sequential growth for the quarter. These production levels highlight the productivity of our Marcellus assets and demonstrates that the asset quality and well performance are quite unique assets for Cabot. However, we would like to see more favorable natural gas prices, which we anticipate will materialize upon the in-service of several new takeaway projects in our area, scheduled over the next 12 to 18 months, along with the continued increase in natural gas demand growth. 
I want to also highlight that during the first quarter, the state of Pennsylvania began reporting monthly production data and did report for both January and February, Cabot was the top producer in Pennsylvania, which is not bad for a company that has never operated more than 6 rigs in a state. Marcellus pricing continues to be the primary focus of our conversations with shareholders and I imagine is front of mind for everybody on this call today. 
Our first quarter natural gas realizations were $2.46 per Mcf, which is $0.52 below the average NYMEX price for the quarter and improvement relative to the $1.04 differential in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realizations were $0.75 below NYMEX as compared to $1.21 in the fourth quarter of '14. Primary driver of the differential narrowing quarter-to-quarter was that our marketing team was able to secure a meaningful amount of favorable fixed-price contracts for the winter season, prior to the most recent decline in natural gas prices. Many of these deals do roll off in March. However, we do have over 20% of our expected volumes sold at a fixed priced above $2 in the second quarter. 
Based on our current view of where the regional will sell over the quarter, we anticipate that second quarter price realizations will be between $0.82 and $0.92 before NYMEX, below -- excuse me, below NYMEX and before the impact of hedges. Additionally, we anticipate another $0.40 to $0.45 uplift in realized prices from our hedges based on the current strip. So as we frequently get asked the question, we have provided a split of our pricing exposure by index on our website, which should provide some clarity on how we are marketing our gas for the quarter. We anticipate that the third quarter will look similar to the second quarter as it relates to the percentage of sales by index. 
As we have guided, we have reduced our production volumes for the second quarter, relative to the first quarter, in response to our expectation of continued weakness in pricing during the second quarter, some of which is being driven by numerous maintenance and construction projects directly related to our downstream market. Virtually, all of the pipelines are production riches have planned or scheduled projects during the second quarter, most notably is the new looping of the Transco lighting line, in conjunction with the Leidy Southeast expansion project. Although this expansion, 525 million cubic foot per day of new capacity, will ultimately be very beneficial to Cabot at in-service in December of this year, the 43-day construction period is expected to affect throughput on the Leidy Line currently in price -- currently resulting in pricing pressures during this period. We expect to produce between 1.55 and 1.6 Bcf per day of gross production in the Marcellus for the second quarter. And we'll continue to monitor the price environment before we make any decisions on selling more gas into the local market. It is clear from our first quarter production that we have the ability to move volumes in excess of these base load levels. But we are not going to chase production growth to the detriment of cash margins. As planned, we recently decreased our level of activity in the Marcellus to 3 rigs and 1 frac crew, down from 5 rigs and 2 frac crews at the beginning of the year. Our current operating plan and capital program assumes this level of operating activity remains constant for the balance of 2015. However, in light of our expectations for our continued weakness throughout Appalachia during the summer months, we do often reevaluate our program and may consider delaying completions as we await a more favorable price environment in the future, again, not anticipating affecting our guidance. 
In the Eagle Ford, moving onto the Eagle Ford. Our team had an outstanding quarter operationally in South Texas, as evidenced by the 19% sequential growth in daily liquid volumes over the last quarter. During the quarter, we placed 20 wells on production, many of which weren't current in line until late in the quarter, which resulted in the strong sequential production growth. As a reminder, much of this activity was driven by near-term held by production commitment, primarily from the acreage we acquired late last year. 
If we take a step back and we look at where our Eagle Ford program was a year ago, it really highlights the significant improvement we have seen from this asset in a short duration of time. On last year's first quarter call, we had just made a change in the management team overseeing the program and made the decision to increase our rig count from 2 to 3. The increase in the rig count was predicated on an increase in the return profile to over 50%, hoping as a result of well performance enhancements and decreased well cost. Keep in mind that we were running our economics at $90 per barrel at that point. We had approximately 600 gross locations identified based on 400-foot spacing. And frankly, we're pretty excited about the long-term value generation opportunity afforded us by these properties. If you fast forward 12 months and a lot of things have changed, the most obvious being the underlying commodity price. However, as a result of significant improvements in our operating efficiency and well performance, along with a reduction in service cost, our operation now eclipsed the same 50% rate of return of threshold at a price of $65 per barrel, which is only $5 higher than today's 12 months trip. Relative to the 600 gross locations we had mapped at this time last year, we have now increased that location count to over 1300 locations, as a result of our bolt-on acquisitions in the fourth quarter of last year and the success of our 300-foot down-spacing program across our acreage position. We have also seen a 30% decline in operating cost in South Texas, as our team continues to work on driving down our cost structure. We are currently running 2 rigs into play with plans to decrease to 1 rig by the end of May. Our plan is to remain at this level throughout year end. However, we will consider acceleration of completion activity in the Eagle Ford if we see a sustained oil price recovery or further reduction in drilling and completion cost, which have decreased to date, 20% to 30%. 
Now let's move to another area that has many questions in regard to our time with investors. On the year-end call, we discussed a few of the significant accomplishments. The Constitution has recently achieved, such as the FERC Certificate of Public Convenience, approving Constitution Pipeline and the New York DEC formal notice of complete application for the final New York permit. Also, we briefly discussed the regulatory process in New York requiring a public comment period extension, which closed on February 27, 2015. Today, we can continue that update with the following. The project remains on its current schedule for in-service during the second half of '16. The New York DEC is currently finalizing responses to the comments received during the public comment period. Constitution now has possession of 100% of all the tracks necessary to begin construction. Constitution is working towards the finalization of New York State permit by the end of the second quarter and FERC implementation plan is expected to be filed by Williams during the second quarter. 
Based on the progress during the last few months, we continue to be optimistic that construction can begin mid-summer, assuming all these permits are in hand. 
As we also mentioned in our press release, we recently amended our credit facility, increasing the total commitment from $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, providing us ample flexibility in this challenged environment. Our lenders also approved an increase in our borrowing base from $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion, despite the lower commodity price environment. A total of 20 lenders participated in this facility, including 6 new banks. We are appreciative of the support we saw in this transaction. And we believe it demonstrates the quality of our company, both operationally and financially. 
Pro forma for this increase in commitment, we had over $1.5 billion of undrawn commitment as of the end of the first quarter. 
In this morning's press release, we initiated second quarter of production guidance, which implies slightly over 1.5 Bcfe per day of net equivalent production for the quarter, at the midpoint, despite the sequential decline in production relative to first quarter due to the previously mentioned curtailments in the Marcellus. We have reaffirmed our 2015 production growth guidance range between 10% to 18%, based on a stronger than anticipated first quarter and expectations for increase in production above second quarter levels later in the year. 
Our capital program for the current year remains unchanged at $900 million. I would have to highlight that not only that has our 2015 capital program weighted heavily to the first half of the year, the first quarter capital expenditures on the cash flow statement also reflect carryforward cash outlays associated with our capital incurred in '14 but not paid until this year. We have also decreased our unit cost guidance for LOE, taxes other than income and DD&A. These updates can be found on our website. 
In summary, our strong first quarter production highlights that Cabot is able to achieve operationally strong performance. Currently, lower natural gas prices are a reality through Appalachia. However, we are optimistic the environment improves over the next few quarters through a combination of decreased levels of operating activity, increased demand and new takeaway projects. Our goal is to protect margins and ensure we aren't giving away our valuable resources at marginal prices. Despite our planned reduction in volumes for the second quarter, we remain confident in our production guidance range for the year and continue to be excited about our mid-term outlook as we increase our portfolio of firm sales and firm transportation to close of 3 Bcf per day by the end of '17, of which approximately 70% reaches markets outside of Appalachia. 
With that, Dan, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions."

I think it's safe to say at that point in time, regardless of when Constitution is commissioned, whether it's in the middle of summer or right at the beginning of the third quarter, I think it is safe to say that those price points, more likely if they're consistent with historic, is going to be at a higher better price point than the current indices that we're selling into.

And how I will answer the question will be dependent upon how much I make Phil Stalnaker squirm over here in front of me. But keep in mind that the capital intensity necessary for us to ramp up our volumes is minimal comparatively speaking, when you look across the space to be able to find another 0.5 Bcf per day. The driving consideration for that volume of production is going to be not necessarily in the rig count, but it's going to be how we stage in frac crews to allow timely completions of those wells that we have in the queue. So the plan building up to that decision point, it would be our intent to have in the queue that will allow us to have that maximum flexibility is to have wells drilled and in the queue, waiting on completion, if you will, as opposed to backing up a step and saying that we haven't even drilled the wells or drilled those pad sites yet. So when you get towards the end of this year, the discussions that we'll have with the north will be, all right, let's look at our capital program, let's look at our cash flow, let's look at the dynamics of the macro market and let's make a call on bringing on another rig, if we felt like we needed it in the first quarter of '16. But also looking ahead at the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter, how many frac crews do we want to have lined up to get ready to move those volumes in the Constitution. Again, keep in mind that Constitution is going to be filled immediately upon commissioning. The decision is going to be, do we backfill Tennessee, Transco, Millennium with those volumes and how long do we want to take to backfill those volumes. But at the end of this year, as we go into the planning stage for our initial budget for '16, which we present to the board in October, we'll have some of these discussions."

That is going to remain consistent. I don't see much getting into way of that expectation. In regard to frac log and looking at the backlog, it always seems to be a moving number that you see out there. And I see different counts what is backlog at any one given time. I do know that from an operational standpoint and I'll talk more geographically about, say, where it could have a larger impact in our Northeast Pennsylvania area, in that 6-county area. If you look at that area, we've talked in the past about how many rigs are running and how many frac crews are up there. Our most recent intelligence is that you had through, say, January, February, March, a certain number of rigs running up there. And most recently, in April, we placed a number of rigs up there in that particular area and only 12 rigs that are currently running. And we have at any given times 6 to 8 frac crews operating in that neck of the woods. Now if you do the simple math and you look at the 8 Bcf or so a day that's kind of coming from that area, 12 rigs and 6 or 8 frac crews are going to have one hell of a time keeping up with any natural decline that you might suspect from the volumes that are being produced. Now I do think that there were and have been just we like had some curtailed volumes that could keep maybe backfilling some of that gas volume. And you're maybe today not seeing any type of real inflection point. But it doesn't take a mental to do the quick numbers on IPs and 30-day averages and all that for those number of pieces of equipment to say that there has to be some depletion of the backlog, if you will. And the ability of wells to keep up with the natural depletion that would occur in -- under those circumstances. So on '14, at the end of '14, I think we had a similar number. We might actually have a couple more wells at the end of '15 as we had at the end of '14. But for the most part, we're going to have a similar backlog for us."

The -- again, back to just the numbers that are out in front of us, if you believe up in that 6-county area, that there is in April, beginning in April, there were 12 rigs running and 6 to 8 frac crews in that area and producing approximately 8 Bcf a day. Even if all of those wells were to the degree and to the performance levels of Cabot type wells, you are going to have a difficult time being able to maintain, much less grow the production volumes from that production base.

Thank you for joining us today for the Cabot first quarter call. With me today, as usual, are several of our management team. Before we start, the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements that do apply to my comments today. 
I would first like to touch upon a few financial and operating highlights from the first quarter that were outlined in this morning's press release. First, equivalent net production for the first quarter was slightly above 1.9 Bcfe per day, an increase of 43% over the prior year's comparable quarter and a sequential increase of 15% over the fourth quarter. A particular note, our daily liquids production for the quarter increased 132% compared to the prior year's comparable quarter and 20% sequential -- sequentially over the fourth quarter, highlighting the success of our team in the Eagle Ford. 
Net income excluding select items for the quarter was $49 million or $0.12 per share and discretionary cash flow for the quarter was $240 million. Both of these items decreased relative to the first quarter of '14 due to a 34% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 55% decline in realized oil prices. 
On the cost side, our team continues to work hard and deliver on driving down unit cost, which is evidenced by the 10% decline in cash unit cost to $1.22 per Mcfe. I think this decline is even more impressive when considering that we have increased the percentage of all focused activity in our mix, which typically is more costly to operate on a per unit basis. 
Additionally, we reaffirm guidance, even with the planned curtailment, which is, I think, the right economic decision. In the Marcellus, our operational results for the quarter exceeded expectations. The company averaged over 2 Bcf per day of gross Marcellus production, which is 1.7 Bcf per day of net production, an increase, as mentioned previously, 43% over last year's comparable quarter. We completed 19 wells and placed 17 wells on production, which drove the 16% sequential growth for the quarter. 
These production levels highlight the productivity of our Marcellus assets and demonstrates that the asset quality and well performance are quite unique assets for Cabot. However, we would like to see more favorable natural gas prices, which we anticipate will materialize upon the in-service of several new takeaway projects in our area scheduled over the next 12 to 18 months, along with the continued increase in natural gas demand growth. 
I want to also highlight that during the first quarter, the state of Pennsylvania began reporting monthly production data and did report for both January and February, Cabot was the top producer in Pennsylvania, which is not bad for a company that has never operated more than 6 rigs in the state. Marcellus pricing continues to be the primary focus of our conversations with shareholders, and I imagine, is front of mind for everybody on this call today. 
Our first quarter natural gas realizations were $2.46 per Mcf, which is $0.52 below the average NYMEX price for the quarter and improvement relative to the $1.04 differential in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realizations were $0.75 below NYMEX as compared to $1.21 in the fourth quarter of '14. Primary driver of the differential narrowing quarter-to-quarter was that our marketing team was able to secure a meaningful amount of favorable fixed price contracts for the winter season prior to the most recent decline in natural gas prices. Many of these deals do roll off in March. However, we do have over 20% of our expected volumes sold at a fixed priced above $2 in the second quarter. 
Based on our current view of where the regional indices will settle over the quarter, we anticipate that second quarter price realizations will be between $0.82 and $0.92 before NYMEX, below -- excuse me, below NYMEX and before the impact of hedges. Additionally, we anticipate another $0.40 to $0.45 uplift in realized prices from our hedges based on the current strip. So as we frequently get asked the question, we have provided a split of our pricing exposure by index on our website, which should provide some clarity on how we are marketing our gas for the quarter. We anticipate that the third quarter will look similar to the second quarter as it relates to the percentage of sales by index. 
As we have guided, we have reduced our production volumes for the second quarter relative to the first quarter, in response to our expectation of continued weakness in pricing during the second quarter, some of which is being driven by numerous maintenance and construction projects directly related to our downstream market. Virtually, all of the pipelines our production reachers have planned or scheduled projects during the second quarter, most notably is the new looping of the Transco lighting line in conjunction with the Leidy Southeast expansion project. Although this expansion of 525 million cubic foot per day of new capacity will ultimately be very beneficial to Cabot at in-service in December of this year, the 43-day construction period is expected to affect throughput on the Leidy Line currently in price -- currently resulting in pricing pressures during this period. We expect to produce between 1.55 and 1.6 Bcf per day of gross production in the Marcellus for the second quarter. And we'll continue to monitor the price environment before we make any decisions on selling more gas into the local market. It is clear from our first quarter production that we have the ability to move volumes in excess of these base load levels, but we are not going to chase production growth to the detriment of cash margins. As planned, we recently decreased our level of activity in the Marcellus to 3 rigs and 1 frac crew, down from 5 rigs and 2 frac crews at the beginning of the year. Our current operating plan and capital program assumes this level of operating activity remains constant for the balance of 2015. However, in light of our expectations for our continued weakness throughout Appalachia during the summer months, we do often reevaluate our program and may consider delaying completions as we await a more favorable price environment in the future, again, not anticipating affecting our guidance. 
In the Eagle Ford, moving onto the Eagle Ford. Our team had an outstanding quarter operationally in South Texas, as evidenced by the 19% sequential growth in daily liquid volumes over the last quarter. During the quarter, we placed 20 wells on production, many of which weren't current in line until late in the quarter, which resulted in the strong sequential production growth. As a reminder, much of this activity was driven by near-term, held-by-production commitment, primarily from the acreage we acquired late last year. 
If we take a step back and we look at where our Eagle Ford program was a year ago, it really highlights the significant improvement we have seen from this asset in a short duration of time. On last year's first quarter call, we had just made a change in the management team overseeing the program and made the decision to increase our rig count from 2 to 3. The increase in the rig count was predicated on an increase in the return profile to over 50%, hoping as a result of well performance enhancements and decreased well cost. Keep in mind that we were running our economics at $90 per barrel at that point. We had approximately 600 gross locations identified based on 400-foot spacing. And frankly, we're pretty excited about the long-term value generation opportunity afforded us by these properties. 
If you fast forward 12 months and a lot of things have changed, the most obvious being the underlying commodity price. However, as a result of significant improvements in our operating efficiency and well performance, along with a reduction in service cost, our operation now eclipsed the same 50% rate of return threshold at a price of $65 per barrel, which is only $5 higher than today's 12 months trip. Relative to the 600 gross locations we had mapped at this time last year, we have now increased that location count to over 1,300 locations as a result of our bolt-on acquisitions in the fourth quarter of last year and the success of our 300-foot down spacing program across our acreage position. We have also seen a 30% decline in operating cost in South Texas as our team continues to work on driving down our cost structure. 
We are currently running 2 rigs into play with plans to decrease to 1 rig by the end of May. Our plan is to remain at this level throughout year end. However, we will consider acceleration of completion activity in the Eagle Ford if we see a sustained oil price recovery or further reduction in drilling and completion cost, which have decreased, to date, 20% to 30%. 
Now let's move to another area that has many questions in regard to our time with investors. On the year-end call, we discussed a few of the significant accomplishments. The Constitution had recently achieved, such as the FERC Certificate of Public Convenience, approving Constitution Pipeline and the New York DEC formal notice of complete application for the final New York permit. Also, we briefly discussed the regulatory process in New York requiring a public comment period extension, which closed on February 27, 2015. 
Today, we can continue that update with the following. The project remains on its current schedule for in-service during the second half of '16. The New York DEC is currently finalizing responses to the comments received during the public comment period. Constitution now has possession of 100% of all the tracks necessary to begin construction. Constitution is working towards the finalization of New York State permits by the end of the second quarter, and the FERC implementation plan is expected to be filed by Williams during the second quarter. Based on the progress during the last few months, we continue to be optimistic that construction can begin mid-summer, assuming all these permits are in hand. 
As we also mentioned in our press release, we recently amended our credit facility, increasing the total commitment from $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, providing us ample flexibility in this challenged environment. Our lenders also approved an increase in our borrowing base from $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion despite the lower commodity price environment. A total of 20 lenders participated in this upside facility, including 6 new banks. We are appreciative of the support we saw in this transaction. And we believe it demonstrates the quality of our company, both operationally and financially. 
Pro forma for this increase in commitment, we had over $1.5 billion of undrawn commitments as of the end of the first quarter. 
In this morning's press release, we initiated second quarter of production guidance, which implies slightly over 1.5 Bcfe per day of net equivalent production for the quarter, at the mid-point despite the sequential decline in production relative to the first quarter due to the previously mentioned curtailments in the Marcellus. We have reaffirmed our 2015 production growth guidance range between 10% to 18%, based on a stronger than anticipated first quarter and expectations for increase in production above second quarter levels later in the year. 
Our capital program for the current year remains unchanged at $900 million. I would, have however, highlight that not only as our 2015 capital program weighted heavily to the first half of the year, the first quarter capital expenditures on the cash flow statement also reflect carryforward cash outlays associated with our capital incurred in '14 but not paid until this year. We have also decreased our unit cost guidance, VaR LOE, taxes other than income and DD&A. These updates can be found on our website. 
In summary, our strong first quarter production highlights that Cabot is able to achieve operationally strong performance. Currently, lower natural gas prices are a reality through Appalachia. However, we are optimistic the environment improves over the next few quarters through a combination of decreased levels of operating activity, increased demand and new takeaway projects. Our goal in end term to protect margins and ensure we aren't giving away our valuable resources at marginal prices. Despite our planned reduction in volumes for the second quarter, we remain confident in our production guidance range for the year and continue to be excited about our mid-term outlook as we increase our portfolio of firm sales and firm transportation to close of 3 Bcf per day by the end of '17, of which approximately 70% reaches markets outside of Appalachia. 
With that, Dan, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

But we do expect to see better realizations later in the year than we anticipated during this period when the maintenance projects were going to be implemented and you were in the shoulder months. In regard to our field operations and methodology of how we're reducing the volumes out there, we have discussed in the past that we have a very flexible gathering system that allows us to move gas even from 1 particular pad to multiple outlets. We do anticipate that as we raise the field pressures in the field and allow that to happen, that we would naturally bring down some of the volumes that we would be moving into the pipe. And so it's not a shut in a particular portion of the field and produce the others at those volumes that they were at. It is more of across the board consideration on how we'd bring the field pressures up a little bit to allow the volumes to be reduced."

I think it's safe to say, at that point in time, regardless of when Constitution is commissioned, whether it's in the middle of summer or right at the beginning of the third quarter, I think, it is safe to say that those price points, more likely, if they're consistent with historic, is going to be at a higher better price point than the current indices that we're selling into.

And how I answer the question will be dependent upon how much I'll make Phil Stalnaker squirm over here in front of me. But keep in mind that the capital intensity necessary for us to ramp up our volumes is minimal comparatively speaking when you look across the space to be able to find another 0.5 Bcf per day. The driving consideration for that volume of production is going to be not necessarily in the rig count, but it's going to be how we stage in frac crews to allow timely completions of those wells that we have in the queue. So the plan building up to that decision point, it would be our intent to have in the queue that will allow us to have that maximum flexibility is to have wells drilled and in the queue, waiting on completion, if you will, as opposed to backing up a step and saying that we haven't even drilled the wells or drilled those pad sites yet. So when you get towards the end of this year, the discussions that we'll have with the north will be, all right, let's look at our capital program, let's look at our cash flow, let's look at the dynamics of the macro market, and let's make a call on bringing on another rig, if we felt like we needed it in the first part of '16. But also looking out ahead at the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter, how many frac crews do we want to have lined up to get ready to move those volumes in the Constitution. Again, keep in mind that Constitution is going to be filled immediately upon commissioning. The decision is going to be, do we backfill Tennessee, Transco, Millennium with those volumes and how long do we want to take to backfill those volumes. But at the end of this year, as we go into the planning stage for our initial budget for '16, which we present to the board in October, we'll have some of these discussions."

That is going to remain consistent. I don't see much getting in the way of that expectation. In regard to frac log and looking at the backlog, it always seems to be a moving number that you see out there. And I see different counts of what is backlogged at any one given time. I do know that from an operation standpoint, and I'll talk more geographically about, say, where it could have a larger impact in our northeast Pennsylvania area, in that 6-county area. If you look at that area, we've talked in the past about how many rigs are running and how many frac crews were up there. Our most recent intelligence is that you had through, say, January, February, March, a certain number of rigs running up there. And most recently, in April, we placed a number of rigs up there in that particular area in our neck of the woods, that only 12 rigs that are currently running. And we have, at any given times, 6 to 8 frac crews operating in that neck of the woods. Now if you do the simple math and you look at the 8 Bcf or so a day that's kind of coming from that area, 12 rigs and 6 or 8 frac crews are going to have one hell of a time keeping up with any natural declines that you might suspect from the volumes that are being produced. Now I do think that there were and have been, just we like had, some curtailed volumes that could keep maybe backfilling some of that gas volume. And you're, maybe today, not seeing any type of real inflection point. But it doesn't take a mental giant to do the quick numbers on IPs and 30-day averages and all of that for those number of pieces of equipment to say that there has to be some depletion of the backlog, if you will. And the ability of wells to keep up with the natural depletion that would occur in -- under those circumstances. So on '14 -- at the end of '14, I think we had a similar number. We might actually have a couple more wells at the end of '15 as we had at the end of '14. But for the most part, we're going to have a similar backlog for us."

So a lot of people are targeting wells that may have been, let's say, proliferated at 100-foot spacing, and now people are targeting 50-foot spacing and the same thing kind of on a sand basis, where people may have done 800 pounds per foot versus now what people are pumping close or towards 1,600 pounds per foot. Cabot does have some opportunity for refracs.

From this point forward, as we have been successful in maintaining our primary term acreage and we have had responsive landowners negotiate with us in regard to the timing of obligatory wells or continuous development wells out there on their properties. Some of those mineral owners do not want to produce their oil into a low-price environment. So we've been able to extend some time on those particular leases. So between now and end of the year, with 1 rig and not a 24/7 frac crew, some of the experimentation, if you will, and completion efforts that we would be implementing are not going to be very numerous simply because we're kind of been in a somewhat of the holding pattern with 1 rig and 1 crew."

Thank you, Dan, and good morning, all. Thank you for joining us today for the Cabot first quarter call. With me today, as usual, are several of our management team. Before we start, the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements do apply to my comments today. 
I would first like to touch upon a few financial and operating highlights from the first quarter that were outlined in this morning's press release. First, equivalent net production for the first quarter was slightly above 1.9 Bcfe per day, an increase of 43% over the prior year's comparable quarter and a sequential increase of 15% over the fourth quarter. A particular note, our daily liquids production for the quarter increased 132% compared to the prior year's comparable quarter and 20% sequential -- sequentially over the fourth quarter, highlighting the success of our team in the Eagle Ford. 
Net income excluding select items for the quarter was $49 million or $0.12 per share and discretionary cash flow for the quarter was $240 million. Both of these items decreased relative to the first quarter of '14 due to a 34% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 55% decline in realized oil prices. 
On the cost side, our team continues to work hard and deliver on driving down unit cost, which is evidenced by the 10% decline in cash unit cost to $1.22 per Mcfe. I think this decline is even more impressive when considering that we have increased the percentage of all focused activity in our mix, which typically is more costly to operate on a per unit basis. 
Additionally, we reaffirm guidance, even with the planned curtailment, which is, I think, the right economic decision. In the Marcellus, our operational results for the quarter exceeded expectations. The company averaged over 2 Bcf per day of gross Marcellus production, which is 1.7 Bcf per day of net production, an increase, as mentioned previously, 43% over last year's comparable quarter. We completed 19 wells and placed 17 wells on production, which drove the 16% sequential growth for the quarter. 
These production levels highlight the productivity of our Marcellus assets and demonstrates that the asset quality and well performance are quite unique assets for Cabot. However, we would like to see more favorable natural gas prices, which we anticipate will materialize upon the in-service of several new takeaway projects in our area scheduled over the next 12 to 18 months, along with the continued increase in natural gas demand growth. 
I want to also highlight that during the first quarter, the state of Pennsylvania began reporting monthly production data and did report for both January and February, Cabot was the top producer in Pennsylvania, which is not bad for a company that has never operated more than 6 rigs in the state. Marcellus pricing continues to be the primary focus of our conversations with shareholders, and I imagine, is front of mind for everybody on this call today. 
Our first quarter natural gas realizations were $2.46 per Mcf, which is $0.52 below the average NYMEX price for the quarter and improvement relative to the $1.04 differential in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realizations were $0.75 below NYMEX as compared to $1.21 in the fourth quarter of '14. Primary driver of the differential narrowing quarter-to-quarter was that our marketing team was able to secure a meaningful amount of favorable fixed price contracts for the winter season prior to the most recent decline in natural gas prices. Many of these deals do roll off in March. However, we do have over 20% of our expected volumes sold at a fixed priced above $2 in the second quarter. 
Based on our current view of where the regional indices will settle over the quarter, we anticipate that second quarter price realizations will be between $0.82 and $0.92 before NYMEX, below -- excuse me, below NYMEX and before the impact of hedges. Additionally, we anticipate another $0.40 to $0.45 uplift in realized prices from our hedges based on the current strip. So as we frequently get asked the question, we have provided a split of our pricing exposure by index on our website, which should provide some clarity on how we are marketing our gas for the quarter. We anticipate that the third quarter will look similar to the second quarter as it relates to the percentage of sales by index. 
As we have guided, we have reduced our production volumes for the second quarter relative to the first quarter, in response to our expectation of continued weakness in pricing during the second quarter, some of which is being driven by numerous maintenance and construction projects directly related to our downstream market. Virtually all of the pipelines our production reachers have planned or scheduled projects during the second quarter, most notably is the new looping of the Transco lighting line in conjunction with the Leidy Southeast expansion project. Although this expansion of 525 million cubic foot per day of new capacity will ultimately be very beneficial to Cabot at in-service in December of this year, the 43-day construction period is expected to affect throughput on the Leidy Line currently in price -- currently resulting in pricing pressures during this period. We expect to produce between 1.55 and 1.6 Bcf per day of gross production in the Marcellus for the second quarter. And we'll continue to monitor the price environment before we make any decisions on selling more gas into the local market. It is clear from our first quarter production that we have the ability to move volumes in excess of these base load levels, but we are not going to chase production growth to the detriment of cash margins. As planned, we recently decreased our level of activity in the Marcellus to 3 rigs and 1 frac crew, down from 5 rigs and 2 frac crews at the beginning of the year. Our current operating plan and capital program assumes this level of operating activity remains constant for the balance of 2015. However, in light of our expectations for our continued weakness throughout Appalachia during the summer months, we do often reevaluate our program and may consider delaying completions as we await a more favorable price environment in the future, again, not anticipating affecting our guidance. 
In the Eagle Ford, moving onto the Eagle Ford. Our team had an outstanding quarter operationally in South Texas, as evidenced by the 19% sequential growth in daily liquid volumes over the last quarter. During the quarter, we placed 20 wells on production, many of which weren't current in line until late in the quarter, which resulted in the strong sequential production growth. As a reminder, much of this activity was driven by near-term, held-by-production commitment, primarily from the acreage we acquired late last year. 
If we take a step back and we look at where our Eagle Ford program was a year ago, it really highlights the significant improvement we have seen from this asset in a short duration of time. On last year's first quarter call, we had just made a change in the management team overseeing the program and made the decision to increase our rig count from 2 to 3. The increase in the rig count was predicated on an increase in the return profile to over 50%, hoping as a result of well performance enhancements and decreased well cost. Keep in mind that we were running our economics at $90 per barrel at that point. We had approximately 600 gross locations identified based on 400-foot spacing. And frankly, we're pretty excited about the long-term value generation opportunity afforded us by these properties. 
If you fast forward 12 months and a lot of things have changed, the most obvious being the underlying commodity price. However, as a result of significant improvements in our operating efficiency and well performance, along with a reduction in service cost, our operation now eclipsed the same 50% rate of return threshold at a price of $65 per barrel, which is only $5 higher than today's 12 month strip. Relative to the 600 gross locations we had mapped at this time last year, we have now increased that location count to over 1,300 locations as a result of our bolt-on acquisitions in the fourth quarter of last year and the success of our 300-foot down spacing program across our acreage position. We have also seen a 30% decline in operating cost in South Texas as our team continues to work on driving down our cost structure. 
We are currently running 2 rigs in the play with plans to decrease to 1 rig by the end of May. Our plan is to remain at this level throughout year end. However, we will consider acceleration of completion activity in the Eagle Ford if we see a sustained oil price recovery or further reduction in drilling and completion costs, which have decreased, to date, 20% to 30%. 
Now let's move to another area that has many questions in regard to our time with investors. On the year-end call, we discussed a few of the significant accomplishments. The Constitution had recently achieved, such as the FERC Certificate of Public Convenience, approving Constitution Pipeline and the New York DEC formal notice of complete application for the final New York permit. Also, we briefly discussed the regulatory process in New York requiring a public comment period extension, which closed on February 27, 2015. 
Today, we can continue that update with the following. The project remains on its current schedule for in-service during the second half of '16. The New York DEC is currently finalizing responses to the comments received during the public comment period. Constitution now has possession of 100% of all the tracks necessary to begin construction. Constitution is working towards the finalization of New York State permits by the end of the second quarter, and the FERC implementation plan is expected to be filed by Williams during the second quarter. Based on the progress during the last few months, we continue to be optimistic that construction can begin mid-summer, assuming all these permits are in hand. 
As we also mentioned in our press release, we recently amended our credit facility, increasing the total commitment from $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, providing us ample flexibility in this challenged environment. Our lenders also approved an increase in our borrowing base from $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion despite the lower commodity price environment. A total of 20 lenders participated in this upside facility, including 6 new banks. We are appreciative of the support we saw in this transaction. And we believe it demonstrates the quality of our company, both operationally and financially. 
Pro forma for this increase in commitment, we had over $1.5 billion of undrawn commitments as of the end of the first quarter. 
In this morning's press release, we initiated second quarter of production guidance, which implies slightly over 1.5 Bcfe per day of net equivalent production for the quarter, at the mid-point despite the sequential decline in production relative to the first quarter due to the previously mentioned curtailments in the Marcellus. We have reaffirmed our 2015 production growth guidance range between 10% to 18%, based on a stronger-than-anticipated first quarter and expectations for increase in production above second quarter levels later in the year. 
Our capital program for the current year remains unchanged at $900 million. I would, however, highlight that not only as our 2015 capital program weighted heavily to the first half of the year, the first quarter capital expenditures on the cash flow statement also reflect carryforward cash outlays associated with our capital incurred in '14 but not paid until this year. We have also decreased our unit cost guidance, VaR LOE, taxes other than income and DD&A. These updates can be found on our website. 
In summary, our strong first quarter production highlights that Cabot is able to achieve operationally strong performance. Currently, lower natural gas prices are a reality through Appalachia. However, we are optimistic the environment improves over the next few quarters through a combination of decreased levels of operating activity, increased demand and new takeaway projects. Our goal in end term to protect margins and ensure we aren't giving away our valuable resources at marginal prices. Despite our planned reduction in volumes for the second quarter, we remain confident in our production guidance range for the year and continue to be excited about our mid-term outlook as we increase our portfolio of firm sales and firm transportation to close of 3 Bcf per day by the end of '17, of which approximately 70% reaches markets outside of Appalachia. 
With that, Dan, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

We do anticipate that as we raise the field pressures in the field and allow that to happen, that we would naturally bring down some of the volumes that we would be moving into the pipe.

Well, certainly, on the historic look, price points up there at that right station and into that line are close to the NYMEX pricing. Various times of the year, it exceeds NYMEX pricing by a considerable margin. We've already kind of broadcast that we will make that call on how we would roll into the Constitution volumes, whether it would be just total incremental volumes to what our current production is at that point in time of commissioning or if it'd be a phase-in by displacing the volumes from our current price points to the Constitution pipeline. I think it's safe to say, at that point in time, regardless of when Constitution is commissioned, whether it's in the middle of summer or right at the beginning of the third quarter, I think, it is safe to say that those price points, more likely, if they're consistent with historic, is going to be at a higher, better price point than the current indices that we're selling into. So we would naturally move and fill 100% of Constitution immediately, but it may be just a displacement from the Millennium or Transco or Tennessee lines."

I actually wanted to follow up on that exact point, which is how you strategically determine the appropriate mix of filling Constitution with production you already have versus kind of new production. When do you have to make that call? Are you planning on increasing your production capacity from where it is today by the full 500 million a day, and then you make that -- you can make that call at the last second?

Yes, good question, Brian. And how I answer the question will be dependent upon how much I'll make Phil Stalnaker squirm over here in front of me. But keep in mind that the capital intensity necessary for us to ramp up our volumes is minimal comparatively speaking when you look across the space to be able to find another 0.5 Bcf per day. The driving consideration for that volume of production is going to be not necessarily in the rig count, but it's going to be how we stage in frac crews to allow timely completions of those wells that we have in the queue. So the plan building up to that decision point, it would be our intent to have in the queue that will allow us to have that maximum flexibility is to have wells drilled and in the queue, waiting on completion, if you will, as opposed to backing up a step and saying that we haven't even drilled the wells or drilled those pad sites yet. So when you get towards the end of this year, the discussions that we'll have with the north will be, all right, let's look at our capital program, let's look at our cash flow, let's look at the dynamics of the macro market, and let's make a call on bringing on another rig, if we felt like we needed it in the first part of '16. But also looking out ahead at the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter, how many frac crews do we want to have lined up to get ready to move those volumes into Constitution. Again, keep in mind that Constitution is going to be filled immediately upon commissioning. The decision is going to be, do we backfill Tennessee, Transco, Millennium with those volumes and how long do we want to take to backfill those volumes. But at the end of this year, as we go into the planning stage for our initial budget for '16, which we present to the board in October, we'll have some of these discussions."

Well, first off, on our expectations for year-end '15, we do still maintain our expectations of 20 wells in Eagle Ford and 45 wells or so in the Marcellus. That is going to remain consistent. I don't see much getting in the way of that expectation. In regard to frac log and looking at the backlog, it always seems to be a moving number that you see out there. And I see different counts of what is backlogged at any one given time. I do know that from an operation standpoint, and I'll talk more geographically about, say, where it could have a larger impact in our northeast Pennsylvania area, in that 6-county area. If you look at that area, we've talked in the past about how many rigs are running and how many frac crews were up there. Our most recent intelligence is that you had through, say, January, February, March, a certain number of rigs running up there. And most recently, in April, we placed the number of rigs up there in that particular area in our neck of the woods, at only 12 rigs that are currently running. And we have, at any given times, 6 to 8 frac crews operating in that neck of the woods. Now if you do the simple math and you look at the 8 Bcf or so a day that's kind of coming from that area, 12 rigs and 6 or 8 frac crews are going to have one hell of a time keeping up with any natural declines that you might suspect from the volumes that are being produced. Now I do think that there were and have been, just we like had, some curtailed volumes that could keep maybe backfilling some of that gas volume. And you're, maybe today, not seeing any type of real inflection point. But it doesn't take a mental giant to do the quick numbers on IPs and 30-day averages and all of that for those number of pieces of equipment to say that there has to be some depletion of the backlog, if you will. And the ability of wells to keep up with the natural depletion that would occur in -- under those circumstances. So on '14 -- at the end of '14, I think we had a similar number. We might actually have a couple more wells at the end of '15 as we had at the end of '14. But for the most part, we're going to have a similar backlog for us."

So Pierce, when we look at that the successful refracs throughout the industry, really, what has been targeted is wells that have had, I would say, less sand concentration or lower connectivity frac jobs pump as compared to what the current standard would be. And then, secondly, a group of wells that might have different PERF clustering than what's being used. So a lot of people are targeting wells that may have been, let's say, proliferated at 100-foot spacing, and now people are targeting 50-foot spacing and the same thing kind of on a sand basis, where people may have done 800 pounds per foot versus now what people are pumping closer towards 1,600 pounds per foot. Cabot does have some opportunity for refracs. I would say that we would target those when we would do the downspaced wells and do those in conjunction with that, so you can get the full benefit of the zipper frac, both on the re-frac and on the new well that you drill in a downspaced perspective."

Even if all those wells were to the degree and to the performance levels of Cabot type wells, you are going to have a difficult time being able to maintain much less grow the production volumes from that production base.

From this point forward, as we have been successful in maintaining our primary term acreage and we have had responsive landowners negotiate with us in regard to the timing of obligatory wells or continuous development wells out there on their properties.

Thank you for joining us today for the Cabot first quarter call. With me today, as usual, are several of our management team.

Thank you for joining us today for the Cabot first quarter call. With me today, as usual, are several of our management team. Before we start, the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements do apply to my comments today. 
I would first like to touch upon a few financial and operating highlights from the first quarter that were outlined in this morning's press release. First, equivalent net production for the first quarter was slightly above 1.9 Bcfe per day, an increase of 43% over the prior year's comparable quarter and a sequential increase of 15% over the fourth quarter. A particular note, our daily liquids production for the quarter increased 132% compared to the prior year's comparable quarter and 20% sequential -- sequentially over the fourth quarter, highlighting the success of our team in the Eagle Ford. 
Net income excluding select items for the quarter was $49 million or $0.12 per share and discretionary cash flow for the quarter was $240 million. Both of these items decreased relative to the first quarter of '14 due to a 34% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 55% decline in realized oil prices. 
On the cost side, our team continues to work hard and deliver on driving down unit cost, which is evidenced by the 10% decline in cash unit cost to $1.22 per Mcfe. I think this decline is even more impressive when considering that we have increased the percentage of all focused activity in our mix, which typically is more costly to operate on a per unit basis. 
Additionally, we reaffirm guidance, even with the planned curtailment, which is, I think, the right economic decision. In the Marcellus, our operational results for the quarter exceeded expectations. The company averaged over 2 Bcf per day of gross Marcellus production, which is 1.7 Bcf per day of net production, an increase, as mentioned previously, 43% over last year's comparable quarter. We completed 19 wells and placed 17 wells on production, which drove the 16% sequential growth for the quarter. 
These production levels highlight the productivity of our Marcellus assets and demonstrates that the asset quality and well performance are quite unique assets for Cabot. However, we would like to see more favorable natural gas prices, which we anticipate will materialize upon the in-service of several new takeaway projects in our area scheduled over the next 12 to 18 months, along with the continued increase in natural gas demand growth. 
I want to also highlight that during the first quarter, the state of Pennsylvania began reporting monthly production data and did report for both January and February, Cabot was the top producer in Pennsylvania, which is not bad for a company that has never operated more than 6 rigs in the state. Marcellus pricing continues to be the primary focus of our conversations with shareholders, and I imagine, is front of mind for everybody on this call today. 
Our first quarter natural gas realizations were $2.46 per Mcf, which is $0.52 below the average NYMEX price for the quarter and improvement relative to the $1.04 differential in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realizations were $0.75 below NYMEX as compared to $1.21 in the fourth quarter of '14. Primary driver of the differential narrowing quarter-to-quarter was that our marketing team was able to secure a meaningful amount of favorable fixed price contracts for the winter season prior to the most recent decline in natural gas prices. Many of these deals do roll off in March. However, we do have over 20% of our expected volumes sold at a fixed priced above $2 in the second quarter. 
Based on our current view of where the regional indices will settle over the quarter, we anticipate that second quarter price realizations will be between $0.82 and $0.92 before NYMEX, below -- excuse me, below NYMEX and before the impact of hedges. Additionally, we anticipate another $0.40 to $0.45 uplift in realized prices from our hedges based on the current strip. So as we frequently get asked the question, we have provided a split of our pricing exposure by index on our website, which should provide some clarity on how we are marketing our gas for the quarter. We anticipate that the third quarter will look similar to the second quarter as it relates to the percentage of sales by index. 
As we have guided, we have reduced our production volumes for the second quarter relative to the first quarter, in response to our expectation of continued weakness in pricing during the second quarter, some of which is being driven by numerous maintenance and construction projects directly related to our downstream market. Virtually all of the pipelines our production reachers have planned or scheduled projects during the second quarter, most notably is the new looping of the Transco lighting line in conjunction with the Leidy Southeast expansion project. Although this expansion of 525 million cubic foot per day of new capacity will ultimately be very beneficial to Cabot at in-service in December of this year, the 43-day construction period is expected to affect throughput on the Leidy Line currently in price -- currently resulting in pricing pressures during this period. We expect to produce between 1.55 and 1.6 Bcf per day of gross production in the Marcellus for the second quarter. And we'll continue to monitor the price environment before we make any decisions on selling more gas into the local market. It is clear from our first quarter production that we have the ability to move volumes in excess of these base load levels, but we are not going to chase production growth to the detriment of cash margins. As planned, we recently decreased our level of activity in the Marcellus to 3 rigs and 1 frac crew, down from 5 rigs and 2 frac crews at the beginning of the year. Our current operating plan and capital program assumes this level of operating activity remains constant for the balance of 2015. However, in light of our expectations for our continued weakness throughout Appalachia during the summer months, we do often reevaluate our program and may consider delaying completions as we await a more favorable price environment in the future, again, not anticipating affecting our guidance. 
In the Eagle Ford, moving onto the Eagle Ford. Our team had an outstanding quarter operationally in South Texas, as evidenced by the 19% sequential growth in daily liquid volumes over the last quarter. During the quarter, we placed 20 wells on production, many of which weren't current in line until late in the quarter, which resulted in the strong sequential production growth. As a reminder, much of this activity was driven by near-term, held-by-production commitment, primarily from the acreage we acquired late last year. 
If we take a step back and we look at where our Eagle Ford program was a year ago, it really highlights the significant improvement we have seen from this asset in a short duration of time. On last year's first quarter call, we had just made a change in the management team overseeing the program and made the decision to increase our rig count from 2 to 3. The increase in the rig count was predicated on an increase in the return profile to over 50%, hoping as a result of well performance enhancements and decreased well cost. Keep in mind that we were running our economics at $90 per barrel at that point. We had approximately 600 gross locations identified based on 400-foot spacing. And frankly, we're pretty excited about the long-term value generation opportunity afforded us by these properties. 
If you fast forward 12 months and a lot of things have changed, the most obvious being the underlying commodity price. However, as a result of significant improvements in our operating efficiency and well performance, along with a reduction in service cost, our operation now eclipsed the same 50% rate of return threshold at a price of $65 per barrel, which is only $5 higher than today's 12 month strip. Relative to the 600 gross locations we had mapped at this time last year, we have now increased that location count to over 1,300 locations as a result of our bolt-on acquisitions in the fourth quarter of last year and the success of our 300-foot down spacing program across our acreage position. We have also seen a 30% decline in operating cost in South Texas as our team continues to work on driving down our cost structure. 
We are currently running 2 rigs in the play with plans to decrease to 1 rig by the end of May. Our plan is to remain at this level throughout year end. However, we will consider acceleration of completion activity in the Eagle Ford if we see a sustained oil price recovery or further reduction in drilling and completion costs, which have decreased, to date, 20% to 30%. 
Now let's move to another area that has many questions in regard to our time with investors. On the year-end call, we discussed a few of the significant accomplishments. The Constitution had recently achieved, such as the FERC Certificate of Public Convenience, approving Constitution Pipeline and the New York DEC formal notice of complete application for the final New York permit. Also, we briefly discussed the regulatory process in New York requiring a public comment period extension, which closed on February 27, 2015. 
Today, we can continue that update with the following. The project remains on its current schedule for in-service during the second half of '16. The New York DEC is currently finalizing responses to the comments received during the public comment period. Constitution now has possession of 100% of all the tracks necessary to begin construction. Constitution is working towards the finalization of New York State permits by the end of the second quarter, and the FERC implementation plan is expected to be filed by Williams during the second quarter. Based on the progress during the last few months, we continue to be optimistic that construction can begin mid-summer, assuming all these permits are in hand. 
As we also mentioned in our press release, we recently amended our credit facility, increasing the total commitment from $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, providing us ample flexibility in this challenged environment. Our lenders also approved an increase in our borrowing base from $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion despite the lower commodity price environment. A total of 20 lenders participated in this upside facility, including 6 new banks. We are appreciative of the support we saw in this transaction. And we believe it demonstrates the quality of our company, both operationally and financially. 
Pro forma for this increase in commitment, we had over $1.5 billion of undrawn commitments as of the end of the first quarter. 
In this morning's press release, we initiated second quarter of production guidance, which implies slightly over 1.5 Bcfe per day of net equivalent production for the quarter, at the mid-point despite the sequential decline in production relative to the first quarter due to the previously mentioned curtailments in the Marcellus. We have reaffirmed our 2015 production growth guidance range between 10% to 18%, based on a stronger-than-anticipated first quarter and expectations for increase in production above second quarter levels later in the year. 
Our capital program for the current year remains unchanged at $900 million. I would, however, highlight that not only as our 2015 capital program weighted heavily to the first half of the year, the first quarter capital expenditures on the cash flow statement also reflect carryforward cash outlays associated with our capital incurred in '14 but not paid until this year. We have also decreased our unit cost guidance, VaR LOE, taxes other than income and DD&A. These updates can be found on our website. 
In summary, our strong first quarter production highlights that Cabot is able to achieve operationally strong performance. Currently, lower natural gas prices are a reality through Appalachia. However, we are optimistic the environment improves over the next few quarters through a combination of decreased levels of operating activity, increased demand and new takeaway projects. Our goal in end term to protect margins and ensure we aren't giving away our valuable resources at marginal prices. Despite our planned reduction in volumes for the second quarter, we remain confident in our production guidance range for the year and continue to be excited about our mid-term outlook as we increase our portfolio of firm sales and firm transportation to close of 3 Bcf per day by the end of '17, of which approximately 70% reaches markets outside of Appalachia. 
With that, Dan, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

I think it's safe to say, at that point in time, regardless of when Constitution is commissioned, whether it's in the middle of summer or right at the beginning of the third quarter, I think, it is safe to say that those price points, more likely, if they're consistent with historic, is going to be at a higher, better price point than the current indices that we're selling into.

Or is there a point where, earlier on, where you have to figure out your rig count and make that call on the split between transferring production currently oversupplying or potentially oversupplying the local market versus new production to go into Constitution?"

And how I answer the question will be dependent upon how much I'll make Phil Stalnaker squirm over here in front of me. But keep in mind that the capital intensity necessary for us to ramp up our volumes is minimal comparatively speaking when you look across the space to be able to find another 0.5 Bcf per day. The driving consideration for that volume of production is going to be not necessarily in the rig count, but it's going to be how we stage in frac crews to allow timely completions of those wells that we have in the queue. So the plan building up to that decision point, it would be our intent to have in the queue that will allow us to have that maximum flexibility is to have wells drilled and in the queue, waiting on completion, if you will, as opposed to backing up a step and saying that we haven't even drilled the wells or drilled those pad sites yet. So when you get towards the end of this year, the discussions that we'll have with the north will be, all right, let's look at our capital program, let's look at our cash flow, let's look at the dynamics of the macro market, and let's make a call on bringing on another rig, if we felt like we needed it in the first part of '16. But also looking out ahead at the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter, how many frac crews do we want to have lined up to get ready to move those volumes into Constitution. Again, keep in mind that Constitution is going to be filled immediately upon commissioning. The decision is going to be, do we backfill Tennessee, Transco, Millennium with those volumes and how long do we want to take to backfill those volumes. But at the end of this year, as we go into the planning stage for our initial budget for '16, which we present to the board in October, we'll have some of these discussions."

That is going to remain consistent. I don't see much getting in the way of that expectation. In regard to frac log and looking at the backlog, it always seems to be a moving number that you see out there. And I see different counts of what is backlogged at any one given time. I do know that from an operation standpoint, and I'll talk more geographically about, say, where it could have a larger impact in our northeast Pennsylvania area, in that 6-county area. If you look at that area, we've talked in the past about how many rigs are running and how many frac crews were up there. Our most recent intelligence is that you had through, say, January, February, March, a certain number of rigs running up there. And most recently, in April, we placed the number of rigs up there in that particular area in our neck of the woods, at only 12 rigs that are currently running. And we have, at any given times, 6 to 8 frac crews operating in that neck of the woods. Now if you do the simple math and you look at the 8 Bcf or so a day that's kind of coming from that area, 12 rigs and 6 or 8 frac crews are going to have one hell of a time keeping up with any natural declines that you might suspect from the volumes that are being produced. Now I do think that there were and have been, just we like had, some curtailed volumes that could keep maybe backfilling some of that gas volume. And you're, maybe today, not seeing any type of real inflection point. But it doesn't take a mental giant to do the quick numbers on IPs and 30-day averages and all of that for those number of pieces of equipment to say that there has to be some depletion of the backlog, if you will. And the ability of wells to keep up with the natural depletion that would occur in -- under those circumstances. So on '14 -- at the end of '14, I think we had a similar number. We might actually have a couple more wells at the end of '15 as we had at the end of '14. But for the most part, we're going to have a similar backlog for us."

So a lot of people are targeting wells that may have been, let's say, proliferated at 100-foot spacing, and now people are targeting 50-foot spacing and the same thing kind of on a sand basis, where people may have done 800 pounds per foot versus now what people are pumping closer towards 1,600 pounds per foot. Cabot does have some opportunity for refracs. I would say that we would target those when we would do the downspaced wells and do those in conjunction with that, so you can get the full benefit of the zipper frac, both on the re-frac and on the new well that you drill in a downspaced perspective."

With me today, as usual, are several members of the executive team. Before we start, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward statements",1938,"Thank you, Kaye, and thank you all for joining us this morning for the second quarter earnings call. With me today, as usual, are several members of the executive team. Before we start, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward statements do apply to my comments today.
First, like to touch upon a few financial and operating highlights from the second quarter that were outlined in this morning's press release. Equivalent net production for the second quarter was 1,516 million cubic foot equivalent per day. Our quarterly results reflect the impact of our previously announced strategic decision to reduce our production levels during the quarter as a result of the lower-priced realizations throughout Appalachia. We estimate that we reduced our gross production volumes by approximately 500 million cubic foot per day during the quarter.
Despite this significant reduction in volumes during the second quarter, the company's equivalent production for the first half of '15 increased 25% as compared to the first half of '14, and the company's liquid production for the first half of '15 increased 95% relative to the first half of '14.
The company generated a net loss of $0.07 per share for the quarter. However, when adjusting for select items, including a $36.5 million noncash mark-to-market loss on derivatives, Cabot generated adjusted earnings of $0.03 per share. Operating cash flow, discretionary cash flow and EBITDAX were $171 million, $183 million, $204 million, respectively. All these financial metrics were lower relative to the second quarter of '14, primarily as a result of a 38% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 43% decline in realized oil prices.
Moving to specific comments regarding the Marcellus. As I mentioned, in light of the continued weakness in Appalachia pricing, we curtailed a significant level of volumes in the Marcellus during the second quarter. And we plan to continue this strategy into the third quarter as we await potential improvement in pricing in the fourth quarter with the addition of new takeaway capacity and stronger winter demand. While our marketing team continues to take advantage of short-term opportunities to improve netbacks in the Marcellus, there are limitations on the pricing front in the near term as we await some of the larger, more impactful projects like Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. However, we continue to accomplish our ongoing focus of enhancing margins by improving the cost side of our operations through efficiencies and also with cost reductions.
Our drilling operations in the Marcellus continue to set new records for the company. Our spud-to-spud cycle time during the quarter was under 15 days as compared to approximately 19 days for full year 2014 due in large part to new highs established for gross peak drilled per day during the quarter. As a result of these deficiencies, we have seen a 15% reduction in cost at rig release year-to-date. We anticipate further cost reductions as we move into '16 as 2 rig contracts will expire in December of this year, and our expectations are for a significant reduction in day rates going forward.
On the completion side of our operations, we have been successful in working with our service providers to realize additional cost reductions. All of these drilling and completion efficiencies and savings have allowed us to achieve the lower end or slightly below our $26.5 million range for a completed well cost. I would like to highlight that our wells placed on production year-to-date in 2015 are tracking our industry's best type curve of 0.6 [ph] Bcf per thousand feet, highlighting the consistency of our wells throughout our lease position.
Regarding pricing, our second quarter natural gas realizations were $2.15 per Mcf, which is $0.49 below the average NYMEX for the quarter, an improvement relative to the $0.52 differential in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realizations were $0.89 below NYMEX. Assuming the regional differentials we observed in the second quarter persist in the third quarter, we anticipate that Cabot's third quarter price realizations will be somewhere between $0.95 and $1.05, below NYMEX before the impact of hedges.
Additionally, we anticipate another $0.30 to $0.35 per Mcf uplift in realized prices from our hedges based on the current strip. If you want more details on the spread of our pricing exposure by index, check out our guidance slide on the website. Similar to the second quarter, we expect to produce between 1.55 and 1.6 Bcf per day of gross production in the Marcellus during the third quarter. We will continue to be patient as we anticipate a better opportunity to move additional volumes in the local market. We firmly believe that stronger demand and improved price realizations for Cabot are on the rise, and we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to managing through this lower-priced environment as we have through all the commodity cycles. The bottom line is that we remain focused on improving margins and returns and maximizing long-term value, which I believe is evidenced by our ability to continue to efficiently grow our production and reserves in this low-price environment without straining our balance sheet or issuing equity. This clearly sets us apart in the industry.
In the Eagle Ford, a couple of comments there. Our second quarter volumes were flat to our first quarter volumes despite decreasing our rig count to 1 and slowing down our completion activity. Our efficiencies in the field continued to improve as we have decreased our drilling days by about 20% relative to '14 and increased the average number of completions per day by about 20%.
As a reminder, much of our activity in the first half of the year was driven by near-term primary term -- near-term primary lease terms and continuous development obligations. Given that we have already met the majority of these obligations for '15, we only plan to operate 1 rig during the second half of the year. We still anticipate exiting the year with over 20 wells waiting on completion. We frequently get asked at what price we would look to accelerate our completion activity in the Eagle Ford. Despite the significant reduction in cost, we have -- that we have achieved upwards of 30% across all service lines, we do not believe that allocating incremental capital in the Eagle Ford is the prudent investment decision in this oil price environment, especially given the implied increases in the cash flow deficit that would result from the increased spending.
Okay. Let's move to Constitution Pipeline update. During our first quarter teleconference, we highlighted the additional progress that was made regarding our efforts to finalize a permit, process for Constitution. Today, we can continue that update with the following: Constitution filed its implementation plan with the FERC on May 19, '15. This was a critical step, documenting how Constitution will comply with the environmental conditions placed in the third quarter. And it's the last step prior to the FERC issuing its notice to proceed regarding construction. Also, Constitution is now providing a weekly update to the FERC.
Constitution filed its final reroute variance report also with the FERC last week. This completes all outstanding issues regarding the route and Constitution now has 100% of the required right of ways.
Regarding the New York DEC, our understanding is the last reroute that I just mentioned was one of the final loose ends prior to their issuance of 401 water quality permit. Therefore, our expectations are that we are very close to wrapping up and completing all remaining New York DEC outstanding issues.
In summary, we continue to make important progress and remain optimistic that we will receive final clearance so that we can then begin construction this fall and place the project into service during the second half of '16.
Regarding our third quarter guidance. Production guidance included in the press release this morning implies approximately 1.5 Bcfe per day of net equivalent production at the midpoint. Natural gas guidance for the quarter is unchanged relative to the second quarter guidance, while the midpoints of our liquid volumes, we reduced by 1,500 barrels per day as a result of the slowdown in completion activity that we have discussed previously due to front-end loaded capital program, resulting from drilling obligations in the first half of the year.
We remain -- we have remained our 2015 full year production growth guidance range of 10% to 18%. If we were to hold the midpoint of our third quarter guidance flat into the fourth quarter, we would achieve the low end of our full year guidance. However, we do anticipate at least a moderate ramp in our Marcellus of volumes in the fourth quarter in response to seasonal winter demand.
Our capital program for 2015 remains unchanged at $900 million. We have received a few questions about our program spending this year, so I'd like to take a brief moment to clarify our guidance. The $900 million for 2015 refers to the capital associated with activity incurred in 2015 for this year's operating plan. However, because of the timing gap between activity incurred and payments for services, we have had cash outflows this year associated with activity incurred in 2014. And because of the significant decline in capital spending year-over-year, we are in a position this year where cash outflows on the cash flow statement will be higher than our capital guidance for the year. The majority of this impact occurred in the first half of the year where the capital incurred for 2015 activity was $540 million, but the capital expenditure on the cash flow statement were approximately $660 million. The $550 million incurred in the first half of the year for our 2015 program is approximately 60% of our full year guidance, which is, in fact, below the 65% guidance we provided last quarter.
Our unit cost guidance for the year remains unchanged. However, I would highlight that year-to-date, cash unit cost were $1.25 per Mcf, $0.07 below the midpoint of our full year guidance. This includes a $0.85 per Mcf cash unit cost in the Marcellus and a $15 per barrel cash unit cost in the Eagle Ford. While we are pleased with these low cost, the mandate -- the organization has is to continue to focus on further improving our cost structure.
As per '16, we're still in the planning phase, and we'll have more detail to provide on the third quarter call in October, once we have had an opportunity to fully our plans with the board, including an updated review of our 5-year plan. Based on a preliminary look at the 5-year plan, we are extremely excited about the long-term value created by our Marcellus asset as we begin to assess more favorable price markets, which will allow Cabot to not only accelerate production and cash flow growth, but also significantly improve corporate-wide margins and returns.
In summary, we continue to focus on improving efficiencies, reducing cost and increasing our margins with an emphasis on maximizing the long-term value of this top-tier portfolio we have. In the near term, we remain optimistic about Constitution construction beginning in the fall and remain confident in the second half of '16 in-service date.
Additionally, we are pleased with the progress being made on the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline, which is another important step in our strategy to monetize our low-cost Marcellus assets at premium prices.
Lastly, we will continue to be disciplined through this low commodity price environment with an emphasis on managing the balance sheet and protecting returns in margins.
Kate, with those brief comments, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

So there's a different uptick that we anticipate being able to capture with that 0.5 Bcf moving into Constitution. In regard to the transportation, we certainly take all of that in consideration when we look at what our realizations are. So with a roll forward in the 5-year model and looking at in , in Atlantic Sunrise, we have 850 million a day in the Atlantic sunrise. We have all of those volumes already sold. And we have 300 million -- 350 million of that sold to Cove Point, Sumitomo in Cove Point, under a contract. And we have the remaining portions of that allocated already. Also, those price points are going to be outside of the price points we're currently exposed to. So going forward, again, putting together in the middle of our 5-year plan, as you might suspect because we're now just getting a lot of this data and digesting a lot of this data and building our operations model around the expectations on the macro market. But rolling forward and looking at the price points, we're going to be able to achieve and the volumes we can move to those price points.

As with our assumption that how much we're going to be able to do on those stream crossings in '15 versus '16. But coming out of the '16 -- end of '15 to the beginning of the summer of '16, depending on how many stream crossings we have remaining, if we have some remaining, we anticipate to start immediately on those, complete those. And then the project would then be commissioned following that. Keep in mind, during this period of time, it's the stream crossings that have the sideboards on them. The rest of the pipeline, we can be continuing to tie in and do all of those things that we have to do. It's just those stream crossings and tying those pinch points on the streams that we're juggling in the schedule.

We have continued to run our operation with the primary focus of maximizing returns as I've said, and the efficiencies, trying to protect the margins or improve our margins.

As far as looking at the 2 commodities, looking at oil, gas, we're really returns focused and we feel like that is going to remain our focus. You can get into the discussion about how you would want to look at a more diverse program, add a little bit more oil to our program, obviously, diversify it a little bit. But I've been in the business a long time, Brian, and looked at these different cycles that we've gone through. And our view of our crystal ball rolling forward for our position in the natural gas base and what we think we can do with improved infrastructure, we think we're going to be able to deliver extremely strong returns with our natural gas position. And we think it is going to be, with our crystal ball look at the liquid side of the business, that the natural gas liquids are going to be challenged for an extended period of time. And we think that on the oil side, it's such a dynamic market with the international influence that affects the oil market. That crystal ball is not -- in my opinion, I'm not as confident as what the oil price is going to do as I am what I see available to us on the natural gas side. So with that being said, we're focused in natural gas. We'll remain focused in natural gas. If we have the opportunity to improve our liquids position, it's going to have to compete with what our view is long term in natural gas."

I don't think differentials are going to be equal across all spaces. I think differentials will be -- continue to be subject to -- even in the longer term, will continue to be subject to gas-on-gas competition. In our specific instance, what we see is getting to price points into areas in the market that we feel like we'll have the demand side of the equation matching the supply side and the ability for just that amount of gas to get to different price points. Constitution, as an example, we're going to be able to move gas not only south from right station, but we're also going to be able to move gas north into Canada from that position. We also would hope to be able to move gas to a different price point when the Atlantic Sunrise comes on. Cove Point is a unique project for us, and the differentials that are attached to that project are basically part of a contractual -- or potential contractual arrangement. So we feel confident about what our realizations are going to be on that marketing of that volume of gas. We also have a price point set at the 500 million -- of the remaining 500 million of the Atlantic Sunrise volume. So in looking out where we are, we just feel and looking at point-specific areas that the narrowing of the differential seems to and tying it to the demand situations in those areas. And if that -- those particular price points, we just feel confident that the volume of gas that can get to those price points is going to measure up to the demand that we see.
In other areas to your point, David, on some of the modeling out there has -- still has differentials of $0.50 to a $1. There might be areas that those type of differentials. And those are going to be areas that have ongoing bottlenecks where gas and gas competition is not going to be able to get the volumes of gas out that are on the supply side to reach the demand areas. And there could be those specific areas that have those type of differentials.
What our -- and kind of to your point, David, that was part of the reason why we commissioned a unique independent study for Cabot's behalf to answer some of those questions on the market dynamics from a macro sense and also a micro sense on its effect on Cabot and where we're moving our gas."

Before we start, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward statements",1936,"Thank you, Kate, and thank you all for joining us this morning for the second quarter earnings call. With me today, as usual, are several members of the executive team. Before we start, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward statements do apply to my comments today.
First, I'd like to touch upon a few financial and operating highlights from the second quarter that were outlined in this morning's press release. The equivalent net production for the second quarter was 1,516 million cubic foot equivalent per day. Our quarterly results reflect the impact of our previously announced strategic decision to reduce our production levels during the quarter as a result of the lower-priced realizations throughout Appalachia. We estimate that we reduced our gross production volumes by approximately 500 million cubic foot per day during the quarter. Despite this significant reduction in volumes during the second quarter, the company's equivalent production for the first half of '15 increased 25% as compared to the first half of '14, and the company's liquid production for the first half of '15 increased 95% relative to the first half of '14.
The company generated a net loss of $0.07 per share for the quarter. However, when adjusting for select items, including a $36.5 million noncash mark-to-market loss on derivatives, Cabot generated adjusted earnings of $0.03 per share. Operating cash flow, discretionary cash flow and EBITDAX were $171 million, $183 million, $204 million, respectively. All of these financial metrics were lower relative to the second quarter of '14, primarily as a result of a 38% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 43% decline in realized oil prices.
Moving to specific comments regarding the Marcellus. As I mentioned, in light of the continued weakness in Appalachia pricing, we curtailed a significant level of volumes in the Marcellus during the second quarter, and we plan to continue this strategy into the third quarter as we await potential improvement in pricing in the fourth quarter with the addition of new takeaway capacity and stronger winter demand. While our marketing team continues to take advantage of short-term opportunities to improve netbacks in the Marcellus, there are limitations on the pricing front in the near term as we await some of the larger, more impactful projects like Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. However, we continue to accomplish our ongoing focus of enhancing margins by improving the cost side of our operations through efficiencies and also with cost reductions.
Our drilling operations in the Marcellus continue to set new records for the company. Our spud-to-spud cycle time during the quarter was under 15 days as compared to approximately 19 days for full year 2014 due in large part to new highs established for gross peak drilled per day during the quarter. As a result of these efficiencies, we have seen a 15% reduction in cost at rig release year-to-date. We anticipate further cost reductions as we move into '16 as 2 rig contracts will expire in December of this year and our expectations are for a significant reduction in day rates going forward.
On the completion side of our operations, we have been successful in working with our service providers to realize additional cost reductions. All of these drilling and completion efficiencies and savings have allowed us to achieve the lower end or slightly below our $26.5 million range for a completed well cost. I would like to highlight that our wells placed on production year-to-date in 2015 are tracking our industry's best type curve of 3.6 Bcf per thousand feet, highlighting the consistency of our wells throughout our lease position.
Regarding pricing, our second quarter natural gas realizations were $2.15 per Mcf, which is $0.49 below the average NYMEX for the quarter, an improvement relative to the $0.52 differential in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realizations were $0.89 below NYMEX. Assuming the regional differentials we observed in the second quarter persist in the third quarter, we anticipate that Cabot's third quarter price realizations will be somewhere between $0.95 and $1.05, below NYMEX before the impact of hedges. Additionally, we anticipate another $0.30 to $0.35 per Mcf uplift in realized prices from our hedges based on the current strip. If you want more details on the split of our pricing exposure by index, check out our guidance slide on the website.
Similar to the second quarter, we expect to produce between 1.55 and 1.6 Bcf per day of gross production in the Marcellus during the third quarter. We will continue to be patient as we anticipate a better opportunity to move additional volumes in the local market. We firmly believe that stronger demand and improved price realizations for Cabot are on the rise, and we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to managing through this lower-priced environment as we have through all the commodity cycles. The bottom line is that we remain focused on improving margins and returns and maximizing long-term value, which, I believe, is evidenced by our ability to continue to efficiently grow our production and reserves in this low-price environment without straining our balance sheet or issuing equity. This clearly sets us apart in the industry.
In the Eagle Ford, a couple of comments there. Our second quarter volumes were flat to our first quarter volumes despite decreasing our rig count to one and slowing down our completion activity. Our efficiencies in the field continued to improve as we have decreased our drilling days by about 20% relative to '14 and increased the average number of completions per day by about 20%. As a reminder, much of our activity in the first half of the year was driven by near-term primary term -- near-term primary lease terms and continuous development obligations. Given that we have already met the majority of these obligations for '15, we only plan to operate one rig during the second half of the year. We still anticipate exiting the year with over 20 wells waiting on completion. We frequently get asked at what price we would look to accelerate our completion activity in the Eagle Ford. Despite the significant reduction in cost, we have -- that we have achieved upwards of 30% across all service lines, we do not believe that allocating incremental capital in the Eagle Ford is the prudent investment decision in this oil price environment, especially given the implied increases in cash flow deficit that would result from the increased spending.
Okay. Let's move to Constitution Pipeline update. During our first quarter teleconference, we highlighted the additional progress that was made regarding our efforts to finalize a permit, a process for Constitution. Today, we can continue that update with the following: Constitution filed its implementation plan with the FERC on May 19, '15. This was a critical step, documenting how Constitution will comply with the environmental conditions placed in the FERC order, and it's the last step prior to the FERC issuing its notice to proceed regarding construction. Also, Constitution is now providing a weekly update to the FERC. Constitution filed its final reroute variance report also with the FERC last week. This completes all outstanding issues regarding the route, and Constitution now has 100% of the required right of ways. Regarding the New York DEC, our understanding is the last reroute that I just mentioned was one of the final loose ends prior to their issuance of 401 water quality permit. Therefore, our expectations are that we are very close wrapping up and completing all remaining New York DEC outstanding issues. In summary, we continue to make important progress and remain optimistic that we will receive final clearance so that we can then begin construction this fall and place the project into service during the second half of '16.
Regarding our third quarter guidance. Production guidance included in the press release this morning implies approximately 1.5 Bcfe per day of net equivalent production at midpoint. Natural gas guidance for the quarter is unchanged relative to the second quarter guidance; while the midpoints of our liquid volumes, we reduced by 1,500 barrels per day as a result of the slowdown in completion activity that we have discussed previously due to front-end-loaded capital program resulting from drilling obligations in the first half of the year. We remain -- we have remained our 2015 full year production growth guidance range of 10% to 18%. If we were to hold the midpoint of our third quarter guidance flat into the fourth quarter, we would achieve the low end of our full year guidance. However, we do anticipate at least a moderate ramp in our Marcellus volumes in the fourth quarter in response to seasonal winter demand.
Our capital program for 2015 remains unchanged at $900 million. We have received a few questions about our program spending this year, so I'd like to take a brief moment to clarify our guidance. The $900 million for 2015 refers to the capital associated with activity incurred in 2015 for this year's operating plan. However, because of the timing gap between activity incurred and payments for services, we have had cash outflows this year associated with activity incurred in 2014. And because of the significant decline in capital spending year-over-year, we are in a position this year where cash outflows on the cash flow statement will be higher than our capital guidance for the year. The majority of this impact occurred in the first half of the year, where the capital incurred for 2015 activity was $540 million, but the capital expenditure on the cash flow statement were approximately $660 million. The $550 million incurred in the first half of the year for our 2015 program is approximately 60% of our full year guidance, which is, in fact, below the 65% guidance we provided last quarter.
Our unit cost guidance for the year remains unchanged. However, I would highlight that year-to-date, cash unit costs were $1.25 per Mcf, $0.07 below the midpoint of our full year guidance. This includes a $0.85 per Mcf cash unit cost in the Marcellus and a $15 per barrel cash unit cost in the Eagle Ford. While we are pleased with these low costs, the mandate the organization has is to continue to focus on further improving our cost structure. As for '16, we're still in the planning phase, and we'll have more detail to provide on the third quarter call in October once we have had an opportunity to fully vet our plans with the board, including an updated review of our 5-year plan. Based on a preliminary look at the 5-year plan, we are extremely excited about the long-term value created by our Marcellus asset as we begin to assess more favorable price markets, which will allow Cabot to not only accelerate production and cash flow growth, but also significantly improve corporate-wide margins and returns.
In summary, we continue to focus on improving efficiencies, reducing cost and increasing our margins with an emphasis on maximizing the long-term value of this top-tier portfolio we have. In the near term, we remain optimistic about Constitution construction beginning in the fall and remain confident in the second half of '16 in-service date. Additionally, we are pleased with the progress being made on the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline, which is another important step in our strategy to monetize our low-cost Marcellus assets at premium prices. Lastly, we will continue to be disciplined through this low commodity price environment with an emphasis on managing the balance sheet and protecting returns and margins.
Kate, with those brief comments, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

What we would also expect is that some of the stream crossings, we think we can complete and prior to the September closure period for open cuts and streams, but I don't know and I don't think that we could get all of those stream crossings done prior to September. Some of it depends on weather, and certainly, some of it is based on the timing the DEC gets out there. We did change our capital allocation number a little bit from -- or reduced it from 70 to 38, I think as -- with our assumption that how much we're going to be able to do on those stream crossings in '15 versus '16. But coming out of the '16 -- end of '16, the beginning of the summer of '16, depending on how many stream crossings we have remaining, if we have some remaining, we anticipate to start immediately on those, complete those. And then the project would then be commissioned following that. Keep in mind, during this period of time, it's the stream crossings that have the sideboards on them. The rest of the pipeline, we can -- continuing to tie in and do all of those things that we have to do, it's just those stream crossings and tying in those pinch points on the streams that we're juggling in the schedule. So sometime -- if we have stream crossing sometime after the June period, depending on how many and when we hook those up will dictate when we can commission the pipeline."

We have continued to run our operation with the primary focus of maximizing returns, as I've said, and the efficiencies, trying to protect the margins or improve our margins. We think, in this environment, that a good, strong balance sheet and one that affords the greatest flexibility not only allows you to conduct your operations prudently and allows you to manage from a position of strength. But if there is an opportunity that presents itself, then we're certainly in a great physical and financial position to take advantage of it. As far as looking at the 2 commodities, looking at oil, gas, we're really returns focused, and we feel like that is going to remain our focus. You can get into the discussion about how you would want to look at a more diverse program, add a little bit more oil to our program, obviously, diversify it a little bit. But I've been in the business a long time, Brian, and looked at these different cycles that we've gone through. And our view of our crystal ball, rolling forward, for our position in the natural gas space and what we think we can do with improved infrastructure, we think we're going to be able to deliver extremely strong returns with our natural gas position. And we think it is going to be, with our crystal ball look at the liquid side of the business, that natural gas liquids are going to be challenged for an extended period of time. And we think that on the oil side, it's such a dynamic market with the international influence that affects the oil market. That crystal ball is not -- in my opinion, I'm not as confident as what the oil price is going to do as I am what I see available to us on the natural gas side. So with that being said, we're focused in natural gas. We'll remain focused for natural gas. If we have the opportunity to improve our liquids position, it's going to have to compete with what our view is long term in natural gas."

I don't think differentials are going to be equal across all spaces. I think differentials will be -- continue to be subject to -- even in the longer term, will continue to be subject to gas-on-gas competition. In our specific instance, what we see is getting to price points and to areas in the market that we feel like will have the demand side of the equation matching the supply side and the ability for just that amount of gas to get to different price points. Constitution, as an example, we're going to be able to move gas not only south from Wright station, but we're also going to be able to move gas north into Canada from that position. We also would hope to be able to move gas to a different price point when the Atlantic Sunrise comes on. Cove Point is a unique project for us, and the differentials and -- that are attached to that project are basically part of a contractual -- or confidential contractual arrangement. So we feel confident about what our realizations are going to be on that marketing of that volume of gas. We also have a price point set at the 500 million -- of the remaining 500 million of the Atlantic Sunrise volume. So in looking out where we are, we just feel, in looking at point-specific areas, that the narrowing of the differential seems to and tying it to the demand situations in those areas. And if that particular -- those particular price points, we just feel confident that the volume of gas that can get to those price points is going to measure up to the demand that we see. In other areas to your point, David, on -- some of the modeling out there has -- still has differentials of $0.50 or $1. There might be areas that have those type of differentials. And those are going to be areas that have ongoing bottlenecks, where gas-on-gas competition is not going to be able to get the volumes of gas out that are on the supply side to reach the demand areas. And there could be those specific areas that have those type of differentials. What our -- and kind of to your point, David, that was part of the reason why we commissioned a unique, independent study for Cabot's behalf to answer some of those questions on the market dynamics from a macro sense and also a micro sense on its effect on Cabot and where we're moving our gas."

With me today, as usual, are several members of the executive team. Before we start, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward statements do apply to my comments today.
First, I'd like to touch upon a few financial and operating highlights from the second quarter that were outlined in this morning's press release. The equivalent net production for the second quarter was 1,516 million cubic foot equivalent per day. Our quarterly results reflect the impact of our previously announced strategic decision to reduce our production levels during the quarter as a result of the lower-priced realizations throughout Appalachia. We estimate that we reduced our gross production volumes by approximately 500 million cubic foot per day during the quarter. Despite this significant reduction in volumes during the second quarter, the company's equivalent production for the first half of '15 increased 25% as compared to the first half of '14, and the company's liquid production for the first half of '15 increased 95% relative to the first half of '14.
The company generated a net loss of $0.07 per share for the quarter. However, when adjusting for select items, including a $36.5 million noncash mark-to-market loss on derivatives, Cabot generated adjusted earnings of $0.03 per share. Operating cash flow, discretionary cash flow and EBITDAX were $171 million, $183 million, $204 million, respectively. All of these financial metrics were lower relative to the second quarter of '14, primarily as a result of a 38% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 43% decline in realized oil prices.
Moving to specific comments regarding the Marcellus. As I mentioned, in light of the continued weakness in Appalachia pricing, we curtailed a significant level of volumes in the Marcellus during the second quarter, and we plan to continue this strategy into the third quarter as we await potential improvement in pricing in the fourth quarter with the addition of new takeaway capacity and stronger winter demand. While our marketing team continues to take advantage of short-term opportunities to improve netbacks in the Marcellus, there are limitations on the pricing front in the near term as we await some of the larger, more impactful projects like Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. However, we continue to accomplish our ongoing focus of enhancing margins by improving the cost side of our operations through efficiencies and also with cost reductions.
Our drilling operations in the Marcellus continue to set new records for the company. Our spud-to-spud cycle time during the quarter was under 15 days as compared to approximately 19 days for full year 2014 due in large part to new highs established for gross peak drilled per day during the quarter. As a result of these efficiencies, we have seen a 15% reduction in cost at rig release year-to-date. We anticipate further cost reductions as we move into '16 as 2 rig contracts will expire in December of this year and our expectations are for a significant reduction in day rates going forward.
On the completion side of our operations, we have been successful in working with our service providers to realize additional cost reductions. All of these drilling and completion efficiencies and savings have allowed us to achieve the lower end or slightly below our $26.5 million range for a completed well cost. I would like to highlight that our wells placed on production year-to-date in 2015 are tracking our industry's best type curve of 3.6 Bcf per thousand feet, highlighting the consistency of our wells throughout our lease position.
Regarding pricing, our second quarter natural gas realizations were $2.15 per Mcf, which is $0.49 below the average NYMEX for the quarter, an improvement relative to the $0.52 differential in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realizations were $0.89 below NYMEX. Assuming the regional differentials we observed in the second quarter persist in the third quarter, we anticipate that Cabot's third quarter price realizations will be somewhere between $0.95 and $1.05, below NYMEX before the impact of hedges. Additionally, we anticipate another $0.30 to $0.35 per Mcf uplift in realized prices from our hedges based on the current strip. If you want more details on the split of our pricing exposure by index, check out our guidance slide on the website.
Similar to the second quarter, we expect to produce between 1.55 and 1.6 Bcf per day of gross production in the Marcellus during the third quarter. We will continue to be patient as we anticipate a better opportunity to move additional volumes in the local market. We firmly believe that stronger demand and improved price realizations for Cabot are on the rise, and we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to managing through this lower-priced environment as we have through all the commodity cycles. The bottom line is that we remain focused on improving margins and returns and maximizing long-term value, which, I believe, is evident by our ability to continue to efficiently grow our production and reserves in this low-price environment without straining our balance sheet or issuing equity. This clearly sets us apart in the industry.
In the Eagle Ford, a couple of comments there. Our second quarter volumes were flat to our first quarter volumes despite decreasing our rig count to one and slowing down our completion activity. Our efficiencies in the field continued to improve as we have decreased our drilling days by about 20% relative to '14 and increased the average number of completions per day by about 20%. As a reminder, much of our activity in the first half of the year was driven by near-term primary term -- near-term primary lease terms and continuous development obligations. Given that we have already met the majority of these obligations for '15, we only plan to operate one rig during the second half of the year. We still anticipate exiting the year with over 20 wells waiting on a completion. We frequently get asked at what price we would look to accelerate our completion activity in the Eagle Ford. Despite the significant reduction in cost, we have -- that we have achieved upwards of 30% across all service lines, we do not believe that allocating incremental capital in the Eagle Ford is the prudent investment decision in this oil price environment, especially given the implied increases in cash flow deficit that would result from the increased spending.
Okay. Let's move to Constitution Pipeline update. During our first quarter teleconference, we highlighted the additional progress that was made regarding our efforts to finalize a permit process for Constitution. Today, we can continue that update with the following: Constitution filed its implementation plan with the FERC on May 19, '15. This was a critical step, documenting how Constitution will comply with the environmental conditions placed in the FERC order, and it's the last step prior to the FERC issuing its notice to proceed regarding construction. Also, Constitution is now providing a weekly update to the FERC. Constitution filed its final reroute variance report also with the FERC last week. This completes all outstanding issues regarding the route, and Constitution now has 100% of the required right of ways. Regarding the New York DEC, our understanding is the last reroute that I just mentioned was one of the final loose ends prior to their issuance of 401 water quality permit. Therefore, our expectations are that we are very close to wrapping up and completing all remaining New York DEC outstanding issues. In summary, we continue to make important progress and remain optimistic that we will receive final clearance so that we can then begin construction this fall and place the project into service during the second half of '16.
Regarding our third quarter guidance. Production guidance included in the press release this morning implies approximately 1.5 Bcfe per day of net equivalent production at midpoint. Natural gas guidance for the quarter is unchanged relative to the second quarter guidance; while the midpoints of our liquid volumes, we reduced by 1,500 barrels per day as a result of the slowdown in completion activity that we have discussed previously due to front-end-loaded capital program resulting from drilling obligations in the first half of the year. We remain -- we have remained our 2015 full year production growth guidance range of 10% to 18%. If we were to hold the midpoint of our third quarter guidance flat into the fourth quarter, we would achieve the low end of our full year guidance. However, we do anticipate at least a moderate ramp in our Marcellus volumes in the fourth quarter in response to seasonal winter demand.
Our capital program for 2015 remains unchanged at $900 million. We have received a few questions about our program spending this year, so I'd like to take a brief moment to clarify our guidance. The $900 million for 2015 refers to the capital associated with activity incurred in 2015 for this year's operating plan. However, because of the timing gap between activity incurred and payments for services, we have had cash outflows this year associated with activity incurred in 2014. And because of the significant decline in capital spending year-over-year, we are in a position this year where cash outflows on the cash flow statement will be higher than our capital guidance for the year. The majority of this impact occurred in the first half of the year, where the capital incurred for 2015 activity was $540 million, but the capital expenditure on the cash flow statement were approximately $660 million. The $550 million incurred in the first half of the year for our 2015 program is approximately 60% of our full year guidance, which is, in fact, below the 65% guidance we provided last quarter.
Our unit cost guidance for the year remains unchanged. However, I would highlight that year-to-date, cash unit costs were $1.25 per Mcf, $0.07 below the midpoint of our full year guidance. This includes a $0.85 per Mcf cash unit cost in the Marcellus and a $15 per barrel cash unit cost in the Eagle Ford. While we are pleased with these low costs, the mandate the organization has is to continue to focus on further improving our cost structure. As for '16, we're still in the planning phase, and we'll have more detail to provide on the third quarter call in October once we have had an opportunity to fully vet our plans with the board, including an updated review of our 5-year plan. Based on a preliminary look at the 5-year plan, we are extremely excited about the long-term value created by our Marcellus asset as we begin to assess more favorable price markets, which will allow Cabot to not only accelerate production and cash flow growth, but also significantly improve corporate-wide margins and returns.
In summary, we continue to focus on improving efficiencies, reducing cost and increasing our margins with an emphasis on maximizing the long-term value of this top-tier portfolio we have. In the near term, we remain optimistic about Constitution construction beginning in the fall and remain confident in the second half of '16 in-service date. Additionally, we are pleased with the progress being made on the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline, which is another important step in our strategy to monetize our low-cost Marcellus assets at premium prices. Lastly, we will continue to be disciplined through this low commodity price environment with an emphasis on managing the balance sheet and protecting returns and margins.
Kate, with those brief comments, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

So we're optimistic that we'll see better days ahead in the fourth quarter and first quarter of '16."

But if I could go back, Dan, to one of the -- your comments -- your prepared comments on the CapEx picture. That's definitely helpful, the detail on the CapEx incurred versus your cash flow CapEx. But just taking your $540 million for the first half '15 CapEx incurred, you're still looking like a pretty significant drop for a run rate for the back half of the year. And I'm wondering if you could maybe offer some commentary. You're keeping 4 rigs running, but you just have that CapEx dropping. Is that a function of deferring more completions on that? I know you gave us your drilled and complete count at year-end, but how does that look from your perspective? How are you going to get to that reduced CapEx run rate?"

It utilized all the available data out there, certainly integrated all of the positions that were out there that you can see in the different crags and different positions and different guidances and expectations out there. So it was a fully encompassing study. In regard to the Constitution depth, I mean, you can look at Constitution and -- today and look at what the prices of that index is on InterCore [ph], and you can look at today and look at the difference compared to what we're saving right now on those 3 pipes. So there's a significant uptick that we anticipate being able to capture with that 0.5 Bcf moving into -- in the Constitution. In regard to the transportation, we certainly take all of that in consideration when we look at what our realizations are. So with a roll forward in the 5-year model and looking at then Atlantic Sunrise, we have 850 million a day in the Atlantic Sunrise. We have all of those volumes already sold. And we have 300 million of that -- 350 million of that sold to Cove Point, Sumitomo in Cove Point, under a contract, and we have the remaining portions of that allocated already. Also, those price points are going to be outside of the price points we're currently exposed to. So rolling forward, again, putting together in the middle of our 5-year plan, as you might suspect, because we're just now getting a lot of this data and digesting a lot of this data and building our operations model around the expectations on the macro market. But rolling forward and looking at the price points, we're going to be able to achieve, and the volumes, we can move to those price points, we think that our price realizations will be above the NYMEX towards the end of this 5-year period."

And then the project would then be commissioned following that. Keep in mind, during this period of time, it's the stream crossings that have the sideboards on them. The rest of the pipeline, we can be continuing to tie in and do all of those things that we have to do, it's just those stream crossings and tying in those pinch points on the streams that we're juggling in the schedule.

We think, in this environment, that a good, strong balance sheet and one that affords the greatest flexibility not only allows you to conduct your operations prudently and allows you to manage from a position of strength. But if there is an opportunity that presents itself, then we're certainly in a great physical and financial position to take advantage of it. As far as looking at the 2 commodities, looking at oil, gas, we're really returns focused, and we feel like that is going to remain our focus. You can get into the discussion about how you would want to look at a more diverse program, add a little bit more oil to our program, obviously, diversify it a little bit. But I've been in the business a long time, Brian, and looked at these different cycles that we've gone through. And our view of our crystal ball, rolling forward, for our position in the natural gas space and what we think we can do with improved infrastructure, we think we're going to be able to deliver extremely strong returns with our natural gas position. And we think it is going to be, with our crystal ball look at the liquid side of the business, that natural gas liquids are going to be challenged for an extended period of time. And we think that on the oil side, it's such a dynamic market with the international influence that affects the oil market. That crystal ball is not -- in my opinion, I'm not as confident as what the oil price is going to do as I am what I see available to us on the natural gas side. So with that being said, we're focused in natural gas. We'll remain focused in natural gas. If we have the opportunity to improve our liquids position, it's going to have to compete with what our view is long term in natural gas."

I don't think differentials are going to be equal across all spaces. I think differentials will be -- continue to be subject to -- even in the longer term, will continue to be subject to gas-on-gas competition. In our specific instance, what we see is getting to price points and to areas in the market that we feel like will have the demand side of the equation matching the supply side and the ability for just that amount of gas to get to different price points. Constitution, as an example, we're going to be able to move gas not only south from Wright station, but we're also going to be able to move gas north into Canada from that position. We also would hope to be able to move gas to a different price point when the Atlantic Sunrise comes on. Cove Point is a unique project for us, and the differentials and -- that are attached to that project are basically part of a contractual -- or confidential contractual arrangement. So we feel confident about what our realizations are going to be on that marketing of that volume of gas. We also have a price point set at the 500 million -- of the remaining 500 million of the Atlantic Sunrise volume. So in looking out where we are, we just feel, in looking at point-specific areas, that the narrowing of the differential seems to and tying it to the demand situations in those areas. And at that particular -- those particular price points, we just feel confident that the volume of gas that can get to those price points is going to measure up to the demand that we see. In other areas to your point, David, on -- some of the modeling out there has -- still has differentials of $0.50 or $1. There might be areas that have those type of differentials. And those are going to be areas that have ongoing bottlenecks, where gas-on-gas competition is not going to be able to get the volumes of gas out that are on the supply side to reach the demand areas. And there could be those specific areas that have those type of differentials. What our -- and kind of to your point, David, that was part of the reason why we commissioned a unique, independent study for Cabot's behalf to answer some of those questions on the market dynamics from a macro sense and also a micro sense on its effect on Cabot and where we're moving our gas."

Appreciate you joining us on this third quarter earnings call. I do have the management team gathered with me. And also, as usual, the forward-looking statements included in this morning's release do apply to my",2625,"Thank you, Kerry, and good morning to all. Appreciate you joining us on this third quarter earnings call. I do have the management team gathered with me. And also, as usual, the forward-looking statements included in this morning's release do apply to my comments today.
I would like to touch upon a couple of financial and operating highlights from the third quarter that were outlined in the release this morning. First, the equivalent net production for the third quarter was 1.544 Bcf -- cubic -- billion cubic foot equivalent per day, an increase of 7% as compared to the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date, our production volumes have increased 19% relative to the first 9 months of 2014. Operating cash flow, discretionary cash flow and EBITDAX were $146 million, $150 million and $168 million, respectively. All these financial metrics were lower relative to the third quarter of '14, primarily as a result of a 34% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 54% decline in realized oil prices, which also resulted in a slight loss for the quarter.
Operationally, I'll move to the Marcellus first. Similar to our discussion in the second quarter, we continue to curtail production in the Marcellus during the third quarter due to the weak pricing throughout Appalachia. There are 2 takeaway projects coming online during the fourth quarter that will be beneficial to Cabot. One of which comes online in November, and one that will be in service beginning in December. Our new capacity and long-term sales on these projects will allow Cabot to accelerate production sequentially in the fourth quarter at better price realizations than we are expecting in the local market today. We're cautiously optimistic for an improvement in price realizations in '16 due to the impact of new takeaway capacity coming online over the next few quarters on the demand side and the impact of significant reduction in industry activity on the supply side. Currently, there are only 9 rigs operating in Northeast Pennsylvania compared to 25 rigs this time last year. That's a 64% decline.
On the completion front, there are less than a handful of frac crews working at any point in time. And those crews have moved primarily to daylight operations, which certainly translates into less frac stages being completed per crew. While our price realizations continue to be challenged as we await new infrastructure, our operations continue to exceed expectations with a focus on continuously improving our capital efficiency.
On the drilling side, our team continues to set new records. In the Marcellus, our average spud-to-spud cycle time during the third quarter was 14 days as compared to 18 days in the third quarter of 2014. That's a 22% improvement, despite our average total measured depth increasing by almost 10%. This has resulted in roughly a 25% decrease in drilling cost per lateral foot. Most of these savings are sticky, which means that they're not tied to the current cyclical reduction in service cost. We have 2 rig contracts in the Marcellus expiring at year-end, and we anticipate a significant reduction in day rates going forward, further reducing our drilling cost as we move into '16.
On the completion side, we have continued to see downward pressure on pumping cost in our operations. While we are not currently forecasting another meaningful downward step change in frac cost in '16, I do believe we will see further declines across various service lines, given the current and the anticipated activity levels across Appalachia next year. We're currently operating 3 rigs in the Marcellus. However, we will drop to 2 rigs by the end of this year, with the intention of accelerating our activity levels in the third quarter of '16 in anticipation of the in-service of Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. More on those pipelines later.
In the Eagle Ford, we experienced an 8% sequential decline in liquid volumes, which reflects the impact of our natural decline, since we have reduced the amount of activity in the play due to lower oil prices. To provide context, during the quarter, we completed only 7 wells in the Eagle Ford and only placed 6 wells on production. Our activity -- current activity levels are driven by obligatory lease and operational commitments. We also anticipate a further reduction in activity in the fourth quarter, which will result in a slight sequential decline in liquid volumes for the third to fourth quarter.
On the positive side, operationally, we have continued to see improvements, especially in our drilling operation. This quarter, we experienced another 15% to 20% reduction in drilling costs per lateral foot as compared to the second quarter, which were driven primarily by improving operational efficiencies. Currently, we're drilling our Eagle Ford wells at 30% to 40% faster than our '14 average. Quite an impressive job by the team. We are currently operating 1 rig in the Eagle Ford, and we plan to drop that rig by the end of the second quarter of '16 when the contract expires, unless we see a significant uplift in oil prices during the first half of this next year. Based on this level of activity in '16, we should be able to maintain all of our leasehold while averaging full year liquids production volumes that are flat to our fourth quarter liquid volumes this year.
A Constitution update. Since Constitution's status is likely on everybody's mind, I would like to provide that update, as we highlight some of the significant benefits of this project that I personally believe do not get enough attention and are not fully understood. On the second quarter call, you might recall in July, we outlined the progress Constitution Pipeline had achieved to date, including the filing of the FERC implementation plan, finalizing the route variance and finalizing all the outstanding issues with the New York DEC. We also reported that we were optimistic to begin construction in the fall, and we're still planning on an in-service date in the second half to meet the heating season demand from New York and New England next winter. To be blunt and to the point, we have not received the 401 water quality permit from New York, which is necessary for the mainline construction of the pipeline. There remains a few other outstanding approvals as well, but these issues should fall into place very quickly once New York issues the 401 certificate. Given the continued delay in the issuance of this permit from New York, I do want to take this opportunity to highlight a number of very important significant benefits that the Constitution Pipeline will provide, both during construction and after in-service. First and foremost, job creation and retention. Construction of project is estimated to directly and indirectly create 2,400 jobs and generate about $130 million in labor income to the region. These jobs are high-paying and will utilize the excellent skills of the localized -- local unionized labor force. In fact, Constitution, in conjunction with stocking company, will directly provide natural gas to one of the largest employers in the area. The Ethanol aerospace, plant in Sydney, New York, which employs more than 1,000 unionized employees. In 2011, the state administration committed to ethanol that the plant would have access to natural gas and couple of leaders are on record as stating that access to Constitution Pipeline is a key reason why the plant has chosen to remain in Sydney, New York. Ethanol was awarded $750,000 grant by the Delaware Accounting Industrial Development agency in New York for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Constitution to their facility.
On tax revenues and other significant benefit on the project, once operational, Constitution economic impact is anticipated to result in more than $13 million in annual tax property revenue. This project is practically financed with no government subsidies, tax breaks or incentives. Project will pay millions in annual property tax payments to localities and school districts. Approximately 60% of taxes paid by this project will directly benefit local school districts along the pipeline route.
Third, Constitution Pipeline will link New York State with lower-cost energy New York, as the fourth largest natural gas-consuming state in a country and their consumers currently experience some of the highest rates for natural gas in the United States. Once complete, the pipeline will provide consumers reliable supplies of low-cost energy, addressing one of the key challenges upstate New York faces and remaining competitive with other manufacturing regions. Pipeline will transport enough gas -- natural gas each day to serve about 3 million homes, many of which will be located in New York. Plans are already underway to provide new natural gas services in parts of and Delaware counties, which have never before enjoyed natural gas access. Further delays in issuing the final permit risk to projects 2016 in-service date, which means that New York energy consumers will have to wait another full year to receive the relief from the extraordinarily high energy prices experienced during the winter heating season.
Lastly, this pipeline is consistent with the New York State energy plan. Due to ongoing issues with the end-to-end point nuclear facility, New York needs and alternative fuel source for power generation in the Long Island area. Constitution will connect to core pipeline, gas pipeline which currently serves natural gas, electric generation plants in the same area as end-to-end point. Constitution brings additional capacity for new or expanded gas use for power generation in the state. In fact, Constitution Pipeline will specifically highlighted in the New York State energy plan as critical gas-transmission infrastructure needed to meet New York's expanding energy needs. The state currently utilizes natural gas for over 36% of its electric generation, and the New York State energy plan calls for a 32% increase in natural gas usage, which can help reduce emissions as the state transitions away from the usage of coal and heating oil to cleaner fuels like natural gas. I think you can see how New York State will benefit greatly from Constitution Pipeline. The project is supported by legislators, local officials, unions, business, trade groups, both in New York and throughout New England as well as several New England governors. We look forward to beginning construction of this project as soon as possible. Assuming that Constitution team can begin construction activities in the next few months, we are optimistic that the project can be placed in service during the fourth quarter of '16 in order to help meet the growing natural gas demands in New York.
In the morning's press release, we provided an update of our 2015 guidance as well as initiated preliminary guidance for '16. Based on our anticipated production levels for the fourth quarter, we have adjusted our full year 2015 production guidance to a range of 12% to 14%. This adjustment reflects our price outlook for the fourth quarter and our corresponding decision to continue curtailments on a portion of our production for the remainder of the year, while our fourth quarter volumes are expected to increase 5% sequentially at the midpoint relative to the third quarter. This does imply slight year-over-year decline of the fourth quarter, driven by our strategy to curtail volumes in light of the current price environment. We have also reduced our 2015 capital program to $850 million. The reduced capital program is a result of a reduction in our planned level of activity in the fourth quarter as well as the impact of further cost reductions from improving efficiencies and lower service cost. In addition, we anticipate approximately $35 million of commitments this year associated with the equity ownership in Constitution and in Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. Our preliminary '16 budget was built from the bottom up, with focus on spending within cash flow at recent strip prices while still providing measured growth in '16 and still investing the appropriate amount of growth capital for '17 that allows us to accelerate our production growth into better price points upon in-service of Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise. Our focus on maximizing efficiencies throughout program results in a plan that provides economic wellhead returns, even at our conservative low price assumptions and results in a continued reduction in our unit cost. I will emphasize, however, that this is a preliminary budget based on our current expectations over the next year. And we certainly reserve the right to call of this plan as we monitor the commodity price environment and the approval process in the key takeaway projects we are participating in. We have initiated our preliminary '16 production growth guidance in the range at 2% to 10%. Low end to midpoint assumes that the headwinds on price realizations we're experiencing today persist throughout '16. And we curtail -- continue to curtail a modest portion of our production. While the high end assumes an improvement in price realizations and reflects an uncurtailed production profile without spending any additional capital. This production growth range is based on peak capital budget of $615 million. Additionally, we have approximately $150 million of equity investment in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise planned for next year. Depending on the timing of construction of both these projects, that number could change throughout the year, but currently assumes a fourth quarter 2016 in-service date for our Constitution and a third quarter 2017 in-service date for Atlantic Sunrise. Drilling, completion and facility capital will account for approximately 93% of the capital budget, with approximately 74% allocated to the Marcellus Shale and 26% allocated to the Eagle Ford Shale. In total, we plan to drill approximately 60 net wells in '16 and complete approximately 90 net wells. This level of activity will allow us to meet all of our obligatory drilling and operating commitments remain -- maintain the operating efficiencies throughout the program and sets up -- us up for acceleration of growth into 2017. While we'd be able to hold our Marcellus production volumes flat this next year by only spending approximately $175 million in drilling completion capital, we do -- and we have allocated capital in next year's program that will provide for expanded growth in 2017, assuming Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise remain on the schedule we've outlined, all while generating free cash flow under our conservative price assumptions.
As we continue to focus on improving capital efficiencies, our average planned lateral lengths in our '16 program are approximately 25% longer than the 2015 program at 6,700 feet in the Marcellus and 9,500 feet in the Eagle Ford. The average drilling and completion costs for Cabot's 2016 program of longer laterals and more stages per well as compared to '15, are $6.6 million and $6.3 million for the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, respectively. This represents a drilling completion cost decrease of over 15% on a per-lateral-foot basis relative to our '15 budgeted cost. Based on our budgeted price assumptions, 2016 program generates free cash flow before taking in consideration our pipeline commitments. This assumes a slight improvement year-over-year and the local basis differentials have. We will be closely monitoring the impact of the following on local pricing over the next quarters. New takeaway capacity in Appalachia, a supply-side rationalization from reduced activity levels and the winter demand. The good news is that we have plenty of flexibility in our plan to adopt our program throughout the year the market warrants.
While '16 will be a challenged year, our ability to generate free cash flow from our drilling program at these low commodity prices, while also providing production growth and investing a significant amount of growth capital for '17, speaks to the quality of our assets, our highly efficient operating plan and our historically low cost structure.
With that, Kerry, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

But we have adjusted our capital program as we've gone through '15 to take in consideration curtailment. And so that tweaking of our capital allocation has certainly delayed some of our originally scheduled and budgeted frac stage completions. And we've also amended our direct to the frac crew to initiate only during daylight hours. So we're sliding out some of that activity.

Appreciate you joining us on this third quarter earnings call. I do have the management team gathered with me. And also, as usual, the forward-looking statements included in this morning's release do apply to my comments today.
I would like to touch on upon a couple of financial and operating highlights from the third quarter that were outlined in the release this morning. First, the equivalent net production for the third quarter was 1.544 Bcf -- excuse me, cubic -- billion cubic foot equivalent per day, an increase of 7% as compared to the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date, our production volumes have increased 19% relative to the first 9 months of 2014. Operating cash flow, discretionary cash flow and EBITDAX were $146 million, $150 million and $168 million, respectively. All these financial metrics were lower relative to the third quarter of '14, primarily as a result of a 34% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 54% decline in realized oil prices, which also resulted in a slight loss for the quarter.
Operationally, I'll move to the Marcellus first. Similar to our discussion in the second quarter, we continue to curtail production in the Marcellus during the third quarter due to the weak pricing throughout Appalachia. There are 2 takeaway projects coming online during the fourth quarter that will be beneficial to Cabot. One of which comes online in November and one that will be in service beginning in December. Our new capacity and long-term sales on these projects will allow Cabot to accelerate production sequentially in the fourth quarter at better price realizations than we are expecting in the local market today. We're cautiously optimistic for an improvement in price realizations in '16 due to the impact of new takeaway capacity coming online over the next few quarters on the demand side and the impact of significant reduction in industry activity on the supply side. Currently, there are only 9 rigs operating in Northeast Pennsylvania compared to 25 rigs this time last year. That's a 64% decline.
On the completion front, there are less than a handful of frac crews working at any point in time. And those crews have moved primarily to daylight operations, which certainly translates into less frac stages being completed per crew. While our price realizations continue to be challenged as we await new infrastructure, our operations continue to exceed expectations with a focus on continuously improving our capital efficiency.
On the drilling side, our team continues to set new records. In the Marcellus, our average spud-to-spud cycle time during the third quarter was 14 days as compared to 18 days in the third quarter of 2014. That's a 22% improvement, despite our average total measured depth increasing by almost 10%. This has resulted in roughly a 25% decrease in drilling cost per lateral foot. Most of these savings are sticky, which means that they're not tied to the current cyclical reduction in service costs. We have 2 rig contracts in the Marcellus expiring at year-end, and we anticipate a significant reduction in day rates going forward, further reducing our drilling costs as we move into '16.
On the completion side, we have continued to see downward pressure on pumping costs in our operations. While we are not currently forecasting another meaningful downward step change in frac costs in '16, I do believe we will see further declines across various service lines, given the current and the anticipated activity levels across Appalachia next year. We're currently operating 3 rigs in the Marcellus. However, we will drop to 2 rigs by the end of this year, with the intention of accelerating our activity levels in the third quarter of '16 in anticipation of the in-service of Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. More on those pipelines later.
In the Eagle Ford, we experienced an 8% sequential decline in liquid volumes, which reflects the impact of our natural decline since we have reduced the amount of activity in the play due to lower oil prices. To provide context, during the quarter, we completed only 7 wells in the Eagle Ford and only placed 6 wells on production. Our activity -- current activity levels are driven by obligatory lease and operational commitments. We also anticipate a further reduction in activity in the fourth quarter, which will result in a slight sequential decline in liquid volumes for the third to fourth quarter.
On the positive side, operationally, we have continued to see improvements, especially in our drilling operation. This quarter, we experienced another 15% to 20% reduction in drilling costs per lateral foot as compared to the second quarter, which were driven primarily by improving operational efficiencies. Currently, we're drilling our Eagle Ford wells at 30% to 40% faster than our '14 average. Quite an impressive job by the team. We are currently operating 1 rig in the Eagle Ford, and we plan to drop that rig by the end of the second quarter of '16 when the contract expires, unless we see a significant uplift in oil prices during the first half of this next year. Based on this level of activity in '16, we should be able to maintain all of our leasehold while averaging full year liquids production volumes that are flat to our fourth quarter liquid volumes this year.
A Constitution update. Since Constitution's status is likely on everybody's mind, I would like to provide that update, as we highlight some of the significant benefits of this project that I personally believe do not get enough attention and are not fully understood. On the second quarter call, you might recall in July, we outlined the progress Constitution Pipeline had achieved to date, including the filing of the FERC implementation plan, finalizing the route variance and finalizing all the outstanding issues with the New York DEC. We also reported that we were optimistic to begin construction in the fall, and we're still planning on an in-service date in the second half to meet the heating season demand from New York and New England next winter. 
To be blunt and to the point, we have not received the 401 water quality permit from New York, which is necessary for the mainline construction of the pipeline. There remains a few other outstanding approvals as well, but these issues should fall into place very quickly once New York issues the 401 certificate. 
Given the continued delay in the issuance of this permit from New York, I do want to take this opportunity to highlight a number of very important significant benefits that the Constitution Pipeline will provide, both during construction and after in-service. First and foremost, job creation and retention. Construction of project is estimated to directly and indirectly create 2,400 jobs and generate about $130 million in labor income to the region. These jobs are high-paying and will utilize the excellent skills of the localized -- local unionized labor force. In fact, Constitution, in conjunction with Leatherstocking Gas Company, will directly provide natural gas to one of the largest employers in the area, the Amphenol Aerospace plant in Sidney, New York, which employs more than 1,000 unionized employees. In 2011, the state administration committed to Amphenol that the plant would have access to natural gas and couple of leaders are on record as stating that access to Constitution Pipeline is a key reason why the plant has chosen to remain in Sidney, New York. Amphenol was awarded a $750,000 grant by the Delaware Accounting Industrial Development Agency in New York for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Constitution to their facility
On tax revenues and other significant benefit on the project, once operational, Constitution economic impact is anticipated to result in more than $13 million in annual tax property revenue. This project is practically financed with no government subsidies, tax breaks or incentives. Project will pay millions in annual property tax payments to localities and school districts. Approximately 60% of taxes paid by this project will directly benefit local school districts along the pipeline route.
Third, Constitution Pipeline will link New York State with lower-cost energy New York as the fourth largest natural gas-consuming state in a country, and their consumers currently experience some of the highest rates for natural gas in the United States. Once complete, the pipeline will provide consumers reliable supplies of low-cost energy, addressing one of the key challenges upstate New York faces and remaining competitive with other manufacturing regions. Pipeline will transport enough gas -- natural gas each day to serve about 3 million homes, many of which will be located in New York. Plans are already underway to provide new natural gas services in parts of Broome, Chenango and Delaware counties, which have never before enjoyed natural gas access. Further delays in issuing the final permit risk to projects 2016 in-service date, which means that New York energy consumers will have to wait another full year to receive the relief from the extraordinarily high energy prices experienced during the winter heating season.
Lastly, this pipeline is consistent with the New York State Energy Plan. Due to ongoing issues with the Indian Point nuclear facility, New York needs an alternative fuel source for power generation in the Long Island area. Constitution will connect to  Iroquois pipeline, Gas Pipeline which currently serves natural gas, electric generation plants in the same area as Indian Point. Constitution brings additional capacity for new or expanded gas use for power generation in the state. 
In fact, Constitution Pipeline was specifically highlighted in the New York State Energy Plan as critical gas-transmission infrastructure needed to meet New York's expanding energy needs. The state currently utilizes natural gas for over 36% of its electric generation, and the New York State Energy Plan calls for a 32% increase in natural gas usage, which can help reduce emissions as the state transitions away from the usage of coal and heating oil to cleaner fuels like natural gas. I think you can see how New York State will benefit greatly from Constitution Pipeline. The project is supported by legislators, local officials, unions, business, trade groups both in New York and throughout New England as well as several New England governors. We look forward to beginning construction of this project as soon as possible. Assuming that Constitution team can begin construction activities in the next few months, we are optimistic that the project can be placed in service during the fourth quarter of '16 in order to help meet the growing natural gas demands in New York.
In the morning's press release, we provided an update of our 2015 guidance as well as initiated preliminary guidance for '16. Based on our anticipated production levels for the fourth quarter, we have adjusted our full year 2015 production guidance to a range of 12% to 14%. This adjustment reflects our price outlook for the fourth quarter and our corresponding decision to continue curtailments on a portion of our production for the remainder of the year. While our fourth quarter volumes are expected to increase 5% sequentially at the midpoint relative to the third quarter, this does imply slight year-over-year decline of the fourth quarter, driven by our strategy to curtail volumes in light of the current price environment. We have also reduced our 2015 capital program to $850 million. The reduced capital program is the result of a reduction in our planned level of activity in the fourth quarter as well as the impact of further cost reductions from improving efficiencies and lower service costs. In addition, we anticipate approximately $35 million of commitments this year associated with the equity ownership in Constitution and in Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. 
Our preliminary '16 budget was built from the bottom up, with a focus on spending within cash flow at recent strip prices while still providing measured growth in '16 and still investing the appropriate amount of growth capital for '17 that allows us to accelerate our production growth into better price points upon in-service of Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise. Our focus on maximizing efficiencies throughout program results in a plan that provides economic wellhead returns, even at our conservative low price assumptions and results in a continued reduction in our unit cost. I will emphasize, however, that this is a preliminary budget based on our current expectations over the next year, and we certainly reserve the right to call an audible on this plan as we monitor the commodity price environment and the approval process in the key takeaway projects we are participating in. 
We have initiated our preliminary '16 production growth guidance in the range at 2% to 10%. Low end to midpoint assumes that the headwinds on price realizations we're experiencing today persist throughout '16, and we curtail -- continue to curtail a modest portion of our production while the high end assumes an improvement in price realizations and reflects an uncurtailed production profile without spending any additional capital. This production growth range is based on E&P capital budget of $615 million. Additionally, we have approximately $150 million of equity investment in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise planned for next year. 
Depending on the timing of construction of both these projects, that number could change throughout the year, but currently assumes a fourth quarter 2016 in-service date for our Constitution and a third quarter 2017 in-service date for Atlantic Sunrise. 
Drilling, completion and facility capital will account for approximately 93% of the capital budget, with approximately 74% allocated to the Marcellus Shale and 26% allocated to the Eagle Ford Shale. In total, we plan to drill approximately 60 net wells in '16 and complete approximately 90 net wells. This level of activity will allow us to meet all of our obligatory drilling and operating commitments remain -- maintain the operating efficiencies throughout the program and sets up -- us up for acceleration of growth into 2017. While we'd be able to hold our Marcellus production volumes flat this next year by only spending approximately $175 million in drilling completion capital, we do -- and we have allocated capital in next year's program that will provide for expanded growth in 2017, assuming Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise remain on the schedule we've outlined, all while generating free cash flow under our conservative price assumptions.
As we continue to focus on improving capital efficiencies, our average planned lateral lengths in our '16 program are approximately 25% longer than the 2015 program at 6,700 feet in the Marcellus and 9,500 feet in the Eagle Ford. The average drilling and completion costs  for Cabot's 2016 program of longer laterals and more stages per well as compared to '15 are $6.6 million and $6.3 million for the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, respectively. This represents a drilling completion cost decrease of over 15% on a per-lateral-foot basis relative to our '15 budgeted cost. 
Based on our budgeted price assumptions, 2016 program generates free cash flow before taking in consideration our pipeline commitments. This assumes a slight improvement year-over-year in the local basis differentials have. We will be closely monitoring the impact of the following items on local pricing over the next quarters: new takeaway capacity in Appalachia, a supply-side rationalization from reduced activity levels and the winter demand. The good news is that we have plenty of flexibility in our plan to adopt our program throughout the year the market warrants.
While '16 will be a challenged year, our ability to generate free cash flow from our drilling program at these low commodity prices, while also providing production growth and investing a significant amount of growth capital for '17, speaks to the quality of our assets, our highly efficient operating plan and our historically low cost structure.
With that, Kerry, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

And keep in mind that in regard to curtailed volumes, we might get the question in regard to how much you shut in and what ability you have to be able to move incremental volumes. But we have adjusted our capital program as we've gone through '15 to take in consideration curtailment. And so that tweaking of our capital allocation has certainly delayed some of our originally scheduled and budgeted frac stage completions. And we've also amended our directives to the frac crew to initiate only during daylight hours. So we're sliding out some of that activity. So as we roll through the year and the amount of activity we're conducting right now and the various swings that we have through our marketing group on a month-to-month on what we're moving, that curtailed volume is a variable number, if you will."

Appreciate you joining us on this third quarter earnings call. I do have the management team gathered with me.

Appreciate you joining us on this third quarter earnings call. I do have the management team gathered with me. And also, as usual, the forward-looking statements included in this morning's release do apply to my comments today.
I would like to touch on upon a couple of financial and operating highlights from the third quarter that were outlined in the release this morning. First, the equivalent net production for the third quarter was 1.544 Bcf -- excuse me, cubic -- billion cubic foot equivalent per day, an increase of 7% as compared to the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date, our production volumes have increased 19% relative to the first 9 months of 2014. Operating cash flow, discretionary cash flow and EBITDAX were $146 million, $150 million and $168 million, respectively. All these financial metrics were lower relative to the third quarter of '14, primarily as a result of a 34% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 54% decline in realized oil prices, which also resulted in a slight loss for the quarter.
Operationally, I'll move to the Marcellus first. Similar to our discussion in the second quarter, we continue to curtail production in the Marcellus during the third quarter due to the weak pricing throughout Appalachia. There are 2 takeaway projects coming online during the fourth quarter that will be beneficial to Cabot. One of which comes online in November and one that will be in service beginning in December. Our new capacity and long-term sales on these projects will allow Cabot to accelerate production sequentially in the fourth quarter at better price realizations than we are expecting in the local market today. We're cautiously optimistic for an improvement in price realizations in '16 due to the impact of new takeaway capacity coming online over the next few quarters on the demand side and the impact of significant reduction in industry activity on the supply side. Currently, there are only 9 rigs operating in Northeast Pennsylvania compared to 25 rigs this time last year. That's a 64% decline.
On the completion front, there are less than a handful of frac crews working at any point in time. And those crews have moved primarily to daylight operations, which certainly translates into less frac stages being completed per crew. While our price realizations continue to be challenged as we await new infrastructure, our operations continue to exceed expectations with a focus on continuously improving our capital efficiency.
On the drilling side, our team continues to set new records. In the Marcellus, our average spud-to-spud cycle time during the third quarter was 14 days as compared to 18 days in the third quarter of 2014. That's a 22% improvement, despite our average total measured depth increasing by almost 10%. This has resulted in roughly a 25% decrease in drilling cost per lateral foot. Most of these savings are sticky, which means that they're not tied to the current cyclical reduction in service costs. We have 2 rig contracts in the Marcellus expiring at year-end, and we anticipate a significant reduction in day rates going forward, further reducing our drilling costs as we move into '16.
On the completion side, we have continued to see downward pressure on pumping costs in our operations. While we are not currently forecasting another meaningful downward step change in frac costs in '16, I do believe we will see further declines across various service lines, given the current and the anticipated activity levels across Appalachia next year. We're currently operating 3 rigs in the Marcellus. However, we will drop to 2 rigs by the end of this year, with the intention of accelerating our activity levels in the third quarter of '16 in anticipation of the in-service of Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. More on those pipelines later.
In the Eagle Ford, we experienced an 8% sequential decline in liquid volumes, which reflects the impact of our natural decline since we have reduced the amount of activity in the play due to lower oil prices. To provide context, during the quarter, we completed only 7 wells in the Eagle Ford and only placed 6 wells on production. Our activity -- current activity levels are driven by obligatory lease and operational commitments. We also anticipate a further reduction in activity in the fourth quarter, which will result in a slight sequential decline in liquid volumes for the third to fourth quarter.
On the positive side, operationally, we have continued to see improvements, especially in our drilling operation. This quarter, we experienced another 15% to 20% reduction in drilling costs per lateral foot as compared to the second quarter, which were driven primarily by improving operational efficiencies. Currently, we're drilling our Eagle Ford wells at 30% to 40% faster than our '14 average. Quite an impressive job by the team. We are currently operating 1 rig in the Eagle Ford, and we plan to drop that rig by the end of the second quarter of '16 when the contract expires, unless we see a significant uplift in oil prices during the first half of this next year. Based on this level of activity in '16, we should be able to maintain all of our leasehold while averaging full year liquids production volumes that are flat to our fourth quarter liquid volumes this year.
A Constitution update. Since Constitution's status is likely on everybody's mind, I would like to provide that update, as we highlight some of the significant benefits of this project that I personally believe do not get enough attention and are not fully understood. On the second quarter call, you might recall in July, we outlined the progress Constitution Pipeline had achieved to date, including the filing of the FERC implementation plan, finalizing the route variance and finalizing all the outstanding issues with the New York DEC. We also reported that we were optimistic to begin construction in the fall, and we're still planning on an in-service date in the second half to meet the heating season demand from New York and New England next winter. 
To be blunt and to the point, we have not received the 401 water quality permit from New York, which is necessary for the mainline construction of the pipeline. There remains a few other outstanding approvals as well, but these issues should fall into place very quickly once New York issues the 401 certificate. 
Given the continued delay in the issuance of this permit from New York, I do want to take this opportunity to highlight a number of very important significant benefits that the Constitution Pipeline will provide, both during construction and after in-service. First and foremost, job creation and retention. Construction of project is estimated to directly and indirectly create 2,400 jobs and generate about $130 million in labor income to the region. These jobs are high-paying and will utilize the excellent skills of the localized -- local unionized labor force. In fact, Constitution, in conjunction with Leatherstocking Gas Company, will directly provide natural gas to one of the largest employers in the area, the Amphenol Aerospace plant in Sidney, New York, which employs more than 1,000 unionized employees. In 2011, the state administration committed to Amphenol that the plant would have access to natural gas and company leaders are on record as stating that access to Constitution Pipeline is a key reason why the plant has chosen to remain in Sidney, New York. Amphenol was awarded a $750,000 grant by the Delaware Accounting Industrial Development Agency in New York for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Constitution to their facility.
On tax revenues and other significant benefit on the project, once operational, Constitution economic impact is anticipated to result in more than $13 million in annual tax property revenue. This project is practically financed with no government subsidies, tax breaks or incentives. Project will pay millions in annual property tax payments to localities and school districts. Approximately 60% of taxes paid by this project will directly benefit local school districts along the pipeline route.
Third, Constitution Pipeline will link New York State with lower-cost energy New York as the fourth largest natural gas-consuming state in a country, and their consumers currently experience some of the highest rates for natural gas in the United States. Once complete, the pipeline will provide consumers reliable supplies of low-cost energy, addressing one of the key challenges upstate New York faces and remaining competitive with other manufacturing regions. Pipeline will transport enough gas -- natural gas each day to serve about 3 million homes, many of which will be located in New York. Plans are already underway to provide new natural gas services in parts of Broome, Chenango and Delaware counties, which have never before enjoyed natural gas access. Further delays in issuing the final permit risk to projects 2016 in-service date, which means that New York energy consumers will have to wait another full year to receive the relief from the extraordinarily high energy prices experienced during the winter heating season.
Lastly, this pipeline is consistent with the New York State Energy Plan. Due to ongoing issues with the Indian Point nuclear facility, New York needs an alternative fuel source for power generation in the Long Island area. Constitution will connect to  Iroquois pipeline, Gas Pipeline which currently serves natural gas, electric generation plants in the same area as Indian Point. Constitution brings additional capacity for new or expanded gas use for power generation in the state. 
In fact, Constitution Pipeline was specifically highlighted in the New York State Energy Plan as critical gas-transmission infrastructure needed to meet New York's expanding energy needs. The state currently utilizes natural gas for over 36% of its electric generation, and the New York State Energy Plan calls for a 32% increase in natural gas usage, which can help reduce emissions as the state transitions away from the usage of coal and heating oil to cleaner fuels like natural gas. I think you can see how New York State will benefit greatly from Constitution Pipeline. The project is supported by legislators, local officials, unions, business, trade groups both in New York and throughout New England as well as several New England governors. We look forward to beginning construction of this project as soon as possible. Assuming that Constitution team can begin construction activities in the next few months, we are optimistic that the project can be placed in service during the fourth quarter of '16 in order to help meet the growing natural gas demands in New York.
In the morning's press release, we provided an update of our 2015 guidance as well as initiated preliminary guidance for '16. Based on our anticipated production levels for the fourth quarter, we have adjusted our full year 2015 production guidance to a range of 12% to 14%. This adjustment reflects our price outlook for the fourth quarter and our corresponding decision to continue curtailments on a portion of our production for the remainder of the year. While our fourth quarter volumes are expected to increase 5% sequentially at the midpoint relative to the third quarter, this does imply slight year-over-year decline of the fourth quarter, driven by our strategy to curtail volumes in light of the current price environment. We have also reduced our 2015 capital program to $850 million. The reduced capital program is the result of a reduction in our planned level of activity in the fourth quarter as well as the impact of further cost reductions from improving efficiencies and lower service costs. In addition, we anticipate approximately $35 million of commitments this year associated with the equity ownership in Constitution and in Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. 
Our preliminary '16 budget was built from the bottom up, with a focus on spending within cash flow at recent strip prices while still providing measured growth in '16 and still investing the appropriate amount of growth capital for '17 that allows us to accelerate our production growth into better price points upon in-service of Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise. Our focus on maximizing efficiencies throughout the program results in a plan that provides economic wellhead returns, even at our conservative low price assumptions and results in a continued reduction in our unit cost. I will emphasize, however, that this is a preliminary budget based on our current expectations over the next year, and we certainly reserve the right to call an audible on this plan as we monitor the commodity price environment and the approval process in the key takeaway projects we are participating in. 
We have initiated our preliminary '16 production growth guidance in the range at 2% to 10%. Low end to midpoint assumes that the headwinds on price realizations we're experiencing today persist throughout '16, and we curtail -- continue to curtail a modest portion of our production while the high end assumes an improvement in price realizations and reflects an uncurtailed production profile without spending any additional capital. This production growth range is based on E&P capital budget of $615 million. Additionally, we have approximately $150 million of equity investment in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise planned for next year. 
Depending on the timing of construction of both these projects, that number could change throughout the year, but currently assumes a fourth quarter 2016 in-service date for our Constitution and a third quarter 2017 in-service date for Atlantic Sunrise. 
Drilling, completion and facility capital will account for approximately 93% of the capital budget, with approximately 74% allocated to the Marcellus Shale and 26% allocated to the Eagle Ford Shale. In total, we plan to drill approximately 60 net wells in '16 and complete approximately 90 net wells. This level of activity will allow us to meet all of our obligatory drilling and operating commitments remain -- maintain the operating efficiencies throughout the program and sets up -- us up for acceleration of growth into 2017. While we'd be able to hold our Marcellus production volumes flat this next year by only spending approximately $175 million in drilling completion capital, we do -- and we have allocated capital in next year's program that will provide for expanded growth in 2017, assuming Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise remain on the schedule we've outlined, all while generating free cash flow under our conservative price assumptions.
As we continue to focus on improving capital efficiencies, our average planned lateral lengths in our '16 program are approximately 25% longer than the 2015 program at 6,700 feet in the Marcellus and 9,500 feet in the Eagle Ford. The average drilling and completion costs for Cabot's 2016 program of longer laterals and more stages per well as compared to '15 are $6.6 million and $6.3 million for the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, respectively. This represents a drilling completion cost decrease of over 15% on a per-lateral-foot basis relative to our '15 budgeted cost. 
Based on our budgeted price assumptions, 2016 program generates free cash flow before taking in consideration our pipeline commitments. This assumes a slight improvement year-over-year in the local basis differentials have. We will be closely monitoring the impact of the following items on local pricing over the next quarters: new takeaway capacity in Appalachia, a supply-side rationalization from reduced activity levels and the winter demand. The good news is that we have plenty of flexibility in our plan to adopt our program throughout the year the market warrants.
While '16 will be a challenged year, our ability to generate free cash flow from our drilling program at these low commodity prices, while also providing production growth and investing a significant amount of growth capital for '17, speaks to the quality of our assets, our highly efficient operating plan and our historically low cost structure.
With that, Kerry, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

And keep in mind that in regard to curtailed volumes, we might get the question in regard to how much you shut in and what ability you have to be able to move incremental volumes. But we have adjusted our capital program as we've gone through '15 to take in consideration curtailment. And so that tweaking of our capital allocation has certainly delayed some of our originally scheduled and budgeted frac stage completions. And we've also amended our directives to the frac crew to initiate only during daylight hours. So we're sliding out some of that activity. So as we roll through the year and the amount of activity we're conducting right now and the various swings that we have through our marketing group on a month-to-month on what we're moving, that curtailed volume is a variable number, if you will."

I appreciate you joining us on this third quarter earnings call. I do have the management team gathered with me.

I appreciate you joining us on this third quarter earnings call. I do have the management team gathered with me. And also, as usual, the forward-looking statements included in this morning's release do apply to my comments today.
I would like to touch on upon a couple of financial and operating highlights from the third quarter that were outlined in the release this morning. First, the equivalent net production for the third quarter was 1.544 Bcf -- excuse me, cubic -- billion cubic foot equivalent per day, an increase of 7% as compared to the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date, our production volumes have increased 19% relative to the first 9 months of 2014. Operating cash flow, discretionary cash flow and EBITDAX were $146 million, $150 million and $168 million, respectively. All these financial metrics were lower relative to the third quarter of '14, primarily as a result of a 34% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 54% decline in realized oil prices, which also resulted in a slight loss for the quarter.
Operationally, I'll move to the Marcellus first. Similar to our discussion in the second quarter, we continue to curtail production in the Marcellus during the third quarter due to the weak pricing throughout Appalachia. There are 2 takeaway projects coming online during the fourth quarter that will be beneficial to Cabot; one of which comes online in November and one that will be in service beginning in December. Our new capacity and long-term sales on these projects will allow Cabot to accelerate production sequentially in the fourth quarter at better price realizations than we are expecting in the local market today. We're cautiously optimistic for an improvement in price realizations in '16 due to the impact of new takeaway capacity coming online over the next few quarters on the demand side and the impact of significant reduction in industry activity on the supply side. Currently, there are only 9 rigs operating in Northeast Pennsylvania compared to 25 rigs this time last year. That's a 64% decline.
On the completion front, there are less than a handful of frac crews working at any point in time. And those crews have moved primarily to daylight operations, which certainly translates into less frac stages being completed per crew. While our price realizations continue to be challenged as we await new infrastructure, our operations continue to exceed expectations with a focus on continuously improving our capital efficiency.
On the drilling side, our team continues to set new records. In the Marcellus, our average spud-to-spud cycle time during the third quarter was 14 days as compared to 18 days in the third quarter of 2014. That's a 22% improvement, despite our average total measured depth increasing by almost 10%. This has resulted in roughly a 25% decrease in drilling cost per lateral foot. Most of these savings are sticky, which means that they're not tied to the current cyclical reduction in service costs. We have 2 rig contracts in the Marcellus expiring at year-end, and we anticipate a significant reduction in day rates going forward, further reducing our drilling costs as we move into '16.
On the completion side, we have continued to see downward pressure on pumping costs in our operations. While we are not currently forecasting another meaningful downward step change in frac costs in '16, I do believe we will see further declines across various service lines, given the current and the anticipated activity levels across Appalachia next year. We're currently operating 3 rigs in the Marcellus. However, we will drop to 2 rigs by the end of this year, with the intention of accelerating our activity levels in the third quarter of '16 in anticipation of the in-service of Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. More on those pipelines later.
In the Eagle Ford, we experienced an 8% sequential decline in liquid volumes, which reflects the impact of our natural decline since we have reduced the amount of activity in the play due to lower oil prices. To provide context, during the quarter, we completed only 7 wells in the Eagle Ford and only placed 6 wells on production. Our activity -- current activity levels are driven by obligatory lease and operational commitments. We also anticipate a further reduction in activity in the fourth quarter, which will result in a slight sequential decline in liquid volumes for the third to fourth quarter.
On the positive side, operationally, we have continued to see improvements, especially in our drilling operation. This quarter, we experienced another 15% to 20% reduction in drilling costs per lateral foot as compared to the second quarter, which were driven primarily by improving operational efficiencies. Currently, we're drilling our Eagle Ford wells at 30% to 40% faster than our '14 average. Quite an impressive job by the team. We are currently operating one rig in the Eagle Ford, and we plan to drop that rig by the end of the second quarter of '16 when the contract expires, unless we see a significant uplift in oil prices during the first half of this next year. Based on this level of activity in '16, we should be able to maintain all of our leasehold while averaging full year liquids production volumes that are flat to our fourth quarter liquid volumes this year.
A Constitution update. Since Constitution's status is likely on everybody's mind, I would like to provide that update, as we highlight some of the significant benefits of this project that I personally believe do not get enough attention and are not fully understood. On second quarter call, you might recall in July, we outlined the progress Constitution Pipeline had achieved to date, including the filing of the FERC implementation plan, finalizing the route variance and finalizing all the outstanding issues with the New York DEC. We also reported that we were optimistic to begin construction in the fall, and we're still planning on an in-service date in the second half to meet the heating season demand from New York and New England next winter. 
To be blunt and to the point, we have not received the 401 water quality permit from New York, which is necessary for the mainline construction of the pipeline. There remains a few other outstanding approvals as well, but these issues should fall into place very quickly once New York issues the 401 certificate. 
Given the continued delay in the issuance of this permit from New York, I do want to take this opportunity to highlight a number of very important significant benefits that the Constitution Pipeline will provide, both during construction and after in-service. First and foremost, job creation and retention. The construction of project is estimated to directly and indirectly create 2,400 jobs and generate about $130 million in labor income to the region. These jobs are high-paying and will utilize the excellent skills of the localized -- local unionized labor force. In fact, Constitution, in conjunction with Leatherstocking Gas Company, will directly provide natural gas to one of the largest employers in the area, the Amphenol Aerospace plant in Sidney, New York, which employs more than 1,000 unionized employees. In 2011, the state administration committed to Amphenol that the plant would have access to natural gas and company leaders are on record as stating that access to Constitution Pipeline is a key reason why the plant has chosen to remain in Sidney, New York. Amphenol was awarded a $750,000 grant by the Delaware County Industrial Development Agency in New York for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Constitution to their facility.
On tax revenues and other significant benefit on the project, once operational, Constitution economic impact is anticipated to result in more than $13 million in annual tax property revenue. This project is practically financed with no government subsidies, tax breaks or incentives. Project will pay millions in annual property tax payments to localities and school districts. Approximately 60% of taxes paid by this project will directly benefit local school districts along the pipeline route.
Third, Constitution Pipeline will link New York State with lower-cost energy. New York is the fourth largest natural gas-consuming state in a country, and their consumers currently experience some of the highest rates for natural gas in the United States. Once complete, the pipeline will provide consumers reliable supplies of low-cost energy, addressing one of the key challenges upstate New York faces and remaining competitive with other manufacturing regions. Pipeline will transport enough gas -- natural gas each day to serve about 3 million homes, many of which will be located in New York. Plans are already underway to provide new natural gas services in parts of Broome, Chenango and Delaware counties, which have never before enjoyed natural gas access. Further delays in issuing the final permit risk the project’s 2016 in-service date, which means that New York energy consumers will have to wait another full year to receive the relief from the extraordinarily high energy prices experienced during the winter heating season.
Lastly, this pipeline is consistent with the New York State Energy Plan. Due to ongoing issues with the Indian Point nuclear facility, New York needs an alternative fuel source for power generation in the Long Island area. Constitution will connect to Iroquois pipeline, gas Pipeline which currently serves natural gas, electric generation plants in the same area as Indian Point. Constitution brings additional capacity for new or expanded gas use for power generation in the state. 
In fact, Constitution Pipeline was specifically highlighted in the New York State Energy Plan as critical gas-transmission infrastructure needed to meet New York's expanding energy needs. The state currently utilizes natural gas for over 36% of its electric generation, and the New York State Energy Plan calls for a 32% increase in natural gas usage, which can help reduce emissions as the state transitions away from the usage of coal and heating oil to cleaner fuels like natural gas. I think you can see how New York State will benefit greatly from Constitution Pipeline. The project is supported by legislators, local officials, unions, business, trade groups, both in New York and throughout New England as well as several New England governors. We look forward to beginning construction of this project as soon as possible. Assuming that Constitution team can begin construction activities in the next few months, we are optimistic that the project can be placed in service during the fourth quarter of '16 in order to help meet the growing natural gas demands in New York.
In the morning's press release, we provided an update of our 2015 guidance as well as initiated preliminary guidance for '16. Based on our anticipated production levels for the fourth quarter, we have adjusted our full year 2015 production guidance to a range of 12% to 14%. This adjustment reflects our price outlook for the fourth quarter and our corresponding decision to continue curtailments on a portion of our production for the remainder of the year. While our fourth quarter volumes are expected to increase 5% sequentially at the midpoint relative to the third quarter, this does imply slight year-over-year decline of the fourth quarter, driven by our strategy to curtail volumes in light of the current price environment. We have also reduced our 2015 capital program to $850 million. The reduced capital program is the result of a reduction in our planned level of activity in the fourth quarter as well as the impact of further cost reductions from improving efficiencies and lower service costs. In addition, we anticipate approximately $35 million of commitments this year associated with the equity ownership in Constitution and in Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. 
Our preliminary '16 budget was built from the bottom up, with a focus on spending within cash flow at recent strip prices while still providing measured growth in '16 and still investing the appropriate amount of growth capital for '17 that allows us to accelerate our production growth into better price points upon in-service of Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise. Our focus on maximizing efficiencies throughout the program results in a plan that provides economic wellhead returns, even at our conservative low price assumptions and results in a continued reduction in our unit cost. I will emphasize, however, that this is a preliminary budget based on our current expectations over the next year, and we certainly reserve the right to call an audible on this plan as we monitor the commodity price environment and the approval process in the key takeaway projects we are participating in. 
We have initiated our preliminary '16 production growth guidance in the range at 2% to 10%. Low end to midpoint assumes that the headwinds on price realizations we're experiencing today persist throughout '16, and we curtail -- continue to curtail a modest portion of our production while the high end assumes an improvement in price realizations and reflects an uncurtailed production profile without spending any additional capital. This production growth range is based on E&P capital budget of $615 million. Additionally, we have approximately $150 million of equity investment in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise planned for next year. 
Depending on the timing of construction of both these projects, that number could change throughout the year, but currently assumes a fourth quarter 2016 in-service date for our Constitution and a third quarter 2017 in-service date for Atlantic Sunrise. 
Drilling, completion and facility capital will account for approximately 93% of the capital budget, with approximately 74% allocated to the Marcellus Shale and 26% allocated to the Eagle Ford Shale. In total, we plan to drill approximately 60 net wells in '16 and complete approximately 90 net wells. This level of activity will allow us to meet all of our obligatory drilling and operating commitments remain -- maintain the operating efficiencies throughout the program and sets up -- us up for acceleration of growth into 2017. While we'd be able to hold our Marcellus production volumes flat this next year by only spending approximately $175 million in drilling completion capital, we do -- and we have allocated capital in next year's program that will provide for expanded growth in 2017, assuming Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise remain on the schedule we've outlined, all while generating free cash flow under our conservative price assumptions.
As we continue to focus on improving capital efficiencies, our average plan lateral lengths in our '16 program are approximately 25% longer than the 2015 program at 6,700 feet in the Marcellus and 9,500 feet in the Eagle Ford. The average drilling and completion costs for Cabot's 2016 program of longer laterals and more stages per well as compared to '15 are $6.6 million and $6.3 million for the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, respectively. This represents a drilling completion cost decrease of over 15% on a per-lateral-foot basis relative to our '15 budgeted cost. 
Based on our budgeted price assumptions, 2016 program generates free cash flow before taking in consideration our pipeline commitments. This assumes a slight improvement year-over-year in the local basis differentials have. We will be closely monitoring the impact of the following items on local pricing over the next quarters: new takeaway capacity in Appalachia, a supply-side rationalization from reduced activity levels and the winter demand. The good news is that we have plenty of flexibility in our plan to adopt our program throughout the year the market warrants.
While '16 will be a challenged year, our ability to generate free cash flow from our drilling program at these low commodity prices, while also providing production growth and investing a significant amount of growth capital for '17, speaks to the quality of our assets, our highly efficient operating plan and our historically low cost structure.
With that, Kerry, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

But we have adjusted our capital program as we've gone through '15 to take in consideration curtailment. And so that tweaking of our capital allocation has certainly delayed some of our originally scheduled and budgeted frac stage completions. And we've also amended our directives to the frac crew to initiate only during daylight hours. So we're sliding out some of that activity.

Because there's obviously not a whole lot of capital required to keep your production flat. But as you're looking at this multiyear progression, the ramping into what would be required for Atlantic Sunrise as well, if by some measure we end up thinking that Constitution is going to come online materially later than anticipated, is there some downside to that '16 CapEx number?"

Yes, we would manage that -- yes, we would manage that allocation of capital, and we certainly do not want to have capital sitting out in the field that we can't monetize. So we would probably reduce our exposure or reduce our capital until the appropriate time that we could plan for the commissioning of the pipeline if we were to see a significant delay in the commissioning. But I would have expected the approval to occur on Constitution prior to this time. However, I'm not disillusioned to the extent that we don't expect it to come in a timely manner for '16's estimated commissioning."

But on Constitution, we have been years in discussions, preparation and have fulfilled all of the requests, all the mitigating factors, all of the hurdles that have been brought by the interested parties, including the New York DEC. We have added, certainly, the -- some of the mitigating factors added incremental cost to the project. We had a major reroute of the -- that was fine with Constitution to mitigate the -- any watershed issues. And in fact, by that reroute, we improved what we think was any impact. And we have, again, on stream crossings, have an extensive plan in place that mitigates any of the concerns about stream crossings. And that has been well documented by the DEC and now has been prepared into a final document. So I think everybody's pleased with that effort. Atlantic Sunrise is in that same process now and having discussions for the mitigation factors and looking at the right ways to be able to mitigate any concerns that any stakeholders might have at that stage.

Probably, the biggest difference on the 2 projects, besides just the learning curve aspect of the second project, is the route on the greenfield portion of Atlantic Sunrise is totally in the state of Pennsylvania, where we have a long history working with the DEP and with the FERC. And so I think from a just a simpler project aspect, it's gone smoother so far. I mean, the community outreach portion of the project's been very successful. The survey permissions and the right-of-way acquisition's been very successful to date. Project is on schedule. And we're -- at this point in time, we look very good in terms of hitting the in-service date."
