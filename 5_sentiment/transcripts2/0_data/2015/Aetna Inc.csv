Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported full year 2014 operating EPS of $6.70, representing a record result for the company, the high-end of our previous annual projection, year-over-year growth in",1507,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported full year 2014 operating EPS of $6.70, representing a record result for the company, the high-end of our previous annual projection, year-over-year growth in excess of 7% and an operating EPS CAGR of 15% since 2010. 
Looking back on 2014. We solved or priced for nearly $1 billion of new fees and taxes; achieved pretax margins in excess of our initial 2014 projections; accelerated Coventry synergies, achieving a run rate in 2014 that will deliver at least $0.90 of operating EPS accretion in 2015; closing out our commitments to shareholders; enrolled nearly 600,000 public exchange members, while exceeding our initial profitability projections in this new program; bolstered our consumer platform through the acquisition of BSwift; and continue to advance our efforts to ship the network model for patient-centric population health management. Our 2014 results are a testament to the strength of our leadership team and the execution of our growth strategy. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with more than 23.5 million medical members, well in excess of our previous projections and representing full year growth of approximately 1.4 million members. We reported record operating revenue of nearly $58 billion, including organic growth of approximately 13% across multiple lines of business. We reported a full year commercial medical benefit ratio, that absent our conservative stance on our ACA-compliant blocks of business and higher-than-projected flu, would have been at the lower end of our previous 2014 projections. Our full year Commercial benefit ratio of 80.2% was a very good result, as aggregate Commercial medical cost trend increases remain moderate, and our 51 to 300 employee block perform consistent with our previous projections. Our operating expense ratio, excluding the impact of Health Care Reform, fees and taxes, improved by 100 basis points, as we grew operating revenue and continue to focus on synergy realization. Finally, we generated strong cash flow in 2014, which enabled us to continue to invest in our growth strategy, closed 2 acquisitions, pay down debt, increase our shareholder dividend and still repurchase $1.2 billion of our shares. Our strong finish to 2014, in combination with our strong start to 2015, gives us the confidence this morning to increase our 2015 operating EPS projection to at least $7 per share. As always, this projection does not include any projection of prior year development and represents approximately 13% growth over 2014 results when prior year development is excluded. 
In a moment, sean will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to discuss Aetna's growth strategy and how we are executing on that strategy. At our Investor Conference in December, we highlighted the multiple avenues we have to drive top and bottom line growth. Specifically, we discussed the stability of our Large Group Commercial businesses and the ability of these businesses to continue to produce attractive returns and generate capital, the growth of our Government franchise and the potential for sustained growth in the future and the opportunity for additional growth in our Individual business as exchanges continue to evolve. Additionally, we discussed our continued efforts to help Aetna to transform model for one of episodic care to population health management and our strategy to lead the industry toward a more consumer-oriented marketplace. 
I will now provide a brief update on how we're executing against some of these growth levers. Starting with our Large Group Commercial business. 2014 was another solid year, as most of our Large Group Commercial businesses met or exceeded our initial projections. In particular, our fee-based businesses had an outstanding year. We grew Commercial ASC membership by over 700,000 members for the year and exceeded our initial operating projection. These results demonstrate the ability of our Large Group Commercial businesses to continue to generate solid returns and to provide capital to reinvest for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. 
Moving on to Government business. Our Medicare franchise continues to be a key component of our strategy to grow our Government business, and our 2014 results speak to our successes in this business. During 2014, we grew our Medicare Advantage membership by almost 18% and our Medicare Supplement membership by nearly 20%, results that are well in excess of our industry growth. Additionally, we just completed another highly successful Medicare annual enrollment period, where growth exceeded our initial projections. We now project to grow our Medicare Advantage membership by 90,000 members in the first quarter, including double-digit percentage growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage membership. A key driver of Aetna's Medicare Advantage membership growth trajectory has been our star ratings. And for the second year in a row, approximately 80% of our sales have come through plans rated 4 stars or greater. 
Continuing with Government. Our Medicaid business has had an excellent year in 2014, including over 11,000 members related to our participation in multiple dual-eligible demonstration projects. We grew premium revenue by over 60%, and operating earnings exceeded our initial projections, driven by better underwriting margins in several of our key geographies and a strong prior year development. Looking forward, despite the previously disclosed exit from our Delaware Medicaid contract, we project 2015 to be another strong year of top line growth for our Medicaid franchise, driven primarily by growth from serving dual-eligible and other high-acuity populations. 
Shifting to public exchanges. We are pleased with our first year execution, particularly in light of the well-publicized challenges with the initial launch of the public exchanges. We ended the year with approximately 560,000 on-exchange members, modestly ahead of our most recent projections. Additionally, while the opening enrollment period is still ongoing, we are on track to exceed our initial enrollment projections for 2015. Further, we have successfully transitioned the vast majority of our off-exchange membership to ACA-compliant plans, consistent with our previous projections. As we look at our total Individual business, we now project that we will end the first quarter with approximately 1.1 million members, including up to 800,000 on-exchange members. We believe the strong results validate our strategy are focusing on geographies where we have a competitive cost structure and can provide the greatest value to potential customers. As we entered the second year of this emerging marketplace, we are cautiously optimistic on the potential for public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity, where we continue to offer value to our customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders. 
Let me now spend a few moments discussing our provider transformation efforts. We continue to advance our strategy of collaborating with providers to build a simpler, more integrated health care system, and we continue to make great strides as we: signed contracts with 28 new ACL partners since year-end 2013; launched multiple new products backed by ACL contracts; doubled our members covered by value-based contracts to more than 3 million members; and increased the percentage of our medical cost that run through value-based contract to 28% of total spend. As we continue to focus incentives around improving the health of our members and lowering overall costs, we are moving closer to a health care system that rewards providers for keeping people healthy and ultimately more productive. 
Finally, in 2014, we continue to advance our strategy to become a more consumer-oriented company. For example, in the fourth quarter, we closed the BSwift acquisition. This transaction was an important step forward as it accelerates our efforts to create the leading front-end buy, shop and enroll capabilities necessary to drive the change through a more consumer-oriented marketplace. Additionally, BSwift adds back-end eligibility and benefits administration, an important element for our employer customers as they look to make the transition to define contribution and private exchange models. Combined with the other investments we have been making, including our efforts to transform the provider network model through our health business, our investments in building a new modular administration platform, and consumer-facing tools like I Triage, we are not only preparing for the shift to defined contribution and consumer-oriented models, we are positioning to drive it. 
In summary, as we reflect on the many challenges that we face as a company and an industry last year, our 2014 results demonstrate strong financial fundamentals and execution against our growth strategies. As we begin 2015, I am confident in our strategic direction and the ability to execute, the multiple growth opportunities ahead that Aetna is well positioned to capitalize on and our updated 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 per share. 
I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who'll provide additional insight into our fourth quarter and full year results and our updated 2015 outlook. Sean?"
655542,282078937,753280,"Aetna Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2014 operating earnings of $2.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $6.70, results at the high end of our most recent projections and well in excess of our initial g",1956,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2014 operating earnings of $2.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $6.70, results at the high end of our most recent projections and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2014. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong operating fundamentals as evidenced by double-digit organic revenue growth, robust cash flow, healthy balance sheet metrics and achievement of target operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on our overall full year 2014 performance. We grew medical membership by approximately 1.4 million members to more than 23.5 million members, ending the year approximately 100,000 members higher than our previous projection, as a result of stronger than projected December renewals, primarily in Small Group accounts. We grew operating revenue by 23% to a record $58 billion, driven by double-digit organic revenue growth across multiple lines of business and the full year impact of the Coventry acquisition. Our full year Government medical benefit ratio was 84.9%, a very good results and a testament to the execution of our strategy to solve for the meaningful rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in 2014, combined with continued strong performance of our Medicaid business. We improved our full year operating expense ratio by 100 basis points, excluding the impact of ACA-related fees, driven by higher operating revenues and continued discipline in controlling costs. Finally, we generated over $1.5 billion in dividends from subsidiaries and returned an equal amount to shareholders in the form of shareholder dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking more specifically at the fourth quarter results. We grew operating revenue by over 12% versus the same quarter last year to $14.8 billion, driven primarily by membership growth in our Government and Commercial businesses. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses continued to perform quite well. Our fourth quarter total medical benefit ratios was 83%, a good overall result and a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Our operating expense ratio increased from the same period last year to 19.7%. However, excluding ACA fees from our expenses, our operating expense ratio was essentially flat with the prior year quarter. Our pretax operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter and 7.6% for the year, consistent with our target operating margin range. This result represents Aetna's fifth consecutive year of achieving or exceeding this goal despite an increasing mix of Government and public exchange businesses and the many challenges that faced our industry in 2014. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across our Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare products, primarily attributable to third quarter 2014 dates of service. Our reserve growth kept pace with premium growth, and days claims payable were 49.2 days at the end of the quarter, down marginally from the third quarter, primarily as a result of processing improvements but up over 4 days year-over-year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. Our full year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.5x operating earnings. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing approximately 3 million shares in the quarter for $243 million and distributing approximately $79 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In summary, our fourth quarter results demonstrate the execution of Aetna's growth strategy, the success of the Coventry integration and the value of our diversified portfolio. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our Commercial membership declined by approximately 70,000 members during the quarter, driven by declines in our Individual and Small Group insured books, partially offset by modest ASC membership growth. These results are consistent with our commitment to financially responsible pricing, where we favor margin over membership and price to projected underlying medical cost trends. Our crucial medical benefit ratio was 82% for the quarter and 80.2% for the full year 2014, a good absolute result and consistent with our previous projections despite pressures from an early and more severe flu season. Importantly, the medical cost performance of our core commercial business and specifically, our 51 to 300 employee block, performed consistent with the projections we described on our third quarter 2014 earnings call. Additionally, Aetna's commercial MBR was influenced by our continued prudent stance with regard to our ACA-compliant blocks of business. Based on the most recent data available, we have adjusted our accruals related to the 3Rs during the fourth quarter, specifically, we recorded $176 million of incremental reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $338 million; we recorded additional net payables for the risk adjusters of $78 million, bringing the net full year total to $230 million; and we did not record any risk corridor receivables as of December 31, 2014. However, in select geographies, we have recorded a modest risk corridor payable where our current projections indicate we will be required to contribute to this program. Had we accrued a risk corridor receivable at December 31, our full year 2014 Commercial MBR would have been lower by approximately 20 basis points. Consistent with our Commercial MBR performance, Aetna's standalone 2014 Commercial manager cost trend was in the middle to upper end of our originally projected range of 6% to 7%, in line with our previous projection. 
Moving on from Commercial. Our Government franchise is another important growth lever for our business. As Mark mentioned earlier, our Government business had an outstanding year from both a growth and profitability standpoint and now represents over 40% of our health care premiums. Our Government business grew by 45,000 members in the quarter, primarily due to Medicaid growth of 26,000 members. Aetna's continued government membership growth drove fourth quarter Government premiums to $5.4 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year period. Over Government medical benefit ratio was 84.4% in the quarter, an excellent result in absolute terms and a 260 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this year's excellent performance include favorable prior-period reserve development; the success of actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap, including the health insurer fee; and continuing strong performance in our Medicaid business. Finally, Group Insurance operating earnings were $21.3 million in the quarter compared to $47.9 million in the same quarter of 2013, driven primarily by lower net investment income. For the full year 2014, Group Insurance operating earnings were $171 million, well in excess of 2013 results in our initial full year projections. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 37%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $169 million. We repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $243 million and pay a shareholder dividend of $79 million. After other sources, we ended the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349.8 million shares at December 31. 
Moving on to 2015. This morning, we increased our 2015 outlook to at least $7 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $6.90 per share. As a reminder, Aetna's guidance does not include any projections of prior year development. This increased projection reflects the impact of our recently disclosed preferred drug contract for hepatitis C treatments on our Commercial business; higher medical membership than we had previously projected, driven by our solid finish to 2014, and our encouraging early 2015 growth in both our public exchange and Medicare Advantage businesses. These 2 favorable items are partially offset by a projected increase in flu and related costs in 2015 based on the severity of the current flu season. Our 2015 guidance is further influenced by the following drivers. We project that our first quarter medical membership will be approximately 23.5 million members, an increase of approximately 1,000 members versus our previous guidance. Specifically, Aetna's Commercial ASC membership is now projected to decline by approximately 175,000 members, a modest improvement versus our previous guidance. Commercial Insured membership is now projected to be flat to slightly down as compared to year-end 2014, influenced by public and private exchange growth, offset by the previously discussed increase in Small Group renewal activity that occurred in late 2014 rather than in early 2015 and the potential for increased attrition in our smaller Middle Markets and off-exchange Individual businesses. Medicare membership is projected to grow by approximately 120,000 members, comprised of at least 90,000 Medicare Advantage numbers and approximately 30,000 Medicare Supplement members, growth that is again higher than our previous projections. And Medicaid membership is now projected to be better than our previous forecast with other growth almost entirely offsetting the exit from Delaware's Medicaid program. We continue to project full year operating revenue to be at least $62 billion, as the impact of higher-than-projected membership growth on exchanges and Individual Medicare Advantage is projected to be partially offset by the potential for increased attrition in our smaller middle market and off-exchange Individual businesses. We continue to project our full year total health medical benefit ratio to be 82% to 83%. Aetna's 2015 core Commercial Medicare medical cost trend is projected to be in the range of 6% to 7%, reflecting a projected increase in utilization of 50 to 100 basis points over 2014. We project our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. This metric is impacted by the increase in expense related to the ACA fees and taxes, which runs to the SG&A line, increasing the reported SG&A ratio for 2015 by approximately 140 basis points. Our underlying operating expense ratio, excluding these fees and taxes, is projected to show improvement over our 2014 result. We project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.3%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We project operating earnings to be over $2.4 billion. And finally, we project net dividends from subsidiaries to be approximately $1.8 billion as additional capital to support growth is held at the subsidiaries. We continue to project excess cash flow to the parent to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, noting that increased premiums versus our initial projection could push us into the lower half of this range. 
To the extent that current analyst consensus for 2015 contemplates the same quarterly earnings progression Aetna experienced in 2014, especially as it pertains to the first quarter, we would remind investors that the first quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by severe winter weather and a lower-than-normal flu season, both of which we do not project to recur in 2015. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. I want to reiterate that our 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 is a floor and that we are committed to delivering results in excess of this early view. To that end, we remain focused on executing on our exchange strategy, both public and private; delivering on our Government growth strategy; improving the performance of our 51 to 300 employee Commercial block of business; and solving for the incremental ACA fees and taxes. As we continue to execute during this challenging time for our industry, we are confident that we can achieve our 2015 projections and are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at least $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.

Now on the Individual side, obviously the public exchanges, but we see a lot of opportunity in the public exchange marketplace, particularly as we work through all the issues with the Federal Government where private exchange models that connect Medicare, Medicaid, Individual and Small Group, any marketplace and creates ubiquity or fungibility of products through 1 marketplace as an opportunity for private exchanges, including the potential for subsidy in the longer run. And so that all depends on how things work out in Washington. Where we see this private exchange model even more importantly, with the admin platform on the back-end, which most private exchange models do not have.

This morning, we reported full year 2014 operating EPS of $6.70, representing a record result for the company, the high end of our previous annual projection, year-over-year growth",1515,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. 
This morning, we reported full year 2014 operating EPS of $6.70, representing a record result for the company, the high end of our previous annual projection, year-over-year growth in excess of 7% and an operating EPS CAGR of 15% since 2010. 
Looking back on 2014, we solved or priced for nearly $1 billion of new fees and taxes; achieved pretax margins in excess of our initial 2014 projections; accelerated Coventry synergies, achieving a run rate in 2014 that will deliver at least $0.90 of operating EPS accretion in 2015; closing out our commitments to shareholders; enrolled nearly 600,000 public exchange members while exceeding our initial profitability projections in this new program; bolstered our consumer platform through the acquisition of bSwift; and continue to advance our efforts to shift the network model for patient-centric population health management. 
Our 2014 results are a testament to the strength of our leadership team and the execution of our growth strategy. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with more than 23.5 million medical members, well in excess of our previous projections and representing full year growth of approximately 1.4 million members. 
We reported record operating revenue of nearly $58 billion, including organic growth of approximately 13% across multiple lines of business. We reported a full year Commercial medical benefit ratio that, absent our conservative stance on our ACA-compliant block of business and higher-than-projected flu, would have been at the low end of our previous 2014 projections. 
Our full year Commercial medical benefit ratio of 80.2% was a very good result as aggregate commercial medical cost trend increases remain moderate and our 51 to 300 employee block perform consistent with our previous projections. 
Our operating expense ratio, excluding the impact of health care reform, fees and taxes, improved by 100 basis points as we grew operating revenue and continue to focus on synergy realization. 
Finally, we generated strong cash flow in 2014, which enabled us to continue to invest in our growth strategy, close 2 acquisitions, pay down debt, increase our shareholder dividend and still repurchase $1.2 billion of our shares. 
Our strong finish to 2014, in combination with our strong start to 2015, gives us the confidence this morning to increase our 2015 operating EPS projection to at least $7 per share. As always, this projection does not include any projection of prior year development and represents approximately 13% growth over 2014 results when prior year development is excluded. 
In a moment, Shawn will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to discuss Aetna's growth strategy and how we are executing on that strategy. At our Investor Conference in December, we highlighted the multiple avenues we have to drive top and bottom line growth. Specifically, we discussed the stability of our Large Group Commercial businesses and the ability of these businesses to continue to produce attractive returns and generate capital, the growth of our Government franchise and the potential for sustained growth in the future and the opportunity for additional growth in our Individual business as exchanges continue to evolve. 
Additionally, we discussed our continued efforts through Healthagen to transform the network model from one of episodic care to population health management and our strategy to lead the industry toward a more consumer-oriented marketplace. 
I will now provide a brief update on how we're executing against some of these growth levers. 
Starting with our Large Group Commercial business. 2014 was another solid year as most of our Large Group Commercial businesses met or exceeded our initial projections. In particular, our fee-based businesses had an outstanding year. We grew Commercial ASC membership by over 700,000 members for the year and exceeded our initial operating projection. These results demonstrate the ability of our Large Group Commercial businesses to continue to generate solid returns and to provide capital to reinvest for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. 
Moving on to Government business. Our Medicare franchise continues to be a key component of our strategy to grow our Government business, and our 2014 results speak to our successes in this business. During 2014, we grew our Medicare Advantage membership by almost 18% and our Medicare Supplement membership by nearly 20%, results that are well in excess of our industry growth. 
Additionally, we just completed another highly successful Medicare annual enrollment period where growth exceeded our initial projections. We now project to grow our Medicare Advantage membership by 90,000 members in the first quarter, including double-digit percentage growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage membership. A key driver of Aetna's Medicare Advantage membership growth trajectory has been our star ratings. And for the second year in a row, approximately 80% of our sales have come through plans rated 4 stars or greater. 
Continuing with Government. Our Medicaid business has had an excellent year in 
[Audio Gap]
thousand members in 2014, including over 11,000 members related to our participation in multiple dual-eligible demonstration projects. We grew premium revenue by over 60%, and operating earnings exceeded our initial projections, driven by better underwriting margins in several of our key geographies and a strong prior year development. 
Looking forward, despite the previously disclosed exit from our Delaware Medicaid contract, we project 2015 to be another strong year of top line growth for our Medicaid franchise, driven primarily by growth from serving dual-eligible and other high-acuity populations. 
Shifting to public exchanges. We are pleased with our first year execution particularly in light of the well-publicized challenges with the initial launch of the public exchanges. We ended the year with approximately 560,000 on-exchange members, modestly ahead of our most recent projections. 
Additionally, while the open enrollment period is still ongoing, we are on track to exceed our initial enrollment projections for 2015. Further, we have successfully transitioned the vast majority of our off-exchange membership to ACA-compliant plans, consistent with our previous projections. 
As we look at our total Individual business, we now project that we will end the first quarter with approximately 1.1 million members, including up to 800,000 on-exchange members. We believe these strong results validate our strategy of focusing on geographies where we have a competitive cost structure and can provide the greatest value to potential customers. 
As we enter the second year of this emerging marketplace, we are cautiously optimistic on the potential for public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity, where we continue to offer value to our customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders. 
Let me now spend a few moments discussing our provider transformation efforts. We continue to advance our strategy of collaborating with providers to build a simpler, more integrated health care system, and we continue to make great strides as we signed contracts with 28 new ACO partners since year-end 2013, launched multiple new products backed by ACO contracts, doubled our membership covered by value-based contracts to more than 3 million members and increased the percent of our medical costs that run through value-based contracts to 28% of total spend. 
As we continue to focus incentives around improving the health of our members and lowering overall costs, we are moving closer to a health care system that rewards providers for keeping people healthy and ultimately more productive. 
Finally, in 2014, we continue to advance our strategy to become a more consumer-oriented company. For example, in the fourth quarter, we closed the bSwift acquisition. This transaction was an important step forward as it accelerates our efforts to create the leading front-end buy, shop and enroll capabilities necessary to drive the change to a more consumer-oriented marketplace. Additionally, bSwift adds back-end eligibility and benefits administration, an important element for our employer customers as they look to make the transition to defined contribution and private exchange models. 
Combined with the other investments we have been making, including our efforts to transform the provider network model through our Healthagen business, our investments in building a new modular administration platform and consumer-facing tools like iTriage, we are not only preparing for the shift to defined contribution and consumer-oriented models, we are positioning to drive it. 
In summary, as we reflect on the many challenges that we faced as a company and an industry last year, our 2014 results demonstrate strong financial fundamentals and execution against our growth strategies. As we begin 2015, I am confident in our strategic direction and the ability to execute, the multiple growth opportunities ahead that Aetna is well positioned to capitalize on and our updated 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 per share. 
I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn who will provide additional insight into our fourth quarter and full year results and our updated 2015 outlook. Shawn?"
655542,282078937,753580,"Aetna Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2014 operating earnings of $2.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $6.70, results at the high end of our most recent projections and well in excess of our initial g",1950,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2014 operating earnings of $2.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $6.70, results at the high end of our most recent projections and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2014. 
Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong operating fundamentals as evidenced by double-digit organic revenue growth, robust cash flow, healthy balance sheet metrics and achievement of target operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on our overall full year 2014 performance. We grew medical membership by approximately 1.4 million members to more than 23.5 million members, ending the year approximately 100,000 members higher than our previous projection, as a result of stronger-than-projected December renewals, primarily in Small Group accounts. 
We grew operating revenue by 23% to a record $58 billion, driven by double-digit organic revenue growth across multiple lines of business and the full year impact of the Coventry acquisition. Our full year Government medical benefit ratio  was 84.9%, a very good result and a testament to the execution of our strategy to solve for the meaningful rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in 2014, combined with continued strong performance of our Medicaid business. 
We improved our full year operating expense ratio by 100 basis points, excluding the impact of ACA-related fees, driven by higher operating revenues and continued discipline in controlling costs. 
Finally, we generated over $1.5 billion in dividends from subsidiaries and returned an equal amount to shareholders in the form of shareholder dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking more specifically at the fourth quarter results. We grew operating revenue by over 12% versus the same quarter last year to $14.8 billion, driven primarily by membership growth in our Government and Commercial businesses. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses continued to perform quite well. Our fourth quarter total medical benefit ratio was 83%, a good overall result and a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. 
Our operating expense ratio increased from the same period last year to 19.7%. However, excluding ACA fees from our expenses, our operating expense ratio was essentially flat with the prior year quarter. Our pretax operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter and 7.6% for the year, consistent with our target operating margin range. This result represents Aetna's fifth consecutive year of achieving or exceeding this goal despite an increasing mix of government and public exchange businesses and the many challenges that faced our industry in 2014. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across our Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare products, primarily attributable to third quarter 2014 dates of service. Our reserve growth kept pace with premium growth, and days claims payable were 49.2 days at the end of the quarter, down marginally from the third quarter primarily as a result of processing improvements, but up over 4 days year-over-year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. Our full year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.5x operating earnings. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing approximately 3 million shares in the quarter for $243 million and distributing approximately $79 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. 
In summary, our fourth quarter results demonstrate the execution of Aetna's growth strategy, the success of the Coventry integration and the value of our diversified portfolio. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail. 
Beginning with our Commercial business. Our Commercial membership declined by approximately 70,000 members during the quarter, driven by declines in our Individual and Small Group insured books, partially offset by modest ASC membership growth. These results are consistent with our commitment to financially responsible pricing where we favor margin over membership and price to projected underlying medical cost trends. 
Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 82% for the quarter and 80.2% for the full year 2014, a good absolute result and consistent with our previous projections despite pressures from an early and more severe flu season. 
Importantly, the medical cost performance of our core Commercial business and specifically, our 51 to 300 employee block, performed consistent with the projections we described on our third quarter 2014 earnings call. Additionally, Aetna's Commercial MBR was influenced by our continued prudent stance with regard to our ACA-compliant blocks of business. 
Based on the most recent data available, we have adjusted our accruals related to the 3Rs during the fourth quarter. Specifically, we recorded $176 million of incremental reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $338 million. We recorded additional net payables for the risk adjusters of $78 million, bringing the net full year total to $230 million. And we did not record any risk corridor receivables as of December 31, 2014. 
However, in select geographies, we have recorded a modest risk corridor payable where our current projections indicate we will be required to contribute to this program. Had we accrued a risk corridor receivable at December 31, our full year 2014 Commercial MBR would have been lower by approximately 20 basis points. Consistent with our Commercial MBR performance, Aetna's stand-alone 2014 Commercial medical cost trend was in the middle to upper end of our originally projected range of 6% to 7%, in line with our previous projection. 
Moving on from Commercial. Our Government franchise is another important growth lever for our business. As Mark mentioned earlier, our Government business had an outstanding year from both a growth and profitability standpoint and now represents over 40% of our health care premiums. Our Government business grew by 45,000 members in the quarter, primarily due to Medicaid growth of 26,000 members. 
Aetna's continued Government membership growth drove fourth quarter Government premiums to $5.4 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year period. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 84.4% in the quarter, an excellent result in absolute terms and a 260 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this year's excellent performance include favorable prior-period reserve development; the success of actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap, including the health insurer fee; and continuing strong performance in our Medicaid business. 
Finally, Group Insurance operating earnings were $21.3 million in the quarter compared to $47.9 million in the same quarter of 2013, driven primarily by lower net investment income. For the full year 2014, Group Insurance operating earnings were $171 million, well in excess of 2013 results in our initial full year projections. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 37%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $169 million. We repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $243 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $79 million. After other sources, we ended the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349.8 million shares at December 31. 
Moving on to 2015. This morning, we increased our 2015 outlook to at least $7 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $6.90 per share. As a reminder, Aetna's guidance does not include any projection of prior year development. 
This increased projection reflects the impact of our recently disclosed preferred drug contract for hepatitis C treatments on our Commercial business; higher medical membership than we had previously projected, driven by our solid finish to 2014; and our encouraging early 2015 growth in both our public exchange and Medicare Advantage businesses. These 2 favorable items are partially offset by a projected increase in flu and related costs in 2015 based on the severity of the current flu season. 
Our 2015 guidance is further influenced by the following drivers. We project that our first quarter medical membership will be approximately 23.5 million members, an increase of approximately 100,000 members versus our previous guidance. Specifically, Aetna's Commercial ASC membership is now projected to decline by approximately 175,000 members, a modest improvement versus our previous guidance. 
Commercial Insured membership is now projected to be flat to slightly down as compared to year-end 2014, influenced by public and private exchange growth, offset by the previously discussed increase in Small Group renewal activity that occurred in late 2014 rather than in early 2015 and the potential for increased attrition in our smaller middle-markets and off-exchange Individual businesses. 
Medicare membership is projected to grow by approximately 120,000 members, comprised of at least 90,000 Medicare Advantage numbers and approximately 30,000 Medicare Supplement members, growth that is again higher than our previous projections. And Medicaid membership is now projected to be better than our previous forecasts, with other growth almost entirely offsetting the exit from Delaware's Medicaid program. 
We continue to project full year operating revenue to be at least $62 billion as the impact of higher-than-projected membership growth on exchanges and Individual Medicare Advantage is projected to be partially offset by the potential for increased attrition in our smaller middle-market and off-exchange Individual businesses. 
We continue to project our full year total health medical benefit ratio to be 82% to 83%. Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trend is projected to be in the range of 6% to 7%, reflecting a projected increase in utilization of 50 to 100 basis points over 2014. 
We project our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. This metric is impacted by the increase in expense related to the ACA fees and taxes, which runs to the SG&A line, increasing the reported SG&A ratio for 2015 by approximately 140 basis points. Our underlying operating expense ratio, excluding these fees and taxes, is projected to show improvement over our 2014 results. 
We project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.3%, consistent with our high single digit target. We project operating earnings to be over $2.4 billion. 
And finally, we project net dividends from subsidiaries to be approximately $1.8 billion as additional capital to support growth is held at the subsidiaries. We continue to project excess cash flow to the parent to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, noting that increased premiums versus our initial projection could push us into the lower half of this range. 
To the extent that current analyst consensus for 2015 contemplates the same quarterly earnings progression Aetna experienced in 2014, especially as it pertains to the first quarter, we would remind investors that the first quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by severe winter weather and a lower-than-normal flu season, both of which we do not project to recur in 2015. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. I want to reiterate that our 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 is a floor and that we are committed to delivering results in excess of this early view. 
To that end, we remain focused on executing on our exchange strategy, both public and private; delivering on our Government growth strategy; improving the performance of our 51 to 300 employee Commercial block of business; and solving for the incremental ACA fees and taxes. As we continue to execute during this challenging time for our industry, we are confident that we can achieve our 2015 projections and are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at least $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.

We believe it's an important part of the early stages of this program. But some of the activity around the budget process and some of the guidance that came out, frankly, created a degree of uncertainty about the collectibility, and we just didn't feel like we were over the threshold to do that. In addition, I mean, there is -- on this whole topic, it is really important for everyone to realize what I would call the relative immaturity of the data that pertains to both the base estimates of claim experience, which is still emerging in this new program, but also the data we are using to estimate risk adjusters is, as you know, from an outside consulting source of gathering industry data, it is certainly not the official dataset upon which we will ultimately make that calculation, and so there still is a lot of uncertainty.

So there is a good chunk of renewal activity that is now taking place in December. And at the end of the day, we did better in renewing that block of business than we had initially projected. And so in many ways, if you think about business that used to be 1/1 as effectively 12/1 now, we're getting some of that growth earlier in the cycle than maybe we would have had in the past.

And I think there is a realization that throwing, pick your number, 10 million people into the uninsured marketplace as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court would not be a wise thing for anybody. And so I think there's a lot of conversation going on, on what kind of continuance we would need, if any, to get through the end of the year, what kind of solutions would be offered by both sides to get to a place where the program would just not abandon people.

Now on the Individual side, obviously, it's the public exchanges, but we see a lot of opportunity in the public exchange marketplace, particularly as we work through all the issues with the federal government where private exchange models that connect Medicare, Medicaid, Individual and Small Group, any marketplace and creates ubiquity or fungibility of products through one marketplace as an opportunity for private exchanges, including the potential for subsidy in the longer run. And so that all depends on how things work out in Washington. But we see this private exchange model even more importantly with the ben/admin platform on the back end, which most private exchange models do not have. And that ability to provide benefit administration for the employer, bundled into the cost of the overall product and the private exchange experience, a marketplace, really creates a lot of flexibility with us to provide value to certain employer segments."

Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported full year 2014 operating EPS of $6.70, representing a record result for the company, the high end of our previous annual projection, year-over-year growth",1515,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. 
This morning, we reported full year 2014 operating EPS of $6.70, representing a record result for the company, the high end of our previous annual projection, year-over-year growth in excess of 7% and an operating EPS CAGR of 15% since 2010. 
Looking back on 2014, we solved or priced for nearly $1 billion of new fees and taxes; achieved pretax margins in excess of our initial 2014 projections; accelerated Coventry synergies, achieving a run rate in 2014 that will deliver at least $0.90 of operating EPS accretion in 2015; closing out our commitments to shareholders; enrolled nearly 600,000 public exchange members while exceeding our initial profitability projections in this new program; bolstered our consumer platform through the acquisition of bSwift; and continue to advance our efforts to shift the network model for patient-centric population health management. 
Our 2014 results are a testament to the strength of our leadership team and the execution of our growth strategy. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with more than 23.5 million medical members, well in excess of our previous projections and representing full year growth of approximately 1.4 million members. 
We reported record operating revenue of nearly $58 billion, including organic growth of approximately 13% across multiple lines of business. We reported a full year Commercial medical benefit ratio that, absent our conservative stance on our ACA-compliant block of business and higher-than-projected flu, would have been at the low end of our previous 2014 projections. 
Our full year Commercial medical benefit ratio of 80.2% was a very good result as aggregate commercial medical cost trend increases remain moderate and our 51 to 300 employee block perform consistent with our previous projections. 
Our operating expense ratio, excluding the impact of health care reform, fees and taxes, improved by 100 basis points as we grew operating revenue and continue to focus on synergy realization. 
Finally, we generated strong cash flow in 2014, which enabled us to continue to invest in our growth strategy, close 2 acquisitions, pay down debt, increase our shareholder dividend and still repurchase $1.2 billion of our shares. 
Our strong finish to 2014, in combination with our strong start to 2015, gives us the confidence this morning to increase our 2015 operating EPS projection to at least $7 per share. As always, this projection does not include any projection of prior year development and represents approximately 13% growth over 2014 results when prior year development is excluded. 
In a moment, Shawn will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to discuss Aetna's growth strategy and how we are executing on that strategy. At our Investor Conference in December, we highlighted the multiple avenues we have to drive top and bottom line growth. Specifically, we discussed the stability of our Large Group Commercial businesses and the ability of these businesses to continue to produce attractive returns and generate capital, the growth of our Government franchise and the potential for sustained growth in the future and the opportunity for additional growth in our Individual business as exchanges continue to evolve. 
Additionally, we discussed our continued efforts through Healthagen to transform the network model from one of episodic care to population health management and our strategy to lead the industry toward a more consumer-oriented marketplace. 
I will now provide a brief update on how we're executing against some of these growth levers. 
Starting with our Large Group Commercial business. 2014 was another solid year as most of our Large Group Commercial businesses met or exceeded our initial projections. In particular, our fee-based businesses had an outstanding year. We grew Commercial ASC membership by over 700,000 members for the year and exceeded our initial operating projection. These results demonstrate the ability of our Large Group Commercial businesses to continue to generate solid returns and to provide capital to reinvest for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. 
Moving on to Government business. Our Medicare franchise continues to be a key component of our strategy to grow our Government business, and our 2014 results speak to our successes in this business. During 2014, we grew our Medicare Advantage membership by almost 18% and our Medicare Supplement membership by nearly 20%, results that are well in excess of our industry growth. 
Additionally, we just completed another highly successful Medicare annual enrollment period where growth exceeded our initial projections. We now project to grow our Medicare Advantage membership by 90,000 members in the first quarter, including double-digit percentage growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage membership. A key driver of Aetna's Medicare Advantage membership growth trajectory has been our star ratings. And for the second year in a row, approximately 80% of our sales have come through plans rated 4 stars or greater. 
Continuing with Government. Our Medicaid business has had an excellent year in 
[Audio Gap]
thousand members in 2014, including over 11,000 members related to our participation in multiple dual-eligible demonstration projects. We grew premium revenue by over 60%, and operating earnings exceeded our initial projections, driven by better underwriting margins in several of our key geographies and a strong prior year development. 
Looking forward, despite the previously disclosed exit from our Delaware Medicaid contract, we project 2015 to be another strong year of top line growth for our Medicaid franchise, driven primarily by growth from serving dual-eligible and other high-acuity populations. 
Shifting to public exchanges. We are pleased with our first year execution particularly in light of the well-publicized challenges with the initial launch of the public exchanges. We ended the year with approximately 560,000 on-exchange members, modestly ahead of our most recent projections. 
Additionally, while the open enrollment period is still ongoing, we are on track to exceed our initial enrollment projections for 2015. Further, we have successfully transitioned the vast majority of our off-exchange membership to ACA-compliant plans, consistent with our previous projections. 
As we look at our total Individual business, we now project that we will end the first quarter with approximately 1.1 million members, including up to 800,000 on-exchange members. We believe these strong results validate our strategy of focusing on geographies where we have a competitive cost structure and can provide the greatest value to potential customers. 
As we enter the second year of this emerging marketplace, we are cautiously optimistic on the potential for public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity, where we continue to offer value to our customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders. 
Let me now spend a few moments discussing our provider transformation efforts. We continue to advance our strategy of collaborating with providers to build a simpler, more integrated health care system, and we continue to make great strides as we signed contracts with 28 new ACO partners since year-end 2013, launched multiple new products backed by ACO contracts, doubled our membership covered by value-based contracts to more than 3 million members and increased the percent of our medical costs that run through value-based contracts to 28% of total spend. 
As we continue to focus incentives around improving the health of our members and lowering overall costs, we are moving closer to a health care system that rewards providers for keeping people healthy and ultimately more productive. 
Finally, in 2014, we continue to advance our strategy to become a more consumer-oriented company. For example, in the fourth quarter, we closed the bSwift acquisition. This transaction was an important step forward as it accelerates our efforts to create the leading front-end buy, shop and enroll capabilities necessary to drive the change to a more consumer-oriented marketplace. Additionally, bSwift adds back-end eligibility and benefits administration, an important element for our employer customers as they look to make the transition to defined contribution and private exchange models. 
Combined with the other investments we have been making, including our efforts to transform the provider network model through our Healthagen business, our investments in building a new modular administration platform and consumer-facing tools like iTriage, we are not only preparing for the shift to defined contribution and consumer-oriented models, we are positioning to drive it. 
In summary, as we reflect on the many challenges that we faced as a company and an industry last year, our 2014 results demonstrate strong financial fundamentals and execution against our growth strategies. As we begin 2015, I am confident in our strategic direction and the ability to execute, the multiple growth opportunities ahead that Aetna is well positioned to capitalize on and our updated 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 per share. 
I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn who will provide additional insight into our fourth quarter and full year results and our updated 2015 outlook. Shawn?"
655542,282078937,753702,"Aetna Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

Earlier today, we reported full year 2014 operating earnings of $2.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $6.70, results at the high end of our most recent projections and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2014. 
Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong operating fundamentals as evidenced by double-digit organic revenue growth, robust cash flow, healthy balance sheet metrics and achievement of target operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on our overall full year 2014 performance. We grew medical membership by approximately 1.4 million members to more than 23.5 million members, ending the year approximately 100,000 members higher than our previous projection, as a result of stronger-than-projected December renewals, primarily in Small Group accounts. 
We grew operating revenue by 23% to a record $58 billion, driven by double-digit organic revenue growth across multiple lines of business and the full year impact of the Coventry acquisition. Our full year Government medical benefit ratio  was 84.9%, a very good result and a testament to the execution of our strategy to solve for the meaningful rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in 2014, combined with continued strong performance of our Medicaid business. 
We improved our full year operating expense ratio by 100 basis points, excluding the impact of ACA-related fees, driven by higher operating revenues and continued discipline in controlling costs. 
Finally, we generated over $1.5 billion in dividends from subsidiaries and returned an equal amount to shareholders in the form of shareholder dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking more specifically at the fourth quarter results. We grew operating revenue by over 12% versus the same quarter last year to $14.8 billion, driven primarily by membership growth in our Government and Commercial businesses. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses continued to perform quite well. Our fourth quarter total medical benefit ratio was 83%, a good overall result and a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. 
Our operating expense ratio increased from the same period last year to 19.7%. However, excluding ACA fees from our expenses, our operating expense ratio was essentially flat with the prior year quarter. Our pretax operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter and 7.6% for the year, consistent with our target operating margin range. This result represents Aetna's fifth consecutive year of achieving or exceeding this goal despite an increasing mix of government and public exchange businesses and the many challenges that faced our industry in 2014. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across our Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare products, primarily attributable to third quarter 2014 dates of service. Our reserve growth kept pace with premium growth, and days claims payable were 49.2 days at the end of the quarter, down marginally from the third quarter primarily as a result of processing improvements, but up over 4 days year-over-year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. Our full year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.5x operating earnings. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing approximately 3 million shares in the quarter for $243 million and distributing approximately $79 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. 
In summary, our fourth quarter results demonstrate the execution of Aetna's growth strategy, the success of the Coventry integration and the value of our diversified portfolio. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail. 
Beginning with our Commercial business. Our Commercial membership declined by approximately 70,000 members during the quarter, driven by declines in our Individual and Small Group insured books, partially offset by modest ASC membership growth. These results are consistent with our commitment to financially responsible pricing where we favor margin over membership and price to projected underlying medical cost trends. 
Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 82% for the quarter and 80.2% for the full year 2014, a good absolute result and consistent with our previous projections despite pressures from an early and more severe flu season. 
Importantly, the medical cost performance of our core Commercial business and specifically, our 51 to 300 employee block, performed consistent with the projections we described on our third quarter 2014 earnings call. Additionally, Aetna's Commercial MBR was influenced by our continued prudent stance with regard to our ACA-compliant blocks of business. 
Based on the most recent data available, we have adjusted our accruals related to the 3Rs during the fourth quarter. Specifically, we recorded $176 million of incremental reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $338 million. We recorded additional net payables for the risk adjusters of $78 million, bringing the net full year total to $230 million. And we did not record any risk corridor receivables as of December 31, 2014. 
However, in select geographies, we have recorded a modest risk corridor payable where our current projections indicate we will be required to contribute to this program. Had we accrued a risk corridor receivable at December 31, our full year 2014 Commercial MBR would have been lower by approximately 20 basis points. Consistent with our Commercial MBR performance, Aetna's stand-alone 2014 Commercial medical cost trend was in the middle to upper end of our originally projected range of 6% to 7%, in line with our previous projection. 
Moving on from Commercial. Our Government franchise is another important growth lever for our business. As Mark mentioned earlier, our Government business had an outstanding year from both a growth and profitability standpoint and now represents over 40% of our health care premiums. Our Government business grew by 45,000 members in the quarter, primarily due to Medicaid growth of 26,000 members. 
Aetna's continued Government membership growth drove fourth quarter Government premiums to $5.4 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year period. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 84.4% in the quarter, an excellent result in absolute terms and a 260 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this year's excellent performance include favorable prior-period reserve development; the success of actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap, including the health insurer fee; and continuing strong performance in our Medicaid business. 
Finally, Group Insurance operating earnings were $21.3 million in the quarter compared to $47.9 million in the same quarter of 2013, driven primarily by lower net investment income. For the full year 2014, Group Insurance operating earnings were $171 million, well in excess of 2013 results in our initial full year projections. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 37%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $169 million. We repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $243 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $79 million. After other sources, we ended the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349.8 million shares at December 31. 
Moving on to 2015. This morning, we increased our 2015 outlook to at least $7 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $6.90 per share. As a reminder, Aetna's guidance does not include any projection of prior year development. 
This increased projection reflects the impact of our recently disclosed preferred drug contract for hepatitis C treatments on our Commercial business; higher medical membership than we had previously projected, driven by our solid finish to 2014; and our encouraging early 2015 growth in both our public exchange and Medicare Advantage businesses. These 2 favorable items are partially offset by a projected increase in flu and related costs in 2015 based on the severity of the current flu season. 
Our 2015 guidance is further influenced by the following drivers. We project that our first quarter medical membership will be approximately 23.5 million members, an increase of approximately 100,000 members versus our previous guidance. Specifically, Aetna's Commercial ASC membership is now projected to decline by approximately 175,000 members, a modest improvement versus our previous guidance. 
Commercial Insured membership is now projected to be flat to slightly down as compared to year-end 2014, influenced by public and private exchange growth, offset by the previously discussed increase in Small Group renewal activity that occurred in late 2014 rather than in early 2015 and the potential for increased attrition in our smaller middle-markets and off-exchange Individual businesses. 
Medicare membership is projected to grow by approximately 120,000 members, comprised of at least 90,000 Medicare Advantage numbers and approximately 30,000 Medicare Supplement members, growth that is again higher than our previous projections. And Medicaid membership is now projected to be better than our previous forecasts, with other growth almost entirely offsetting the exit from Delaware's Medicaid program. 
We continue to project full year operating revenue to be at least $62 billion as the impact of higher-than-projected membership growth on exchanges and Individual Medicare Advantage is projected to be partially offset by the potential for increased attrition in our smaller middle-market and off-exchange Individual businesses. 
We continue to project our full year total health medical benefit ratio to be 82% to 83%. Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trend is projected to be in the range of 6% to 7%, reflecting a projected increase in utilization of 50 to 100 basis points over 2014. 
We project our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. This metric is impacted by the increase in expense related to the ACA fees and taxes, which runs through the SG&A line, increasing the reported SG&A ratio for 2015 by approximately 140 basis points. Our underlying operating expense ratio, excluding these fees and taxes, is projected to show improvement over our 2014 results. 
We project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.3%, consistent with our high single digit target. We project operating earnings to be over $2.4 billion. 
And finally, we project net dividends from subsidiaries to be approximately $1.8 billion as additional capital to support growth is held at the subsidiaries. We continue to project excess cash flow to the parent to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, noting that increased premiums versus our initial projection could push us into the lower half of this range. 
To the extent that current analyst consensus for 2015 contemplates the same quarterly earnings progression Aetna experienced in 2014, especially as it pertains to the first quarter, we would remind investors that the first quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by severe winter weather and a lower-than-normal flu season, both of which we do not project to recur in 2015. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. I want to reiterate that our 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 is a floor and that we are committed to delivering results in excess of this early view. 
To that end, we remain focused on executing on our exchange strategy, both public and private; delivering on our Government growth strategy; improving the performance of our 51 to 300 employee Commercial block of business; and solving for the incremental ACA fees and taxes. As we continue to execute during this challenging time for our industry, we are confident that we can achieve our 2015 projections and are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at least $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.

We believe it's an important part of the early stages of this program. But some of the activity around the budget process and some of the guidance that came out, frankly, created a degree of uncertainty about the collectability, and we just didn't feel like we were over the threshold to do that. In addition, I mean, there is -- on this whole topic, it is really important for everyone to realize what I would call the relative immaturity of the data that pertains to both the base estimates of claim experience, which is still emerging in this new program, but also the data we are using to estimate risk adjusters is, as you know, from an outside consulting source that's gathering industry data, it is certainly not the official dataset upon which we will ultimately make that calculation, and so there still is a lot of uncertainty.

But we're already seeing it on the unions side, not quite on the large employers side. So I think the real question is whether or not we have private exchange models that are stable.

International is performing ahead of expectations based on the changes we made in the third quarter, and student health is performing at expectations. So when you combine that with a 51 to 30, actually, the Commercial MBR is performing better, offset by the impact of flu in the fourth quarter and the change we made regarding risk adjusters. So I think that's how we look at the overall bridge to the MBR in the fourth quarter and for the full year. As it relates to the conversation in Washington, I've obviously been engaged there on a number of points. And I think there is a realization that throwing, pick your number, 10 million people into the uninsured marketplace as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court would not be a wise thing for anybody. And so I think there's a lot of conversation going on, on what kind of continuance we would need, if any, to get through the end of the year, what kind of solutions would be offered by both sides to get to a place where the program would just not abandon people. And I think that conversation is ongoing. I think it is actually constructive at this point in time, and I think there are people on both sides of the aisle who want to try and make something work should that decision come forward."

Now on the Individual side, obviously, it's the public exchanges, but we see a lot of opportunity in the public exchange marketplace, particularly as we work through all the issues with the federal government where private exchange models that connect Medicare, Medicaid, Individual and Small Group, any marketplace and creates a ubiquity or fungibility of products through one marketplace as an opportunity for private exchanges, including the potential for subsidy in the longer run. And so that all depends on how things work out in Washington. But we see this private exchange model even more importantly with the ben/admin platform on the back end, which most private exchange models do not have. And that ability to provide benefit administration for the employer, bundled into the cost of the overall product and the private exchange experience, a marketplace, really creates a lot of flexibility with us to provide value to certain employer segments."

Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported full year 2014 operating EPS of $6.70, representing a record result for the company, the high-end of our previous annual projection, year-over-year growth in",1507,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported full year 2014 operating EPS of $6.70, representing a record result for the company, the high-end of our previous annual projection, year-over-year growth in excess of 7% and an operating EPS CAGR of 15% since 2010. 
Looking back on 2014. We solved or priced for nearly $1 billion of new fees and taxes; achieved pretax margins in excess of our initial 2014 projections; accelerated Coventry synergies, achieving a run rate in 2014 that will deliver at least $0.90 of operating EPS accretion in 2015; closing out our commitments to shareholders; enrolled nearly 600,000 public exchange members, while exceeding our initial profitability projections in this new program; bolstered our consumer platform through the acquisition of BSwift; and continue to advance our efforts to ship the network model for patient-centric population health management. Our 2014 results are a testament to the strength of our leadership team and the execution of our growth strategy. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with more than 23.5 million medical members, well in excess of our previous projections and representing full year growth of approximately 1.4 million members. We reported record operating revenue of nearly $58 billion, including organic growth of approximately 13% across multiple lines of business. We reported a full year commercial medical benefit ratio, that absent our conservative stance on our ACA-compliant blocks of business and higher-than-projected flu, would have been at the lower end of our previous 2014 projections. Our full year Commercial benefit ratio of 80.2% was a very good result, as aggregate Commercial medical cost trend increases remain moderate, and our 51 to 300 employee block perform consistent with our previous projections. Our operating expense ratio, excluding the impact of Health Care Reform, fees and taxes, improved by 100 basis points, as we grew operating revenue and continue to focus on synergy realization. Finally, we generated strong cash flow in 2014, which enabled us to continue to invest in our growth strategy, closed 2 acquisitions, pay down debt, increase our shareholder dividend and still repurchase $1.2 billion of our shares. Our strong finish to 2014, in combination with our strong start to 2015, gives us the confidence this morning to increase our 2015 operating EPS projection to at least $7 per share. As always, this projection does not include any projection of prior year development and represents approximately 13% growth over 2014 results when prior year development is excluded. 
In a moment, sean will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to discuss Aetna's growth strategy and how we are executing on that strategy. At our Investor Conference in December, we highlighted the multiple avenues we have to drive top and bottom line growth. Specifically, we discussed the stability of our Large Group Commercial businesses and the ability of these businesses to continue to produce attractive returns and generate capital, the growth of our Government franchise and the potential for sustained growth in the future and the opportunity for additional growth in our Individual business as exchanges continue to evolve. Additionally, we discussed our continued efforts to help Aetna to transform model for one of episodic care to population health management and our strategy to lead the industry toward a more consumer-oriented marketplace. 
I will now provide a brief update on how we're executing against some of these growth levers. Starting with our Large Group Commercial business. 2014 was another solid year, as most of our Large Group Commercial businesses met or exceeded our initial projections. In particular, our fee-based businesses had an outstanding year. We grew Commercial ASC membership by over 700,000 members for the year and exceeded our initial operating projection. These results demonstrate the ability of our Large Group Commercial businesses to continue to generate solid returns and to provide capital to reinvest for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. 
Moving on to Government business. Our Medicare franchise continues to be a key component of our strategy to grow our Government business, and our 2014 results speak to our successes in this business. During 2014, we grew our Medicare Advantage membership by almost 18% and our Medicare Supplement membership by nearly 20%, results that are well in excess of our industry growth. Additionally, we just completed another highly successful Medicare annual enrollment period, where growth exceeded our initial projections. We now project to grow our Medicare Advantage membership by 90,000 members in the first quarter, including double-digit percentage growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage membership. A key driver of Aetna's Medicare Advantage membership growth trajectory has been our star ratings. And for the second year in a row, approximately 80% of our sales have come through plans rated 4 stars or greater. 
Continuing with Government. Our Medicaid business has had an excellent year in 2014, including over 11,000 members related to our participation in multiple dual-eligible demonstration projects. We grew premium revenue by over 60%, and operating earnings exceeded our initial projections, driven by better underwriting margins in several of our key geographies and a strong prior year development. Looking forward, despite the previously disclosed exit from our Delaware Medicaid contract, we project 2015 to be another strong year of top line growth for our Medicaid franchise, driven primarily by growth from serving dual-eligible and other high-acuity populations. 
Shifting to public exchanges. We are pleased with our first year execution, particularly in light of the well-publicized challenges with the initial launch of the public exchanges. We ended the year with approximately 560,000 on-exchange members, modestly ahead of our most recent projections. Additionally, while the opening enrollment period is still ongoing, we are on track to exceed our initial enrollment projections for 2015. Further, we have successfully transitioned the vast majority of our off-exchange membership to ACA-compliant plans, consistent with our previous projections. As we look at our total Individual business, we now project that we will end the first quarter with approximately 1.1 million members, including up to 800,000 on-exchange members. We believe the strong results validate our strategy are focusing on geographies where we have a competitive cost structure and can provide the greatest value to potential customers. As we entered the second year of this emerging marketplace, we are cautiously optimistic on the potential for public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity, where we continue to offer value to our customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders. 
Let me now spend a few moments discussing our provider transformation efforts. We continue to advance our strategy of collaborating with providers to build a simpler, more integrated health care system, and we continue to make great strides as we: signed contracts with 28 new ACL partners since year-end 2013; launched multiple new products backed by ACL contracts; doubled our members covered by value-based contracts to more than 3 million members; and increased the percentage of our medical cost that run through value-based contract to 28% of total spend. As we continue to focus incentives around improving the health of our members and lowering overall costs, we are moving closer to a health care system that rewards providers for keeping people healthy and ultimately more productive. 
Finally, in 2014, we continue to advance our strategy to become a more consumer-oriented company. For example, in the fourth quarter, we closed the BSwift acquisition. This transaction was an important step forward as it accelerates our efforts to create the leading front-end buy, shop and enroll capabilities necessary to drive the change through a more consumer-oriented marketplace. Additionally, BSwift adds back-end eligibility and benefits administration, an important element for our employer customers as they look to make the transition to define contribution and private exchange models. Combined with the other investments we have been making, including our efforts to transform the provider network model through our health business, our investments in building a new modular administration platform, and consumer-facing tools like I Triage, we are not only preparing for the shift to defined contribution and consumer-oriented models, we are positioning to drive it. 
In summary, as we reflect on the many challenges that we face as a company and an industry last year, our 2014 results demonstrate strong financial fundamentals and execution against our growth strategies. As we begin 2015, I am confident in our strategic direction and the ability to execute, the multiple growth opportunities ahead that Aetna is well positioned to capitalize on and our updated 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 per share. 
I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. By focusing on sound fundamentals, creating new approaches to satisfying customers and generating and deploying capital responsibly, we believe that we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.

Earlier today, we reported full year 2014 operating earnings of $2.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $6.70, results at the high end of our most recent projections and well in excess of our initial g",1956,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2014 operating earnings of $2.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $6.70, results at the high end of our most recent projections and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2014. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong operating fundamentals as evidenced by double-digit organic revenue growth, robust cash flow, healthy balance sheet metrics and achievement of target operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on our overall full year 2014 performance. We grew medical membership by approximately 1.4 million members to more than 23.5 million members, ending the year approximately 100,000 members higher than our previous projection, as a result of stronger than projected December renewals, primarily in Small Group accounts. We grew operating revenue by 23% to a record $58 billion, driven by double-digit organic revenue growth across multiple lines of business and the full year impact of the Coventry acquisition. Our full year Government medical benefit ratio was 84.9%, a very good results and a testament to the execution of our strategy to solve for the meaningful rate cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in 2014, combined with continued strong performance of our Medicaid business. We improved our full year operating expense ratio by 100 basis points, excluding the impact of ACA-related fees, driven by higher operating revenues and continued discipline in controlling costs. Finally, we generated over $1.5 billion in dividends from subsidiaries and returned an equal amount to shareholders in the form of shareholder dividends and share repurchases. 
Looking more specifically at the fourth quarter results. We grew operating revenue by over 12% versus the same quarter last year to $14.8 billion, driven primarily by membership growth in our Government and Commercial businesses. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses continued to perform quite well. Our fourth quarter total medical benefit ratios was 83%, a good overall result and a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Our operating expense ratio increased from the same period last year to 19.7%. However, excluding ACA fees from our expenses, our operating expense ratio was essentially flat with the prior year quarter. Our pretax operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter and 7.6% for the year, consistent with our target operating margin range. This result represents Aetna's fifth consecutive year of achieving or exceeding this goal despite an increasing mix of Government and public exchange businesses and the many challenges that faced our industry in 2014. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across our Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare products, primarily attributable to third quarter 2014 dates of service. Our reserve growth kept pace with premium growth, and days claims payable were 49.2 days at the end of the quarter, down marginally from the third quarter, primarily as a result of processing improvements but up over 4 days year-over-year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. Our full year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.5x operating earnings. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing approximately 3 million shares in the quarter for $243 million and distributing approximately $79 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In summary, our fourth quarter results demonstrate the execution of Aetna's growth strategy, the success of the Coventry integration and the value of our diversified portfolio. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our Commercial membership declined by approximately 70,000 members during the quarter, driven by declines in our Individual and Small Group insured books, partially offset by modest ASC membership growth. These results are consistent with our commitment to financially responsible pricing, where we favor margin over membership and price to projected underlying medical cost trends. Our crucial medical benefit ratio was 82% for the quarter and 80.2% for the full year 2014, a good absolute result and consistent with our previous projections despite pressures from an early and more severe flu season. Importantly, the medical cost performance of our core commercial business and specifically, our 51 to 300 employee block, performed consistent with the projections we described on our third quarter 2014 earnings call. Additionally, Aetna's commercial MBR was influenced by our continued prudent stance with regard to our ACA-compliant blocks of business. Based on the most recent data available, we have adjusted our accruals related to the 3Rs during the fourth quarter, specifically, we recorded $176 million of incremental reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $338 million; we recorded additional net payables for the risk adjusters of $78 million, bringing the net full year total to $230 million; and we did not record any risk corridor receivables as of December 31, 2014. However, in select geographies, we have recorded a modest risk corridor payable where our current projections indicate we will be required to contribute to this program. Had we accrued a risk corridor receivable at December 31, our full year 2014 Commercial MBR would have been lower by approximately 20 basis points. Consistent with our Commercial MBR performance, Aetna's standalone 2014 Commercial manager cost trend was in the middle to upper end of our originally projected range of 6% to 7%, in line with our previous projection. 
Moving on from Commercial. Our Government franchise is another important growth lever for our business. As Mark mentioned earlier, our Government business had an outstanding year from both a growth and profitability standpoint and now represents over 40% of our health care premiums. Our Government business grew by 45,000 members in the quarter, primarily due to Medicaid growth of 26,000 members. Aetna's continued government membership growth drove fourth quarter Government premiums to $5.4 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year period. Over Government medical benefit ratio was 84.4% in the quarter, an excellent result in absolute terms and a 260 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this year's excellent performance include favorable prior-period reserve development; the success of actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap, including the health insurer fee; and continuing strong performance in our Medicaid business. Finally, Group Insurance operating earnings were $21.3 million in the quarter compared to $47.9 million in the same quarter of 2013, driven primarily by lower net investment income. For the full year 2014, Group Insurance operating earnings were $171 million, well in excess of 2013 results in our initial full year projections. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 37%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $169 million. We repurchased approximately 3 million shares for $243 million and pay a shareholder dividend of $79 million. After other sources, we ended the quarter with $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349.8 million shares at December 31. 
Moving on to 2015. This morning, we increased our 2015 outlook to at least $7 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $6.90 per share. As a reminder, Aetna's guidance does not include any projections of prior year development. This increased projection reflects the impact of our recently disclosed preferred drug contract for hepatitis C treatments on our Commercial business; higher medical membership than we had previously projected, driven by our solid finish to 2014, and our encouraging early 2015 growth in both our public exchange and Medicare Advantage businesses. These 2 favorable items are partially offset by a projected increase in flu and related costs in 2015 based on the severity of the current flu season. Our 2015 guidance is further influenced by the following drivers. We project that our first quarter medical membership will be approximately 23.5 million members, an increase of approximately 1,000 members versus our previous guidance. Specifically, Aetna's Commercial ASC membership is now projected to decline by approximately 175,000 members, a modest improvement versus our previous guidance. Commercial Insured membership is now projected to be flat to slightly down as compared to year-end 2014, influenced by public and private exchange growth, offset by the previously discussed increase in Small Group renewal activity that occurred in late 2014 rather than in early 2015 and the potential for increased attrition in our smaller Middle Markets and off-exchange Individual businesses. Medicare membership is projected to grow by approximately 120,000 members, comprised of at least 90,000 Medicare Advantage numbers and approximately 30,000 Medicare Supplement members, growth that is again higher than our previous projections. And Medicaid membership is now projected to be better than our previous forecast with other growth almost entirely offsetting the exit from Delaware's Medicaid program. We continue to project full year operating revenue to be at least $62 billion, as the impact of higher-than-projected membership growth on exchanges and Individual Medicare Advantage is projected to be partially offset by the potential for increased attrition in our smaller middle market and off-exchange Individual businesses. We continue to project our full year total health medical benefit ratio to be 82% to 83%. Aetna's 2015 core Commercial Medicare medical cost trend is projected to be in the range of 6% to 7%, reflecting a projected increase in utilization of 50 to 100 basis points over 2014. We project our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. This metric is impacted by the increase in expense related to the ACA fees and taxes, which runs to the SG&A line, increasing the reported SG&A ratio for 2015 by approximately 140 basis points. Our underlying operating expense ratio, excluding these fees and taxes, is projected to show improvement over our 2014 result. We project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.3%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We project operating earnings to be over $2.4 billion. And finally, we project net dividends from subsidiaries to be approximately $1.8 billion as additional capital to support growth is held at the subsidiaries. We continue to project excess cash flow to the parent to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, noting that increased premiums versus our initial projection could push us into the lower half of this range. 
To the extent that current analyst consensus for 2015 contemplates the same quarterly earnings progression Aetna experienced in 2014, especially as it pertains to the first quarter, we would remind investors that the first quarter of 2014 was favorably impacted by severe winter weather and a lower-than-normal flu season, both of which we do not project to recur in 2015. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. I want to reiterate that our 2015 operating EPS projection of at least $7 is a floor and that we are committed to delivering results in excess of this early view. To that end, we remain focused on executing on our exchange strategy, both public and private; delivering on our Government growth strategy; improving the performance of our 51 to 300 employee Commercial block of business; and solving for the incremental ACA fees and taxes. As we continue to execute during this challenging time for our industry, we are confident that we can achieve our 2015 projections and are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at least $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.

I think probably the most important part of what the Government is trying to do is to partner with private sector to get more value-based contracting under way.

We believe it's an important part of the early stages of this program. But some of the activity around the budget process and some of the guidance that came out, frankly, created a degree of uncertainty about the collectibility, and we just didn't feel like we were over the threshold to do that. In addition, I mean there is, on this whole topic, it is really important for everyone to realize what I would call the relative immaturity of the data that pertains to both the base estimates of claim experience, which is still emerging in this new program, but also the data we are using to estimate risk adjusters, is, as you know, from an outside consulting source of gathering industry data, it is certainly not the official data set upon which we will ultimately make that calculation and so there's still a lot of uncertainty.

So I think the real question is whether or not we have private exchange models that are stable.

There's also a lot of work going on in new consumer platform that is very low cost and is modular. And all of that is aimed at connecting those 2 at some point in the future, where we have this consumer platform and exchange and benefit administration platform connected to ACOs and markets that we think is disruptive and a lot of ways to the current models that we see in our marketplace. So that's where the lion's share of the investment is going. However, we continue to invest in Medicare stars and solving the funding gap; Medicaid expansion in the markets, particularly dual-eligibles. In the Commercial business, it's likely toward how do we stream operating costs and make that a better generator of capital for the kinds of investments we want to make the the future in the other items I just mentioned."

And so that all depends on how things work out in Washington. Where we see this private exchange model even more importantly, with the admin platform on the back-end, which most private exchange models do not have.

This morning, Aetna reported record first quarter operating earnings of $2.39 a share, a 21% increase from last year's very strong first quarter. Our first quarter performance speaks",971,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported record first quarter operating earnings of $2.39 a share, a 21% increase from last year's very strong first quarter. Our first quarter performance speaks to Aetna's focus on operating fundamentals and the continued execution of our growth strategy. Specifically, we grew medical membership to 23.7 million members, an increase of over 120,000 members during the quarter. We now project that 2015 will be Aetna's third consecutive year of membership growth. The combination of this membership growth and strong yields from disciplined pricing actions drove solid top line growth, as quarterly operating revenue reached $15.1 billion. Medical cost trends remain moderate, and we experienced a healthy level of reserve development in the quarter and we now project that pretax operating margins will expand in 2015 despite an increasing mix of lower-margin, government-sponsored business. With this strong start to 2015, today, we are increasing our operating EPS projection to $7.20 to $7.40 per share from our previous projection of at least $7. At the top end of the range, Aetna would achieve its low double-digit operating EPS growth goal in 2015. 
With this backdrop, let me discuss some of our businesses in greater detail beginning with our group Commercial business. Operating results from the quarter was solid as the impact of pricing actions in our 51 to 300 employee block of business took hold and improved underwriting margin. Aetna has consistently favored margin over membership in our group Commercial business, and our first quarter results are proof of that commitment to our shareholders. 
Moving on to our Government business. 2015 will represent another year of top line growth in our Medicare business, driven by increased membership. Aetna's Medicare Advantage business added 80,000 members in the quarter, a 12% sequential growth in Individual Medicare Advantage membership. We continue to believe that our success in this business is representative of the quality and value we provide to our members, as demonstrated by our high-performing 4-plus Star-rated plans or 85% of our members reside. Medicare Advantage is an important business for Aetna, and we continue to be encouraged by the support that the administration has shown for this program. It now serves more than 1 in 3 medical eligibles. For the first time in several years, Federal funding for this program will increase in 2016, which we expect will help us to further improve the value we offer to seniors as well as our returns the shareholders. Going forward, the stability and predictability of payment rates as well as risk adjustment and star ratings will be critical in ensuring health plans can continue to provide comprehensive, affordable benefits to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who choose Medicare Advantage plans. 
Continuing with the Government business. Medicaid is a key component of Aetna's long-term growth strategy. And our Medicaid franchise delivered another strong quarter. We continue to be pleased with our ability to win and implement high-acuity contracts, expanding our footprint and bolstering our reputation for excellence in the marketplace. This quarter, we began serving new members as part of our recent launches in Louisiana and New Jersey, and we added over 30,000 members across multiple state programs related to ACA expansion. For 2015, we project that Aetna's Medicaid business will grow revenues by over $1 billion, representing over 15% annual growth while exceeding our target pretax operating margin. 
Shifting to our Individual Commercial business. We have another highly successful open enrollment period in our public exchange business, growing membership to over 950,000 members and exceeding our initial projections. The demographic profile of Aetna's public exchange membership remains generally consistent with last year. While the average age of our membership has declined modestly, the vast majority remains in silver and bronze plans and nearly 90% of our members receive a subsidy from the Federal Government, consistent with national averages. In addition to our public exchange success, we continue to execute on our plans [indiscernible] Individual off-exchange membership to ACA-compliant plan. As a result, we ended the quarter with nearly 1.3 million total Individual members, and we now project that Individual business will represent approximately 6% of our 2015 revenues. We remain cautiously optimistic in the potential for the public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity where we continue to offer value to customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders. 
Finally, as we consider our long-term growth objectives, we continue to focus on several key strategic initiatives. We continue to advance health agenda as it seeks to transform the network model from episodic acute care management to population health management. Value-based contracting now represents approximately 30% of Aetna's medical spend, with a goal to achieve 75% by the end of the decade. 
Our consumer platform continues to develop as we integrate the bswift acquisition and advance our plans to launch a new suite of Individual products in 4 pilot markets in 2016. And international continues to grow exceeding its operating targets this quarter, while continuing to evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth in emerging markets. 
I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering this record-breaking quarter for Aetna. Our people are one of our greatest assets and one that we continue to invest in as evidenced by our recent minimum wage commitments. Building on the strengths of this team, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing health care marketplace. We can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy. We will continue to be disciplined across all our lines of business, and we can achieve our 2015 operating EPS projection of $7.20 to $7.40 per share. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insights into our first quarter results and our updated 2015 outlook. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported record first quarter 2015 operating earnings of $844 million and operating earnings per share of $2.39. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance for the quarter was very good. We grew medical membership to a record 23.7 million members, adding over 120,000 new members during the quarter, with growth in our Government and Commercial businesses. We grew operating revenue by 8% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of $15.1 billion, driven by growth in medical membership as well as higher premium yields. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin exceeded 10%, a very strong result and above our target operating margin range. Our first quarter total medical benefit ratio was 79.1%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate trends and favorable prior year's reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.4%, a 60 basis point increase over the first quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and the inclusion of our 2014 acquisitions in first quarter results. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior year's reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable the fourth quarter 2014 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claim payable were 53.5 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 4 days. The increase in days claims payable was primarily a result of business mix but was also due to payment timing changes associated with pharmacy spend, the latter accounting for approximately 1.5 days of the increase. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows in the first quarter were strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were over 1.8x operating earnings, driven by membership growth and strong operating results. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing over 2 million shares in the quarter for $196 million and distributing another $87 million to our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership grew by 37,000 members during the quarter, exceeding our previous projections. Public exchange membership was the primarily driver of this growth, which was partially offset by declines in our middle-market businesses, a direct result of the previously disclosed pricing actions to improve performance in this block. As we examine our result in Commercial membership base, we continue to be pleased with the early indicators on membership attraction and selection as well as overall performance. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 77.4% for the quarter, an excellent result that benefited from higher premiums, moderate cost trends and strong prior year's reserve development. 
With respect to our ACA-compliant blocks of business, we continue to take a prudent stance on accruing for the 3Rs. Specifically, we accrued $47 million of additional reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, the vast majority of which relates to 2014 dates of service. Aetna's reinsurance recoverable related to 2014 now totals approximately $370 million. For the remainder of 2015, we project that we will record additional recoverables in excess of $400 million related to this program. 
We also recorded additional risk adjuster payables of $198 million during the quarter, roughly 1/4 of which relate to 2014 dates of service, bringing our total payable related to 2014 to $276 million. Based on our current projections, Aetna expects to record incremental net payables in excess of $300 million over the remainder of 2015 related to the risk adjuster program, bringing our total payable related to 2015 to over $450 million. We expect to be able to update our projections for this program with our second quarter 2015 reporting based on information CMS is expected to provide in late June on actual 2014 risk adjuster amounts. Finally, consistent with our year-end reporting, we have not recorded any receivables for the risk corridor program. 
Moving on from the 3Rs. Medical cost trends continue to be moderate. And based on first quarter results, including our previously disclosed preferred drug pricing contracts for hepatitis C treatments, we now project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trends will be in the lower half of our previously projected range of 6% to 7%. Another important growth lever is our Government franchise. Our Government business grew by 85,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 88,000 members, Medicare Supplement grew by over 26,000 members and Medicaid membership declined by 29,000 members. However, underlying Medicaid membership grew by 108,000 members, which was more than offset by our previously disclosed decision to exit our Delaware contract that accounted for 137,000 members. Our first quarter 2015 Government premiums reached a record $5.7 billion, and our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.3% in the quarter. Drivers of this excellent result include: stronger-than-projected membership, revenue and yields; actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap; and strong favorable prior year's reserve development. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of 35%, completing our targeted deleveraging after the Coventry acquisition earlier than our initial commitment. 
Looking at cash and investments as the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $862 million. We reduced outstanding debt by $432 million. We repurchased over 2 million shares for $196 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349 million at March 31. 
As a result of our first quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.20 to $7.40 per share. At the top end of the range, our guidance has increased by $0.40 per share, reflecting favorable operating performance, including the effect of favorable prior year's reserve development. However, certain risks and challenges remained that temper our outlook at this early stage in the year, including: the ever-present concerned that medical cost trends could increased more than we have projected, current low visibility associated with our higher-than-projected public exchange membership and the uncertainty-related the accruals associated with it 3Rs, and the potential for the midyear rate reset in our Kentucky Medicaid contract to pressure performance by more than previously projected. Our updated 2015 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our first quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.7 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including in our Individual businesses. As we consider our year-to-date mix of Commercial membership and the probability of continued delays in the implementation and ramp of our existing duals contracts, we now project full year 2015 operating revenue will be in the range of $61 billion to $62 billion. Based on our strong first quarter results, including the positive impact of prior year reserve development, we now project our full year total medical benefit ratio to be in the range of 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Primarily as a result of our updated revenue projections, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be in excess of 18% for the full year. We now project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.6%, consistent with our high single-digit target with operating earnings at least $2.5 billion. Finally, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of $800 million to $1 billion, and our share count projection remains unchanged. 
Looking back to the beginning of 2014. We had outlined 4 focus areas for our company that would be key to our success: delivering on our government growth strategy, integrating Coventry in achieving or exceeding our synergy targets, collecting or solving for the ACA-mandated fees and taxes, and executing on our exchange strategies both public and private. As we look back on our performance in 2014 and through the first quarter of 2015, we can say with confidence that we achieved and often exceeded our goals across these 4 areas. As we look to the remainder of 2015, many of these focus areas remain unchanged. We are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter results and our improved 2015 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year. Further, we continue to believe we are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at the $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.

Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported record first quarter operating earnings of $2.39 a share, a 21% increase from last year's very strong first quarter.Our first quarter performance speaks",970,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported record first quarter operating earnings of $2.39 a share, a 21% increase from last year's very strong first quarter.
Our first quarter performance speaks to Aetna's focus on operating fundamentals and the continued execution of our growth strategy. Specifically, we grew medical membership to 23.7 million members, an increase of over 120,000 members during the quarter. We now project that 2015 will be Aetna's third consecutive year of membership growth.
The combination of this membership growth and strong yields from disciplined pricing actions drove solid top line growth, as quarterly operating revenue reached $15.1 billion. Medical cost trends remain moderate, and we experienced a healthy level of reserve development in the quarter. And we now project that pretax operating margins will expand in 2015, despite an increasing mix of lower-margin, government-sponsored business.
With this strong start to 2015, today, we are increasing our operating EPS projection to $7.20 to $7.40 per share from our previous projection of at least $7. At the top end of the range, Aetna would achieve its low double-digit operating EPS growth goal in 2015.
With this backdrop, let me discuss some of our businesses in greater detail, beginning with our group Commercial business. Operating results from the quarter was solid, as the impact of pricing actions in our 51 to 300 employee block of business took hold and improved underwriting margins. Aetna has consistently favored margin over membership in our group Commercial business, and our first quarter results are proof of that commitment to our shareholders.
Moving on to our Government business. 2015 will represent another year of top line growth in our Medicare business, driven by increased membership. Aetna's Medicare Advantage business added 88,000 members in the quarter, a 12% sequential growth in Individual Medicare Advantage membership. We continue to believe that our success in this business is representative of the quality and value we provide to our members, as demonstrated by our high-performing 4-plus star-rated plans, where 85% of our members reside.
Medicare Advantage is an important business for Aetna, and we continue to be encouraged by the support that the administration has shown for this program. It now serves nearly 1 in 3 Medicare eligibles.
For the first time in several years, Federal funding for this program will increase in 2016, which we expect will help us to further improve the value we offer to seniors, as well as our returns to shareholders. Going forward, the stability and predictability of payment rates, as well as risk adjustment and star ratings, will be critical in ensuring health plans can continue to provide comprehensive, affordable benefits to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who choose Medicare Advantage plans.
Continuing with the Government business. Medicaid is a key component of Aetna's long-term growth strategy, and our Medicaid franchise delivered another solid quarter. We continue to be pleased with our ability to win and implement high-acuity contracts, expanding our footprint and bolstering our reputation for excellence in the marketplace.
This quarter, we began serving new members as part of our recent launches in Louisiana and New Jersey, and we added over 30,000 members across multiple state programs related to ACA expansion. For 2015, we project that Aetna's Medicaid business will grow revenues by over $1 billion, representing over 15% annual growth, while exceeding our target pretax operating margin.
Shifting to our Individual Commercial business. We have another highly successful open enrollment period in our public exchange business, growing membership to over 950,000 members and exceeding our initial projections. The demographic profile of Aetna's public exchange membership remains generally consistent with last year. While the average age of our membership has declined modestly, the vast majority remains in silver and bronze plans, and nearly 90% of our members receive a subsidy from the Federal Government, consistent with national averages.
In addition to our public exchange success, we continue to execute on our plans [indiscernible] Individual off-exchange membership to ACA-compliant plan. As a result, we ended the quarter with nearly 1.3 million total individual members, and we now project that the Individual business will represent approximately 6% of our 2015 revenues. We remain cautiously optimistic on the potential for the public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity, where we can continue to offer value to customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders.
Finally, as we consider our long-term growth objectives, we continue to focus on several key strategic initiatives. We continue to advance Healthagen, as it seeks to transform the network model from episodic acute care management to population health management. Value-based contracting now represents approximately 30% of Aetna's medical spend, with a goal to achieve 75% by the end of the decade.
Our consumer platform continues to develop as we integrate the bswift acquisition and advance our plans to launch a new suite of Individual products in 4 pilot markets in 2016. And international continues to grow, exceeding its operating targets this quarter, while continuing to evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth in emerging markets.
I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering this record-breaking quarter for Aetna. Our people are one of our greatest assets and one that we continue to invest in, as evidenced by our recent minimum wage commitments. Building on the strengths of this team, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing healthcare marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, we will continue to be disciplined across all our lines of business and we can achieve our 2015 operating EPS projection of $7.20 to $7.40 per share.
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insights into our first quarter results and our updated 2015 outlook. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported record first quarter 2015 operating earnings of $844 million and operating earnings per share of $2.39. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, ca",1526,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported record first quarter 2015 operating earnings of $844 million and operating earnings per share of $2.39. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow and operating margins.
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance for the quarter was very good. We grew medical membership to a record 23.7 million members, adding over 120,000 new members during the quarter, with growth in our Government and Commercial businesses. We grew operating revenue by 8% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of $15.1 billion, driven by growth in medical membership, as well as higher premium yields.
From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin exceeded 10%, a very strong result and above our target operating margin range. Our first quarter total medical benefit ratio was 79.1%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate trends and favorable prior year's reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.4%, a 60 basis point increase over the first quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and the inclusion of our 2014 acquisitions in the first quarter results.
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior year's reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to fourth quarter 2014 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claims payable were 53.5 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 4 days. The increase in days claims payable was primarily a result of business mix, but was also due to payment timing changes associated with pharmacy spend, the latter accounting for approximately 1.5 days of the increase.
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows in the first quarter were strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were over 1.8x operating earnings, driven by membership growth and strong operating results. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing over 2 million shares in the quarter for $196 million and distributing another $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.
In short, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy.
I will now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership grew by 37,000 members during the quarter, exceeding our previous projections. Public exchange membership was the primarily driver of this growth, which was partially offset by declines in our middle-market businesses, a direct result of the previously disclosed pricing actions to improve performance in this block.
As we examine our result in Commercial membership base, we continue to be pleased with the early indicators on membership attraction and selection, as well as overall performance. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 77.4% for the quarter, an excellent result that benefited from higher premiums, moderate cost trends and strong prior year's reserve development.
With respect to our ACA-compliant blocks of business, we continue to take a prudent stance on accruing for the 3Rs. Specifically, we accrued $47 million of additional reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, the vast majority of which relates to 2014 dates of service. Aetna's reinsurance recoverable related to 2014 now totals approximately $370 million. For the remainder of 2015, we project that we will record additional recoverables in excess of $400 million related to this program.
We also recorded additional risk adjuster payables of $198 million during the quarter, roughly 1/4 of which relate to 2014 dates of service, bringing our total payable related to 2014 to $276 million. Based on our current projections, Aetna expects to record incremental net payables in excess of $300 million over the remainder of 2015 related to the risk-adjuster program, bringing our total payable related to 2015 to over $450 million.
We expect to be able to update our projections for this program with our second quarter 2015 reporting based on information CMS is expected to provide in late June on actual 2014 risk adjuster amounts. Finally, consistent with our year-end reporting, we have not recorded any receivables for the risk corridor program.
Moving on from the 3Rs. Medical cost trends continue to be moderate. And based on first quarter results, including our previously disclosed preferred drug pricing contract for hepatitis C treatments, we now project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trends will be in the lower half of our previously projected range of 6% to 7%.
Another important growth lever is our Government franchise. Our Government business grew by 85,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 88,000 members, Medicare Supplement grew by over 26,000 members and Medicaid membership declined by 29,000 members. However, underlying Medicaid membership grew by 108,000 members, which was more than offset by our previously disclosed decision to exit our Delaware contract that accounted for 137,000 members.
Our first quarter 2015 Government premiums reached a record $5.7 billion, and our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.3% in the quarter. Drivers of this excellent result include: stronger-than-projected membership, revenue and yields; actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap; and strong favorable prior year's reserve development.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of 35%, completing our targeted deleveraging after the Coventry acquisition earlier than our initial commitment.
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $862 million. We reduced outstanding debt by $432 million. We repurchased over 2 million shares for $196 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349 million at March 31.
As a result of our first quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.20 to $7.40 per share. At the top end of the range, our guidance has increased by $0.40 per share, reflecting favorable operating performance, including the effect of favorable prior year's reserve development.
However, certain risks and challenges remain that temper our outlook at this early stage in the year, including: the ever-present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected; current low visibility associated with our higher-than-projected public exchange membership and the uncertainty related to accruals associated with the 3Rs; and the potential for the midyear rate reset in our Kentucky Medicaid contract to pressure performance by more than previously projected.
Our updated 2015 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our first quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.7 million members, as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including in our Individual business.
As we consider our year-to-date mix of Commercial membership and the probability of continued delays in the implementation and ramp of our existing duals contracts, we now project full year 2015 operating revenue will be in the range of $61 billion to $62 billion. Based on our strong first quarter results, including the positive impact of prior year reserve development, we now project our full year total medical benefit ratio to be in the range of 82%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Primarily as a result of our updated revenue projections, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be in excess of 18% for the full year. We now project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.6%, consistent with our high single-digit target, with operating earnings at least $2.5 billion. Finally, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of $800 million to $1 billion, and our share count projection remains unchanged.
Looking back to the beginning of 2014, we had outlined 4 focus areas for our company that would be key to our success: Delivering on our Government growth strategy; integrating Coventry in achieving or exceeding our synergy targets; collecting or solving for the ACA-mandated fees and taxes; and executing on our exchange strategies, both public and private.
As we look back on our performance in 2014 and through the first quarter of 2015, we can say with confidence that we achieved and often exceeded our goals across these 4 areas. As we look to the remainder of 2015, many of these focus areas remain unchanged. We are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter results and our improved 2015 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year. Further, we continue to believe we are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at least $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?"

Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported record first quarter operating earnings of $2.39 a share, a 21% increase from last year's very strong first quarter.Our first quarter performance speaks",971,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported record first quarter operating earnings of $2.39 a share, a 21% increase from last year's very strong first quarter.
Our first quarter performance speaks to Aetna's focus on operating fundamentals and the continued execution of our growth strategy. Specifically, we grew medical membership to 23.7 million members, an increase of over 120,000 members during the quarter. We now project that 2015 will be Aetna's third consecutive year of membership growth.
The combination of this membership growth and strong yields from disciplined pricing actions drove solid top line growth as quarterly operating revenue reached $15.1 billion. Medical cost trends remain moderate, and we experienced a healthy level of reserve development in the quarter. And we now project that pretax operating margins will expand in 2015 despite an increasing mix of lower-margin, government-sponsored business.
With this strong start to 2015, today, we are increasing our operating EPS projection to $7.20 to $7.40 per share from our previous projection of at least $7. At the top end of the range, Aetna would achieve its low double-digit operating EPS growth goal in 2015.
With this backdrop, let me discuss some of our businesses in greater detail, beginning with our group Commercial business. Operating results from the quarter were solid as the impact of pricing actions in our 51-300 employee block of business took hold and improved underwriting margin. Aetna has consistently favored margin over membership in our group Commercial business, and our first quarter results are proof of that commitment to our shareholders.
Moving on to our Government business. 2015 will represent another year of top line growth in our Medicare business driven by increased membership. Aetna's Medicare Advantage business added 88,000 members in the quarter with 12% sequential growth in Individual Medicare Advantage membership. We continue to believe that our success in this business is representative of the quality and value we provide to our members as demonstrated by our high-performing 4-plus star-rated plans, where 85% of our members reside.
Medicare Advantage is an important business for Aetna, and we continue to be encouraged by the support that the administration has shown for this program. It now serves nearly 1 in 3 Medicare eligibles.
For the first time in several years, federal funding for this program will increase in 2016, which we expect will help us to further improve the value we offer to seniors as well as our returns to shareholders. Going forward, the stability and predictability of payment rates as well as risk adjustment and star ratings will be critical in ensuring health plans can continue to provide comprehensive, affordable benefits to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who choose Medicare Advantage plans.
Continuing with the Government business. Medicaid is a key component of Aetna's long-term growth strategy, and our Medicaid franchise delivered another solid quarter. We continue to be pleased with our ability to win and implement high-acuity contracts, expanding our footprint and bolstering our reputation for excellence in the market place.
This quarter, we began serving new members as part of our recent launches in Louisiana and New Jersey, and we added over 30,000 members across multiple state programs related to ACA expansion. For 2015, we project that Aetna's Medicaid business will grow revenues by over $1 billion representing over 15% annual growth while exceeding our target pretax operating margin.
Shifting to our individual Commercial business. We had another highly successful open-enrollment period in our public exchange business, growing membership to over 950,000 members and exceeding our initial projections. The demographic profile of Aetna's public exchange membership remains generally consistent with last year. While the average age of our membership has declined modestly, the vast majority remains in Silver and Bronze plans, and nearly 90% of our members receive a subsidy from the federal government, consistent with national averages.
In addition to our public exchange success, we continue to execute on our plans to transition our [ph] individual off-exchange membership to ACA-compliant plans. As a result, we ended the quarter with nearly 1.3 million total individual members, and we now project that the individual business will represent approximately 6% of our 2015 revenues. We remain cautiously optimistic on the potential for the public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity where we can continue to offer value to customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders.
Finally, as we consider our long-term growth objectives, we continue to focus on several key strategic initiatives. We continue to advance Healthagen as it seeks to transform the network model from episodic acute care management to population health management. Value-based contracting now represents approximately 30% of Aetna's medical spend with a goal to achieve 75% by the end of the decade.
Our Consumer platform continues to develop as we integrate the bswift acquisition and advance our plans to launch a new suite of individual products in 4 pilot markets in 2016. And International continues to grow, exceeding its operating targets this quarter while continuing to evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth in emerging markets.
I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering this record-breaking quarter for Aetna. Our people are one of our greatest assets and one that we continue to invest in as evidenced by our recent minimum-wage commitments. Building on the strengths of this team, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing health-care market place; we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy; we will continue to be disciplined across all our lines of business; and we can achieve our 2015 operating EPS projection of $7.20 to $7.40 per share.
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insights into our first quarter results and our updated 2015 outlook. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported record first quarter 2015 operating earnings of $844 million and operating earnings per share of $2.39. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, ca",1528,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported record first quarter 2015 operating earnings of $844 million and operating earnings per share of $2.39. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow and operating margins.
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance for the quarter was very good. We grew medical membership to a record 23.7 million members adding over 120,000 new members during the quarter with growth in our Government and Commercial businesses. We grew operating revenue by 8% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of $15.1 billion, driven by growth in medical membership as well as higher premium yields.
From an operating-margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin exceeded 10%, a very strong result and above our target operating margin range. Our first quarter total medical benefit ratio was 79.1%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate trends and favorable prior years' reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.4%, a 60 basis point increase over the first quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and the inclusion of our 2014 acquisitions in first quarter results.
From a balance-sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior years' reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to fourth quarter 2014 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claims payable were 53.5 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 4 days. The increase in days claims payable was primarily a result of business mix but was also due to payment timing changes associated with pharmacy spend, the latter accounting for approximately 1.5 days of the increase.
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows in the first quarter were strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were over 1.8x operating earnings driven by membership growth and strong operating results. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing over 2 million shares in the quarter for $196 million and distributing another $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.
In short, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy.
I will now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership grew by 37,000 members during the quarter, exceeding our previous projections. Public exchange membership was the primary driver of this growth, which was partially offset by declines in our middle-market businesses, a direct result of the previously disclosed pricing actions to improve performance in this block.
As we examine our result in Commercial membership base, we continue to be pleased with the early indicators on membership attraction and selection as well as overall performance. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 77.4% for the quarter, an excellent result that benefited from higher premiums, moderate cost trends and strong prior years' reserve development.
With respect to our ACA-compliant blocks of business, we continue to take a prudent stance on accruing for the 3Rs. Specifically, we accrued $47 million of additional reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, the vast majority of which relates to 2014 dates of service. Aetna's reinsurance recoverable related to 2014 now totals approximately $370 million. For the remainder of 2015, we project that we will record additional recoverables in excess of $400 million related to this program.
We also recorded additional risk adjuster payables of $198 million during the quarter, roughly 1/4 of which relate to 2014 dates of service, bringing our total payable related to 2014 to $276 million. Based on our current projections, Aetna expects to record incremental net payables in excess of $300 million over the remainder of 2015 related to the risk adjuster program, bringing our total payable related to 2015 to over $450 million.
We expect to be able to update our projections for this program with our second quarter 2015 reporting based on information CMS is expected to provide in late June on actual 2014 risk adjuster amounts. Finally, consistent with our year end reporting, we have not recorded any receivables for the risk corridor program.
Moving on from the 3Rs. Medical cost trends continue to be moderate, and based on first quarter results, including our previously disclosed preferred drug pricing contract for hepatitis C treatments, we now project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trends will be in the lower half of our previously projected range of 6% to 7%.
Another important growth lever is our Government franchise. Our Government business grew by 85,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 88,000 members, Medicare Supplement grew by over 26,000 members and Medicaid membership declined by 29,000 members. However, underlying Medicaid membership grew by 108,000 members, which was more than offset by our previously disclosed decision to exit our Delaware contract that accounted for 137,000 members.
Our first quarter 2015 Government premiums reached a record $5.7 billion, and our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.3% in the quarter. Drivers of this excellent result include stronger-than-projected membership, revenue and yields; actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap; and strong favorable prior year's reserve development.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31, we had a ""debt to total capitalization"" ratio of 35%, completing our targeted deleveraging after the Coventry acquisition earlier than our initial commitment.
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $862 million. We reduced outstanding debt by $432 million. We repurchased over 2 million shares for $196 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349 million at March 31.
As a result of our first quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.20 to $7.40 per share. At the top end of the range, our guidance has increased by $0.40 per share, reflecting favorable operating performance, including the effect of favorable prior years' reserve development.
However, certain risks and challenges remain that temper our outlook at this early stage in the year, including the ever-present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected, current low visibility associated with our higher-than-projected public exchange membership and the uncertainty related to accruals associated with the 3Rs, and the potential for the midyear rate reset in our Kentucky Medicaid contract to pressure performance by more than previously projected.
Our updated 2015 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers: Based on our first quarter membership results, we now project that our year end medical membership will be approximately 23.7 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial insured membership, including in our Individual business.
As we consider our year-to-date mix of Commercial membership and the probability of continued delays in implementation and ramp of our existing duals contracts, we now project full year 2015 operating revenue will be in the range of $61 billion to $62 billion. Based on our strong first quarter results, including the positive impact of prior year reserve development, we now project our full year total medical benefit ratio to be in the range of 82% plus or minus 50 basis points. Primarily as a result of our updated revenue projections, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be in excess of 18% for the full year. We now project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.6%, consistent with our high-single-digit target with operating earnings of at least $2.5 billion. Finally, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of $800 million to $1 billion, and our share count projection remains unchanged.
Looking back to the beginning of 2014, we had outlined 4 focus areas for our company that would be key to our success: Delivering on our Government growth strategy; integrating Coventry and achieving or exceeding our synergy targets; collecting or solving for the ACA-mandated fees and taxes; and executing on our exchange strategies, both public and private.
As we look back on our performance in 2014 and through the first quarter of 2015, we can say with confidence that we achieved and often exceeded our goals across these 4 areas. As we look to the remainder of 2015, many of these focus areas remain unchanged. We are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter results and our improved 2015 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year. Further, we continue to believe we are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at least $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.

This morning, Aetna reported record first quarter operating earnings of $2.39 a share, a 21% increase from last year's very strong first quarter.Our first quarter performance speaks t",975,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported record first quarter operating earnings of $2.39 a share, a 21% increase from last year's very strong first quarter.
Our first quarter performance speaks to Aetna's focus on operating fundamentals and the continued execution of our growth strategy. Specifically, we grew medical membership to 23.7 million members, an increase of over 120,000 members during the quarter. We now project that 2015 will be Aetna's third consecutive year of membership growth.
The combination of this membership growth and strong yields from disciplined pricing actions drove solid top line growth as quarterly operating revenue reached $15.1 billion. Medical cost trends remain moderate, and we experienced a healthy level of reserve development in the quarter. And we now project that pretax operating margins will expand in 2015 despite an increasing mix of lower-margin, government-sponsored business.
With this strong start to 2015, today, we are increasing our operating EPS projection to $7.20 to $7.40 per share from our previous projection of at least $7. At the top end of the range, Aetna would achieve its low double-digit operating EPS growth goal in 2015.
With this backdrop, let me discuss some of our businesses in greater detail, beginning with our group Commercial business. Operating results from the quarter were solid as the impact of pricing actions in our 51 to 300 employee block of business took hold and improved underwriting margin. Aetna has consistently favored margin over membership in our group Commercial business, and our first quarter results are proof of that commitment to our shareholders.
Moving on to our Government business. 2015 will represent another year of top line growth in our Medicare business driven by increased membership. Aetna's Medicare Advantage business added 88,000 members in the quarter with 12% sequential growth in Individual Medicare Advantage membership. We continue to believe that our success in this business is representative of the quality and value we provide to our members as demonstrated by our high-performing 4-plus star-rated plans, where 85% of our members reside.
Medicare Advantage is an important business for Aetna, and we continue to be encouraged by the support that the administration has shown for this program. It now serves nearly 1 in 3 Medicare eligibles.
For the first time in several years, federal funding for this program will increase in 2016, which we expect will help us to further improve the value we offer to seniors as well as our returns to shareholders. Going forward, the stability and predictability of payment rates as well as risk adjustment and star ratings will be critical in ensuring health plans can continue to provide comprehensive, affordable benefits to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who choose Medicare Advantage plans.
Continuing with the Government business. Medicaid is a key component of Aetna's long-term growth strategy, and our Medicaid franchise delivered another solid quarter. We continue to be pleased with our ability to win and implement high-acuity contracts, expanding our footprint and bolstering our reputation for excellence in the market place.
This quarter, we began serving new members as part of our recent launches in Louisiana and New Jersey, and we added over 30,000 members across multiple state programs related to ACA expansion. For 2015, we project that Aetna's Medicaid business will grow revenues by over $1 billion representing over 15% annual growth while exceeding our target pretax operating margin.
Shifting to our individual Commercial business. We had another highly successful open enrollment period in our public exchange business, growing membership to over 950,000 members and exceeding our initial projections. The demographic profile of Aetna's public exchange membership remains generally consistent with last year. While the average age of our membership has declined modestly, the vast majority remains in silver and bronze plans, and nearly 90% of our members receive a subsidy from the federal government, consistent with national averages.
In addition to our public exchange success, we continue to execute on our plans to transition our [ph] individual off-exchange membership to ACA-compliant plans. As a result, we ended the quarter with nearly 1.3 million total individual members, and we now project that the individual business will represent approximately 6% of our 2015 revenues. We remain cautiously optimistic on the potential for the public exchanges to develop into an attractive growth opportunity where we can continue to offer value to customers and generate a reasonable return for our shareholders.
Finally, as we consider our long-term growth objectives, we continue to focus on several key strategic initiatives. We continue to advance Healthagen as it seeks to transform the network model from episodic acute care management to population health management. Value-based contracting now represents approximately 30% of Aetna's medical spend with a goal to achieve 75% by the end of the decade.
Our consumer platform continues to develop as we integrate the bswift acquisition and advance our plans to launch a new suite of individual products in 4 pilot markets in 2016. And International continues to grow, exceeding its operating targets this quarter while continuing to evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth in emerging markets.
I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering this record-breaking quarter for Aetna. Our people are one of our greatest assets and one that we continue to invest in as evidenced by our recent minimum-wage commitments. Building on the strengths of this team, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing health care market place; we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy; we will continue to be disciplined across all our lines of business; and we can achieve our 2015 operating EPS projection of $7.20 to $7.40 per share.
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insights into our first quarter results and our updated 2015 outlook. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported record first quarter 2015 operating earnings of $844 million and operating earnings per share of $2.39. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, ca",1529,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported record first quarter 2015 operating earnings of $844 million and operating earnings per share of $2.39. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow and operating margins.
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance for the quarter was very good. We grew medical membership to a record 23.7 million members adding over 120,000 new members during the quarter with growth in our Government and Commercial businesses. We grew operating revenue by 8% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of $15.1 billion, driven by growth in medical membership as well as higher premium yields.
From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin exceeded 10%, a very strong result and above our target operating margin range. Our first quarter total medical benefit ratio was 79.1%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate trends and favorable prior years' reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.4%, a 60 basis point increase over the first quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and the inclusion of our 2014 acquisitions in first quarter results.
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior years' reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to fourth quarter 2014 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claims payable were 53.5 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 4 days. The increase in days claims payable was primarily a result of business mix but was also due to payment timing changes associated with pharmacy spend, the latter accounting for approximately 1.5 days of the increase.
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows in the first quarter were strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were over 1.8x operating earnings driven by membership growth and strong operating results. We also continue to aggressively deploy capital to create shareholder value, repurchasing over 2 million shares in the quarter for $196 million and distributing another $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend.
In short, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy.
I will now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership grew by 37,000 members during the quarter, exceeding our previous projections. Public exchange membership was the primary driver of this growth, which was partially offset by declines in our middle-market businesses, a direct result of the previously disclosed pricing actions to improve performance in this block.
As we examine our result in Commercial membership base, we continue to be pleased with the early indicators on membership attraction and selection as well as overall performance. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 77.4% for the quarter, an excellent result that benefited from higher premiums, moderate cost trends and strong prior years' reserve development.
With respect to our ACA-compliant blocks of business, we continue to take a prudent stance on accruing for the 3Rs. Specifically, we accrued $47 million of additional reinsurance recoverable during the quarter, the vast majority of which relates to 2014 dates of service. Aetna's reinsurance recoverable related to 2014 now totals approximately $370 million. For the remainder of 2015, we project that we will record additional recoverables in excess of $400 million related to this program.
We also recorded additional risk adjuster payables of $198 million during the quarter, roughly 1/4 of which relate to 2014 dates of service, bringing our total payable related to 2014 to $276 million. Based on our current projections, Aetna expects to record incremental net payables in excess of $300 million over the remainder of 2015 related to the risk adjuster program, bringing our total payable related to 2015 to over $450 million.
We expect to be able to update our projections for this program with our second quarter 2015 reporting based on information CMS is expected to provide in late June on actual 2014 risk adjuster amounts. Finally, consistent with our year-end reporting, we have not recorded any receivables for the risk corridor program.
Moving on from the 3Rs. Medical cost trends continue to be moderate, and based on first quarter results, including our previously disclosed preferred drug pricing contract for hepatitis C treatments, we now project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trends will be in the lower half of our previously projected range of 6% to 7%.
Another important growth lever is our Government franchise. Our Government business grew by 85,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 88,000 members, Medicare Supplement grew by over 26,000 members and Medicaid membership declined by 29,000 members. However, underlying Medicaid membership grew by 108,000 members, which was more than offset by our previously disclosed decision to exit our Delaware contract that accounted for 137,000 members.
Our first quarter 2015 Government premiums reached a record $5.7 billion, and our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.3% in the quarter. Drivers of this excellent result include stronger-than-projected membership, revenue and yields; actions designed to solve for the Medicare Advantage funding gap; and strong favorable prior year's reserve development.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31, we had a ""debt to total capitalization"" ratio of 35%, completing our targeted deleveraging after the Coventry acquisition earlier than our initial commitment.
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $862 million. We reduced outstanding debt by $432 million. We repurchased over 2 million shares for $196 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent, representing our core liquidity. Our basic share count was 349 million at March 31.
As a result of our first quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.20 to $7.40 per share. At the top end of the range, our guidance has increased by $0.40 per share, reflecting favorable operating performance, including the effect of favorable prior years' reserve development.
However, certain risks and challenges remain that temper our outlook at this early stage in the year, including the ever-present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected, current low visibility associated with our higher-than-projected public exchange membership and the uncertainty related to accruals associated with the 3Rs, and the potential for the midyear rate reset in our Kentucky Medicaid contract to pressure performance by more than previously projected.
Our updated 2015 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers: Based on our first quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.7 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial insured membership, including in our Individual business.
As we consider our year-to-date mix of Commercial membership and the probability of continued delays in implementation and ramp of our existing duals contracts, we now project full year 2015 operating revenue will be in the range of $61 billion to $62 billion. Based on our strong first quarter results, including the positive impact of prior year reserve development, we now project our full year total medical benefit ratio to be in the range of 82% plus or minus 50 basis points. Primarily as a result of our updated revenue projections, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be in excess of 18% for the full year. We now project pretax operating margin to be at least 7.6%, consistent with our high single-digit target with operating earnings of at least $2.5 billion. Finally, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of $800 million to $1 billion, and our share count projection remains unchanged.
Looking back to the beginning of 2014, we had outlined 4 focus areas for our company that would be key to our success: Delivering on our Government growth strategy; integrating Coventry and achieving or exceeding our synergy targets; collecting or solving for the ACA-mandated fees and taxes; and executing on our exchange strategies, both public and private.
As we look back on our performance in 2014 and through the first quarter of 2015, we can say with confidence that we achieved and often exceeded our goals across these 4 areas. As we look to the remainder of 2015, many of these focus areas remain unchanged. We are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter results and our improved 2015 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year. Further, we continue to believe we are well positioned to attain our 2018 goals of at least $80 billion in operating revenue and $10 in operating EPS.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?"

This morning, Aetna reported strong second quarter operating earnings of $2.05 per share, a 21% increase from last year second quarter. Underlying our second quarter results are sound operating fundamentals as evidenced by: record quarterly operating revenue of over $15.1 billion; medical cost trends that remained moderate and drove a healthy level of reserve development in the quarter; the total medical benefit ratio that improved 200 basis points year-over-year; and pretax operating margins of 8.7%, an improvement of 110 basis points over last year's second quarter. Based on our strong second quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 operating EPS guidance to at least $7.40 per share, eliminating the bottom end of our previous range and recognizing the potential for meaningful upside in our full year outlook, particularly as we contemplate our continuing prudent stance on accruing for the 3Rs. 
This quarter is the sixth quarter in a row that we have increased our operating EPS projection. Even at the minimum performance level we are projecting, our updated guidance represents over 10% year-over-year operating EPS growth, consistent with our low double-digit, long-term operating EPS growth target. In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and improved outlook. But first, I am going to re-emphasize the rationale behind our proposed acquisition of Humana and briefly discuss some of the operational highlights of the quarter. In early July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Humana. The combination will create one of the country's largest managed care companies, with strong membership physicians across multiple lines of business. We believe the strategic acquisition is very compelling, will provide significant value to customers and deliver attractive returns for shareholders. Specifically, the acquisition will substantially accelerate our ability to grow in Medicare Advantage. Aetna's current Medicare Advantage footprint covers approximately 45% of the Medicare-eligible population. The combined company serve 4.4 million Medicare Advantage members, representing 8% of today's 54 million Medicare beneficiaries and will expand our geographic footprint to cover approximately 90% of the Medicare-eligible population. This expanded reach will increase our ability to continue to offer high-quality products to customers and capitalize on the projected growth of Medicare programs. We believe there's an opportunity to improve the performance of Humana's Commercial and Medicaid businesses by deploying our strong capabilities in both these areas. The combination will reduce cost, which will enable the combined company to provide more cost-effective products to consumers. Humana's significant investment in consumer engagement, as evidenced by their industry-leading Net Promoter Score and Medicare Advantage Star Ratings, will enhance our own consumer engagement efforts. The combination brings together 2 companies with a shared vision of enabling providers to transition from episodic care to a population health model. And finally, the Humana acquisition adds a growing services business and reintroduces certain PBN capabilities to our portfolio, providing longer-term optionality to create a high-growth, high-margin, nonregulated cash flow stream. All of these strategic benefits are accomplished in the transaction that is financially compelling and projected to be accretive not only to earnings per share but to our operating EPS growth rate. 
Moving on to second quarter highlights. Beginning with our group Commercial business. Operating results for our Large Group Commercial business was strong in the second quarter. We continue to favor margin over membership in this business, producing strong operating margins and predictable capital generation that enables the investments needed to drive our long-term growth strategy. While the quarterly operating performance of our Small Group and Individual businesses was impacted by the official CMS calculations on risk adjusters, we continue to be pleased with the underlying performance across these blocks of business and how they are positioned for 2016. 
Moving on, our Government business had another standout quarter. Starting with Medicare, we increased Medicare medical membership by 24,000 members during the quarter, driven by Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage. We continue to believe that Medicare is one of the most attractive growth opportunities for our company and our industry. Year-to-date, Aetna's Medicare Advantage revenues have increased by 12% over the same period last year, and we are on track to achieve mid-single-digit pretax operating margins in this business this year. Our Medicaid business also delivered another strong quarter of results. We grew medical membership by 42,000 members across multiple state programs and delivered pretax operating margins near the high end of our targeted range for this business. While the ramp in the duals demonstration programs continues to lag our expectations, we believe in the long-term opportunity of the duals program as well as the opportunity to serve other additional high acuity populations. Finally, we continued to make progress in both our provider and consumer engagement efforts during the quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 2015 goals in these areas and are excited by the opportunity to accelerate these efforts through the Humana acquisition. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong quarter for Aetna. I am confident we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing healthcare marketplace. We can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy. We will continue to be disciplined across all of our lines of business. We will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, and we can exceed $7.40 of operating earnings per share in 2015. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our second quarter results, our updated 2015 outlook and the financial aspects of our proposed Humana acquisition. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $722 million and operating earnings per share of $2.05.

Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $722 million and operating earnings per share of $2.05. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance for the quarter was solid. Medical membership held steady at approximately 23.7 million members as growth in Commercial ASC and Government membership offset declines in our Small Group and Middle Market Commercial Insured businesses. We grew operating revenue to a record quarterly level of over $15.1 billion, driven by higher premium yields and year-over-year growth in medical membership. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.7% for the quarter, 110 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our second quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.3%, a 70 basis point increase over the second quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and lower-than-projected operating revenue. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all our core products primarily attributable the first quarter 2015 dates of service. Additionally, our days claims payable were approximately 52 days at the end of the quarter. While sequentially lower, this metric is at a healthy level, and the expected decline is consistent with improved processing times and our insured membership growth profile in the second quarter. Note that our days claims payable has increased by over 4 days as compared to prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were over 1.2x operating earnings. We continue to project that our full year 2015 Health Care and growth insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2015 operating earnings. Our share repurchases during the quarter were constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition. We did, however, repurchase over 900,000 shares in the quarter for $100 million and distributed another $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. As disclosed previously, our ability to repurchase shares prior to the closing of the Humana acquisition will be limited. In summary, we are quite pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership declined by 61,000 members during the quarter, as declines in our Commercial Insured business more than offset gains in our Commercial ASC membership. The declines in Commercial Insured membership were largely driven by our Small Group and middle market businesses, a direct result of the previously disclosed pricing actions to improve performance in this block. Attrition in our Individual business was consistent with our previously communicated projections. As we continue to monitor our Commercial membership base, we remain pleased with the indicators on membership attraction and selection as well as overall performance. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.8% for the quarter, a 120 basis point increase over the same period last year on a reported basis. However, it is important to note, the year-over-year increase in our reported Commercial MBR is essentially a timing issue reflecting our updated view on ACA risk adjustment payables. Simply stated, if we remove all 3R adjustments booked in the second quarter but related to prior periods, our second quarter 2015 Commercial MBR would have been essentially equivalent to our second quarter 2014 Commercial MBR. This underlying performance is consistent with our projections for the quarter and leaves us well positioned in the Commercial business over the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. It is also worth noting that as of the end of Q2, we have not booked any receivable related to risk corridors for either 2014 or 2015. 
Moving on from the 3Rs. Medical cost trends continue to be moderate, and based on year-to-date experience, we now project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial Medicare cost trends will be at the low end of our projected range of 6% to 7%. Another important growth lever is our Government business, which grew by 66,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 5,000 members, Medicare Supplement grew by 19,000 members and Medicaid membership also grew by 42,000 members. Of note, Medicare membership is now up 4% year-over-year despite the exit from the Delaware Medicaid contract at the end of last year. Our second quarter 2015 government premiums were $5.7 billion, and our government medical benefit ratio was 80.3% in the quarter, a 620 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this excellent result include: excellent performance in Medicare, a demonstration of operating improvements in our Individual Medicare Advantage business, including strong revenue performance and continued favorable medical cost trends as our initiatives to lower cost continue to exceed our projections; continued strong performance in our Group Medicare Advantage business as well as improved margins in our PDP businesses as our product redesign and network recontracting efforts improved margins versus the prior year quarter. Additionally, we saw continued strong performance in Medicaid, driven by favorable prior-period reserve development and continued improvement in a select number of our Medicaid contracts. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 34%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends for the parent were $576 million. We reduced outstanding debt by approximately $300 million. We repurchased over 900,000 shares for $100 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 349 million at June 30. As a result of our second quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to at least $7.40 per share. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where we have met or exceeded consensus and increased guidance. This guidance increase also speaks to the strength of the underlying business as we are overcoming headwinds related to: an updated view of ACA risk adjuster payments, a larger-than-projected rate decrease in Kentucky and a higher weighted average share count than contemplated in our previous projections. Further, our updated guidance formulation where we have provided a minimum projected performance level acknowledges that there could be meaningful upside opportunities to our projections over the remainder of the year, including accrual of 2014 and 2015 risk corridor receivables. Our current estimates indicate that we could be owed well in excess of $100 million related to 2014 alone. We expect we will have some additional clarity on this program in mid-August. Actions taken to better understand the health of our ACA-compliant populations, which could lower our projected 2015 risk adjuster payables and continued performance across our Government blocks of business that is better than our projections. Potentially offsetting these opportunities is the ever-present risk that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected. Our updated 2015 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our second quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be between 23.4 million and 23.5 million members, down approximately 250,000 members from our last projection. For the remainder of the year, we now project that growth in Government membership will be more than offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including in our Individual, Small Group and student health businesses. Primarily based on lower membership and mix, we have revised our outlook on full year 2015 operating revenue, which we now project to be in the range of $60 billion to $61 billion. Based on our strong second quarter results, we now project our full year total medical benefit ratio will be 81.5% plus or minus 30 basis points and that our full year 2015 Commercial MBR will be essentially flat when compared to the 2014 Commercial MBR of 80.2%. Primarily as a result of our updated revenue projections and continued investment spending on our strategic initiatives, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be in the range of 18.5% to 19% for the full year. We now project our pretax operating margin to be at least 7.9%, consistent with our high single-digit target with operating earnings of at least $2.6 billion. Finally, in light of the pending Humana transaction, we now expect that we will use free cash flow this year to eliminate any projected commercial paper borrowings, which will leave us with a parent cash balance of approximately $200 million at year-end. Our 2015 share count is now projected to be approximately 353 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result, of the proposed Humana acquisition. 
I'd like to finish with a few words on the proposed acquisition of Humana. Mark outlined the strategic merits of the acquisition at the outset this morning, and I'd like to spend a moment on the projected financial benefits. Humana has deep experience in Medicare Advantage, a business that we think can continue to grow membership at mid to high single-digit rates with sustainable margins in the mid-single-digit range. We remain confident that we are purchasing a premier provider in this growing business. Humana's Commercial in Medicaid businesses will substantially benefit from Aetna's expertise, and we are confident in our ability to improve performance in these businesses. There is substantial synergy value that will be unlocked through this transaction that we are confident we can achieve and will enable us to deliver more cost-effective products for consumers. And finally, we have not included any revenue or Health Care services synergies in our outlook, which should ultimately provide upside to our projections and enhance our growth profile over the longer term. Our experience in successfully integrating the Coventry acquisition and the strength of our management team give us great confidence that we have the right people and processes to manage the Humana integration to a successful outcome. We are building a dedicated team with experienced executives and operators to manage each step of the integration and have great confidence in our ability to execute our plans. We look forward to moving this process to a successful closing in the second half of 2016 so that we may begin to realize the value proposition for our customers, members and shareholders. As we look to the balance of 2015, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong, and we are confident in our operating EPS projection of at least $7.40 per share. The Humana acquisition will only serve to enhance our position as a leader in the transformation of the health care system, delivering more cost-effective products to customers and our ability to achieve and exceed our long-term growth objectives. 
I will now turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?"

Let me start with the second one because the answer is yes. As we mentioned, we are -- we push price. We're seeing a little bit of a volume pressure, but because of the way this is shaking out, we're doing fine from a margin dollars perspective, so that is -- that's going the right way. On the Government business, I think it's worth commenting on really why it's performing so well and then talk a little bit about the outlook. I would say first that both Medicare and Medicaid are performing very well. The way this is showing up has been another quarter of very strong prior-period development. Obviously, leading the pack on Medicaid is Kentucky. That continues to perform very well. And as you alluded to, we will have a rate reset in the third quarter. Medicare is really firing on all cylinders as I mentioned. The Individual M&A business, the group MA business are performing very well. And I think that's the result of investments that we made even more than a year ago but looking at making sure that we're doing as good job as we can on revenue and medical management. I also mentioned the PDP margins. The actions we took to recontact the network and do some product redesign have really taken hold, and that business is performing better. I think the thing I don't want to get lost here obviously is the fact that the Medicare business is running so much meaningfully better and very well on the second quarter. I think that's a nice thing to be taking into 2016 when you think about the bids that we submitted during the second quarter. In terms of our outlook, we are not projecting that this same very favorable level will show up in the second half of the year. Part of this is we do want to be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves, and we're not making any assumption in terms of these ongoing very strong levels of PDP, for instance. You mentioned the Kentucky rate reset. That is certainly a meaningful items in the second half of the year, and also, there tends to be a little bit of seasonal pressure on the Medicare MBR in the second half of the year, which is related to the risk scores and the population. So I do think we still have a very good result. In fact, our forecast for these businesses certainly has been squarely in the target margin range for the full year. I do expect that the second half performance will not be as good as the first half, but again, these businesses are still performing exceptionally well."

So I think it speaks again to the strength of the underlying businesses. Not only do we have the prior period sort of catch-up adjustments we discussed, but the very fact that we're in essence sort of on plan and flat year-over-year, that's being done in essence in the face of a higher outlook for 2015, which again speaks directly to how well the underlying Commercial business is performing."

We're doing deep analysis even deeper than we did before the deal, the number of competitors by market plans offer, the opportunity to divest. I think if you all do your homework like you have been in all the competitors in each market and look at the markets where we may need to consider divestiture, there are plenty of competitors left in the market. And so I think our comfort is in the actual analysis at the end of the day, we will still be 8% of the overall Medicare market on a combined basis. We will not -- we will be big in the markets where we may be -- have to divest. There will be plenty of competitors in each market.

If we get paid for the risk that we're assuming, then we can manage the population more effectively. And so the model really is shifting on underwriting and Medicare from one of creating balanced risk pools to one of getting paid for the risk we're assuming. And so that really depends at the local market level. I think what you're seeing in our performance this year is all the work we've done underlying those provider relationships so those collaborations we've been talking about for the number of years in addition to all the work we've been doing on the star ratings. We literally double our presence in the markets with the Humana acquisition today that works at that level of market penetration that's going to make a difference."

This morning, Aetna reported strong second quarter operating earnings of $2.05 per share, a 21% increase from last year's second quarter. Underlying our second quarter results are sound operating fundamentals, as evidenced by: record quarterly operating revenue of over $15.1 billion; medical cost trends that remained moderate and drove a healthy level of reserve development in the quarter; a total medical benefit ratio that improved 200 basis points year-over-year; and pretax operating margins of 8.7%, an improvement of 110 basis points over last year's second quarter. Based on our strong second quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 operating EPS guidance to at least $7.40 per share, eliminating the bottom end of our previous range and recognizing the potential for meaningful upside in our full year outlook, particularly as we contemplate our continuing prudent stance on accruing for the 3Rs. 
This quarter is the sixth quarter in a row that we have increased our operating EPS projection. Even at the minimum performance level we are projecting, our updated guidance represents over 10% year-over-year operating EPS growth, consistent with our low double-digit, long-term operating EPS growth target. 
In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and improved outlook. But first, I am going to re-emphasize the rationale behind our proposed acquisition of Humana and briefly discuss some of the operational highlights of the quarter. In early July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Humana. The combination will create one of the country's largest managed care companies with strong membership positions across multiple lines of business. We believe this strategic acquisition is very compelling, will provide significant value to customers and deliver attractive returns for shareholders. Specifically, the acquisition will substantially accelerate our ability to grow in Medicare Advantage. Aetna's current Medicare Advantage footprint covers approximately 45% of the Medicare-eligible population. The combined companies serve 4.4 million Medicare Advantage members, representing 8% of today's 54 million Medicare beneficiaries, and will expand our geographic footprint to cover approximately 90% of the Medicare-eligible population. This expanded reach will increase our ability to continue to offer high-quality products to customers and capitalize on the projected growth of Medicare programs. 
We believe there is an opportunity to improve the performance of Humana's Commercial and Medicaid businesses by deploying our strong capabilities in both these areas. The combination will reduce costs, which will enable the combined company to provide more cost-effective products to consumers. Humana's significant investment in consumer engagement, as evidenced by their industry-leading Net Promoter Score and Medicare Advantage star ratings, will enhance our own consumer engagement efforts. The combination brings together 2 companies with a shared vision of enabling providers to transition from episodic care to a population health model. 
And finally, the Humana acquisition adds a growing services business and reintroduces certain PBN capabilities to our portfolio, providing longer-term optionality to create a high-growth, high-margin, nonregulated cash flow stream. All of these strategic benefits are accomplished in a transaction that is financially compelling and projected to be accretive not only to earnings per share, but to our operating EPS growth rate. 
Moving on to second quarter highlights. Beginning with our group Commercial business. Operating results for our Large Group Commercial business was strong in the second quarter. We continue to favor margin over membership in this business, producing strong operating margins and predictable capital generation that enables the investments needed to drive our long-term growth strategy. While the quarterly operating performance of our Small Group and Individual businesses was impacted by the official CMS calculations on risk adjusters, we continue to be pleased with the underlying performance across these blocks of business and how they are positioned for 2016. 
Moving on, our Government business had another standout quarter. Starting with Medicare. We increased Medicare medical membership by 24,000 members during the quarter, driven by Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage. We continue to believe that Medicare is one of the most attractive growth opportunities for our company and our industry. Year-to-date, Aetna's Medicare Advantage revenues have increased by 12% over the same period last year, and we are on track to achieve mid-single-digit pretax operating margins in this business this year. 
Our Medicaid business also delivered another strong quarter of results. We grew medical membership by 42,000 members across multiple state programs and delivered pretax operating margins near the high end of our targeted range for this business. While the ramp in the duals demonstration programs continues to lag our expectations, we believe in the long-term opportunity of the duals program as well as the opportunity to serve other additional high-acuity populations. 
Finally, we continue to make progress in both our provider and consumer engagement efforts during the quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 2015 goals in these areas and are excited by the opportunity to accelerate these efforts through the Humana acquisition. 
I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong quarter for Aetna. I am confident we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace. We can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy. We will continue to be disciplined across all of our lines of business. We will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, and we can exceed $7.40 of operating earnings per share in 2015. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who'll provide additional insight into our second quarter results, our updated 2015 outlook and the financial aspects of our proposed Humana acquisition. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $722 million and operating earnings per share of $2.05. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flo",1871,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $722 million and operating earnings per share of $2.05. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance for the quarter was solid. Medical membership held steady at approximately 23.7 million members, as growth in Commercial ASC and Government membership offset declines in our Small Group and middle-market Commercial Insured businesses. We grew operating revenue to a record quarterly level of over $15.1 billion, driven by higher premium yields and year-over-year growth in medical membership. 
From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.7% for the quarter, a 110 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our second quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.3%, a 70 basis point increase over the second quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and lower-than-projected operating revenue. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to first quarter 2015 dates of service. 
Additionally, our days claims payable were approximately 52 days at the end of the quarter. While sequentially lower, this metric is at a healthy level, and the expected decline is consistent with improved processing times and our insured membership growth profile in the second quarter. Note that our days claims payable has increased by over 4 days as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were over 1.2x operating earnings. We continue to project that our full year 2015 Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2015 operating earnings. 
Our share repurchases during the quarter were constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition. We did, however, repurchase over 900,000 shares in the quarter for $100 million and distributed another $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. As disclosed previously, our ability to repurchase shares prior to the closing of the Humana acquisition will be limited. In summary, we are quite pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership declined by 61,000 members during the quarter, as declines in our Commercial Insured business more than offset gains in our Commercial ASC membership. The declines in Commercial Insured membership were largely driven by our Small Group and middle-markets businesses, a direct result of the previously disclosed pricing actions to improve performance in this block. 
Attrition in our Individual business was consistent with our previously communicated projections. As we continue to monitor our Commercial membership base, we remain pleased with the indicators on membership attraction and selection as well as overall performance. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.8% for the quarter, a 120 basis point increase over the same period last year on a reported basis. However, it is important to note, the year-over-year increase in our reported Commercial MBR is essentially a timing issue reflecting our updated view on ACA risk adjustment payables. Simply stated, if we remove all 3R adjustments booked in the second quarter but related to prior periods, our second quarter 2015 Commercial MBR would have been essentially equivalent to our second quarter 2014 Commercial MBR. This underlying performance is consistent with our projections for the quarter and leaves us well positioned in the Commercial business over the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. It is also worth noting that as of the end of Q2, we have not booked any receivable related to risk corridors for either 2014 or 2015. 
Moving on from the 3Rs. Medical cost trends continue to be moderate. And based on year-to-date experience, we now project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trend will be at the low end of our projected range of 6% to 7%. 
Another important growth lever is our Government business, which grew by 66,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 5,000 members. Medicare Supplement grew by 19,000 members, and Medicaid membership also grew by 42,000 members. Of note, Medicaid membership is now up 4% year-over-year despite the exit from the Delaware Medicaid contract at the end of last year. 
Our second quarter 2015 Government premiums were $5.7 billion, and our Government medical benefit ratio was 80.3% in the quarter, a 620 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this excellent result include: excellent performance in Medicare; a demonstration of operating improvements in our Individual Medicare Advantage business, including strong revenue performance and continued favorable medical cost trends as our initiatives to lower costs continue to exceed our projections; continued strong performance in our Group Medicare Advantage business; as well as improved margins in our PDP businesses as our product redesign and network recontracting efforts improved margins versus the prior year quarter. Additionally, we saw continued strong performance in Medicaid, driven by favorable prior period reserve development and continued improvement in a select number of our Medicaid contracts. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 34%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $576 million. We reduced outstanding debt by approximately $300 million. We repurchased over 900,000 shares for $100 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent. 
Our basic share count was 349 million at June 30. As a result of our second quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to at least $7.40 per share. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where we have met or exceeded consensus and increased guidance. This guidance increase also speaks to the strength of the underlying business as we are overcoming headwinds related to an updated view of ACA risk adjuster payments, a larger-than-projected rate decrease in Kentucky and a higher weighted average share count than contemplated in our previous projections. 
Further, our updated guidance formulation where we have provided a minimum projected performance level acknowledges that there could be meaningful upside opportunities to our projections over the remainder of the year, including accrual of 2014 and 2015 risk corridor receivables. Our current estimates indicate that we could be owed well in excess of $100 million related to 2014 alone. We expect we will have some additional clarity on this program in mid-August, actions taken to better understand the health of our ACA-compliant populations, which could lower our projected 2015 risk adjuster payables and continued performance across our Government blocks of business that is better than our projections. Potentially offsetting these opportunities is the ever-present risk that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected. 
Our updated 2015 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our second quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be between 23.4 million and 23.5 million members, down approximately 250,000 members from our last projection. For the remainder of the year, we now project that growth in Government membership will be more than offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including in our Individual, Small Group and student health businesses. 
Primarily based on lower membership and mix, we have revised our outlook on full year 2015 operating revenue, which we now project to be in the range of $60 billion to $61 billion. Based on our strong second quarter results, we now project our full year total medical benefit ratio will be 81.5% plus or minus 30 basis points and that our full year 2015 Commercial MBR will be essentially flat when compared to the 2014 Commercial MBR of 80.2%. 
Primarily as a result of our updated revenue projections and continued investment spending on our strategic initiatives, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be in the range of 18.5% to 19% for the full year. We now project our pretax operating margin to be at least 7.9%, consistent with our high single-digit target with operating earnings of at least $2.6 billion. 
Finally, in light of the pending Humana transaction, we now expect that we will use free cash flow this year to eliminate any projected commercial paper borrowings, which will leave us with a parent cash balance of approximately $200 million at year-end. Our 2015 share count is now projected to be approximately 353 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition. 
I'd like to finish with a few words on the proposed acquisition of Humana. Mark outlined the strategic merits of the acquisition at the outset this morning, and I'd like to spend a moment on the projected financial benefits. Humana has deep experience in Medicare Advantage, a business that we think can continue to grow membership at mid- to high single-digit rates with sustainable margins in the mid-single-digit range. We remain confident that we are purchasing a premier provider in this growing business. 
Humana's Commercial and Medicaid businesses will substantially benefit from Aetna's expertise, and we are confident in our ability to improve performance in these businesses. There is substantial synergy value that will be unlocked through this transaction that we are confident we can achieve and will enable us to deliver more cost-effective products for consumers. 
And finally, we have not included any revenue or health care services synergies in our outlook, which should ultimately provide upside to our projections and enhance our growth profile over the longer term. Our experience in successfully integrating the Coventry acquisition and the strength of our management team give us great confidence that we have the right people and processes to manage the Humana integration to a successful outcome. We are building a dedicated team with experienced executives and operators to manage each step of the integration and have great confidence in our ability to execute our plans. We look forward to moving this process to a successful closing in the second half of 2016 so that we may begin to realize the value proposition for our customers, members and shareholders. As we look to the balance of 2015, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong, and we are confident in our operating EPS projection of at least $7.40 per share. The Humana acquisition will only serve to enhance our position as a leader in the transformation of the health care system, delivering more cost-effective products to customers and our ability to achieve and exceed our long-term growth objectives.

As we mentioned, we are -- we've pushed price. We're seeing a little bit of volume pressure. But because of the way this is shaking out, we're doing fine from a margin dollars perspective, so that is -- that's going the right way. On the Government business, I think it's worth commenting on really why it's performing so well and then talk a little bit about the outlook. I would say first that both Medicare and Medicaid are performing very well. The way this is showing up has been another quarter of very strong prior period development. Obviously, leading the pack on Medicaid is Kentucky. That continues to perform very well. And as you alluded to, we will have a rate reset in the third quarter. Medicare is really firing on all cylinders, as I mentioned. The Individual MA business, the Group MA business are performing very well. And I think that's the result of investments that we made even more than a year ago, but looking at making sure that we're doing as good a job as we can on revenue and medical management. I also mentioned the PDP margins. The actions we took to recontact the network and do some product redesign have really taken hold, and that business is performing better. I think the thing I don't want to get lost here, obviously, is the fact that the Medicare businesses is running so much meaningfully better and very well in the second quarter. I think that's a nice thing to be taking into 2016 when you think about the bids that we submitted during the second quarter. In terms of our outlook, we are not projecting that this same very favorable level will show up in the second half of the year. Part of this is we do want to be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves. And we're not making any assumption in terms of these ongoing very strong levels of PPD, for instance. You mentioned the Kentucky rate reset. That is certainly a meaningful item in the second half of the year. And also, there tends to be a little bit of seasonal pressure on the Medicare MBR in the second half of the year just related to the risk scores and the population. So I do think we've -- we still have a very good result. In fact, our forecast for these businesses certainly has been squarely in the target margin range for the full year. I do expect that the second half performance will not be as good as the first half. But again, these businesses are still performing exceptionally well."

The next logical question is, what does that tell data tell you about your 2015 accrual? And we have largely assumed that the -- in our guidance and what we booked for the second quarter that the 2015 risk adjustment payables will be more or less at the same PMPM rate as the 2014 payable despite the fact that we are making substantially more investment spending to improve that result and the potential for a risk pool improvement in 2015. So I think it speaks, again, to the strength of the underlying businesses. Not only do we have the prior period sort of catch-up adjustments we discussed. But the very fact that we're, in essence, sort of on plan and flat year-over-year, that's being done in essence in the face of a higher outlook for 2015, which, again, I think speaks directly to how well the underlying Commercial business is performing."

I think if you all do your homework like you have been on all the competitors in each market and look at the markets where we may need to consider a divestiture, there are plenty of competitors left in the market. And so I think our comfort is in the actual analysis at the end of the day, we will still be 8% of the overall Medicare market on a combined basis. We will not -- we will be big in some markets, where we may be -- have to divest. There will be plenty of competitors in each market.

If we get paid for the risk that we're assuming, then we can manage the population more effectively. And so the model really is shifting on underwriting in Medicare from one of creating balanced risk pools to one of getting paid for the risk we're assuming. And so that really depends at the local market level. I think what you're seeing in our performance so far this year is all the work that we've done underlying those provider relationships, so those collaborations we've been talking about for a number of years. In addition to all the work we've been doing on the star ratings, we literally double our presence in the markets with the Humana acquisition to make that work.

This morning, Aetna reported strong second quarter operating earnings of $2.05 per share, a 21% increase from last year's second quarter. Underlying our second quarter results are sound operating fundamentals, as evidenced by: record quarterly operating revenue of over $15.1 billion; medical cost trends that remained moderate and drove a healthy level of reserve development in the quarter; a total medical benefit ratio that improved 200 basis points year-over-year; and pretax operating margins of 8.7%, an improvement of 110 basis points over last year's second quarter. Based on our strong second quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 operating EPS guidance to at least $7.40 per share, eliminating the bottom end of our previous range and recognizing the potential for meaningful upside in our full year outlook, particularly as we contemplate our continuing prudent stance on accruing for the 3Rs. 
This quarter is the sixth quarter in a row that we have increased our operating EPS projection. Even at the minimum performance level we are projecting, our updated guidance represents over 10% year-over-year operating EPS growth, consistent with our low double-digit, long-term operating EPS growth target. In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and improved outlook. But first, I am going to re-emphasize the rationale behind our proposed acquisition of Humana and briefly discuss some of the operational highlights of the quarter. 
In early July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Humana. The combination will create one of the country's largest managed care companies with strong membership positions across multiple lines of business. We believe this strategic acquisition is very compelling, will provide significant value to customers and deliver attractive returns for shareholders. Specifically, the acquisition will substantially accelerate our ability to grow in Medicare Advantage. Aetna's current Medicare Advantage footprint covers approximately 45% of the Medicare-eligible population. The combined companies serve 4.4 million Medicare Advantage members, representing 8% of today's 54 million Medicare beneficiaries, and will expand our geographic footprint to cover approximately 90% of the Medicare-eligible population. This expanded reach will increase our ability to continue to offer high-quality products to customers and capitalize on the projected growth of Medicare programs. 
We believe there is an opportunity to improve the performance of Humana's Commercial and Medicaid businesses by deploying our strong capabilities in both these areas. The combination will reduce costs, which will enable the combined company to provide more cost-effective products to consumers. Humana's significant investment in consumer engagement, as evidenced by their industry-leading Net Promoter Score and Medicare Advantage star ratings, will enhance our own consumer engagement efforts. The combination brings together 2 companies with a shared vision of enabling providers to transition from episodic care to a population health model. 
And finally, the Humana acquisition adds a growing services business and reintroduces certain PBN capabilities to our portfolio, providing longer-term optionality to create a high-growth, high-margin, nonregulated cash flow stream. All of these strategic benefits are accomplished in a transaction that is financially compelling and projected to be accretive not only to earnings per share, but to our operating EPS growth rate. 
Moving on to second quarter highlights. Beginning with our group Commercial business. Operating results for our Large Group Commercial business was strong in the second quarter. We continue to favor margin over membership in this business, producing strong operating margins and predictable capital generation that enables the investments needed to drive our long-term growth strategy. While the quarterly operating performance of our Small Group and Individual businesses was impacted by the official CMS calculations on risk adjusters, we continue to be pleased with the underlying performance across these blocks of business and how they are positioned for 2016. 
Moving on, our Government business had another standout quarter. Starting with Medicare. We increased Medicare medical membership by 24,000 members during the quarter, driven by Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage. We continue to believe that Medicare is one of the most attractive growth opportunities for our company and our industry. Year-to-date, Aetna's Medicare Advantage revenues have increased by 12% over the same period last year, and we are on track to achieve mid-single-digit pretax operating margins in this business this year. 
Our Medicaid business also delivered another strong quarter of results. We grew medical membership by 42,000 members across multiple state programs and delivered pretax operating margins near the high end of our targeted range for this business. While the ramp in the duals demonstration programs continues to lag our expectations, we believe in the long-term opportunity of the duals program as well as the opportunity to serve other additional high-acuity populations.  Finally, we continue to make progress in both our provider and consumer engagement efforts during the quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 2015 goals in these areas and are excited by the opportunity to accelerate these efforts through the Humana acquisition. 
I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong quarter for Aetna. I am confident we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace. We can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy. We will continue to be disciplined across all of our lines of business. We will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, and we can exceed $7.40 of operating earnings per share in 2015. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our second quarter results, our updated 2015 outlook and the financial aspects of our proposed Humana acquisition. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $722 million and operating earnings per share of $2.05. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flo",1870,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2015 operating earnings of $722 million and operating earnings per share of $2.05. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong revenue growth, cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance for the quarter was solid. Medical membership held steady at approximately 23.7 million members, as growth in Commercial ASC and Government membership offset declines in our Small Group and middle-market Commercial Insured businesses. We grew operating revenue to a record quarterly level of over $15.1 billion, driven by higher premium yields and year-over-year growth in medical membership. 
From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.7% for the quarter, a 110 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our second quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.3%, a 70 basis point increase over the second quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and lower-than-projected operating revenue. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to first quarter 2015 dates of service. Additionally, our days claims payable were approximately 52 days at the end of the quarter. While sequentially lower, this metric is at a healthy level, and the expected decline is consistent with improved processing times and our insured membership growth profile in the second quarter. Note that our days claims payable has increased by over 4 days as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were over 1.2x operating earnings. We continue to project that our full year 2015 Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2015 operating earnings.  Our share repurchases during the quarter were constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition. We did, however, repurchase over 900,000 shares in the quarter for $100 million and distributed another $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. As disclosed previously, our ability to repurchase shares prior to the closing of the Humana acquisition will be limited. In summary, we are quite pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership declined by 61,000 members during the quarter, as declines in our Commercial Insured business more than offset gains in our Commercial ASC membership. The declines in Commercial Insured membership were largely driven by our Small Group and middle-markets businesses, a direct result of the previously disclosed pricing actions to improve performance in this block. 
Attrition in our Individual business was consistent with our previously communicated projections. As we continue to monitor our Commercial membership base, we remain pleased with the indicators on membership attraction and selection as well as overall performance. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.8% for the quarter, a 120 basis point increase over the same period last year on a reported basis. However, it is important to note, the year-over-year increase in our reported Commercial MBR is essentially a timing issue reflecting our updated view on ACA risk adjustment payables. Simply stated, if we remove all 3R adjustments booked in the second quarter but related to prior periods, our second quarter 2015 Commercial MBR would have been essentially equivalent to our second quarter 2014 Commercial MBR. This underlying performance is consistent with our projections for the quarter and leaves us well positioned in the Commercial business over the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. It is also worth noting that as of the end of Q2, we have not booked any receivable related to risk corridors for either 2014 or 2015. 
Moving on from the 3Rs. Medical cost trends continue to be moderate. And based on year-to-date experience, we now project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trend will be at the low end of our projected range of 6% to 7%.  Another important growth lever is our Government business, which grew by 66,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 5,000 members. Medicare Supplement grew by 19,000 members, and Medicaid membership also grew by 42,000 members. Of note, Medicaid membership is now up 4% year-over-year despite the exit from the Delaware Medicaid contract at the end of last year. 
Our second quarter 2015 Government premiums were $5.7 billion, and our Government medical benefit ratio was 80.3% in the quarter, a 620 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Drivers of this excellent result include: excellent performance in Medicare; a demonstration of operating improvements in our Individual Medicare Advantage business, including strong revenue performance and continued favorable medical cost trends as our initiatives to lower costs continue to exceed our projections; continued strong performance in our Group Medicare Advantage business; as well as improved margins in our PDP businesses as our product redesign and network recontracting efforts improved margins versus the prior year quarter. Additionally, we saw continued strong performance in Medicaid, driven by favorable prior period reserve development and continued improvement in a select number of our Medicaid contracts. 
Moving onto the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 34%. Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $576 million. We reduced outstanding debt by approximately $300 million. We repurchased over 900,000 shares for $100 million and paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $100 million of cash at the parent. 
Our basic share count was 349 million at June 30. As a result of our second quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to at least $7.40 per share. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where we have met or exceeded consensus and increased guidance. This guidance increase also speaks to the strength of the underlying business as we are overcoming headwinds related to an updated view of ACA risk adjuster payments, a larger-than-projected rate decrease in Kentucky and a higher weighted average share count than contemplated in our previous projections. 
Further, our updated guidance formulation where we have provided a minimum projected performance level acknowledges that there could be meaningful upside opportunities to our projections over the remainder of the year, including accrual of 2014 and 2015 risk corridor receivables. Our current estimates indicate that we could be owed well in excess of $100 million related to 2014 alone. We expect we will have some additional clarity on this program in mid-August. Actions taken to better understand the health of our ACA-compliant populations, which could lower our projected 2015 risk adjuster payables and continued performance across our Government blocks of business that is better than our projections. Potentially offsetting these opportunities is the ever-present risk that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected. 
Our updated 2015 guidance is also influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our second quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be between 23.4 million and 23.5 million members, down approximately 250,000 members from our last projection. For the remainder of the year, we now project that growth in Government membership will be more than offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including in our Individual, Small Group and student health businesses. 
Primarily based on lower membership and mix, we have revised our outlook on full year 2015 operating revenue, which we now project to be in the range of $60 billion to $61 billion. Based on our strong second quarter results, we now project our full year total medical benefit ratio will be 81.5% plus or minus 30 basis points and that our full year 2015 Commercial MBR will be essentially flat when compared to the 2014 Commercial MBR of 80.2%.  Primarily as a result of our updated revenue projections and continued investment spending on our strategic initiatives, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be in the range of 18.5% to 19% for the full year. We now project our pretax operating margin to be at least 7.9%, consistent with our high single-digit target with operating earnings of at least $2.6 billion. 
Finally, in light of the pending Humana transaction, we now expect that we will use free cash flow this year to eliminate any projected commercial paper borrowings, which will leave us with a parent cash balance of approximately $200 million at year-end. Our 2015 share count is now projected to be approximately 353 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition. 
I'd like to finish with a few words on the proposed acquisition of Humana. Mark outlined the strategic merits of the acquisition at the outset this morning, and I'd like to spend a moment on the projected financial benefits. Humana has deep experience in Medicare Advantage, a business that we think can continue to grow membership at mid- to high single-digit rates with sustainable margins in the mid-single-digit range. We remain confident that we are purchasing a premier provider in this growing business. Humana's Commercial and Medicaid businesses will substantially benefit from Aetna's expertise, and we are confident in our ability to improve performance in these businesses. There is substantial synergy value that will be unlocked through this transaction that we are confident we can achieve and will enable us to deliver more cost-effective products for consumers. 
And finally, we have not included any revenue or health care services synergies in our outlook, which should ultimately provide upside to our projections and enhance our growth profile over the longer term. Our experience in successfully integrating the Coventry acquisition and the strength of our management team give us great confidence that we have the right people and processes to manage the Humana integration to a successful outcome. We are building a dedicated team with experienced executives and operators to manage each step of the integration and have great confidence in our ability to execute our plans. We look forward to moving this process to a successful closing in the second half of 2016 so that we may begin to realize the value proposition for our customers, members and shareholders. As we look to the balance of 2015, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong, and we are confident in our operating EPS projection of at least $7.40 per share. The Humana acquisition will only serve to enhance our position as a leader in the transformation of the health care system, delivering more cost-effective products to customers and our ability to achieve and exceed our long-term growth objectives.

As we mentioned, we are -- we've pushed price. We're seeing a little bit of volume pressure. But because of the way this is shaking out, we're doing fine from a margin dollars perspective, so that's going the right way. On the Government business, I think it's worth commenting on really why it's performing so well and then talk a little bit about the outlook. I would say first that both Medicare and Medicaid are performing very well. The way this is showing up has been another quarter of very strong prior period development. Obviously, leading the pack on Medicaid is Kentucky. That continues to perform very well. And as you alluded to, we will have a rate reset in the third quarter. Medicare is really firing on all cylinders, as I mentioned. The Individual MA business, the Group MA business are performing very well. And I think that's the result of investments that we made even more than a year ago, but looking at making sure that we're doing as good a job as we can on revenue and medical management. I also mentioned the PDP margins. The actions we took to recontract the network and do some product redesign have really taken hold, and that business is performing better. I think the thing I don't want to get lost here, obviously, is the fact that the Medicare business is running so much meaningfully better and very well in the second quarter. I think that's a nice thing to be taking into 2016 when you think about the bids that we submitted during the second quarter. In terms of our outlook, we are not projecting that this same very favorable level will show up in the second half of the year. Part of this is we do want to be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves. And we're not making any assumption in terms of these ongoing very strong levels of PPD, for instance. You mentioned the Kentucky rate reset. That is certainly a meaningful item in the second half of the year. And also, there tends to be a little bit of seasonal pressure on the Medicare MBR in the second half of the year just related to the risk scores and the population. So I do think we've -- we still have a very good result. In fact, our forecast for these businesses certainly has been squarely in the target margin range for the full year. I do expect that the second half performance will not be as good as the first half. But again, these businesses are still performing exceptionally well."

So I think it speaks, again, to the strength of the underlying businesses. Not only do we have the prior period sort of catch-up adjustments we discussed. But the very fact that we're, in essence, sort of on plan and flat year-over-year, that's being done in essence in the face of a higher outlook for 2015, which, again, I think speaks directly to how well the underlying Commercial business is performing."

We believe that's an appropriate return, and we can price well into that. I think the real issue is that the local market level, what our presence is and our ability to partner with providers and keeping medical costs under control going forward and our ability to get the information necessary to drive star ratings and risk adjusters. If we get paid for the risk that we're assuming, then we can manage the population more effectively. And so the model really is shifting on underwriting in Medicare from one of creating balanced risk pools to one of getting paid for the risk we're assuming. And so that really depends at the local market level. I think what you're seeing in our performance so far this year is all the work that we've done underlying those provider relationships, so those collaborations we've been talking about for a number of years. In addition to all the work we've been doing on the star ratings, we literally double our presence in the markets with the Humana acquisition to make that work.

This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating earnings of $1.90 per share, delivering another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter results are a continuation of our mom",1125,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. 
This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating earnings of $1.90 per share, delivering another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter results are a continuation of our momentum from the first half of the year, specifically underwriting margin performance was strong as our total Health Care medical benefit ratio improved by 120 basis points year-over-year; our Commercial medical benefit ratio improved by 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by our group Commercial businesses. And the Government medical benefit ratio improved by 240 basis points year-over-year, driven by a continued strong results in our Medicare business. 
Pretax operating margins reached 8.4% in the quarter consistent with our high single-digit pretax operating margin targets, and we generated nearly $1.3 billion in Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow. Based on our strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 operating EPS guidance to a range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share. This represents the fourth time we have increased our 2015 operating EPS projection. At the midpoint of our updated range, Aetna would now achieve 12% year-over-year operating EPS growth, a result that would be at the high end of our low double-digit operating EPS growth target. 
In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and improved outlook. But first, I am going to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights of the quarter. 
Aetna's mission is to build a healthier world. In Humana, we believe we have found the ideal partner to complement and accelerate our efforts. Though the projected closing of the acquisition is still months away, our integration teams are working in earnest to ensure we achieve, if not exceed, our synergy and accretion goals. We are excited to welcome Rick to our executive team as the leader of our integration efforts. We are confident his well-put industry knowledge and experience will help deliver a smooth integration as we choose the best processes and talent from both organizations to create a stronger enterprise. All material state regulatory filings have been made for the proposed transaction, and we have received our first state approval for the transaction. We continue to work diligently with the Department of Justice in a collaborative and constructive manner. Last week, the shareholders of both Humana and Aetna overwhelmingly voted to approve the transaction, another significant milestone as we progress on our journey to deal completion. We remain confident that we are on track to achieve a successful close in the second half of 2016 and that Humana is the right cultural and strategic partner to create customer and shareholder value through the new Aetna. 
Moving on to third quarter highlights. Our Government businesses continue to perform well. Specifically, the momentum in our Medicare businesses in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter. We increased Medicare medical membership by 40,000 members in the quarter with growth across Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage. From a year-to-date perspective, we have grown our Medicare membership by 11%, including over 14% Individual Medicare Advantage growth. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow our Medicare Advantage business in 2016 as program funding will increase for the first time in several years. We continue to expand our geographic footprint and will now offer products in 745 counties for 2016, representing nearly half of that Medicare-eligible population. And based on the recently published 2016 Medicare Advantage Star Ratings, 87% of our membership is in 4-star or greater plans, the highest percentage as compared to our national peers. 
Our Medicaid business also performed very well. We grew by 86,000 members in the quarter, primarily from additions in state programs related to ACA expansion. Despite continued slow growth the duals program and midyear rate decreases in our Kentucky contract, we still delivered solid pretax operating margins in Medicaid. We remain focused on the opportunity to continue to grow this business, and we look forward to serving new populations, including members in the recently awarded Michigan Medicaid contract and the Texas Star Kids program. 
Shifting to our public exchange and consumer efforts. The Individual business remains challenging, especially in light of the continued administrative changes for this new and developing membership pool. Despite these challenges, we continue to work constructively with CMS and the states to serve our 1.1 million individual members. We have always said that Aetna would participate in this emerging opportunity in a prudent manner in geographies where we have the cost structure to offer attractive products to consumers and earn an appropriate return for our shareholders. In keeping with our strategy, Aetna will participate on Individual exchanges in the 15 states in 2016 as compared to 17 states in 2015, our footprint that we continue to believe can drive net membership growth. 
Further, as part of our 2016 offerings, Aetna will launch new consumer-focused health solutions for individuals and families in 4 existing geographies. These innovative products will feature simplified benefit structures and an improved consumer experience. Central to these new products will be access to helpful digital tools with clear information about Health Care resources, coverage and costs. We intend to use our experience with these new products as preparation for a broader rollout in the future as we continue our journey to help reshape the Health Care system. 
Additionally, we are excited that Gary has joined the Aetna team to help lead newly expanded Healthagen, including our consumer businesses. Under his leadership, we are confident that we will make our consumer-centric Health Care vision a reality. 
In summary, as we finish out the year and look toward 2016 and beyond, we are well positioned to cross a number of major growth opportunities, including Medicare, Medicaid and the public exchanges. We continue to work diligently on planning for the Humana integration, and we are excited about the value that our combination will create for consumers and shareholders. 
I am pleased with our results and I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong quarter for Aetna. I am confident we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute in our differentiated strategy, we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, we can achieve our 2015 operating earnings per share projection of $7.45 to $7.55 and we can grow both operating earnings and operating EPS in 2016. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2015 outlook and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2016. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported third quarter of 2015 operating earnings of $669 million and operating earnings per share of $1.90. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance was steady for the quarter. Medical membership declined to approximately 23.5 million members, as growth in Government membership was more than offset by declines in our group Commercial and Individual businesses. Operating revenue was $15 billion, driven primarily by higher premium yields and membership growth in our Government business. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.4% for the quarter, a 60 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our third quarter total Health Care medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, a strong result that benefited from disciplined pricing, continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.6%, a 40 basis point increase over the third quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and lower-than-projected operating revenue growth. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our results. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days and claims payable were 54.3 days at the end of the quarter, up 2.5 days sequentially and 4.6 days on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.4x operating earnings. We continue to project that our full year 2015 Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2015 operating earnings. Our ability to repurchase shares was constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition and we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We did, however, distribute $87 million to our quarterly shareholder dividend. 
In summary, we are quite pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership declined by approximately 300,000 members during the quarter, largely driven by our group Commercial and Individual businesses. This performance is consistent with recent membership trends in these blocks, our previously discussed pricing actions to improve performance in our group Commercial business and enrollment patterns in our Individual business. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.7% for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Our third quarter Commercial MBR was influenced by continued moderate medical cost trends and strong performance in our group Commercial business, partially offset by an updated view on 3R accruals in our ACA-compliant businesses. Based on our year-to-date experience, we project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trend will be approximately 6%. 
We continue to drive growth in our Government business where we grew by 126,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 13,000 members. Medicare Supplement grew by 27,000 members, and Medicaid membership also grew by 86,000 members. Our third quarter 2015 Government premiums grew to $5.7 billion, a 6.6% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.6% in the quarter, a 240 basis point improvement over the same period last year, driven primarily by continued momentum in our Medicare business. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 33%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $385 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, including payment of transaction-related expenses, we ended the quarter with approximately $180 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 348.7 million at September 30. 
As a result of our third quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to our range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share. This represents the seventh quarter in a row we have raised our operating EPS guidance and the fourth time we have increased our projection this year. Our updated 2015 guidance is influenced by the following drivers: based on our third quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.3 million members. Primarily based on lower membership and mix, we have revised our outlook on full year 2015 operating revenue, which we now project to be approximately $60 billion. This top line projection is a result of our continued stance to favor margin over membership, particularly in our group Commercial blocks of business. We now project our full year total Health Care medical benefit ratio will be 81%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to project that our full year 2015 Commercial medical benefit ratio will be essentially flat when compared to our 2014 Commercial MBR. This projection is generally consistent with current consensus estimates for this metric. Our current view is that our operating expense ratio will be approximately 19% for the full year, a result of lower-than-projected revenues and continued investment spending as we execute on our strategy. We now project our pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high single-digit target with operating earnings between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. Finally, we now expect that net subsidiary dividends for the year will be up to $2.4 billion and Aetna's parent cash balance will be approximately $400 million at year-end. We continue to project that our 2015 weighted average diluted share count will be approximately 353 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition. 
Moving on to 2016. We do not typically provide forward guidance on our third quarter call. However, as we will not be providing detailed 2016 guidance until early next year, I wanted to provide some directional commentary on Aetna's 2016 earnings outlook on a stand-alone basis. As you know, we do not as a matter of course include prior year's reserve development in our guidance. When we exclude prior year's reserve development and other items from our projected 2015 performance, we currently believe that this 2015 baseline earnings power is approximately $7 per share. Our goal is to achieve at least low double-digit growth off this operating EPS baseline next year. While uncertainties remain and we continue to work through our forecasting process, we are incorporating a number of challenges in our outlook, including the projected impact of known membership attrition in our Commercial ASC business and certain large insured customers that are projected to convert to alternative funding arrangements; the projected full year impact of the rate reset in our Kentucky Medicaid contract; and the fact that our operating EPS outlook typically incorporates a benefit from share repurchases, which we are no longer projecting because of the pending Humana transaction. We are also incorporating a number of opportunities in our outlook, including: continued membership growth in our Medicare and Medicaid products; the opportunity to improve margins on our ACA-compliant and dual-eligible membership; and fixed cost leverage as we continue to grow revenue and actively manage costs. In summary, our goal is to grow our 2015 operating EPS baseline of $7 per share at low double-digit rates next year. This growth floor, which does not pursue many prior year's reserve development, would be driven entirely by underlying operating earnings performance as share repurchases do not contribute to operating EPS growth in our 2016 outlook. Further, if medical cost trends were to develop below our projections similar to the last several years, we could see upside to our outlook. As we enter the final quarter of 2015 and begin to look toward 2016, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong, and we are confident in our projected operating EPS range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share and our ability to grow operating EPS at low double-digit rates over time. The Humana acquisition will only serve to enhance our position as a leader in the transformation of the health care system, delivering more cost-effective products to customers and enhancing our ability to achieve and exceed our long-term growth objectives. We remain committed and confident that we can close the Humana transaction in the second half of 2016 and that we can achieve at least $11 of operating EPS in 2018 as a combined company.

And I'll remind everybody that it was our view that we would go into markets where we have a cost structure that could develop an affordable product for people in those communities. And so our changes in this current year are related to our ability to do so. But we think it's way too early to call it quits on the ACA and on the exchanges. We view it still as a big opportunity for the company. I'll remind everybody it's just a little over 6% of our operating revenue, so we still view it as an opportunity to play. In relationship to the Government margins, we believe that we will not have the same level of Government margins, but we will have some pressure on them going backwards in 2016. But our 2015 margins are healthy. We believe that it's related to 2 things: our strong growth, our investment in scorable items, and I would also add our star ratings are having a material impact on growth in our plans and also on our opportunity to generate a higher margin."

So Josh, I just add a few comments thinking about the margin.

And I do think given the strength of the performance and the factors Mark mentioned, we can continue to perform in that mid-single-digit range next year. I think where we'll get a little bit of pressure on the margin is on Medicaid, and a lot of that is obviously just emanating from Kentucky given how large a contract that is in our portfolio. Having said that, I still think the overall performance of the Government business will be very strong again in 2016. The exchange business in terms of margin improvement, I think this is a year when we knew a lot more about pricing at the beginning of this year than we knew a year ago. And while I don't think we'd ever think that we would achieve sort of a target pricing profitability, I think we have a lot more confidence that we can improve the profitability position on that business in 2016 versus 2015. Again, as Mark mentioned this, we've always known since day one, this was a multiyear and sort of longer-term proposition in this market."

This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating earnings of $1.90 per share, delivering another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter results are a continuation of our momen",1130,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating earnings of $1.90 per share, delivering another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter results are a continuation of our momentum from the first half of the year, specifically underwriting margin performance was strong as our total Health Care medical benefit ratio improved by 120 basis points year-over-year. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio improved by 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by our group commercial businesses. And the Government medical benefit ratio improved by 240 basis points year-over-year, driven by continued strong results in our Medicare business. 
Pretax operating margins reached 8.4% in the quarter, consistent with our high single digit pretax operating margin targets, and we generated nearly $1.3 billion in Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow. Based on our strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 operating EPS guidance to a range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share. This represents the fourth time we have increased our 2015 operating EPS projection. At the midpoint of our updated range, Aetna would now achieve 12% year-over-year operating EPS growth, a result that would be at the high end of our low double digit operating EPS growth target. 
In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and improved outlook. But first, I am going to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights of the quarter. 
Aetna's mission is to build a healthier world. In Humana, we believe we have found the ideal partner to complement and accelerate our efforts. Though the projected closing of the acquisition is still months away, our integration teams are working in earnest to ensure we achieve, if not exceed, our synergy and accretion goals. We are excited to welcome Rick Jelinek to our executive team as the leader of our integration efforts. We are confident his wealth of industry knowledge and experience will help deliver a smooth integration, as we choose the best processes and talent from both organizations to create a stronger enterprise. 
All material state regulatory filings have been made for the proposed transaction, and we have received our first state approval for the transaction. We continue to work diligently with the Department of Justice in a collaborative and constructive manner. Last week, the shareholders of both Humana and Aetna overwhelmingly voted to approve the transaction, another significant milestone as we progress on our journey to deal completion. We remain confident that we are on track to achieve a successful close in the second half of 2016, and that Humana is the right cultural and strategic partner to create customer and shareholder value through the new Aetna. 
Moving on to third quarter highlights. Our Government businesses continue to perform well. Specifically, the momentum in our Medicare businesses in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter. We increased Medicare medical membership by 40,000 members in the quarter, with growth across Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage. 
From a year-to-date perspective, we have grown our Medicare membership by 11%, including over 14% Individual Medicare Advantage growth. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow our Medicare Advantage business in 2016, as program funding will increase for the first time in several years. We continue to expand our geographic footprint and will now offer products in 745 counties for 2016, representing nearly half of the Medicare-eligible population. And based on the recently published 2016 Medicare Advantage star ratings, 87% of our membership is in 4-star or greater plans, the highest percentage as compared to our national peers. 
Our Medicaid business also performed very well. We grew by 86,000 members in the quarter, primarily from additions in state programs related to ACA expansion. Despite continued slow growth in the duals programs and midyear rate decreases in our Kentucky contract, we still delivered solid pretax operating margins in Medicaid. We remain focused on the opportunity to continue to grow this business, and we look forward to serving new populations, including members in the recently awarded Michigan Medicaid contract and the Texas Star Kids program. 
Shifting to our public exchange and consumer efforts. The Individual business remains challenging, especially in light of the continued administrative changes for this new and developing membership pool. Despite these challenges, we continue to work constructively with CMS and the states to serve our 1.1 million individual members. We have always said that Aetna would participate in this emerging opportunity in a prudent manner in geographies where we have the cost structure to offer attractive products to consumers and earn an appropriate return for our shareholders. In keeping with our strategy, Aetna will participate on Individual exchanges in 15 states in 2016 as compared to 17 states in 2015, our footprint that we continue to believe can drive net membership growth. 
Further, as part of our 2016 offerings, Aetna will launch new consumer-focused health solutions for individuals and families in 4 existing geographies. These innovative products will feature simplified benefit structures and an improved consumer experience. Central to these new products will be access to helpful digital tools with clear information about health care resources, coverage and costs. We intend to use our experience with these new products as preparation for a broader rollout in the future as we continue our journey to help reshape the Health Care system. 
Additionally, we are excited that Gary Loveman has joined the Aetna team to help lead the newly expanded Healthagen, including our consumer businesses. Under his leadership, we are confident that we will make our consumer-centric health care vision a reality. 
In summary, as we finish out the year and look toward 2016 and beyond, we are well positioned to cross a number of major growth opportunities, including Medicare, Medicaid and the public exchanges. We continue to work diligently on planning for the Humana integration, and we are excited about the value that our combination will create for consumers and shareholders. 
I am pleased with our results and I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong quarter for Aetna. I am confident we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, we can achieve our 2015 operating earnings per share projection of $7.45 to $7.55 and we could grow both operating earnings and operating EPS in 2016. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2015 outlook and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2016. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2015 operating earnings of $669 million and operating earnings per share of $1.90.

Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2015 operating earnings of $669 million and operating earnings per share of $1.90. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance was steady for the quarter. Medical membership declined to approximately 23.5 million members, as growth in Government membership was more than offset by declines in our group Commercial and Individual businesses. Operating revenue was $15 billion, driven primarily by higher premium yields and membership growth in our Government business. 
From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.4% for the quarter, a 60 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our third quarter total Health Care medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, a strong result that benefited from disciplined pricing, continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.6%, a 40 basis point increase over the third quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and lower-than-projected operating revenue growth. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days and claims payable were 54.3 days at the end of the quarter, up 2.5 days sequentially and 4.6 days on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.4x operating earnings. We continue to project that our full year 2015 Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2015 operating earnings. Our ability to repurchase shares was constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition, and we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We did, however, distribute $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. 
In summary, we are quite pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership declined by approximately 300,000 members during the quarter, largely driven by our group Commercial and Individual businesses. This performance is consistent with recent membership trends in these blocks, our previously discussed pricing actions to improve performance in our group Commercial business and enrollment patterns in our Individual business. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.7% for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Our third quarter Commercial MBR was influenced by continued moderate medical cost trends and strong performance in our group Commercial business, partially offset by an updated view on 3R accruals in our ACA-compliant businesses. Based on our year-to-date experience, we project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trend will be approximately 6%. 
We continue to drive growth in our Government business, where we grew by 126,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 13,000 members. Medicare Supplement grew by 27,000 members. And Medicaid membership also grew by 86,000 members. Our third quarter 2015 Government premiums grew to $5.7 billion, a 6.6% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.6% in the quarter, a 240 basis point improvement over the same period last year, driven primarily by continued momentum in our Medicare business. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 33%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $385 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, including payment of transaction-related expenses, we ended the quarter with approximately $180 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 348.7 million at September 30. 
As a result of our third quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share. This represents the seventh quarter in a row we have raised our operating EPS guidance and the fourth time we have increased our projection this year. Our updated 2015 guidance is influenced by the following drivers: based on our third quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.3 million members. Primarily based on lower membership and mix, we have revised our outlook on full year 2015 operating revenue, which we now project to be approximately $60 billion. This top line projection is a result of our continued stance to favor margin over membership, particularly in our group Commercial blocks of business. 
We now project our full year total Health Care medical benefit ratio will be 81%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to project that our full year 2015 Commercial medical benefit ratio will be essentially flat when compared to our 2014 Commercial MBR. This projection is generally consistent with current consensus estimates for this metric. Our current view is that our operating expense ratio will be approximately 19% for the full year, a result of lower-than-projected revenues and continued investment spending as we execute on our strategy. We now project our pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high single digit target, with operating earnings between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. 
Finally, we now expect that net subsidiary dividends for the year will be up to $2.4 billion and Aetna's parent cash balance will be approximately $400 million at year-end. We continue to project that our 2015 weighted average diluted share count will be approximately 353 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition. 
Moving on to 2016. We do not typically provide forward guidance on our third quarter call. However, as we will not be providing detailed 2016 guidance until early next year, I wanted to provide some directional commentary on Aetna's 2016 earnings outlook on a stand-alone basis. As you know, we do not, as a matter, of course, include prior year's reserve development in our guidance. When we exclude prior year's reserve development and other items from our projected 2015 performance, we currently believe Aetna's 2015 baseline earnings power is approximately $7 per share. Our goal is to achieve at least low double digit growth off this operating EPS baseline next year. 
While uncertainties remain and we continue to work through our forecasting process, we are incorporating a number of challenges in our outlook, including the projected impact of known membership attrition in our Commercial ASC business and certain large insured customers that are projected to convert to alternative funding arrangements; the projected full year impact of the rate reset in our Kentucky Medicaid contract; and the fact that our operating EPS outlook typically incorporates a benefit from share repurchases, which we are no longer projecting because of the pending Humana transaction. 
We are also incorporating a number of opportunities in our outlook, including continued membership growth in our Medicare and Medicaid products, the opportunity to improve margins on our ACA-compliant and dual-eligible membership, and fixed cost leverage as we continue to grow revenue and actively manage costs. 
In summary, our goal is to grow our 2015 operating EPS baseline of $7 per share at low double digit rates next year. This growth floor, which does not presume many prior year's reserve development, would be driven entirely by underlying operating earnings performance as share repurchases do not contribute to operating EPS growth in our 2016 outlook. Further, if medical cost trends were to develop below our projections, similar to the last several years, we could see upside to our outlook. As we enter the final quarter of 2015 and begin to look toward 2016, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong, and we are confident in our projected operating EPS range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share and our ability to grow operating EPS at low double digit rates over time. The Humana acquisition will only serve to enhance our position as a leader in the transformation of the health care system, delivering more cost-effective products to customers and enhancing our ability to achieve and exceed our long-term growth objectives. We remain committed and confident that we can close the Humana transaction in the second half of 2016 and that we can achieve at least $11 of operating EPS in 2018 as a combined company.

And so our changes in this current year are related to our ability to do so. But we think it's way too early to call it quits on the ACA and on the exchanges. We view it still as a big opportunity for the company. I'll remind everybody it's just a little over 6% of our operating revenue, so we still view it as an opportunity to play. In relationship to the Government margins, we believe that we will not have the same level of Government margins, but we will have some pressure on them going backwards in 2016. But our 2015 margins are healthy. We believe that it's related to 2 things: our strong growth, our investment in scorable action items, and I would also add our star ratings are having a material impact on growth in our plans and also on our opportunity to generate a higher margin."

So Josh, I'd just append a few comments thinking about the margin.

I think where we'll get a little bit of pressure on the margin is on Medicaid, and a lot of that is obviously just emanating from Kentucky, given how large a contract that is in our portfolio. Having said that, I still think the overall performance of the Government business will be very strong, again, in 2016. The exchange business in terms of margin improvement, I think this is a year where we knew a lot more about pricing at the beginning of this year than we knew a year ago. And while I don't think we'd ever think that we would achieve sort of a target pricing profitability, I think we have a lot more confidence that we can improve the profitability position on that business in 2016 versus 2015.

We now have more information. We have some really interesting deep insights on the businesses. It looks across medical categories and CSRs and everything else. And we were anxious to -- we're going to start sharing some of that with CMS as we begin to tell them how we could better manage the program, gain more enrollment.

I would say clearly what we did right was -- again, going back to what Mark talked about, was we had a lot of focus on making sure we had a cost structure and program in place to sustain a lot of the price positions that we had. And we actually limited where we played to those places where we thought we had a winning game plan for cost structure.

This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating earnings of $1.90 per share, delivering another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter results are a continuation of our momen",1128,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating earnings of $1.90 per share, delivering another quarter of strong results. Our third quarter results are a continuation of our momentum from the first half of the year. Specifically: underwriting margin performance was strong as our total Health Care medical benefit ratio improved by 120 basis points year-over-year; our Commercial medical benefit ratio improved by 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by our group commercial businesses; and the Government medical benefit ratio improved by 240 basis points year-over-year, driven by continued strong results in our Medicare business. 
Pretax operating margins reached 8.4% in the quarter, consistent with our high single digit pretax operating margin targets, and we generated nearly $1.3 billion in Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow. Based on our strong third quarter results, we are raising our full year 2015 operating EPS guidance to a range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share. This represents the fourth time we have increased our 2015 operating EPS projection. At the midpoint of our updated range, Aetna would now achieve 12% year-over-year operating EPS growth, a result that would be at the high end of our low double digit operating EPS growth target. 
In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and improved outlook. But first, I am going to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights of the quarter. 
Aetna's mission is to build a healthier world. In Humana, we believe we have found the ideal partner to complement and accelerate our efforts. Though the projected closing of the acquisition is still months away, our integration teams are working in earnest to ensure we achieve, if not exceed, our synergy and accretion goals. We are excited to welcome Rick Jelinek to our executive team as the leader of our integration efforts. We are confident his wealth of industry knowledge and experience will help deliver a smooth integration, as we choose the best processes and talent from both organizations to create a stronger enterprise. 
All material state regulatory filings have been made for the proposed transaction, and we have received our first state approval for the transaction. We continue to work diligently with the Department of Justice in a collaborative and constructive manner. Last week, the shareholders of both Humana and Aetna overwhelmingly voted to approve the transaction, another significant milestone as we progress on our journey to deal completion. We remain confident that we are on track to achieve a successful close in the second half of 2016, and that Humana is the right cultural and strategic partner to create customer and shareholder value through the new Aetna. 
Moving on to third quarter highlights. Our Government businesses continue to perform well. Specifically, the momentum in our Medicare businesses in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter. We increased Medicare medical membership by 40,000 members in the quarter, with growth across Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage. 
From a year-to-date perspective, we have grown our Medicare membership by 11%, including over 14% Individual Medicare Advantage growth. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow our Medicare Advantage business in 2016, as program funding will increase for the first time in several years. We continue to expand our geographic footprint and will now offer products in 745 counties for 2016, representing nearly half of the Medicare-eligible population. And based on the recently published 2016 Medicare Advantage star ratings, 87% of our membership is in 4-star or greater plans, the highest percentage as compared to our national peers. 
Our Medicaid business also performed very well. We grew by 86,000 members in the quarter, primarily from additions in state programs related to ACA expansion. Despite continued slow growth in the duals programs and midyear rate decreases in our Kentucky contract, we still delivered solid pretax operating margins in Medicaid. We remain focused on the opportunity to continue to grow this business, and we look forward to serving new populations, including members in the recently-awarded Michigan Medicaid contract and the Texas Star Kids program. 
Shifting to our public exchange and consumer efforts. The Individual business remains challenging, especially in light of the continued administrative changes for this new and developing membership pool. Despite these challenges, we continue to work constructively with CMS and the states to serve our 1.1 million individual members. We have always said that Aetna would participate in this emerging opportunity in a prudent manner in geographies where we have the cost structure to offer attractive products to consumers and earn an appropriate return for our shareholders. In keeping with our strategy, Aetna will participate on Individual exchanges in 15 states in 2016 as compared to 17 states in 2015, a footprint that we continue to believe can drive net membership growth. 
Further, as part of our 2016 offerings, Aetna will launch new consumer-focused health solutions for individuals and families in 4 existing geographies. These innovative products will feature simplified benefit structures and an improved consumer experience. Central to these new products will be access to helpful digital tools with clear information about health care resources, coverage and costs. We intend to use our experience with these new products as preparation for a broader rollout in the future as we continue our journey to help reshape the Health Care system. 
Additionally, we are excited that Gary Loveman has joined the Aetna team to help lead the newly-expanded Healthagen, including our consumer businesses. Under his leadership, we are confident that we will make our consumer-centric health care vision a reality. 
In summary, as we finish out the year and look toward 2016 and beyond, we are well positioned to cross a number of major growth opportunities, including Medicare, Medicaid and the public exchanges. We continue to work diligently on planning for the Humana integration, and we are excited about the value that our combination will create for consumers and shareholders. 
I am pleased with our results and I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong quarter for Aetna. I am confident we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, we can achieve our 2015 operating earnings per share projection of $7.45 to $7.55 and we could grow both operating earnings and operating EPS in 2016. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2015 outlook and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2016. Shawn?"
655542,313034587,885708,"Aetna Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2015 operating earnings of $669 million and operating earnings per share of $1.90. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating m",1466,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2015 operating earnings of $669 million and operating earnings per share of $1.90. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our top line performance was steady for the quarter. Medical membership declined to approximately 23.5 million members, as growth in Government membership was more than offset by declines in our group Commercial and Individual businesses. Operating revenue was $15 billion, driven primarily by higher premium yields and membership growth in our Government business. 
From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.4% for the quarter, a 60 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our third quarter total Health Care medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, a strong result that benefited from disciplined pricing, continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18.6%, a 40 basis point increase over the third quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of continued investment spending on our growth initiatives and lower-than-projected operating revenue growth. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days and claims payable were 54.3 days at the end of the quarter, up 2.5 days sequentially and 4.6 days on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. On a year-to-date basis, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.4x operating earnings. We continue to project that our full year 2015 Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows will exceed our 2015 operating earnings. Our ability to repurchase shares was constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition, and we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We did, however, distribute $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. 
In summary, we are quite pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial membership declined by approximately 300,000 members during the quarter, largely driven by our group Commercial and Individual businesses. This performance is consistent with recent membership trends in these blocks, our previously-discussed pricing actions to improve performance in our group Commercial business and enrollment patterns in our Individual business. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.7% for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Our third quarter Commercial MBR was influenced by continued moderate medical cost trends and strong performance in our group Commercial business, partially offset by an updated view on 3R accruals in our ACA-compliant businesses. Based on our year-to-date experience, we project that Aetna's 2015 core Commercial medical cost trend will be approximately 6%. 
We continue to drive growth in our Government business, where we grew by 126,000 members in the quarter. Medicare Advantage grew by 13,000 members. Medicare Supplement grew by 27,000 members. And Medicaid membership also grew by 86,000 members. Our third quarter 2015 Government premiums grew to $5.7 billion, a 6.6% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.6% in the quarter, a 240 basis point improvement over the same period last year, driven primarily by continued momentum in our Medicare business. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 33%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $100 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $385 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. After other uses, including payment of transaction-related expenses, we ended the quarter with approximately $180 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 348.7 million at September 30. 
As a result of our third quarter performance, we are increasing our 2015 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share. This represents the seventh quarter in a row we have raised our operating EPS guidance and the fourth time we have increased our projection this year. Our updated 2015 guidance is influenced by the following drivers: based on our third quarter membership results, we now project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23.3 million members. Primarily based on lower membership and mix, we have revised our outlook on full year 2015 operating revenue, which we now project to be approximately $60 billion. This top line projection is a result of our continued stance to favor margin over membership, particularly in our group Commercial blocks of business. 
We now project our full year total Health Care medical benefit ratio will be 81%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to project that our full year 2015 Commercial medical benefit ratio will be essentially flat when compared to our 2014 Commercial MBR. This projection is generally consistent with current consensus estimates for this metric. Our current view is that our operating expense ratio will be approximately 19% for the full year, a result of lower-than-projected revenues and continued investment spending as we execute on our strategy. We now project our pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high single digit target, with operating earnings between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. 
Finally, we now expect that net subsidiary dividends for the year will be up to $2.4 billion and Aetna's parent cash balance will be approximately $400 million at year-end. We continue to project that our 2015 weighted average diluted share count will be approximately 353 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition. 
Moving on to 2016. We do not typically provide forward guidance on our third quarter call. However, as we will not be providing detailed 2016 guidance until early next year, I wanted to provide some directional commentary on Aetna's 2016 earnings outlook on a stand-alone basis. As you know, we do not, as a matter, of course, include prior year's reserve development in our guidance. When we exclude prior year's reserve development and other items from our projected 2015 performance, we currently believe Aetna's 2015 baseline earnings power is approximately $7 per share. Our goal is to achieve at least low double digit growth off this operating EPS baseline next year. 
While uncertainties remain and we continue to work through our forecasting process, we are incorporating a number of challenges in our outlook, including the projected impact of known membership attrition in our Commercial ASC business and certain large insured customers that are projected to convert to alternative funding arrangements; the projected full year impact of the rate reset in our Kentucky Medicaid contract; and the fact that our operating EPS outlook typically incorporates a benefit from share repurchases, which we are no longer projecting because of the pending Humana transaction. 
We are also incorporating a number of opportunities in our outlook, including continued membership growth in our Medicare and Medicaid products, the opportunity to improve margins on our ACA-compliant and dual-eligible membership, and fixed cost leverage as we continue to grow revenue and actively manage costs. 
In summary, our goal is to grow our 2015 operating EPS baseline of $7 per share at low double digit rates next year. This growth floor, which does not presume any prior year's reserve development, would be driven entirely by underlying operating earnings performance as share repurchases do not contribute to operating EPS growth in our 2016 outlook. Further, if medical cost trends were to develop below our projections, similar to the last several years, we could see upside to our outlook. As we enter the final quarter of 2015 and begin to look toward 2016, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remain strong, and we are confident in our projected operating EPS range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share and our ability to grow operating EPS at low double digit rates over time. The Humana acquisition will only serve to enhance our position as a leader in the transformation of the health care system, delivering more cost-effective products to customers and enhancing our ability to achieve and exceed our long-term growth objectives. We remain committed and confident that we can close the Humana transaction in the second half of 2016 and that we can achieve at least $11 of operating EPS in 2018 as a combined company.

And then on the Government side, margins have been running a lot better than we had expected. I think others in the industry are seeing some similar trends.

And so our changes in this current year are related to our ability to do so. But we think it's way too early to call it quits on the ACA and on the exchanges. We view it still as a big opportunity for the company. I'll remind everybody it's just a little over 6% of our operating revenue, so we still view it as an opportunity to play. In relationship to the Government margins, we believe that we will not have the same level of Government margins, but we will have some pressure on them going backwards in 2016. But our 2015 margins are healthy. We believe that is related to 2 things: our strong growth, our investment in scorable action items, and I would also add our star ratings are having a material impact on growth in our plans and also on our opportunity to generate a higher margin."

So Josh, I'd just append a few comments thinking about the margin.

And I do think given the strength of the performance and the factors Mark mentioned, we can continue to perform in that mid-single-digit range next year. I think where we'll get a little bit of pressure on the margin is on Medicaid, and a lot of that is obviously just emanating from Kentucky, given how large a contract that is in our portfolio. Having said that, I still think the overall performance of the Government business will be very strong, again, in 2016. The exchange business in terms of margin improvement, I think this is a year where we knew a lot more about pricing at the beginning of this year than we knew a year ago. And while I don't think we'd ever think that we would achieve sort of a target pricing profitability, I think we have a lot more confidence that we can improve the profitability position on that business in 2016 versus 2015. Again, as Mark mentioned this, we've always known since day one, this was a multiyear and sort of longer-term proposition in this market."

I would say clearly what we did right was -- again, going back to what Mark talked about, was we had a lot of focus on making sure we had a cost structure and program in place to sustain a lot of the price positions that we had.
