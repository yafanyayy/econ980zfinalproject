Today, we announced results for the fourth quarter and full year. Comparable full year sales were at the lower end of our guidance range.

Comparable full year sales were at the lower end of our guidance range. Our results for full year comparable operating profit was slightly lower than we had anticipated, primarily due to the decline in sales. And our results for full year comparable earnings per share were in line with our expectations but were also at the low end of the range. 
Project K is on track and we delivered savings in line with our guidance for 2014. The global business services initiative is going well and we have begun to reduce capacity in some regions and add capacity in others. 
Results from our labor strategy intended driver more competitive, sustainable cost structure had been mixed. We've seen good results in Europe and Australia, although we still have work to do in the U.S. As you know, Project K will provide us with a considerable amount of financial flexibility and we are continuing our investment in 2015. 
We're at an important point as we enter 2015. After a disappointing 2014, we are building a platform for growth over the coming year. We will continue to execute Project K. We are investing in our business and we expect to stabilize our top line in 2015. In providing guidance for 2015, we recognize the critical task of returning the company to sustainable top line growth. We expect full year comparable net sales to be approximately flat, significant improvement from the trends we saw in 2014. We were pleased with our performance in much of the international business in 2014. And our expectations are that the positive sales trends will continue in 2015. However, we do have more work to do in the U.S., particularly in the cereal and snack businesses. Ron will provide more detail regarding our guidance for 2015 in a few minutes. 
As we look on long-term health for the business, it is critically important that we set realistic financial goals. Please turn to Slide 4 in a discussion of our long-term targets. We are changing our target to long-term comparable revenue growth to a low single-digit rate. Our target for comparable operating profit growth remains at the mid single-digit rate and our target for currency-neutral comparable EPS growth remains at a high single-digit rate. One of the key drivers of success is targeting realistic goals, which can be achieved over long-term. 
The businesses in the development categories in which we compete are expected to grow at a low single-digit rate over the long-term. And while our cereal and snack businesses in developing in emerging regions will grow faster, we think the low single-digit top line growth for total business is a realistic and achievable goal. 
In 2015, we'll be a step in the right direction. Results have improved as we saw in previous periods and we will build the platform in which we can grow in the years to come. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 and the discussion regarding the areas of investment. As we discussed with you over the last couple of quarters, our current investment as part of Project K will be centered on the 3 main areas over the past periods: Desire, Decide, and Delight. First of all, we support our brands with great brand building ideas that generate the Desire for our products. The way in which we engage with consumers has continued to involve and our investment takes various forms, including digital media, consumer promotions such as inserts; and traditional advertising. As you know, we currently spend a high percentage of sales on brand building. And while we're increasing our investment in brand building, we are as focused on optimizing the impact of this investment as we are on increasing the amount of the investment. 
Next is the excite phase. We're bringing all to life in store. We're investing in sales capabilities. We have invested in both the cereal and snack salesforces in the U.S. and have always started to see better execution and results in store but also started to invest in the 3 international regions, including investment in regional sales Centers of Excellence, designed to share best practices. 
And finally  is the Delight place. We Delight consumers with great food. Consumer trends in [indiscernible] and weight management are evolving. And we must appeal to those trends with foods to address the needs of the consumers and then also taste great. We've been doing a lot of work in our foods around the world, including the recent launch of muesli and granola and reformulation of many of our existing foods. Specifically, we've launched new Special K bars with improved of food and packaging. We have new cereals and we're converting the GOLEAN brand in the heart-to-heart brand to organic. And we're also promoting the versatility of our foods. 
So to sum up. Much of this activity is intended to address the challenges that we faces in developed businesses around the world in the last year or so. I mean, some of these activity has started as early in the year, but we started to see response and we are optimistic that it will provide a base for future sales growth. And now I'll turn it over to Ron for the discussion of the financial results for the quarter and full year."
283356,278189283,760942,"Kellogg Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 shows the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. Comparable net sales for the full year decreased by 2%.

Slide 6 shows the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. Comparable net sales for the full year decreased by 2%. We had better performance in some of our international businesses, particularly in the second half of the year. But we experienced declines in our developed cereal businesses and the U.S. Snacks business. We are executing initiatives in these initiatives, including the introduction of new foods and investment in marketing, as John mentioned, to improve performance. 
The recorded quarterly operating loss was $422 million, which included a significant non-cash mark-to-market adjustment of $822 million. This was primarily driven by the impact the changes of interest rates had on pension plan liabilities. 
Comparable operating profit decreased by 0 .1% in the fourth quarter. Operating profit declined by 3.9% for the full year, more than we expected as a result of lower production volume and higher distribution costs. Cost management actions and lower incentive compensation and overhead contributed positively to fourth quarter and full year performance. As John mentioned, investment in brand building is significant and overall brand building for the year remained unchanged as a percentage of sales in 2014. 
Comparable earnings per share, which excludes integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments to 53rd week, Project K cost and other items that affect comparability, were $0.84 per share on the fourth quarter and $3.81 per share for the full year, in line with our expectations. These results include $0.02 of currency headwind in the fourth quarter and $0.01 for the full year. The 53rd week added $0.07 to earnings per share in the quarter. 
Slide 7 shows the composition of the fourth quarter and full year sales growth. For the full year, reported sales decreased by 1.4% and comparable sales decreased by 2%, with a similar decline in comparable net sales in the fourth quarter. Comparable volume decreased by 2.6% for the full year and price mix increased by 0.6%. 
Comparable volume stabilized in Europe and in Latin America in the fourth quarter. The decline in volume was primarily the result of the developed cereal and snacks businesses in the U.S. 
The impact of currency translation reduced sales growth by 0.8 points in the full year and nearly 3% in the fourth quarter as many currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar. The 53rd week also contributed growth in the quarter and for the full year. 
Slide 8 shows our comparable gross profit and gross margin for the quarter and the year. Comparable gross margin decreased by 40 basis points for the full year and by 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. And this decline was consistent with our latest guidance. Lower production volume driven by our sales performance and higher distribution costs impacted margin. 
Our savings from productivity were in line with expectations and savings from Project K also met expectations. 
Slide 9 shows the comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions in the fourth quarter. North America's comparable operating profit decreased by 7%, largely as a result of lower sales posted in the quarter. 
We continue to face challenges in our U.S. cereals and snacks businesses. And this was the primary driver of the decline in operating profit in the quarter. In addition, we also saw lower production volume and greater-than-anticipated distribution cost continue to the fourth quarter. Investment in brand building as a percentage of sales was unchanged for the full year. 
Comparable operating profit in Europe increased by 24% in the fourth quarter as a result of net deflation in cost of goods sold, including strong productivity savings, the timing of investment in brand building and cost discipline and overhead. 
Comparable operating profit declined by 4% in Latin America in the fourth quarter. Benefit from top line growth of more than 7% was more than offset by the timing of costs, including a double-digit increase in investment in brand building to support second half product launches across the region. 
Fourth quarter comparable operating profit increased by 50% in the Asia-Pacific region. This was driven by solid productivity improvements and Project K savings in cost of goods sold as well as lower brand building, primarily in Australia. 
Slide 10 shows the full year cash flow for 2014. Cash flow was $1.2 billion, which exceeded our expectations for the full year. This was driven by the benefit from the year end U.S. tax legislation and broad-based working capital improvements, including our supplier financing initiative. This initiative added more than $200 million to annual cash flow in 2014 and nearly offset approximately $250 million of incremental cash impact from Project K. We expect additional benefit from this program in 2015 as we cascade it across the globe. 
Capital spending for the year was $582 million, at the low end of our range. This includes the impact of some timing between 2014 and 2015 as well as lower costs for certain projects. 
Share repurchases for the year were $690 million and we reduced our average share count by 1.4% as planned. Dividends paid in 2014 were $680 million of total cash return to share owners with almost $1.4 billion. 
Now let's turn to Slide 11 in our guidance for 2015. As always this guidance excludes items that affect comparability, so please see our notes for details. We expected challenging macroeconomic environment in 2015. And the devaluation of foreign currencies also presents both transitional and transactional foreign currency headwinds. So the guidance we're providing today is realistic and reflects the investment necessary to stabilize our business and return to sustainable growth. We expect the comparable net sales will be approximately flat for the year, an improvement when compared to the performance we saw in 2014. 
We expect net deflation in cost of goods sold. Overall, commodity and packaging costs are relatively neutral and we are approximately 70% covered for the year. However, we do anticipate inflation in wages, benefits and logistics costs. We expect the benefit from productivity to be 3% to 4% cost of goods, in line with our long-term goals and we'll see incremental savings from Project K in 2015. 
So if you add all of these factors together, we expect to see net deflation for the year and slight gross margin expansion. Comparable operating profit is estimated to be down between 2% and 4%. This includes the impact of basing incentive compensation cost, just between 3 and 4-point headwind to operating profit growth, slightly higher than the 2 to 3 points we communicated in our third quarter 10-Q. Excluding this headwind, comparable operating profit growth will be approximately flat to up slightly. We expect brand building will increase at a rate faster than sales growth. And we expect the currency-neutral comparable earnings will be in the range of flat to down 2% or $3.74 to $3.82 per share. Of course, the incentive compensation headwind also impacts our earnings per share in 2015 by between 3 and 4 points. 
These earnings expectations exclude the impact of 2014's 53rd week and the impact of foreign currency translation, which currently looks like it could be as much as $0.15 per share. 
The tax rate is expected to be between 27% and 28% and interest expense is anticipated to be between $215 million and $225 million. We expect that cash flow after capital spending will be approximately $1 billion. This includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million from Project K. So underlying cash flow is between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. We anticipate the total capital spending will be in the range of 4% to 5% of sales. This includes approximately 1 point of sales for incremental capital for Project K. It also includes investment increased capacity in our Pringles business and the completion of a new cereal plant in India. 
As I said, the total incremental after-tax cost for Project K will be approximately $350 million in 2015, including the additional point of sales for capital spending. This makes 2015 a year with the most cash outflows over the life of the Project K. We expect to repurchase between 700 million and 750 million of shares in 2015. Our current outlook for the first quarter earnings per share is that it will account for approximately 1 quarter of our total estimate for the full year on a comparable basis, including the impact of currency. Currently, our expectations are that the impact of the currency will be spread relatively evenly across the year. 
Slide 12 shows our annual EPS log, based on comparable earnings of 2014 of $3.81 per share. As I mentioned, currency translation could have an impact of as much as $0.15 per share, although this does not include the impact of any significant currency devaluations we might see during the year such as in Venezuela. Obviously, this estimate will change and we plan to update you on the impact on future quarterly calls. 
We expect a small amount of costs related to the integration of distributors and other items for Pringles in 2015. And we estimate this cost to be between $0.03 and $0.05 per share, expected that this will be the last year of this integration cost. While it's early in the integration process at this time, we expect that the impact of the investment and in Egypt will not be material in 2015. 
And finally, we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, approximately 2/3 of which will come from cost of goods sold. 
Pretax P&L cost related to the project are estimated to be between $400 million and $450 million, or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share in 2015, 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. Obviously, the timing and cost of the projects may change over time. So we'll provide an update regarding Project K on the quarterly conference calls and at the upcoming conference. And I'll turn it over back to John for more detail on the operations."

Let's turn to next slide and detail regarding the Morning Foods business. Comparable net sales declined by 7.7% in the fourth quarter and by 5.7% for the full year. 2014 was clearly a disappointing year for us in Morning Foods. But we are taking the right actions to improve the performance of the business overtime. 
As I mentioned, we have already started to invest the savings from Project K in our food and brand building and in execution. And we have stronger plans for 2015. We expect that sales in the U.S. cereal business will be down in 2015, but that trends will show a real improvement over those we saw in 2014. 
The performance in the fourth quarter of 2014 was again primarily driven by the Kashi and Special K brands as we have been in recent quarters. In addition, we continue to face innovation of the market and this also had an impact in the quarter. However, partially offsetting these effects was better display and good performance from the Froot Loops brand, which gained share as a result of strong end market support. And we're also seeing good initial results from our Disney Frozen themed cereal, which is exceeding our expectations. 
We previously highlighted the programs in Special K and Kashi brands. And Paul Norman will discuss them in more detail in next week's conference. Let me just highlight a few things on Slide 15. We have launched the See You at Breakfast campaign and the Open for Breakfast Digital program designed to help us connect directly with consumers. We are investing in in-store capabilities in our U.S. Morning Foods sales force. We are investing in our food. We are launching new Special K products, such as gluten-free and protein. We are continuing to evolve the Kashi GOLEAN brand certified GMO free. And we're making the Kashi heart-to-heart brand USDA organic. 
We expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the Special K and Kashi brands and on the whole cereal business as a whole. However, our plan for investment is a long-term one and the levels, content and effectiveness of the support revolve and increase over time. 
Consumption in our Pop-Tarts business declined in the quarter, again due to comparisons to good performance last year. However, we gained share in the quarter and the full year and launched a new variety of peanut butter and jelly flavored Pop-Tarts during the quarter and we expect this to improve results in 2015. As you can tell, we've been focusing on improving the cereal business and we have a lot of activity planned for 2015, some of which is beginning now. We've launched new products and redesigned food and packaging to better appeal to consumer trends. We have continued our brand support, while increasing our efforts to drive category relevance. And we're driving more effectiveness for our investment, not just the incremental work but the core investment as well. Improvement will come over time and we're confident that we have the ideas and the brands necessary to stabilize the business and return us to growth. 
Now let's turn to U.S. Snacks business on Slide 16. Comparable net sales declined by 3.1% in the fourth quarter and by 2.4% for the full year. As we saw last quarter, and in other categories around the world, the decline in sales was largely due to consumer trends away from weight management brands. 
Sales in the cracker business was low in the quarter, although sales and share were approximately unchanged for the full year. We continue to see share gains in the 3 largest brands: Cheez-It, Club and Town House in Q4. However, this good performance was offset by continued declines in the Special K Cracker Chips business due to the trends I referenced earlier. As a result, we are addressing this by relaunching Special K Cracker Chips with better taste profiles and improved packaging and with new positioning. These arrive in stores late in December. 
We saw a decline in share in the cookie category in the quarter, largely as a result of continued declines in the Right Bite 100-calorie pack business, which was also the result of the trends in weight management and accounted for half of the total decline in share. However, we are migrating consumers to expanded line of single-serve products, which should help to reduce the impact of the decline in Right Bites in 2015. The business was also impacted by lower distribution as Keebler special edition items exited the market. 
Also in the cookie segment, we saw continued growth from Chips Deluxe as a result of the new products cobranded with M&M's. These products relate to growth and consumption and share of the brand in the quarter and for the full year. 
Our consumption in the wholesome snack category declined in the quarter and we lost share. However, the trends in consumption improved. Both Nutri-Grain and Rice Krispies Treats saw increased consumption and share in the fourth quarter and for the full year, as a result of core growth and innovation. 
Consumption of Rice Krispies Treats increased at a double-digit rate in the quarter. And Kashi bars posted better performance later in the year due to the launch of new products. 
The declines in the business continued to be driven by Special K bars and other bars, again as a result of the weight management issues I mentioned. In response, we are launching new great-tasting Special K snack bars with new packaging and new food. This activity ties into the initiatives we are launching in other categories in regions around the world and the new products also began to arrive in stores late in December. 
The U.S. Pringles business posted mid-single digit comparable net sales growth for the whole year. We posted flat comparable net sales in the fourth quarter due to the timing of promotions and brand building activities and the impact of the launch of Pringles Tortilla in the fourth quarter of 2013, which led to a high single-digit comparison. We expect to see growth from this business in 2015, partially as a result of brand building support by core brands, although we have difficult comparisons against the launch of Tortilla in the first half of the year. Pringles as a global brand posted full year growth in all regions in 2014 and we're selling every can we can make around the world. 
So as we expected, our U.S. Snacks business continued to face challenges in the fourth quarter. As with the cereal business, we anticipate that improvement will take time. However, we've identified the issues, which was on our weight management brands and we're beginning the investment necessary to stabilize this business and return it to growth. We're taking actions now that will start to drive improvement in the future. 
Please turn to Slide 17 in the U.S. Specialty segment. Our Specialty Channels business posted a decline in comparable net sales of 1% in the fourth quarter. Comparable net sales for the full year declined by 1.4%. In the fourth quarter, Kellogg gained share in the convenience channel, in the wholesome snack, cracker and snacks categories. Total net sales in the convenience business increased at a high single digit rate in the quarter partially as a result of introduction of new products [indiscernible] 2014 high single digit growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. Now that we reduced sales in custom products in Q4 and the full year in this segment. 
We have great plans for U.S. Specialty in 2015 and expect full year sales growth as a result. 
Slide 18 shows the performance of the North America Other segment, which saw an increase in comparable sales of 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This segment includes the U.S. Frozen Foods and Canadian businesses. 
Comparable net sales in the Frozen Foods business declined slightly in the quarter. Consumption of Eggo waffles is improving, as we relaunched the Leggo My Eggo brand building program and launched Eggo gluten-free a new variety of big and fluffy waffles. 
We're also in the middle of launching Eggo handheld sandwiches. These are all family breakfast sandwich. And although it's early in the process, the initial results have been encouraging. As a result of this launch and good performance from our Special K handheld sandwiches, sales of our total sandwich business increased at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter and we gained share. 
Finally, for the Frozen Foods business, we have new Special K products scheduled to launch in April and we've also seen good results in our morning snack bars [indiscernible] burger, which is non-GMO and made with organic ingredients. So a lot of activity planned for this year and we expect this business to return to growth in 2015. 
[indiscernible] increased at a mid single-digit rate in the Canadian business in the fourth quarter. Consumption growth in the Canadian category has improved significantly and our sales were approximately flat for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 19 in our European business. Comparable net sales in the region declined by 0.7% in the full year and by 1.2% in the fourth quarter. We saw growth in the snack and emerging market businesses and some continued challenges in the developed cereal markets. We saw a double-digit net sales growth in emerging markets in the fourth quarter. Specifically, both the [indiscernible] business and the Russian business posted good results in the quarter and for the full year, any that we recently announced in investment in [indiscernible]. the largest biscuit manufacturer in Egypt. The biscuit category has been performing well in Egypt. And this is a great investment that will add additional growth to our current Middle Eastern business and we're also excited about the potential for geographic expansion. Chris Wood [ph], the president of our business in Kellogg in Europe, will give you more detail regarding this -- next week at CAGNY. 
As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, the developed cereal business continued to face challenges, similar to the ones we've seen in the U.S. We ran brand building activities in the second half of 2014 and got more new products and brand building launching in the first quarter of 2015. Muesli, like the one you can see posted on the slide, is just one example of the new [indiscernible] of the market in various regions. This is great tasting cereal in a resealable pouch and is an example of the kind of work we've been doing to improve our foods. 
We're also running popular promotion across the European region that allows consumers to receive a personalized spoon and we're launching new products in the U.K. and Ireland. New Special K advertising has recently gone on air in the U.K, which addresses some of the recent [indiscernible] we've seen and we're launching a new [indiscernible] across the region. 
The Pringles business posted growth of 6.5% in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we posted the highest sales of any quarter in the history of the business. We also got new products launching, including the Tortilla Pringles, which has been very successful in U.S. and we have more capacity coming online at mid-year. So we achieved some success in the region in 2014 and we are optimistic that we can build on this as we enter 2015. 
Slide 20 shows the performance of our Latin American business for the quarter and the year. Comparable net sales growth was 7.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. This group performance was primarily the result of growth in Venezuela, Mexico, and in the broader Pringles business. The markets are in Latin America saw good growth in the fourth quarter, although the competitive activity we mentioned last quarter continued in Mexico. Children cereal contributed to the growth of the business in the region as a result of good brand building programs and product introductions, including new [indiscernible] and Choco Krispies. 
We are also addressing challenges in the adult segment with new commercial plans and the renovation of Special K and All-Bran, 2 of our largest brands in the region. In addition, we have executed parent brand programs, including the Breakfast for Better Days program, which has been well received. We're also launching other great products in the region in 2015 and are working to expand the overall distribution of our cereals. 
The Pringles business continued to do well in Q4, posing mid single-digit comparable sales growth, which had a good initial reaction to new Tortilla Pringles and the execution of the launch has gone well. And we have also recently launched Kellogg branded granola bars in the region. 
So we ended the year well as a result of good activity and we have more planned for the coming months. We expect to increase investment in brand building in 2015 and expect growth in both comparable sales and comparable operating profit. 
Now let's turn to Slide 21 in our Asia-Pacific business. The Asia-Pacific segment posted a decline in comparable net sales of 1.2% in the fourth quarter and growth of 0.7% for the full year. Strong results in Asia were offset by issues in the developed cereals business in Australia. The Asian business posted double-digit net sales growth in the quarter with the Indian, Japanese and Southeast Asian businesses all achieving double-digit sales growth. The Southeast Asian business benefited from strong current brand activation and the Japanese business saw continued growth growth in the granola segment. 
The Australian cereals business continued to face pressures similar to those seen in other developed businesses and the results were also impacted by the year-over-year timing of promotional activity in the fourth quarter. 
The Pringles business posted good sales growth results in Australia and strong growth in much of Asia. 
Finally, the joint venture we had in China posted significant double-digit net sales growth as both cereal and Pringles businesses continued to contribute. 
So we had a good fourth quarter and full year in Asia. We had some challenges in the Australian cereal business. We've already begun initiatives and have launched new products that will help address the situation. We expect stronger growth across Asia Pacific in 2015. 
Now let's look at Slide 22 and the summary. Project K remains on track in 2014 and is beginning to provide significant flexibility to reinvest in the business. In 2015, we will continue to invest across the  and Desire, Decide, Delight. We'll continue to invest in brand building and we have more programs launching now and across the balance of the year that will support our new foods and our existing products. We are bringing all to life in store with increased sales capabilities and starting to see better execution and improvement in the results. And we've made significant improvements to our food in order to meet the rapidly changing views of consumers regarding health and wellness. This includes new foods and new packaging and the reformulation of many of our existing foods. 
So 2015 is rebuilding year for us. It's an opportunity to invest in great food and ideas and to build a solid platform for long-term growth. As I'm sure you can see, our tailored employees are dedicated to returning the company to growth. They are executing Project K, they are delivering savings, they are developing the growth plans and they are implementing the plans.

You've spoken pretty recently that you believe you can achieve that mid-single digit operating profit growth even in an environment where you're only generating 1% to 2% internal sales. So that's consistent. But does that guidance only hold true during this period of accelerated savings in Project K? And is it feasible to sustain that, I guess, 50 basis points of annual margin expansion beyond the conclusion of Project K, when you'll be more reliant just on ongoing productivity? And secondly, is there any implied change in your cereal category expectations that are baked into that 1% to 3%?"

We said before we're reinvesting Project K back into the business and that's our primary objective, as we drive the business back to sustainable long-term growth. So we've got to got the business back into growth. If we can achieve 1% to 2% growth, 3% on the top line, and we can offset inflation with underlying productivity programs that gives us gross margin expansion because of the leverage we get through our manufacturing facilities. We can have modest investment back into our organization and into our brand building programs and still deliver mid single-digit operating profit growth. So the way our economics work is we are quite leveraged P&L. Small amounts of top line growth can lead to mid single-digit operating profit growth, irrespective of Project K. In terms of our views long-term on the business and the category growth, we continue to believe that Europe and North America could grow low single digits and Asia-Pacific and Latin America can grow mid single-digits and even mid to high single digit in the case of Latin America. And we'll talk more about this at CAGNY next week. As I think about our developed cereal businesses, we believe we can return our developed cereal business back to growth. However, we think being pragmatic, that growth is pretty much at the low end of the low single-digit kind of range, where those categories have historically outperformed over the last 5, 10 years. Again, we'll show you some of that information at CAGNY next week. So the key reason for us changing our guidance was to really remind investors that even though our average growth over last 10 years has been about 3.5% of the top line, we really only need low single-digit growth to meet mid single-digit agree that work and we generate a lot of extra cash in able to us to buy back shares and get to the high single-digit EPS and pay have dividend, which even goes to double-digit all of being equal. So that low single digits obviously is our goal internally. We obviously have realistic goals. We'll aspire to do better but we believe we can absolutely achieve the low single-digit growth overtime."

And in fact, if you look at what we've done at Project K savings in 2015, we've invested back into the capabilities that over time will enable us to grow our top line. So we've invested back into global category teams. We've invested back into rebuilding the Kashi team. We've invested back into our sales force in snacks and the Morning Foods in the U.S. Those investments do not provide an immediate return. Those investments provide returns overtime because you have to invest in the people, then they start to generate ideas, they start to bring these ideas to the market. So these are not short-term payback reimbursements. But I can assure you that we have the conversation internally. We have our organization focused on returning to return growth sometimes the organization absolutely focused on being more effective and efficient is about doing both well."

One would be our experience in Australia, where we launched the Special K cereal in 2014 but actually now has a Special K business back to growth in Australia, although Special K is a smaller brand for us in that market that isn't in many other markets.

If we were to move from the official rate to a CCAB 1 which remember, which is about VEF 12 to the U.S. dollar Our latest outlook is that that could be approximately $0.18 of earnings per share impact. That includes both the one time write down of the net asset as well as a translational impact if, for example, that change were to occur here in the first quarter. I believe the CCAB 2 rate goes away, based on what the government recently communicated. I'm not sure where the secondary rate will go that they have have communicated. It looks like it could be around VEF 120 to the U.S. dollar. If that were the case and if we were to value to that level, it will be about twice the impact of moving to CCAB 1."

This is the first kind of a really big year of savings from Project K. Your productivity programs, again, I think you said in line with historic kind of 3% to 4%. And against cost of goods sold, that's something like $300 million or more. So in total, you guys would be producing savings of north of $400 million, which is like $0.80 a share. I think the management comp number, 3% to 4%, that's like $0.15. I guess I want to understand that when I put these numbers together, it just feels like you should be in a much better environment from the internally generated savings than what your bottom line earnings are showing. So where's all the money going if the $0.80 saving is right, if management comp is only $0.15, if sales are comfortable year-on-year, how much is brand building building up?

So our guidance is realistic and it does reflect improving trend, including investments that are going back into our business around innovation, investments into our food as well and investments into our commercial programs, for example, in the brand building. Of our sales, there's estimated to be approximately flat. I said we expect it also slight net deflation in cost of goods sold, which should give us a slight improvement in gross margin. Keep in mind, we are seeing inflation within cost of goods sold. Our commodity, as I commented, are relatively neutral to down slightly. We are seeing increases in our factory costs and wages and benefits and then higher logistic costs as well. Not so much around fuel. We can see fuel this is more around carrier rates and the supply and demand impact on carriers. We also have a little bit of a transactional FX exposure that sits in cost of goods sold as well. And then as I said, our operating profit is down [indiscernible] but that includes a 3 to 4-point headwind associated with the incentive compensation. We are investing in brand building.

Comparable full year sales were at the lower end of our guidance range. Our results for full year comparable operating profit was slightly lower than we had anticipated, primarily due to the decline in sales. And our results for full year comparable earnings per share were in line with our expectations, but were also at the low end of the range. 
Project K is on track and we've delivered savings in line with our guidance for 2014. The global business services initiative is going well and we've begun to reduce capacity in some regions and add capacity in others. 
Results from our labor strategy intend to drive a more competitive, sustainable cost structure had been mixed. We've seen good results in Europe and Australia, although we still have work to do in the U.S. As you know, Project K will provide us with a considerable amount of financial flexibility and we are continuing our investment in 2015. 
We're at an important point as we enter 2015. After a disappointing 2014, we are building a platform for growth over the coming year. We will continue to execute Project K. We are investing in our business and we expect to stabilize our top line in 2015. In providing guidance for 2015, we recognize the critical task of returning the company to sustainable top line growth. We expect full year comparable net sales to be approximately flat, a significant improvement from the trends we saw in 2014. We were pleased with our performance in much of the international business in 2014. And our expectations are that the positive sales trends will continue in 2015. However, we do have more work to do in the U.S., particularly in the cereal and snack businesses. Ron will provide more detail regarding our guidance for 2015 in a few minutes. 
As we look to the long-term health of the business, it is critically important that we set realistic financial goals. Please turn to Slide 4 and a discussion of our long-term targets. We are changing our target for long-term comparable revenue growth to a low single-digit rate. Our target for comparable operating profit growth remains at the mid-single-digit rate and our target for currency-neutral comparable EPS growth remains at a high single-digit rate. One of the key drivers of success is targeting realistic goals, which can be achieved over the long-term. 
The businesses in the developed categories in which we compete are expected to grow at a low single-digit rate over the long-term. And while our cereal and snack businesses in developing in emerging regions will grow faster, we think that low single-digit top line growth for total business is a realistic and achievable goal. 
And 2015, we'll be a step in the right direction. Results will improve from those we saw in previous periods and we will build a platform from which we can grow in the years to come. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 and a discussion regarding the areas of investment. As we've discussed with you over the last couple of quarters, our current investment as part of Project K will be centered on the 3 main areas over the past purchase: Desire, Decide, and Delight. First of all, we support our brands with great brand building ideas that generate the Desire for our products. The way in which we engage with consumers has continued to evolve and our investment takes various forms, including digital media, consumer promotions such as inserts and traditional advertising. As you know, we currently spend a high percentage of sales on brand building. And while we're increasing our investment in brand building, we are as focused on optimizing the impact of this investment as we are on increasing the amount of the investment. 
Next is the Decide phase, where we bring it all to life in store. We're investing in sales capabilities. We have invested in both the cereal and snack sales forces in the U.S. and have always started to see better execution and results in store and have also started to invest in the 3 international regions, including investment in regional sales Centers of Excellence, designed to share best practices. 
And finally is the Delight phase. We Delight consumers with great food. Consumer trends in health and wellness and in weight and management are evolving. And we must appeal to those trends with foods that address the needs of consumers and that also taste great. We've been doing a lot of work on our foods around the world, including the recent launch of Mueslis and granolas and the reformulation of many of our existing foods. Specifically, we've launched new Special K bars with improved food and packaging. We have new cashew cereals and we're converting the GOLEAN brand to be GMO-free the heart-to-heart brand to organic. And we're also promoting the versatility of our foods. 
So to sum up. Much of this activity is intended to address the challenges that we faced in developed businesses around the world in the last year or so. I mean, some of these activity has started and it's early in the year, but we're starting to see a response and we're optimistic that it will provide a base for future sales growth. 
And now I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of the financial results for the quarter and full year."
283356,278189283,761373,"Kellogg Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.

Slide 6 shows the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. Comparable net sales for the full year decreased by 2%. We had better performance in some of our international businesses, particularly in the second half of the year. But we experienced declines in our developed cereal businesses and the U.S. Snacks business. We are executing initiatives in these initiatives, including the introduction of new foods and investment in marketing, as John mentioned, to improve performance. 
The recorded quarterly operating loss was $422 million, which included a significant non-cash mark-to-market adjustment of $822 million. This was primarily driven by the impact the changes in interest rates had on pension plan liabilities. 
Comparable operating profit decreased by 0.1% in the fourth quarter. Operating profit declined by 3.9% for the full year, more than we expected as a result of lower production volume and higher distribution costs. Cost management actions and lower incentive compensation and overhead contributed positively to fourth quarter and full year performance. As John mentioned, investment in brand building is significant and overall brand building for the year remained unchanged as a percentage of sales in 2014. 
Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments to 53rd week, Project K cost and other items that affect comparability, were $0.84 per share on the fourth quarter and $3.81 per share for the full year, in line with our expectations. These results include $0.02 of currency headwind in the fourth quarter and $0.01 for the full year. The 53rd week added $0.07 to earnings per share in the quarter. 
Slide 7 shows the composition of the fourth quarter and full year sales growth. For the full year, reported sales decreased by 1.4% and comparable sales decreased by 2%, with a similar decline in comparable net sales in the fourth quarter. Comparable volume decreased by 2.6% for the full year and price mix increased by 0.6%. 
Comparable volume stabilized in Europe and in Latin America in the fourth quarter. The decline in volume was primarily the result of the developed cereal and snack businesses in the U.S. 
The impact of currency translation reduced sales growth by 0.8 points for the full year and nearly 3% in the fourth quarter as many currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar. The 53rd week also contributed growth in the quarter and for the full year. 
Slide 8 shows our comparable gross profit and gross margin for the quarter and the year. Comparable gross margin decreased by 40 basis points for the full year and by 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. And this decline was consistent with our latest guidance. Lower production volume driven by our sales performance and higher distribution costs impacted margin. 
Our savings from productivity were in line with expectations and savings from Project K also met expectations. 
Slide 9 shows the comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions in the fourth quarter. North America's comparable operating profit decreased by 7%, largely as a result of lower sales posted in the quarter. 
We continue to face challenges in our U.S. cereal and snacks businesses. And this was the primary driver of the decline in operating profit in the quarter. In addition, we also saw lower production volume and greater-than-anticipated distribution cost continue to the fourth quarter. Investment in brand building as a percentage of sales was unchanged for the full year. 
Comparable operating profit in Europe increased by 24% in the fourth quarter as a result of net deflation in cost of goods sold, including strong productivity savings, the timing of investment in brand building and cost discipline and overhead. 
Comparable operating profit declined by 4% in Latin America in the fourth quarter. Benefit from top line growth of more than 7% was more than offset by the timing of costs, including a double-digit increase in investment in brand building to support second half product launches across the region. 
Fourth quarter comparable operating profit increased by 50% in the Asia-Pacific region. This was driven by solid productivity improvements and Project K savings in cost of goods sold as well as lower brand building, primarily in Australia.
Slide 10 shows full year cash flow for 2014. Cash flow was $1.2 billion, which exceeded our expectations for the full year. This was driven by a benefit from year end U.S. tax legislation and broad-based working capital improvements, including our supplier financing initiative. This initiative added more than $200 million to annual cash flow in 2014 and nearly offset approximately $250 million of incremental cash impact from Project K. We expect additional benefit from this program in 2015 as we cascade it across the globe. 
Capital spending for the year was $582 million, at the low end of our range. This includes the impact of some timing between 2014 and 2015 as well as lower costs for certain projects. 
Share repurchases for the year were $690 million and we reduced our average share count by 1.4% as planned. Dividends paid in 2014 were $680 million of total cash return to share owners was almost $1.4 billion.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 and our guidance for 2015. As always this guidance excludes items that affect comparability, so please see our notes for details. We expected challenging macroeconomic environment in 2015. And the devaluation of foreign currencies also presents both translational and transactional foreign currency headwinds. So the guidance we're providing today is realistic and reflects the investment necessary to stabilize our business and return it to sustainable growth. We expect that comparable net sales will be approximately flat for the year, an improvement when compared to the performance we saw in 2014. 
We expect net deflation in cost of goods sold. Overall, commodity and packaging costs are relatively neutral and we are approximately 70% covered for the year. However, we do anticipate inflation in wages, benefits and logistics costs. We expect the benefit from productivity to be 3% to 4% cost of goods, in line with our long-term goals and we'll see incremental savings from Project K in 2015. 
So if you add all of these factors together, we expect to see net deflation for the year and slight gross margin expansion. Comparable operating profit is estimated to be down between 2% and 4%. This includes the impact of rebasing incentive compensation costs, just between 3- and 4-point headwind to operating profit growth, slightly higher than the 2 to 3 points we communicated in our third quarter 10-Q. Excluding this headwind, comparable operating profit growth will be approximately flat to up slightly. We expect brand building will increase at a rate faster than sales growth. And we expect the currency-neutral comparable earnings will be in the range of flat to down 2% or $3.74 to $3.82 per share. Of course, the incentive compensation headwind also impacts our earnings per share in 2015 by between 3 and 4 points. 
These earnings expectations exclude the impact of 2014's 53rd week and the impact of foreign currency translation, which currently looks like it could be as much as $0.15 per share. 
The tax rate is expected to be between 27% and 28% and interest expense is anticipated to be between $215 million and $225 million. We expect that cash flow after capital spending will be approximately $1 billion. This includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million from Project K. So underlying cash flow is between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. We anticipate the total capital spending will be in the range of 4% to 5% of sales. This includes approximately 1 point of sales for incremental capital for Project K. It also includes investment to increase the capacity in our Pringles business and the completion of a new cereal plant in India. 
As I said, the total incremental after-tax cash cost for Project K will be approximately $350 million in 2015, including the additional point of sales for capital spending. This makes 2015 the year with the most cash outflows over the life of Project K. We expect to repurchase between 700 million and 750 million of shares in 2015. Our current outlook for the first quarter earnings per share is that it will account for approximately one quarter of our total estimate for the full year on a comparable basis, including the impact of currency. Currently, our expectations are that the impact of currency will be spread relatively evenly across the year. 
Slide 12 shows our annual EPS log, based on comparable earnings of 2014 of $3.81 per share. As I mentioned, currency translation could have an impact of as much as $0.15 per share, although this does not include the impact of any significant currency devaluations we might see during the year, such as in Venezuela. Obviously, this estimate will change and we plan to update you on the impact on future quarterly calls. 
We expect a small amount of costs related to the integration of distributors and other items for Pringles in 2015. And we estimate this cost of between $0.03 and $0.05 per share and expect that this will be the last year of these integration costs. While it's early in the integration process at this time, we expect that the impact on the investment and BiscoMisr in Egypt will not be material in 2015. 
And finally, we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, approximately 2/3 of which will come from cost of goods sold. 
Pretax P&L cost related to the project are estimated to be between $400 million and $450 million, or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share in 2015, 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. Obviously, the timing and cost of the projects may change over time. So we'll provide an update regarding Project K on the quarterly conference calls and at the upcoming CAGNY conference. 
And now I'll turn it back over to John, for more detail on the operating segments."

Let's turn to next slide in detail regarding the Morning Foods business. Comparable net sales declined by 7.7% in the fourth quarter and by 5.7% for the full year. 2014 was clearly a disappointing year for us in Morning Foods. But we're taking the right actions to improve the performance of the business overtime. 
As I mentioned, we have already started to invest the savings from Project K in our food and brand building and in in-store execution. And we have stronger plans for 2015. We expect that sales in the U.S. cereal business will be down in 2015, but that trends will show a real improvement over those we saw in 2014. 
The performance in the fourth quarter of 2014 was again primarily driven by the Kashi and Special K brands as it has been in recent quarters. In addition, we continue to face and pry innovation out of the market and this also had an impact in the quarter. However, partially offsetting these effects was better display and good performance from the Froot Loops brand, which gained share as a result of strong end market support. And we're also seeing good initial results from our Disney Frozen themed cereal, which is exceeding our expectations.
We previously highlighted some of the programs and changes we're making to the Special K and Kashi brands. And Paul Norman will discuss them in more detail in next week's CAGNY conference. 
Let me just highlight a few things on Slide 15. We have launched the See You at Breakfast campaign and the Open for Breakfast Digital program designed to help us connect directly with consumers. We are investing in in-store capabilities in our U.S. Morning Foods sales force. We are investing in our food. We are launching new Special K products, such as gluten-free and protein. We are continuing to evolve the Kashi GOLEAN brand certified GMO-free. And we're making the Kashi heart-to-heart brand USDA organic. 
We expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the Special K and Kashi brands and on the cereal business as a whole. However, our plan for investment is a long-term one and the levels, content and effectiveness of the support we evolve and increase over time. 
Consumption in our Pop-Tarts business declined in the quarter, again due to comparisons to good performance last year. However, we gained share in the quarter and the full year and launched a new variety of peanut butter and jelly flavored Pop-Tarts during the quarter and we expect this to improve results in 2015. As you can tell, we've been focusing on improving the cereal business and we have a lot of activity planned for 2015, some of which is beginning now. We've launched new products and redesigned food and packaging to better appeal to consumer trends. We have continued our brand support, while increasing our efforts to drive category relevance. And we're driving more effectiveness from our investment, not just the incremental work, but the core investment as well. Improvement will come over time and we're confident that we have the ideas and the brands necessary to stabilize the business and return it to growth. 
Now let's turn to our U.S. Snacks business on Slide 16. Comparable net sales declined by 3.1% in the fourth quarter and by 2.4% for the full year. As we saw last quarter, and in other categories around the world, the decline in sales was largely due to consumer trends away from weight management brands. 
Sales in the cracker business was low in the quarter, although sales and share were approximately unchanged for the full year. We continue to see share gains in the 3 largest brands: Cheez-It, Club and Town House in Q4. However, this good performance was offset by continued declines in the Special K Cracker Chip business due to the trends I referenced earlier. As a result, we are addressing this by relaunching Special K Cracker Chips with better taste profiles and improved packaging and with new positioning. They started to arrive in stores late in December. 
We saw a decline in share of the cookie category in the quarter, largely as a result of continued declines in the Right Bites' 100-calorie pack business. This was also the result of the trends in weight management and accounted for half of that total decline in share. However, we are migrating consumers to an expanded line of single-serve products, which should help to reduce the impact of the decline in Right Bites in 2015. The business was also impacted by lower distribution as Keebler special edition items exited the market. 
Also in the cookie segment, we saw continued growth from Chips Deluxe as a result of the new products co-branded with M&M's. These products relate to growth and consumption and share of the brand in the quarter and for the full year. 
Our consumption in the wholesome snack category declined in the quarter and we lost share. However, the trends in consumption improved. Both Nutri-Grain and Rice Krispies Treats saw increased consumption and share in the fourth quarter and for the full year as a result of core growth and innovation. 
Consumption of Rice Krispies Treats increased at a double-digit rate in the quarter. And Kashi bars posted better performance later in the year due to the launch of new products. 
The declines in the business continued to be driven by Special K bars and FiberPlus bars, again, as a result of the weight management issues I've mentioned. In response, we are launching new great-tasting Special K snack bars with new packaging and new food. This activity ties into the initiatives we are launching in other categories and regions around the world and the new products also began to arrive in stores late in December. 
The U.S. Pringles business posted mid-single digit comparable net sales growth for the whole year. We posted flat comparable net sales in the fourth quarter due to the timing of promotions and brand building activities and the impact of the launch of Pringles Tortilla in the fourth quarter of 2013, which led to a high single-digit comparison. We expect to see growth from this business in 2015, partially as a result of brand building support by core brand, although we have difficult comparisons against the launch of Tortilla in the first half of the year. Pringles, as a global brand, posted full year growth in all regions in 2014 and we're selling every can we can make around the world. 
So as we expected, our U.S. Snacks business continued to face challenges in the fourth quarter. As with the cereal business, we anticipate that improvement will take time. However, we've identified the issues, which was set on our weight management brands and we're beginning the investment necessary to stabilize this business and return it to growth. We're taking the actions now that will start to drive improvement in the future. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 in the U.S. Specialty segment. Our Specialty Channels business posted a decline in comparable net sales of 1% in the fourth quarter. Comparable net sales for the full year declined by 1.4%. In the fourth quarter, Kellogg gained share in the convenience channel, in the wholesome snack, cracker and salty snack categories. Total net sales in the convenience business increased at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, partially as a result of introduction of new products. [indiscernible] in 2014 built a high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. Note that we reduced sales in low-margin custom products in Q4 and the full year in this segment. We have great plans for U.S. Specialty in 2015 and expect full year sales growth as a result. 
Slide 18 shows the performance of the North America Other segment, which saw an increase in comparable sales of 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This segment includes the U.S. Frozen Foods and Canadian businesses. 
Comparable net sales in the Frozen Foods business declined slightly in the quarter. Consumption of Eggo waffles is improving, as we relaunched the Leggo My Eggo brand building program and launched Eggo gluten-free in a new variety of big and fluffy waffles. 
We are also in the middle of launching Eggo handheld sandwiches. These are on all family breakfast sandwich. And although it's early in the process, the initial results have been encouraging. As a result of this launch and good performance from our Special K handheld sandwiches, sales of our total sandwich business increased at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter and we gained share. 
Finally, for the Frozen Foods business, we have new Special K products scheduled to launch in April and we've also seen good results in our Morningstar Farms, Roasted Garlic and Quinoa burger, which is non-GMO and made with organic ingredients. So we've got a lot of activity planned for this year and we expect this business to return to growth in 2015. 
Beef sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the Canadian business in the fourth quarter. Consumption growth in the Canadian soup category has improved significantly and our sales were approximately flat for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 19 in our European business. Comparable net sales in the region declined by 0.7% in the full year and by 1.2% in the fourth quarter. We saw good growth in the snack and emerging market businesses and some continued challenges in the developed cereal markets. We saw a double-digit net sales growth in emerging markets in the fourth quarter. Specifically, both the Med Middle Eastern business and the Russian business posted good results in the quarter and for the full year. And you may have seen that we recently announced an investment in BiscoMisr, the largest biscuit manufacturer in Egypt. The biscuit category has been performing well in Egypt. And this is a great investment that will add additional growth to our current Middle Eastern business and we're also excited about the potential for geographic expansion. Chris Hood, the president of our business in Kellogg in Europe, will give you more detail regarding this next week at CAGNY. 
As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, the developed cereal business continued to face challenges, similar to the ones we've seen in the U.S. We ran brand building activities in the second half of 2014 and got more new products and brand building launching in the first quarter of 2015. Mueslis, like the one you can see pictured on the slide, are just one example of the new [indiscernible] of going into market in various regions. This is great tasting cereal in a resealable pouch and is an example of the kind of work we've been doing to improve our foods. 
We're also running a popular promotion across the European region that allows consumers to receive a personalized spoon and we're launching new product in the U.K. and Ireland. New Special K advertising has recently gone on air in the U.K, which addresses some of the recent help and warmest trends we've seen and we're launching a new variety of [indiscernible] Tresor across the region. 
The Pringles business posted growth of 6.5% in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we posted the highest sales of any quarter in the history of the business. We've also got new products launching, including the Tortilla Pringles, which have been very successful in U.S. and we have more capacity coming online at mid-year. So we achieved some success in the region in 2014 and we are optimistic that we can build on this as we enter 2015. 
Slide 20 shows the performance of our Latin American business for the quarter and the year. Comparable net sales growth was 7.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. This group performance was primarily the result of growth in Venezuela, Mexico, [indiscernible] and the broader Pringles business. The cereal business in Latin America saw good growth in the fourth quarter, although the competitive activity we mentioned last quarter continued in Mexico. Children's cereal contributed to the growth of the business in the region as a result of good brand building programs and product introductions, including new [indiscernible] and Choco Krispies. 
We are also addressing challenges in the adult segment with new commercial plans and the renovation of Special K and All-Bran, 2 of our largest brands in the region. In addition, we have executed parent brand programs, including the Breakfast for Better Days program, which has been well received. We're also launching other great products in the region in 2015 and are working to expand the overall distribution of our cereals. 
The Pringles business continued to do well in Q4, posting mid-single-digit comparable sales growth. We've seen a good initial reaction to new Tortilla Pringles and the execution of the launch has gone well. And we've also recently launched Kellogg branded granola bars in the region. 
So we ended the year well as a result of good activity and we have more planned for the coming months. We expect to increase investment in brand building in 2015 and expect good growth in both comparable sales and comparable operating profit. 
Now let's turn to Slide 21 in our Asia-Pacific business. The Asia-Pacific segment posted a decline in comparable net sales of 1.2% in the fourth quarter and growth of 0.7% for the full year. Strong results in Asia were offset by issues in the developed cereals business in Australia. The Asian business posted double-digit net sales growth in the quarter with the Indian, Japanese and Southeast Asian businesses all achieving double-digit sales growth. The Southeast Asian business benefited from strong parent brand activation and the Japanese business saw continued good growth in the granola segment. 
The Australian cereal business continued to face pressures similar to those seen in other developed businesses and results were also impacted by the year-over-year timing of promotional activity in the fourth quarter. The Pringles business posted good sales growth due to good results in Australia and strong growth in much of Asia. 
Finally, the joint venture we have in China posted significant double-digit net sales growth as both cereal and Pringles businesses continued to contribute. 
So we had a good fourth quarter and full year in Asia. We have some challenges in the Australian cereal business. We've already begun initiatives and have launched new products that will help address the situation. We expect stronger growth across Asia Pacific in 2015. 
Now let's look at Slide 22 and the summary. Project K remains on track in 2014 and is beginning to provide significant flexibility to reinvest in the business. In 2015, we will continue to invest across the path to purchase: Desire, Decide, Delight. We will continue to invest in brand building and we have more programs launching now and across the balance of the year that will support our new foods and our existing products. We are bringing it all to life in store with increased sales capabilities and are starting to see better execution and improvement in the results. And we've made significant improvements to our food in order to meet the rapidly changing views of consumers regarding health and wellness. This includes new foods and new packaging and the reformulation of many of our existing foods. 
So 2015 is a rebuilding year for us. It's an opportunity to invest in great food and ideas and to build a solid platform for long-term growth. As I'm sure you can see, our Kellogg employees are dedicated to returning the company to growth. They are executing Project K, they are delivering the savings, they are developing the growth plans and they are implementing the plans.  It's thanks to them that in 2015, we can build a platform for future growth. 
And with that, I will open up for questions."

You've spoken pretty recently that you believe you can achieve that mid-single digit operating profit growth even in an environment where you're only generating 1% to 2% internal sales. So that's consistent. But does that guidance only hold true during this period of accelerated savings in Project K? And is it feasible to sustain that, I guess, 50 basis points of annual margin expansion beyond the conclusion of Project K, when you'll be more reliant just on ongoing productivity? And secondly, is there any implied change in your cereal category expectations that are baked into that 1% to 3%?"

We've said before we're reinvesting Project K back into the business and that's our primary objective, as we drive the business back to sustainable long-term growth. So we've got to get this business back into growth. If we can achieve 1%, 2% growth, 3% on the top line, and we can offset inflation with underlying productivity programs that gives us gross margin expansion because of the leverage we get through our manufacturing facilities. We can have modest investment back into our organization and into our brand building programs and still deliver mid single-digit operating profit growth. So the way our economics work is we are quite leveraged P&L. Small amounts of top line growth can lead to mid-single digit operating profit growth, irrespective of Project K. In terms of our views long-term on the business and the category growth, we continue to believe that Europe and North America could grow low single digits and Asia-Pacific and Latin America can grow mid-single digit and even mid to high single digit in the case of Latin America. And we'll talk more about this at CAGNY next week. As I think about our developed cereal businesses, we believe we can return our developed cereal business back to growth. However, we think being pragmatic, that growth is pretty much at the low end of the low single-digit kind of range, where those categories have historically outperformed over the last 5, 10 years. Again, we'll show you some of that information at CAGNY next week. So the key reason for us changing our guidance was to really remind investors that even though our average growth over last 10 years has been about 3.5% on the top line, we really only need low single-digit growth to make the mid-single-digit operating profit algorithm work, and then we generated a lot of extra cash that enables us to buy back shares and get to the high-single-digit EPS and pay a good dividend, which can even goes to double-digit [indiscernible] all else being equal. So that low single digit is obviously is our goal internally. It's important to have those realistic goals. We will aspire to do better, but we believe we can absolutely achieve the low single-digit growth overtime."

I know for a long time Kellogg has great history of reinvesting cost savings and that people understand that savings leads to more investment. Where, now it seems like you're more dependent on that or that savings has become a bigger feature of the earnings growth. Let's look at it that way and of the amount of the investable dollars generated, does this emphasis in cost savings, is that part of the reason we're seeing your deceleration and such tough growth across the businesses?"

So we have our supply chain, we have our global business services organization, they are  designed to ensure that we are being as efficient and effective as possible. We have other parts of our organization, sales and marketing, where we still want them to be efficient obviously, but it's much more about driving the top line. And in fact, if you look at what we've done with the Project K savings in 2015, we've invested it back into the capabilities that, over time, will enable us to grow our top line. So we've invested back into our global category teams. We've invested back into rebuilding the Kashi team. We've invested back into our sales force in snacks and the Morning Foods in the U.S. Those investments do not provide an immediate return. Those investments provide returns overtime because you have to invest in the people, then they start to generate the ideas. They start to bring these ideas to market. So these are not short-term payback reinvestments. But I can assure you that we have the conversation internally. We have our organization focused on returning to long-term growth. We have some types of organization absolutely focused on being more effective and efficient is about doing both well."

In terms of acquisitions, you've seen us do the acquisition in Egypt of BiscoMisr to relatively modest sized business, less than $100 million of sales. But it's the leading biscuit business in Egypt and is a great example of the intersection of emerging markets and snacks in An area where we're very interested in continuing to build that business overtime.

And really, people want to have weight wellness. They want to be eating great food because it's good for them. And we actually have foods that deliver upon that promise. And those foods will continue to be in the market and unchanged. And we have other foods that we've renovated to be more in line with what consumers are looking for. So for example, we have renovated the Special K bar line here in early 2015 and we're seeing some initial good results. So what gives me some confidence that we can move the food to be more on trend? One would be our experience in Australia, where we launched the Special K nourish cereal in 2014, but actually now has the Special K business back to growth in Australia, although Special K is a smaller brand for us in that market that isn't in many other markets. So we've demonstrated that changing the foods -- so to your point, it's simpler food, it's clearly less refined, if you like. And that's what I think consumers are looking for as well as satiating, so it can be a bit more of a complicated eat and maybe some protein in there as well. And we have an opportunity to both change the communication in Special K. So it's more about weight wellness as well as changing the foods that's more aligned with consumer trends. Early days in the U.S., but even here at the very beginning of 2015 we're seeing meaningfully better results from the Special K wholesome snacks bars and Special K cracker chips and even from some of our cereal programs."

So I would say it's more of a sort of repositioning is the right word, relaunch of the brand perhaps with new food, new packaging and new communication. And I'm not sure what stores you've been in or when you're in the stores looking at the packaging, but we have changed a lot of the packaging, particularly on the snacks side here in early 2015. But this is not a radical shift of the brand. This is just improving the positioning of the brand so it's more on trend with what consumers are currently looking for."

The Kashi brand is growing in Canada. So there's one difference between the 2 markets right there.

I believe the SICAD 2 rate goes away, based on what the government recently communicated. I'm not sure where the secondary rate will go that they have communicated.

I guess I want to understand that when I put these numbers together, it just feels like you should be in a much better environment from the internally generated savings than what your bottom line earnings are showing. So where's all the money going if the $0.80 saving is right, if management comps only $0.15, and sales are comparable year-on-year, how much is brand building, building up?

So our guidance is realistic and it does reflect improving trends, including investments that are going back into our business around innovation, investments into our food as well and investments into our commercial programs, for example, into brand building. Of our sales, it is estimated to be approximately flat. I said we expect it also slight net deflation in cost of goods sold, which should give us a slight improvement in gross margin. Keep in mind, we are seeing inflation within cost of goods sold. Our commodities, as I commented, are relatively neutral to down slightly. We are seeing increases in our factory costs and wages and in benefits and in higher logistic cost as well. Not so much around fuel. We can see that fuel is declining. This is more around carrier rates and the supply and demand impact on carriers. We also have a little bit of transactional FX exposure that sits in cost of goods sold as well. And then as I said, our operating profit is down 2% to 4%, but that includes a 3 to 4-point headwind associated with the incentive compensation. We are investing in brand building.

Comparable full year sales were at the lower end of our guidance range. Our results for full year comparable operating profit was slightly lower than we had anticipated, primarily due to the decline in sales. And our results for full year comparable earnings per share were in line with our expectations, but were also at the low end of the range. 
Project K is on track and we've delivered savings in line with our guidance for 2014. The global business services initiative is going well and we've begun to reduce capacity in some regions and add capacity in others. 
Results from our labor strategy intend to drive a more competitive, sustainable cost structure have been mixed. We've seen good results in Europe and Australia, although we still have work to do in the U.S. As you know, Project K will provide us with a considerable amount of financial flexibility and we are continuing our investment in 2015. 
We're at an important point as we enter 2015. After a disappointing 2014, we are building a platform for growth over the coming year. We will continue to execute Project K. We are investing in our business and we expect to stabilize our top line in 2015. In providing guidance for 2015, we recognize the critical task of returning the company to sustainable top line growth. We expect full year comparable net sales to be approximately flat, a significant improvement from the trends we saw in 2014. We were pleased with our performance in much of the international business in 2014. And our expectations are that the positive sales trends will continue in 2015. However, we do have more work to do in the U.S., particularly in the cereal and snack businesses. Ron will provide more detail regarding our guidance for 2015 in a few minutes. 
As we look to the long-term health of the business, it is critically important that we set realistic financial goals. Please turn to Slide 4 and a discussion of our long-term targets. We are changing our target for long-term comparable revenue growth to a low single-digit rate. Our target for comparable operating profit growth remains at a mid-single-digit rate and our target for currency-neutral comparable EPS growth remains at a high single-digit rate. One of the key drivers of success is targeting realistic goals, which can be achieved over the long-term. 
The businesses in the developed categories in which we compete are expected to grow at a low single-digit rate over the long-term. And while our cereal and snack businesses in developing and emerging regions will grow faster, we think that low single-digit top line growth for the total business is a realistic and achievable goal. 
And 2015 will be a step in the right direction. Results will improve from those we saw in previous periods and we will build a platform from which we can grow in the years to come. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 and a discussion regarding the areas of investment. As we've discussed with you over the last couple of quarters, our current investment as part of Project K will be centered on the 3 main areas over the past purchase: Desire, Decide, and Delight. First of all, we support our brands with great brand building ideas that generate the Desire for our products. The way in which we engage with consumers has continued to evolve and our investment takes various forms, including digital media, consumer promotions such as inserts and traditional advertising. As you know, we currently spend a high percentage of sales on brand building. And while we're increasing our investment in brand building, we are as focused on optimizing the impact of this investment as we are on increasing the amount of the investment. 
Next is the Decide phase, where we bring it all to life in store. We're investing in sales capabilities. We have invested in both the cereal and snack sales forces in the U.S. and have always started [ph] to see better execution and results in store and have also started to invest in the 3 international regions, including investment in regional sales Centers of Excellence, designed to share best practices. 
And finally is the Delight phase. We Delight consumers with great food. Consumer trends in health and wellness and in weight management are evolving. And we must appeal to those trends with foods that address the needs of consumers and that also taste great. We've been doing a lot of work on our foods around the world, including the recent launch of Mueslis and granolas and the reformulation of many of our existing foods. Specifically, we've launched new Special K bars with improved food and packaging. We have new Kashi cereals and we're converting the GOLEAN brand to be GMO-free the heart-to-heart brand to organic. And we're also promoting the versatility of our foods. 
So to sum up. Much of this activity is intended to address the challenges that we faced in developed businesses around the world in the last year or so. I mean, some of these activity has started and it's early in the year, but we're starting to see a response and we're optimistic that it will provide a base for future sales growth. 
And now I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of the financial results for the quarter and full year."

Slide 6 shows the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. Comparable net sales for the full year decreased by 2%.

Slide 6 shows the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. Comparable net sales for the full year decreased by 2%. We had better performance in some of our international businesses, particularly in the second half of the year. But we experienced declines in our developed cereal businesses and the U.S. Snacks business. We are executing initiatives in these businesses, including the introduction of new foods and investment in marketing, as John mentioned, to improve performance. 
The recorded quarterly operating loss was $422 million, which included a significant non-cash mark-to-market adjustment of $822 million. This was primarily driven by the impact the changes in interest rates had on pension plan liabilities. 
Comparable operating profit decreased by 0.1% in the fourth quarter. Operating profit declined by 3.9% for the full year, more than we expected as a result of lower production volume and higher distribution costs. Cost management actions and lower incentive compensation and overhead contributed positively to fourth quarter and full year performance. As John mentioned, investment in brand building is significant and overall brand building for the year remained unchanged as a percentage of sales in 2014. 
Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments to 53rd week, Project K cost and other items that affect comparability, were $0.84 per share on the fourth quarter and $3.81 per share for the full year, in line with our expectations. These results include $0.02 of currency headwind in the fourth quarter and $0.01 for the full year. The 53rd week added $0.07 to earnings per share in the quarter. 
Slide 7 shows the composition of the fourth quarter and full year sales growth. For the full year, reported sales decreased by 1.4% and comparable sales decreased by 2%, with a similar decline in comparable net sales in the fourth quarter. Comparable volume decreased by 2.6% for the full year and price mix increased by 0.6%. 
Comparable volume stabilized in Europe and in Latin America in the fourth quarter. The decline in volume was primarily the result of the developed cereal and snack businesses in the U.S. 
The impact of currency translation reduced sales growth by 0.8 points for the full year and nearly 3% in the fourth quarter as many currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar. The 53rd week also contributed growth in the quarter and for the full year. 
Slide 8 shows our comparable gross profit and gross margin for the quarter and the year. Comparable gross margin decreased by 40 basis points for the full year and by 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. And this decline was consistent with our latest guidance. Lower production volume driven by our sales performance and higher distribution costs impacted margin. 
Our savings from productivity were in line with expectations and savings from Project K also met expectations. 
Slide 9 shows the comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions in the fourth quarter. North America's comparable operating profit decreased by 7%, largely as a result of lower sales posted in the quarter. 
We continue to face challenges in our U.S. cereal and snacks businesses. And this was the primary driver of the decline in operating profit in the quarter. In addition, we also saw lower production volume and greater-than-anticipated distribution cost continue through the fourth quarter. Investment in brand building as a percentage of sales was unchanged for the full year. 
Comparable operating profit in Europe increased by 24% in the fourth quarter as a result of net deflation in cost of goods sold, including strong productivity savings, the timing of investment in brand building and cost discipline and overhead. 
Comparable operating profit declined by 4% in Latin America in the fourth quarter. Benefit from top line growth of more than 7% was more than offset by the timing of costs, including a double-digit increase in investment in brand building to support second half product launches across the region. 
Fourth quarter comparable operating profit increased by 50% in the Asia-Pacific region. This was driven by solid productivity improvements and Project K savings in cost of goods sold as well as lower brand building, primarily in Australia.
Slide 10 shows full year cash flow for 2014. Cash flow was $1.2 billion, which exceeded our expectations for the year. This was driven by a benefit from year end U.S. tax legislation and broad-based working capital improvements, including our supplier financing initiative. This initiative added more than $200 million to annual cash flow in 2014 and nearly offset approximately $250 million of incremental cash impact from Project K. We expect additional benefit from this program in 2015 as we cascade it across the globe. 
Capital spending for the year was $582 million, at the low end of our range. This includes the impact of some timing between 2014 and 2015 as well as lower costs for certain projects. 
Share repurchases for the year were $690 million and we reduced our average share count by 1.4% as planned. Dividends paid in 2014 were $680 million so total cash return to share owners was almost $1.4 billion.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 and our guidance for 2015. As always this guidance excludes items that affect comparability, so please see our notes for details. We expected challenging macroeconomic environment in 2015. And the devaluation of foreign currencies also presents both translational and transactional foreign currency headwinds. So the guidance we're providing today is realistic and reflects the investment necessary to stabilize our business and return it to sustainable growth. We expect that comparable net sales will be approximately flat for the year, an improvement when compared to the performance we saw in 2014. 
We expect net deflation in cost of goods sold. Overall, commodity and packaging costs are relatively neutral and we are approximately 70% covered for the year. However, we do anticipate inflation in wages, benefits and logistics costs. We expect the benefit from productivity to be 3% to 4% cost of goods, in line with our long-term goals, and we'll see incremental savings from Project K in 2015. 
So if you add all of these factors together, we expect to see net deflation for the year and slight gross margin expansion. Comparable operating profit is estimated to be down between 2% and 4%. This includes the impact of rebasing incentive compensation costs, just between a 3- and 4-point headwind to operating profit growth, slightly higher than the 2 to 3 points we communicated in our third quarter 10-Q. Excluding this headwind, comparable operating profit growth would be approximately flat to up slightly. We expect brand building will increase at a rate faster than sales growth. And we expect the currency-neutral comparable earnings will be in a range of flat to down 2% or $3.74 to $3.82 per share. Of course, the incentive compensation headwind also impacts our earnings per share in 2015 by between 3 and 4 points. 
These earnings expectations exclude the impact of 2014's 53rd week and the impact of foreign currency translation, which currently looks like it could be as much as $0.15 per share. 
The tax rate is expected to be between 27% and 28% and interest expense is anticipated to be between $215 million and $225 million. We expect that cash flow after capital spending will be approximately $1 billion. This includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million from Project K. So underlying cash flow is between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. We anticipate the total capital spending will be in the range of 4% to 5% of sales. This includes approximately 1 point of sales for incremental capital for Project K. It also includes investment to increase the capacity in our Pringles business and the completion of a new cereal plant in India. 
As I said, the total incremental after-tax cash cost for Project K will be approximately $350 million in 2015, including the additional point of sales for capital spending. This makes 2015 the year with the most cash outflows over the life of Project K. We expect to repurchase between 700 million and 750 million of shares in 2015. Our current outlook for the first quarter earnings per share is that it will account for approximately one quarter of our total estimate for the full year on a comparable basis, including the impact of currency. Currently, our expectations are that the impact of currency will be spread relatively evenly across the year. 
Slide 12 shows our annual EPS log, based on comparable earnings in 2014 of $3.81 per share. As I mentioned, currency translation could have an impact of as much as $0.15 per share, although this does not include the impact of any significant currency devaluations we might see during the year, such as in Venezuela. Obviously, this estimate will change and we plan to update you on the impact on future quarterly calls. 
We expect a small amount of costs related to the integration of distributors and other items for Pringles in 2015. And we estimate this cost of between $0.03 and $0.05 per share and expect that this will be the last year of these integration costs. While it's early in the integration process at this time, we expect that the impact on the investment in BiscoMisr in Egypt will not be material in 2015. 
And finally, we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, approximately 2/3 of which will come in cost of goods sold. 
Pretax P&L cost related to the project are estimated to be between $400 million and $450 million, or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share in 2015, 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. Obviously, the timing and cost of the projects may change over time. So we'll provide an update regarding Project K on the quarterly conference calls and at the upcoming CAGNY conference. 
And now I'll turn it back over to John, for more detail on the operating segments."

Let's turn to next slide in detail regarding the Morning Foods business. Comparable net sales declined by 7.7% in the fourth quarter and by 5.7% for the full year. 2014 was clearly a disappointing year for us in Morning Foods. But we're taking the right actions to improve the performance of the business over time. 
As I mentioned, we have already started to invest the savings from Project K in our food and brand building and in in-store execution. And we have stronger plans for 2015. We expect that sales in the U.S. cereal business will be down in 2015, but that trends will show a real improvement over those we saw in 2014. 
The performance in the fourth quarter of 2014 was again primarily driven by the Kashi and Special K brands as it has been in recent quarters. In addition, we continue to face and pry innovation out of the market and this also had an impact in the quarter. However, partially offsetting these effects was better display and good performance from the Froot Loops brand, which gained share as a result of strong end market support. And we're also seeing good initial results from our Disney Frozen themed cereal, which is exceeding our expectations.
We previously highlighted some of the programs and changes we're making to the Special K and Kashi brands. And Paul Norman will discuss them in more detail in next week's CAGNY conference. 
Let me just highlight a few things on Slide 15. We have launched the See You at Breakfast campaign and the Open for Breakfast Digital program designed to help us connect directly with consumers. We are investing in in-store capabilities in our U.S. Morning Foods sales force. We are investing in our food. We are launching new Special K products, such as gluten-free and protein. We are continuing to evolve the Kashi GOLEAN brand certified GMO-free. And we're making the Kashi heart-to-heart brand USDA organic. 
We expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the Special K and Kashi brands and on the cereal business as a whole. However, our plan for investment is a long-term one and the levels, content and effectiveness of the support will evolve and increase over time. 
Consumption in our Pop-Tarts business declined in the quarter, again due to comparisons to good performance last year. However, we gained share in the quarter and the full year and launched a new variety of peanut butter and jelly flavored Pop-Tarts during the quarter and we expect this to improve results in 2015. As you can tell, we've been focusing on improving the cereal business and we have a lot of activity planned for 2015, some of which is beginning now. We've launched new products and redesigned food and packaging to better appeal to consumer trends. We have continued our brand support, while increasing our efforts to drive category relevance. And we're driving more effectiveness from our investment, not just the incremental work, but the core investment as well. Improvement will come over time and we're confident that we have the ideas and the brands necessary to stabilize the business and return it to growth. 
Now let's turn to our U.S. Snacks business on Slide 16. Comparable net sales declined by 3.1% in the fourth quarter and by 2.4% for the full year. As we saw last quarter, and in other categories around the world, the decline in sales was largely due to consumer trends away from weight management brands. 
Sales in the cracker business was low in the quarter, although sales and share were approximately unchanged for the full year. We continue to see share gains in the 3 largest brands: Cheez-It, Club and Town House in Q4. However, this good performance was offset by continued declines in the Special K Cracker Chip business due to the trends I referenced earlier. As a result, we are addressing this by relaunching Special K Cracker Chips with better taste profiles and improved packaging and with new positioning. They started to arrive in stores late in December. 
We saw a decline in share of the cookie category in the quarter, largely as a result of continued declines in the Right Bites' 100-calorie pack business. This was also the result of the trends in weight management and accounted for half of that total decline in share. However, we are migrating consumers to an expanded line of single-serve products, which should help to reduce the impact of the decline in Right Bites in 2015. The business was also impacted by lower distribution as Keebler special edition items exited the market. 
Also in the cookie segment, we saw continued growth from Chips Deluxe as a result of the new products co-branded with M&M's. These products were linked to basic growth and consumption and share for the brand in the quarter and for the full year. 
Our consumption in the wholesome snack category declined in the quarter and we lost share. However, the trends in consumption improved. Both Nutri-Grain and Rice Krispies Treats saw increased consumption and share in the fourth quarter and for the full year as a result of core growth and innovation. 
Consumption of Rice Krispies Treats increased at a double-digit rate in the quarter. And Kashi bars posted better performance later in the year due to the launch of new products. 
The declines in the business continue to be driven by Special K bars and FiberPlus bars, again, as a result of the weight management issues I've mentioned. In response, we are launching new great-tasting Special K snack bars with new packaging and new food. This activity ties into the initiatives we are launching in other categories and regions around the world and the new products also began to arrive in stores late in December. 
The U.S. Pringles business posted mid-single digit comparable net sales growth for the full year. We posted flat comparable net sales in the fourth quarter due to the timing of promotions and brand building activities and the impact of the launch of Pringles Tortilla in the fourth quarter of 2013, which led to a high single-digit comparison. We expect to see growth from this business in 2015, partially as a result of brand building support by core brand, although we have difficult comparisons against the launch of Tortilla in the first half of the year. Pringles, as a global brand, posted full year growth in all regions in 2014 and we're selling every can we can make around the world. 
So as we expected, our U.S. Snacks business continued to face challenges in the fourth quarter. As with the cereal business, we anticipate that improvement will take time. However, we've identified the issues, which was centered on our weight management brands and we're beginning the investment necessary to stabilize this business and return it to growth. We're taking the actions now that will start to drive improvement in the future. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 in the U.S. Specialty segment. Our Specialty Channels business posted a decline in comparable net sales of 1% in the fourth quarter. Comparable net sales for the full year declined by 1.4%. In the fourth quarter, Kellogg gained share in the convenience channel, in the wholesome snack, cracker and salty snack categories. Total net sales in the convenience business increased at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, partially as a result of introduction of new products. [indiscernible] in 2014 built on high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. Note that we reduced sales in low-margin custom products in Q4 and the full year in this segment. We have great plans for U.S. Specialty in 2015 and expect full year sales growth as a result. 
Slide 18 shows the performance of the North America Other segment, which saw an increase in comparable sales of 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This segment includes the U.S. Frozen Foods and Canadian businesses. 
Comparable net sales in the Frozen Foods business declined slightly in the quarter. Consumption of Eggo waffles is improving, as we relaunched the Leggo My Eggo brand building program and launched Eggo gluten-free in a new variety of Thick & Fluffy waffles. 
We are also in the middle of launching Eggo handheld sandwiches. These are an all family breakfast sandwich. And although it's early in the process, the initial results have been encouraging. As a result of this launch and good performance from our Special K handheld sandwiches, sales of our total sandwich business increased at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter and we gained share. 
Finally, for the Frozen Foods business, we have new Special K products scheduled to launch in April and we've also seen good results in our Morningstar Farms, Roasted Garlic and Quinoa burger, which is non-GMO and made with organic ingredients. So we've got a lot of activity planned for this year and we expect this business to return to growth in 2015. 
Beef [ph] sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the Canadian business in the fourth quarter. Consumption growth in the Canadian soup [ph] category has improved significantly and our sales were approximately flat for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 19 in our European business. Comparable net sales in the region declined by 0.7% in the full year and by 1.2% in the fourth quarter. We saw good growth in the snack and emerging market businesses and some continued challenges in the developed cereal markets. We saw a double-digit net sales growth in emerging markets in the fourth quarter. Specifically, both the Med Middle Eastern business and the Russian business posted good results in the quarter and for the full year. And you may have seen that we recently announced an investment in BiscoMisr, the largest biscuit manufacturer in Egypt. The biscuit category has been performing well in Egypt. And this is a great investment that will add additional growth to our current Middle Eastern business and we're also excited about the potential for geographic expansion. Chris Hood, the president of our business in Kellogg in Europe, will give you more detail regarding this next week at CAGNY. 
As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, the developed cereal business in Europe continued to face challenges similar to the ones we've seen in the U.S. We ran brand building activities in the second half of 2014 and we've got more new products and brand building launching in the first quarter of 2015. Mueslis, like the one you can see pictured on the slide, are just one example of the new foods we have going into market in various regions. This is great tasting cereal in a resealable pouch and is an example of the kind of work we've been doing to improve our foods. 
We're also running a popular promotion across the European region that allows consumers to receive a personalized spoon and we're launching new porridge in the U.K. and Ireland. New Special K advertising has recently gone on air in the U.K, which addresses some of the recent health and wellness trends we've seen and we're launching a new variety of Krave Tresor across the region. 
The Pringles business posted growth of 6.5% in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we posted the highest sales of any quarter in the history of the business. We've also got new products launching, including the Tortilla Pringles, which have been very successful in U.S. and we have more capacity coming online at mid-year. So we achieved some success in the region in 2014 and we are optimistic that we can build on this as we enter 2015. 
Slide 20 shows the performance of our Latin American business for the quarter and the year. Comparable net sales growth was 7.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. This group performance was primarily the result of growth in Venezuela, Mexico, Mercosur and the broader Pringles business. The cereal business in Latin America saw good growth in the fourth quarter, although the competitive activity we mentioned last quarter continued in Mexico. Children's cereal contributed to the growth of the business in the region as a result of good brand building programs and product introductions, including new Zucaritas and Choco Krispies. 
We are also addressing challenges in the adult segment with new commercial plans and the renovation of Special K and All-Bran, 2 of our largest brands in the region. In addition, we have executed parent brand programs, including the Breakfast for Better Days program, which has been well received. We're also launching other great products in the region in 2015 and are working to expand the overall distribution of our cereals. 
The Pringles business continued to do well in Q4, posting mid-single-digit comparable sales growth. We've seen a good initial reaction to new Tortilla Pringles and the execution of the launch has gone well. And we've also recently launched Kellogg branded granola bars in the region. 
So we ended the year well as a result of good activity and we have more planned for the coming months. We expect to increase investment in brand building in 2015 and expect good growth in both comparable sales and comparable operating profit. 
Now let's turn to Slide 21 in our Asia-Pacific business. The Asia-Pacific segment posted a decline in comparable net sales of 1.2% in the fourth quarter and growth of 0.7% for the full year. Strong results in Asia were offset by issues in the developed cereals business in Australia. The Asian business posted double-digit net sales growth in the quarter with the Indian, Japanese and Southeast Asian businesses all achieving double-digit sales growth. The Southeast Asian business benefited from strong parent brand activation and the Japanese business saw continued good growth in the granola segment. 
The Australian cereal business continue to face pressures similar to those seen in other developed businesses and results were also impacted by the year-over-year timing of promotional activity in the fourth quarter. The Pringles business posted good sales growth due to good results in Australia and strong growth in much of Asia. 
Finally, the joint venture we have in China posted significant double-digit net sales growth as both cereal and Pringles businesses continued to contribute. 
So we had a good fourth quarter and full year in Asia. We have some challenges in the Australian cereal business. We've already begun initiatives and have launched new products that will help address the situation. We expect stronger growth across Asia Pacific in 2015. 
Now let's look at Slide 22 and the summary. Project K remains on track in 2014 and is beginning to provide significant flexibility to reinvest in the business. In 2015, we will continue to invest across the path to purchase: Desire, Decide, Delight. We will continue to invest in brand building and we have more programs launching now and across the balance of the year that will support our new foods and our existing products. We are bringing it all to life in store with increased sales capabilities and are starting to see better execution and improvement in the results. And we've made significant improvements to our food in order to meet the rapidly changing views of consumers regarding health and wellness. This includes new foods and new packaging and the reformulation of many of our existing foods. 
So 2015 is a rebuilding year for us. It's an opportunity to invest in great food and ideas and to build a solid platform for long-term growth. As I'm sure you can see, our Kellogg employees are dedicated to returning the company to growth. They are executing Project K, they are delivering the savings, they are developing the growth plans and they are implementing the plans. It's thanks to them that in 2015, we can build a platform for future growth. 
And with that, I will open up for questions."

You've spoken pretty recently that you believe you can achieve that mid-single digit operating profit growth even in an environment where you're only generating 1% to 2% internal sales. So that's consistent. But does that guidance only hold true during this period of accelerated savings in Project K? And is it feasible to sustain that, I guess, 50 basis points of annual margin expansion beyond the conclusion of Project K, when you'll be more reliant just on ongoing productivity? And secondly, is there any implied change in your cereal category expectations that are baked into that 1% to 3%?"

We've said before we're reinvesting Project K back into the business and that's our primary objective, as we drive the business back to sustainable long-term growth. So we've got to get this business back into growth. If we can achieve 1%, 2% growth, 3% on the top line, and we can offset inflation with underlying productivity programs, that gives us gross margin expansion because of the leverage we get through our manufacturing facilities. We can have modest investment back into our organization and into our brand building programs and still deliver mid single-digit operating profit growth. So the way our economics work is we are quite a leveraged P&L. Small amounts of top line growth can lead to mid-single digit operating profit growth, irrespective of Project K. In terms of our views long-term on the business and the category growths, we continue to believe that Europe and North America can grow low single digits and Asia-Pacific and Latin America can grow mid-single digit and even mid to high single digit in the case of Latin America. And we'll talk more about this at CAGNY next week. As I think about our developed cereal businesses, we believe we can return our developed cereal business back to growth. However, we think being pragmatic, that growth is pretty much at the low end of the low single-digit kind of range, where those categories have historically outperformed over the last 5, 10 years. Again, we'll show you some of that information at CAGNY next week. So the key reason for us changing our guidance was to really remind investors that even though our average growth over last 10 years has been about 3.5% on the top line, we really only need low single-digit growth to make the mid-single-digit operating profit algorithm work, and then we generated a lot of extra cash that enables us to buy back shares and get to the high-single-digit EPS and pay a good dividend, which can even get us to double-digit tiers, all else being equal. So that low single digit is obviously is our goal internally. It's important to have those realistic goals. We will aspire to do better, but we believe we can absolutely achieve the low single-digit growth over time."

I wonder if, if anything that -- how close is Project K getting to either the innovation process or the service and delivery process where maybe it affects the mindset of Kellogg in such a way that there's a, maybe, a trade-off on growth? I mean, maybe it focuses certain segments of the organization on saving versus growth? I know for a long time Kellogg has great history of reinvesting cost savings and that people understand that savings leads to more investment. Where, now it seems like you're more dependent on that or that savings has become a bigger feature of the earnings growth. Let's look at it that way and of the amount of investable dollars generated, does this emphasis in cost savings, is that part of the reason we're seeing your deceleration and such tough growth across the businesses?"

There are parts in an organization that have to be absolutely focused on productivity and efficiency. So we have our supply chain, we have our global business services organization, they are  designed to ensure that we are being as efficient and effective as possible. We have other parts of our organization, sales and marketing, where we still want them to be efficient obviously, but it's much more about driving the top line. And in fact, if you look at what we've done with the Project K savings in 2015, we've invested it back into the capabilities that, over time, will enable us to grow our top line. So we've invested back into our global category teams. We've invested back into rebuilding the Kashi team. We've invested back into our sales force in snacks and the Morning Foods in the U.S. Those investments do not provide an immediate return. Those investments provide returns over time because you have to invest in the people, then they start to generate the ideas. They start to bring these ideas to market. So these are not short-term payback reinvestments. But I can assure you that we have the conversation internally. We have our organization focused on returning to long-term growth. We have some parts of our organization absolutely focused on being more effective and efficient. It's about doing both well."

And we have confidence that we can get these businesses back to growth, not high growth, but back to modest -- at the low end of a low single-digit range type growth. In terms of acquisitions, you've seen us do the acquisition in Egypt of BiscoMisr to relatively modest sized business, less than $100 million of sales. But it's the leading biscuit business in Egypt and is a great example of the intersection of emerging markets and snacks in an area where we're very interested in continuing to build that business over time.

One is how we've been talking about the brand and the second is the delivery of some of the foods. So in terms of how we've been talking about the brand, we got ourselves into a 2-week challenge, starting to get close to dieting the -- basically asking people to deprive themselves where they have less calories. And really, people want to have weight wellness. They want to be eating great food because it's good for them. And we actually have foods that deliver upon that promise. And those foods will continue to be in the market and unchanged. And we have other foods that we've renovated to be more in line with what consumers are looking for. So for example, we have renovated the Special K bar line here in early 2015 and we're seeing some initial good results. So what gives me some confidence that we can move the food to be more on trend? One would be our experience in Australia, where we launched the Special K Nourish cereal in 2014, that actually now has the Special K business back to growth in Australia, although Special K is a smaller brand for us in that market than it is in many other markets. So we've demonstrated that changing the foods -- so to your point, it's simpler food, it's clearly less refined, if you like. And that's what I think consumers are looking for as well as satiating, so it can be a bit more of a complicated eat and maybe some protein in there as well. And we have an opportunity to both change the communication in Special K. So it's more about weight wellness as well as changing the foods that's more aligned with consumer trends. Early days in the U.S., but even here at the very beginning of 2015 we're seeing meaningfully better results from the Special K wholesome snacks bars and Special K Cracker Chips and even from some of our cereal programs."

That includes both the onetime write-down of the net assets as well as a translational impact if, for example, that change were to occur here in the first quarter. I believe the SICAD 2 rate goes away, based on what the government recently communicated. I'm not sure where the secondary rate will go that they have communicated.

This is the first kind of really big year of savings from Project K. Your productivity programs, again, I think you said in line with historics, kind of 3% to 4%. And against cost of goods sold, that's something like $300 million or more. So in total, you guys would be producing savings of north of $400 million, which is like $0.80 a share. I think the management comp number, 3% to 4%, that's like $0.15. I guess I want to understand that when I put these numbers together, it just feels like you should be in a much better environment from the internally generated savings than what your bottom line earnings are showing. So where's all the money going if the $0.80 saving is right, if management comps only $0.15, if sales are comparable year-on-year, how much is brand building, building up? And how much is SG&A in total going up, such that we're going to see a $0.20 decline in earnings year-on-year?"

So our guidance is realistic and it does reflect improving trends, including investments that are going back into our business around innovation, investments into our food as well and investments into our commercial programs, for example, into brand building. Of our sales, it is estimated to be approximately flat. I said we expected also slight net deflation in cost of goods sold, which should give us a slight improvement in gross margin. Keep in mind, we are seeing inflation within cost of goods sold. Our commodities, as I commented, are relatively neutral to down slightly. We are seeing increases in our factory costs and wages and in benefits and in higher logistics cost as well. Not so much around fuel. We can see that fuel is declining. This is more around carrier rates and the supply and demand impact on carriers. We also have a little bit of transactional FX exposure that sits in cost of goods sold as well. And then as I said, our operating profit is down 2% to 4%, but that includes a 3- to 4-point headwind associated with the incentive compensation. We are investing in brand building. We are also investing, as we've discussed before, in sales capability and other overhead to drive the growth of our business impact to sustainable growth."

We are pleased to have announced today results for currency-neutral comparable net sales, operating profit and earnings per share that were ahead of our expectations. We saw good net sales growth in international business and improving trends in several of our developed market businesses in North America. As you know, we've invested in various revenue-driving initiatives around the world and we've seen improving sales rates. 
Specifically, we posted strong double-digit net sales growth in Latin America in the quarter. We posted low single-digit net sales growth in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region posted mid single-digit net sales growth to double-digit growth in the Asian business. 
And we saw improving trends in our developed cereal business in the U.S. Category trends improved and our Kellogg brands gained share. 
As we mentioned at the CAGNY conference, we've been doing a lot of work over the last year on Project K, our efficiency and effectiveness initiative. We are on track to generate savings and to invest in the business to drive profitable net sales growth. 
Specifically, we are focused on 3 main areas of opportunity. We are investing where the shoppers shop, we are investing in our food and we're increasing our investment in the high-growth emerging markets. 
Let's start with a discussion of in-store execution. The first area of investment we're focused on is the warehouse sales force in the U.S. We made a significant investment in this area in 2014 and we are investing more in 2015. Their focus is on selling promotions, gaining share of the shelf, maximizing distribution and increasing the speed to shelf for new products. 
The second area of investment is the DSD sales team. The benefits we get from this investment build over time. And we have always seen improved display activity in the channels serviced by DSD. 
The third area of investment is in emerging markets, where we've invested in our coverage of high frequency stores in both Asia and Latin America. We are pleased with the progress we have made so far. We have more to do, although we have already seen improved results. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 and the second area of focus, increased investment in our food. First of all, we have started some broad initiatives in the U.S. cereal business this year, including the origins program, which is similar to one that was successful in Europe. This program includes new food and support the simplicity and goodness of the new products. 
We also got some great new snacks coming. In the U.S., we have renovated our Special K bars to include more visible ingredients and we are launching Special K chewy nut bars, which include simple ingredients preferred by consumers. We launched a variety of new mueslis in a number of countries, which are off to a good start. And we have plans to launch granolas and mueslis in other parts of the world. And very importantly, we've also done a lot of work with our Kashi business in North America. We have great brands in both Kashi and Bear Naked. We have a dedicated team in California and they are making progress across 3 priorities: First, they're designing and launching a portfolio of innovative plant-based foods that deliver powerful uplifting health. Second, they're engaging with customers and partnering to develop new and exciting programs targeted at food forward consumers. And finally, they are developing stronger marketing plans using more of a storytelling model, rather than a traditional advertising model. 
Finally, for Project K. Let's turn to Slide 6 and the investment we are making in the emerging markets. We have a strong team across the international businesses. Within these regions, we have targeted various initiatives. In Asia and Latin America, we are focused on increasing our penetration of high-frequency stores. We strong sales growth in the business in the emerging markets over the last 3 years and we've recently opened a new plant in Malaysia. In addition, we recently invested in a large biscuit manufacturing in Egypt and our joint venture in China continues to perform well. These are all initiatives designed to increase our result profitable sales growth and return us to our long-term model. It's early in the process, but we're seeing good sales growth in our international regions and we're confident that we'll achieve additional growth as we execute these programs. Now I'll turn it over to Ron."
283356,288004916,803459,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 shows the financial results for the first quarter. Reported net sales declined by 5%, primarily due to international currency devaluations.

Reported net sales declined by 5%, primarily due to international currency devaluations. Currency-neutral comparable net sales decreased slightly. We had good growth in all of our international regions and results improved in several developed businesses in North America. This quarter's improving trends were the result of new product introductions and brand building initiatives in each of the regions and investments we've made with savings from Project K. 
Reported quarterly operating profit was $384 million and included a charge for the capitalized portion of our pension mark-to-market at year-end 2014 as well as Project K costs in the first quarter. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 1.9% in the quarter, better than our expectations. Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration cost, mark-to-market adjustments, Project K cost and other items that affect comparability were $0.98 per share in the first quarter, again, ahead of our expectations. These results include $0.06 of currency headwind in the quarter. So currency-neutral comparable earnings increased by 3% to $1.04 per share, including a lower than planned tax rate resulting from some discrete items. 
So all results in the first quarter were ahead of our expectations and were in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Slide 8 shows the composition of the first quarter sales growth. Currency-neutral comparable revenues for the first quarter declined by 0.3%, reflecting an overall improvement in trends. Comparable volume decreased by 0.7% in the quarter. We saw volume growth across all our international regions, driven by both cereal and snacks, offset by results in our North America business. Price and mix increased by 0.4% and the impact of currency translation decreased sales growth by 4.7% in the quarter as many currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. 
Slide 9 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin for the first quarter. Quarterly gross margin remained unchanged at 37.9% broadly in line with our expectations. Productivity improvements and savings from Project K supply chain initiatives offset inflation and factory, distribution costs and investments in our food. As expected, commodity and packaging costs were net deflationary and we are currently approximately 85% covered. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10, which shows the currency-neutral comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions in the first quarter. North America's operating profit decreased by 8%. This was primarily driven by lower sales and investment in our U.S. sales force as well as reestablishing our Kashi business in California. Europe's operating profit increased by 13% in the first quarter, driven by the region's sales growth and net deflation in cost of goods sold, including savings from Project K. Operating profit increased by 5% in Latin America in the quarter. Strong sales growth included increases in volume and price actions to offset inflation. In addition, we invested in brand building activities to support new product launches and drive market penetration. 
Operating profit decreased by 3% in the Asia-Pacific region. While we had solid sales growth in the quarter, we are investing in capabilities in brand building for growth in our emerging and developing markets within the region. 
Slide 11 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Our results for cash flow were in line with our plan and we continue to expect approximately $1 billion of cash flow for the full year, although currency has become more of a headwind to our outlook for both earnings and cash flow. 
Operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $12 million. This was driven primarily by the timing of an interest payment and an increase in cash costs in the first quarter associated with Project K. In fact, those 2 items and the impact from foreign currency translation accounted for much of the decline. 
Capital spending for the quarter was $83 million and we are on track with investments for the year. Share repurchases in the first quarter were $285 million and we reduced our average share count by 1.4%. And dividends paid in the quarter were $174 million. So total cash returned to shareholders was more than $450 million. 
Now if you'll turn to Slide 12, you'll see that our guidance for 2015 has not changed. As always, sales, operating profit and earnings per share guidance is currency-neutral comparable. Excludes the items that affect comparability is detailed in our notes. As we told you last quarter, this guidance includes realistic assumptions regarding the competitive environment and the growth of our businesses in developed markets in 2015. 
We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We also continue to expect some net deflation and cost of goods sold and slight improvement in gross margin. We are approximately 85% covered for the year on commodity and packaging costs. And productivity savings should be between 3% and 4% of cost of goods sold, in line with our long-term goals. And in addition to this, we expect to see incremental savings from Project K. We expect that operating profit will be down between 2% and 4%. Remember, this includes a negative 3 to 4-point impact from the annual rebasing of incentive compensation costs. And we continue to expect that brand building will increase the rate faster than sales. 
We are also maintaining our guidance for currency-neutral comparable earnings per share of $3.74 to $3.82 or a range between flat and down 2%. The expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of last year's 53rd week and the impact of foreign currency translation. Our original expectations for the impact of currency translation was $0.15 per share, but we now estimate the impact could be as much as $0.24 per share. We still expect the tax rate to be between 27% and 28% and interest expenses is expected to be between $215 million and $225 million. 
Cash flow after capital spending should be approximately $1 billion, which includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million for Project K. This also includes the incremental capital expenditure required by the project. So cash flow for the full year, excluding Project K, should be between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. We continue to expect that total capital spending will be in the range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately 1 point of sales for incremental capital related to Project K. And we still expect that we will repurchase between $700 million and $750 million of shares during the year. 
Slide 13 shows our full year EPS walk. Remember that this outlook could be affected by any significant currency devaluations that occurred during the year, such as in Venezuela. Cost associated with the integration of Pringles and the recent acquisition in Egypt are expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share. And we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, approximately 2/3 of which will come from cost of goods sold. As we mentioned last quarter, pretax P&L costs related to the project are estimated to be between $400 million and $450 million or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share for the year, approximately 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. 
And our current outlook for second quarter earnings per share is that they will account for approximately 1/4 of our estimate for the full year. Currency impact, we expect in the second quarter is also approximately 1/4 of our estimate for the full year. And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

And now let's turn to Slide 14 in the U.S. Morning Foods business. First of all, I'd like to welcome Craig to the role of President of Morning Foods. Craig joins us most recently from Wendy's.

First of all, I'd like to welcome Craig to the role of President of Morning Foods. Craig joins us most recently from Wendy's. Before that, he worked for a number of years at P&G. I look forward to having him as an important part of the team. I'd also like to congratulate Paul on being named President of Kellogg North America. I'm sure you all agree that there is no one better than Paul for this role. 
Now onto the Morning Foods business, where comparable net sales declined by 2.9% in the quarter. This represents an improvement from the performance we saw last year. Category trends improved in Kellogg brands gained 30 basis points to cereal category share in the quarter. We saw mid single-digit increase in in-store displays and we activated strong commercial plans. In addition, our innovation launches performed well in the quarter. Raisin Bran cranberry, Special K protein and the Disney Frozen themed cereal are all doing well. And we had approximately 44% share of innovation in the quarter. 
In addition, we had the Avengers themed cereal and support coming in the second quarter. So overall, we were pleased with the results in the Morning Foods business in the first quarter. The team has done a great job, trends generally improved and we started to see the benefit where we have invested. As we discussed with you at the CAGNY conference, improvement will be a process. But we're encouraged by the results so far this year as gradual progress as we move through 2015 and into 2016. 
Let's turn to Slide 15 in our U.S. Snacks business. Comparable net sales declined by 1.1% in the first quarter. The decline in sales in the cracker category was led by the Special K Cracker Chip business. We have redesigned the food and the packaging and the consumer communication begins in earnest in the second quarter. Velocity has improved, but we continue to be affected by prior distribution losses. 
Sales in the cookie business declined in the quarter due in part to the performance in our Right Bites 100-calorie packs. This was a result of trends in weight management foods. The majority of our 2015 cookie innovation launches at mid-year. 
Sales in the wholesome snacks business also declined in the quarter. However, we saw good performance from Rice Krispies Treats. Special K bars declined due to distribution losses but velocity improved. And the new bars we introduced in December of last year off to a good start. We have more new products coming in the category. 
The Pringles brand posted flat net sales in Q1 against high single-digit comparisons last year due to the launch of Pringles Tortillas. So we continue facing challenges in the U.S. Snacks business, we've seen some success and we already made changes. We have some more to come. As I said before, improvement will take some time and will be progressive. And we will be focusing our investment to drive improvement in 2015 and into 2016. 
Let's turn to Slide 16 in the U.S. Specialty segment. Net sales in the Specialty Channels business declined by 2.5% in the quarter. The primary cause of the decline was a distributor in the convenience channel that decreased levels of inventory significantly during the period. However, we do see strong underlying consumption. 
In the Convenience channel, we increased share in the cracker, wholesome snacks, cookie and salty snacks category in the quarter. Consumption of Pringles grew at a single -- consumption of Pringles grew at a strong double-digit rate. The team expects full unit sales and operating profit growth in 2015 with the performance in the first quarter due primarily to timing of sales. 
Slide 17 shows the performance of North America Other segment, which now includes the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. Net sales declined by 6.1% in the first quarter. We saw a good consumption in the Frozen Foods business in the quarter, although net sales declined due in part to supply disruptions from last year's limited recall of our Morningstar Farms product. This was related to an industrywide issue with a supplier of cumin. It's worth noting that we are back in supply now. Specifically, the Eggo franchise posted consumption growth, higher rates of penetration and share gains in the quarter. 
Now turning to the Kashi business. Net sales declined as velocities stabilized, although impacted by last year's distribution losses. We plan to rebuild distribution over time with new innovation. 
And finally, net sales for the Canadian business also declined in the first quarter. This was largely due to the timing and phasing of activity. 
Now let's turn to Slide 18 in our European business. Comparable net sales in the region increased by 1% in the quarter due to double-digit growth in the Pringles business and good growth in Northern Europe and Russia. 
Sales in business declined in the quarter due to timing of promotions and weakness in the Special K brand, although results were in line with our expectations. As is the case in many parts of the world, we have a lot planned for Special K brand in the region in the next few months. We have newly renovated food going into the market in April and new packaging and support scheduled for the summer. We recently launched Muesli in Germany. We brought distribution in the first quarter and early results have been good. And the products that we launched recently in the U.K. is also off to a good start. 
As I mentioned, we saw double-digit net sales growth in Pringles in the quarter, which was driven by good promotions and new flavors. And we're launching Tortilla Pringles in the second quarter. So the European business had a good quarter, exceeding our expectations. We have arranged activity plan for both cereal and snack businesses for the remainder of the year and we expect continued good results from the region as a result. Now I'll turn it over to Maria Fernanda for a discussion of our Latin America business."
283356,288004916,803459,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here today to talk about the great business we have in Latin America and to give you some insights as to why we're still optimistic regarding our potential. I'll begin with an overview of the reg",1643,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here today to talk about the great business we have in Latin America and to give you some insights as to why we're still optimistic regarding our potential. I'll begin with an overview of the region, then I'll share our operating model and strategy and I'll close with highlights of how we're bringing all the elements of the strategy together. 
So let's start with Slide 21 and some background about our region and the opportunities we have. As you can see, there is a large consumer base, 40% of whom are under the age of 20 and the population is urbanizing with the rising middle class. However, despite this dynamic environment, consumers in the region retained their tradition, their sense of community and family and their optimism. As you might imagine, this changing environment present some challenges but also some great opportunity. 
Slide 22 shows the composition of Kellogg business in Latin America. Our business is largely in cereal, although we have a good core wholesome snacks business. And the acquisition of the Pringles brand gave us some meaningfully size business as well. We have significant core business in Mexico, which along with the rest of Latin America, performed well in the first quarter. And we also have growing businesses in attractive areas of the region and in growing categories and segments in those areas. 
Now let's turn to Slide 23 and one of our competitive advantages, our brand. Around the region, we have a stable of well-known global brands that consumers love. The consumer base in our region appreciate quality products and Kellogg is one of the most trusted brands in Latin America. Consumer awareness of our brand is high and our products have some of the highest category and segments shares in the region. And the brands are expendable, as we have seen with our success in the wholesome snacks category. We've also targeted geographic expansion of Pringles and the recent introduction of our Kellogg parent brand. 
Now let's turn to Slide 24. As you can see, we have more than 55% cereal category share across the region. Our wholesome snacks business holds approximately 24% share and is made up of snacks sold largely under our cereal brand names such as Special K, Zucaritas, All-Bran and now Kellogg. 
And finally, you can see that our salty snacks business holds only a 1.3% share across the region, although net sales have significantly since the acquisition of Pringles. As a result, we've seen great potential across all of our categories. 
However, despite the great positioning, 3 years ago, we identified some opportunity to expand the business even further. These opportunities were unleashing the potential of the region, growing in all segments of the cereal business and in high-growth areas of the region, expanding into high-frequency stores and better leveraging our supply chain. 
So now let's look at Slide 25 and the discussion regarding how we've addressed these opportunities. We implemented, aiming regional, multifunctional category organization and we reorganized our businesses in the regional hubs, which provided increased scale and improved speed to market. We began developing our plan, not only focused on our consumer, but also on our shopper, who can oftentimes be different than the consumer, and the retail environment, in which these shoppers were shopping. And we elevated our engagement with our customers. We have focused on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. For example, we are delivering regional innovation and commercial program. We're better leveraging total commercial investments to win with shoppers where they shop. And we've moved from a manufacturing organization to a supply chain organization, focused on optimizing asset utilization and improving gross margin. 
As a result, we are executing Project K, we're reducing our cost structure and we are eliminating complexity in the portfolio and queuing our growth. And we will continue to drive underlying productivity and improved profitability. 
Also, we've made great progress in building a strong organization. These are all major undertakings and the entire team in Latin America does an amazing job implementing these changes to our structure, while remaining focused on generating profitable sales growth. 
So how has all this played out in recent years? If you'll turn to Slide 26, you'll see some of the recent successes we've had as a result of the changes we've made to our operating model and strategy. The rate of net sales growth improved as we progressed through 2014 and year-on-year net sales grew at a double-digit rate in first quarter of 2015. And importantly, volume increased by more than 4% as a result of good innovation and strong end market activity. And we're confident we'll see good rate of net sales growth across the remainder of the year. 
We've also seen the benefits of the work we've done in gross margin expansion in recent years. We focused on our large businesses and have achieved margin expansion in both the Mexican and the regional cereal business. 
Now let's turn to Slide 27 and more detail regarding our strategy in the region. There are 5 interrelated parts: First, as I mentioned, we have a large and growing cereal business in the region. And continuing to drive category growth is one of our main priorities. We're also focused on the snack category and on driving increased consumption across the portfolio. 
Next, while our program of innovation and renovation has been successful, we can always improve. Speed to market is critical and we've made good progress streamlining the process. We are also committed to winning where people shop and we're increasing the focus on high-frequency stores. This is the channel where between 50% and 70% of retail sales in the traditional food basket where the majority of our shoppers shop and where affordable products are a requirement. 
We are executing Project K in the region. This means optimizing our supply chain network, developing a footprint that will serve our future growth and generating the flexibility to increase investment in the business. 
And finally, we're constantly striving to develop our people, improve their performance and provide them with exciting opportunities. We've taken big strides in this area and have what, I believe, is a world class team, dedicated to constant improvement. 
Now let me give you more detail on our investment in pan-regional innovation, how we're excelling at in-store execution and our work in high-frequency stores. Let's start with innovation on Slide 28. We significantly increased the number of pan-regional introduction, which have increased the efficiency of our investment. We've relaunched Choco Krispies in 2014, which drove an increase in volume and share in the Andean and Central American region. We restaged Special K as well and gained share in core countries of the region. And we also launched a full line of Muesli granola cereals and bars, branded with the Kellogg brand. We've had some real success government successes with pan-regional innovations so far and we're really looking forward to continued progress. 
Now let's turn to Slide 29 and detail regarding the Pringles business in our region. We've increased net sales in U.S. dollars by more than 10% since the acquisition in 2012. Growth in local currencies was significantly greater. At the time we acquired Pringles, we saw Latin America as one of the areas with the most opportunity for expansion. As you can imagine, we're attacking this growth potential as quickly as possible by increasing distribution and driving significant innovation. Latin America has certainly been a success story for Pringles over the last 3 years and we expect continued strong growth in 2015 and beyond. 
Now turning to Slide 30. Our efforts on high-frequency stores have been focused in 3 areas. Optimizing our route-to-market to enhance our reach, principally in mom-and-pop stores; developing the right portfolio for this channel and getting the right visibility in the stores. As you can see on the slide, we've developed a range of inexpensive smaller serve products, which are available to our shoppers in high-frequency stores. There are 2 million high-frequency stores in the region and we have a goal of increasing our coverage by approximately 50% this year. Having said that, we do have continued opportunities to increase the coverage even further in the future years. 
Slide 31 details the program designed to improve the visibility of Kellogg products in high-frequency stores, ensuring all our products are displayed, visible and accessible to our shoppers. The program includes an ideal store initiative, which leverages stores' real estate to promote the Kellogg brand and build engagement with shoppers and store owners. This program is a pan-regional initiative and sales at these stores have increased at a double-digit rate and have gained share. And our goal for 2015 is to have many more of these stores in place by the end of the year. 
And on Slide 32, you can see that we have more to come. We have more innovation, as I've mentioned, including Kellogg parent brand launches in various parts of the region. We're continuing to invest further in the expansion of high-frequency stores. And finally, we have a significant commercial activation plan. You can see on the slide that we're proud sponsors of the Copa America Soccer Tournament going on this summer in Chile. We have full support plan and expecting great results. 
So let's turn to Slide 33. I'm sure you'll agree we have exciting opportunities for the years ahead. We've never been better positioned to grow, given the dynamic categories, where we participate with our leading brands, our renewed strategy and focused initiative, all with the objective of driving long-term profitable growth. And we focused on the organization. And I'd like to end by thanking the Latin America team for their leadership and commitment to our collective success. And now I'll turn it back over to John."

The Asia-Pacific segment posted an increase in comparable net sales of 4% in the first quarter. We posted double-digit growth in Asia as a result of double-digit growth in India, Japan and South Korea. In India, we saw growth in our core brands and a new smaller size packs designed to make our products more affordable. We have completed construction at our new plant in India and the facility has started production to service the increasing demand in the country. 
Sales declined in the Australian business due to weakness in the cereal and snack businesses. However, we are launching a range of innovation, including granola, Muesli, gluten-free and on the go offerings. The Pringles business posted good sales growth, with results exceeding our expectations. We ran a muesli promotion in Asia, Southeast Asia and Taiwan, which drove sales at a double-digit rate during the activation period. 
We had another quarter in this region, driven by strong growth in our Asian business. As you might imagine, we continue to expect growth from the region for 2015. 
Let's turn to the summary on Page 35. Our results for sales, operating profit and earnings per share were all ahead of our expectations in the first quarter. We saw sales growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. And we saw improving sales trends in our U.S. cereal business and our Kellogg brand been share. 
The Project K initiative continues to go well. We are investing the savings in areas designed to drive profitable sales growth and we're starting to see the results. 
Obviously, our investment program is a process and the benefits will build over time. Improvement in our results will also build and we know that there's no quick fix. However, we are very encouraged by some of the early signs of success we've already seen and by the plans we are making now for future periods. 
Now I'd like to end as always by thanking our employees around the world. It's all the hard work that build the foundation for growth in 2015 and beyond. And with that, I'll open it up for questions."

What we're seeing in our business is a strong performance. 7 of our 10 largest brands out of the Kellogg brand did share in the quarter and that Kellogg brand gained about 20 basis points a share. Why some our businesses are doing better? Fruit Loops grew about 6% and that's being driven by greater advertising programs behind consumption, et cetera. The Raisin Bran business is up about 7%, Rice Krispies, up 4%. In the case of Raisin Bran, there are some innovation very on trend advertising as well.

So when we look at wholesome snacks, Special K bars is the primary source of weakness within that category for us. We've come out with new Special K bars here at the beginning of the year. We've lost some distribution in some retailers. But we've maintained the distribution of velocity is strong we got some good food delivering up on the promise of Special K.

If you look at the consumption data versus the shipment data, there's 2 reasons for the differences there in the first quarter. One has to do with strong growth in the nonvegetarian. I realize Nielsen covers most of the business, but there are some large customers in meaningful channels that are not inside that data. We've seen some very, very good growth in those businesses. Secondly, a lot of what is happening is driven by the facing of innovation year-on-year. So last year innovation went out in the first quarter. This year, innovation for snacks is much more mid-year. And what's happening there is we'll see innovation go in Q2. They would give us more of a consumption drive and a little bit more of a shipment drive as we fill the pipelines for that innovation. Last year, innovation went in in the first quarter [indiscernible] in Q4. And so we actually through inventory in Q1. We get good coming behind innovation in Q1 last year. So a little bit of timing issue within the year what you're seeing there. We do expect better results. I would caution on some of the April data because the shift of Eastern can distort 1 week versus another. But we do expect to see improving consumption trends in our snacks business overtime."

As we shared with you earlier in the presentation, we've made some pretty important structural changes to better address the growth opportunities in Latin America and they're quite simple. First is high-frequency stores. Traditionally, we've had pantry size boxes of cU cereal going through most of our direct account. 15% to 17% of all food sales go through Asia Pac, as I mentioned earlier, only 20% of cereals sales and for us, less than 20% of our snacks. So that's the biggest opportunity. To be able to drive volume growth, John, we need to have the right size, the right pack at the right affordable price. And that's what we now put in through the core of our cereal brand to address high-frequency stores. And as we ramp up Pringles, having Pringles also for affordable prices in high-frequency stores is absolutely critical."

We are pleased to have announced today results for currency-neutral comparable net sales, operating profit and earnings per share that were ahead of our expectations. We saw good net sales growth in the international business and improving trends in several of our developed market businesses in North America. As you know, we've invested in various revenue-driving initiatives around the world, and we've seen improving sales trends.
Specifically, we posted strong double-digit net sales growth in Latin America in the quarter. We posted low single-digit net sales growth in Europe and the Asia Pacific region posted mid-single-digit net sales growth through the double-digit growth in the Asian business. And we saw improving trends in our developed Cereal business in the U.S. Category trends improved and our Kellogg brands gained share. 
As we mentioned at the CAGNY conference, we've been doing a lot of work over the last year on Project K, our efficiency and effectiveness initiative. We are on track to generate savings and to invest in the business to drive profitable net sales growth. 
Specifically, we are focused on 3 main areas of opportunity. We are investing where the shoppers shop, we are investing in our food and we're increasing our investment in the high-growth emerging markets. 
Let's start with a discussion of in-store execution. The first area of investment we're focused on is the warehouse sales force in the U.S. We made a significant investment in this area in 2014 and we are investing more in 2015. Their focus is on selling promotions, gaining share of the shelf, maximizing distribution and increasing the speed to shelf for new products. 
The second area of investment is the DSD sales team. The benefits we get from this investment build over time, but we have always seen improved display activity in the channels serviced by DSD. 
The third area of investment is in emerging markets, where we've invested in our coverage of high-frequency stores in both Asia and Latin America. We are pleased with the progress we have made so far. We have more to do, although we've already seen improved results. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 and the second area of focus, increased investment in our food. First of all, we have started some broad initiatives in the U.S. Cereal business this year, including the Origins program, which is similar to one that was successful in Europe. This program includes new food and support which stresses the simplicity and goodness of the new products. 
And we've also got some great new snacks coming. In the U.S., we have renovated our Special K bars to include more visible ingredients and we are launching Special K chewy nut bars, which include simple ingredients preferred by consumers. We've launched a variety of new mueslis in a number of countries, which are off to a good start, and we have plans to launch granolas and mueslis in other parts of the world. And very importantly, we've also done a lot of work with our Kashi business in North America. 
We have great brands in both Kashi and Bear Naked. We have a dedicated team in California, and they are making progress across 3 priorities: first, they're designing and launching a portfolio of innovative plant-based foods that deliver powerful, uplifting health; second, they're engaging with customers and partnering to develop new and exciting programs targeted at food-forward consumers; and finally, they are developing stronger marketing plans using more of a storytelling model, rather than a traditional advertising model. 
Finally, for Project K. Let's turn to Slide 6 and the investment we are making in the emerging markets. We have a strong team across the international businesses. Within these regions, we have targeted various initiatives. In Asia and Latin America, we are focused on increasing our penetration of high-frequency stores. We've driven strong sales growth in the Pringles business in the emerging markets over the last 3 years, and we've recently opened a new plant in Malaysia. In addition, we recently invested in a large biscuit manufacturer in Egypt and our joint venture in China continues to perform well. These are all initiatives designed to increase our race of profitable sales growth and return us to our long-term model. It's early in the process, but we're seeing good sales growth in our international regions and we're confident that we'll achieve additional growth as we execute these programs. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ron."
283356,288004916,803854,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 shows the financial results for the first quarter. Reported net sales declined by 5%, primarily due to international currency devaluations. Currency-neutral comparable net sales decreased slightly. We had",1261,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 shows the financial results for the first quarter. Reported net sales declined by 5%, primarily due to international currency devaluations. Currency-neutral comparable net sales decreased slightly. We had good growth in all of our international regions and results improved in several developed businesses in North America. This quarter's improving trends were the result of new product introductions and brand-building initiatives in each of the regions and investments we've made with savings from Project K. 
Reported quarterly operating profit was $384 million and included a charge for the capitalized portion of our pension mark-to-market at year-end 2014 as well as Project K costs in the first quarter. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 1.9% in the quarter, better than our expectations. Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration cost, mark-to-market adjustments, Project K cost and other items that affect comparability, were $0.98 per share in the first quarter, again, ahead of our expectations. These results include $0.06 of currency headwind in the quarter, so currency-neutral comparable earnings increased by 3% to $1.04 per share, including a lower-than-planned tax rate resulting from some  discrete items. 
So our results in the first quarter were ahead of our expectations and were in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Slide 8 shows the composition of the first quarter sales growth. Currency-neutral comparable revenues for the first quarter declined by 0.3%, reflecting an overall improvement in trends. Comparable volume decreased by 0.7% in the quarter. We saw volume growth across all our international regions, driven by both cereal and snacks, offset by results in our North America business. Price and mix increased by 0.4% and the impact of currency translation decreased sales growth by 4.7% in the quarter as many currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. 
Slide 9 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin for the first quarter. Quarterly gross margin remained unchanged at 37.9%, which is broadly in line with our expectations. Productivity improvements and savings from Project K's supply chain initiatives offset inflation in factory, distribution costs and investments in our food. As expected, commodity and packaging costs were net deflationary and we are currently approximately 85% covered. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10, which shows the currency-neutral comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions in the first quarter. North America's operating profit decreased by 8%. This was primarily driven by lower sales and investment in our U.S. sales force as well as reestablishing our Kashi business in California. Europe's operating profit increased by 13% in the first quarter, driven by the region's sales growth and net deflation in cost of goods sold, including savings from Project K. 
Operating profit increased by 5% in Latin America in the quarter. Strong sales growth included increases in volume and price actions to offset inflation. In addition, we invested in brand-building activities to support new product launches and drive market penetration. 
Operating profit decreased by 3% in the Asia Pacific region. While we had solid sales growth in the quarter, we are investing in capabilities and brand building for growth in our emerging and developing markets within the region. 
Slide 11 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Our results for cash flow were in line with our plan, and we continue to expect approximately $1 billion of cash flow for the full year, although currency has become more of a headwind to our outlook for both earnings and cash flow. 
Operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $12 million. This was driven primarily by the timing of an interest payment and an increase in cash costs in the first quarter associated with Project K. In fact, those 2 items and the impact from foreign currency translation accounted for much of the decline. 
Capital spending for the quarter was $83 million, and we are on track with investments for the year. Share repurchases in the first quarter were $285 million and we reduced our average share count by 1.4%. And dividends paid in the quarter were $174 million. So total cash returned to share owners was more than $450 million. 
Now if you'll turn to Slide 12, you'll see that our guidance for 2015 has not changed. As always, sales, operating profit and earnings per share guidance is currency-neutral comparable, excludes the items that affect comparability as detailed in our notes. As we told you last quarter, this guidance includes realistic assumptions regarding the competitive environment and the growth of our businesses in developed markets in 2015. 
We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We also continue to expect some net deflation and cost of goods sold and slight improvement in gross margin. We are approximately 85% covered for the year on commodity and packaging costs. And productivity savings should be between 3% and 4% of cost of goods sold, in line with our long-term goals. And in addition to this, we expect to see incremental savings from Project K. 
We expect that operating profit will be down between 2% and 4%. Remember, this includes a negative 3- to 4-point impact from the annual re-basing of incentive compensation costs. And we continue to expect that brand building will increase the rate faster than sales. 
We are also maintaining our guidance for currency-neutral comparable earnings per share of $3.74 to $3.82 or a range between flat and down 2%. The expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of last year's 53rd week and the impact of foreign currency translation. Our original expectations for the impact of currency translation was $0.15 per share, but we now estimate the impact could be as much as $0.24 per share. We still expect the tax rate to be between 27% and 28% and interest expense is expected to be between $215 million and $225 million. 
Cash flow after capital spending should be approximately $1 billion, which includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million for Project K. This also includes the incremental capital expenditure required by the project. So cash flow for the full year excluding Project K should be between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. We continue to expect that total capital spending will be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately 1 point of sales for incremental capital related to Project K. And we still expect that we will repurchase between $700 million and $750 million of shares during the year. 
Slide 13 shows our full year EPS walk. Remember that this outlook could be affected by any significant currency devaluations that occur during the year, such as in Venezuela. Cost associated with the integration of Pringles and the recent acquisition in Egypt are expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share, and we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, approximately 2/3 of which will come from cost of goods sold. As we mentioned last quarter, pretax P&L costs related to the project are estimated to be between $400 million and $450 million or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share for the year, approximately 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. 
And our current outlook for second quarter earnings per share is that they will account for approximately 1/4 of our estimate for the full year. Currency impact, we expect, in the second quarter is also approximately 1/4 of our estimate for the full year. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

And now let's turn to Slide 14 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. First of all, I'd like to welcome Craig Bahner to the role of President of Morning Foods.

First of all, I'd like to welcome Craig Bahner to the role of President of Morning Foods. Craig joins us most recently from Wendy's. Before that, he worked for a number of years at P&G, and we look forward to having him as an important part of the team. I'd also like to congratulate Paul Norman on being named President of Kellogg North America. I'm sure you will all agree that there's no one better than Paul for this role. 
Now onto the Morning Foods business, where comparable net sales declined by 2.9% in the quarter. This represents an improvement from the performance we saw last year. Category trends improved and Kellogg brands gained 30 basis points for cereal category share in the quarter. We saw a mid-single-digit increase in in-store displays and we activated strong commercial plans. In addition, our innovation launches performed well in the quarter. Raisin Bran Cranberry, Special K Protein and a Disney Frozen-themed cereal are all doing well, and we had approximately 44% share of innovation in the quarter. In addition, we have the Avengers-themed cereal and support coming in the second quarter. 
So overall, we were pleased with the results in the Morning Foods business in the first quarter. The team has done a great job, trends generally improved and we started to see the benefit where we have invested. As we discussed with you at the CAGNY conference, improvement will be a process, but we're encouraged by the results so far this year as there's gradual progress as we move through 2015 and into 2016. 
Let's turn to Slide 15 and our U.S. Snacks business. Comparable net sales declined by 1.1% in the first quarter. The decline in sales in the cracker category was led by the Special K Cracker Chips business. We have redesigned the food and the packaging, and the consumer communication begins in earnest in the second quarter. Velocity has improved, but we continue to be affected by prior distribution losses. 
Sales in the cookie business declined in the quarter due in part to the performance in our Right Bites 100-calorie packs. This was a result of trends in weight management foods. The majority of our 2015 cookie innovation launches at mid-year. 
Sales in the wholesome snack business also declined in the quarter, however, we saw a good performance from Rice Krispies Treats. Consumption of Special K bars declined due to distribution losses, but velocity improved and the new bars that we've introduced in December of last year were off to a good start. And we have more new products coming in the category. 
The Pringles brand posted flat net sales in Q1 against high single-digit comparisons last year due to the launch of Pringles Tortillas. So we continue facing challenges in our U.S. Snacks business, but we've seen some success and we've already made changes, and we have some more to come. As I've said before, improvement will take some time and will be progressive. And we will be focusing our investment to drive improvement in 2015 and into 2016. 
Let's turn to Slide 16 and the U.S. Specialty segment. Net sales in the Specialty Channels business declined by 2.5% in the quarter. The primary cause of the decline was a distributor in the convenience channel that decreased levels of inventories significantly during the period. However, we do see strong underlying consumption. 
In the Convenience channel, we increased share in the cracker, wholesome snack, cookie and salty snack categories in the quarter. Consumption of Pringles grew at a single -- sorry, consumption of Pringles grew at a strong double-digit rate. The team expects full unit sales and operating profit growth in 2015, with the performance in the first quarter due primarily to the timing of sales. 
Slide 17 shows the performance of North America Other segment, which now includes the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. Net sales declined by 6.1% in the first quarter. We saw good consumption in the Frozen Foods business in the quarter, although net sales declined due in part to supply disruptions from last year's limited recall of our Morningstar Farms product. This was related to an industry-wide issue with a supplier of cumin. It is worth noting that we are back in supply now. Specifically, the Eggo franchise posted consumption growth, higher rates of penetration and share gains in the quarter. 
Now turning to the Kashi business. Net sales declined as velocities stabilized, although impacted by last year's distribution losses. We plan to rebuild distribution over time with new innovation. 
And finally, net sales for the Canadian business also declined in the first quarter. This was largely due to the timing and phasing of activity. 
Now let's turn to Slide 18 in our European business. Comparable net sales in the region increased by 1% in the quarter due to double-digit growth in the Pringles business and good growth in Northern Europe and Russia. 
Sales in the cereal business declined in the quarter due to timing of promotions and weakness in the Special K brand, although results were in line with our expectations. As is the case in many parts of the world, we have a lot planned for the Special K brand in the region in the next few months. We have newly renovated food going into the market in April and new packaging and support scheduled for the summer. 
We recently launched Muesli in Germany. We brought [ph] distribution in the first quarter and early results have been good. And the Coco Pops products that we launched recently in the U.K. is also off to a good start. 
As I mentioned, we saw double-digit net sales growth in Pringles in the quarter, which was driven by good promotions and new flavors. And we're launching Tortilla Pringles in the second quarter. 
So the European business had a good quarter, exceeding our expectations. We have arranged activity plan for both cereal and snack businesses for the remainder of the year, and we expect continued good results from the region as a result. 
Now I'll turn it over to Maria Fernanda for a discussion of our Latin American business."

I'm excited to be here today to talk about the great business we have in Latin America and to give you some insights as to why we're still optimistic regarding our potential. I'll begin with an overview of the reg",1642,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here today to talk about the great business we have in Latin America and to give you some insights as to why we're still optimistic regarding our potential. I'll begin with an overview of the region, then I'll share our operating model and strategy and I'll close with highlights of how we're bringing all the elements of the strategy together. 
So let's start with Slide 21 and some background about our region and the opportunities we have. As you can see, there is a large consumer base, 40% of whom are under the age of 20 and the population is urbanizing with the rising middle class. However, despite this dynamic environment, consumers in the region retain their tradition, their sense of community and family and their optimism. As you might imagine, this changing environment presents some challenges but also some great opportunities. 
Slide 22 shows the composition of Kellogg business in Latin America. Our business is largely in cereal, although we have a good core wholesome snacks business. And the acquisition of the Pringles brand gave us some meaningfully sized salty  business as well. We have significant core business in Mexico, which, along with the rest of Latin America, performed well in the first quarter. And we also have growing businesses in attractive areas of the region and in growing categories and segments in those areas. 
Now let's turn to Slide 23 and one of our competitive advantages, our brand. Around the region, we have a stable of well-known global brands that consumers love. The consumer base in our region appreciate quality products, and Kellogg is one of the most trusted brands in Latin America. Consumer awareness of our brand is high and our products have some of the highest category and segment shares in the region. And the brands are expandable, as we've seen with our success in the wholesome snacks category. We've also targeted geographic expansion with Pringles and the recent introduction of our Kellogg's parent brand. 
Now let's turn to Slide 24. As you can see, we have more than 55% cereal category share across the region. Our wholesome snacks business holds approximately 24% share and is made up of snacks sold largely under our cereal brand names such as Special K, Zucaritas, All-Bran and now Kellogg's. 
And finally, you can see that our salty snacks business holds only a 1.3% share across the region, although net sales have grown significantly since the acquisition of Pringles. As a result, we see great potential across all of our categories. 
However, despite the great positioning, 3 years ago, we identified some opportunity to expand the business even further. These opportunities were unleashing the potential of the region, growing in all segments of the cereal business and in high-growth areas of the region, expanding into high-frequency stores and better leveraging our supply chain. 
So now let's look at Slide 25 and a discussion regarding how we've addressed these opportunities. We implemented a new regional, multifunctional category organization and we reorganized our businesses in the regional hubs, which provided increased scale and improved speed to market. We began developing our plan not only focused on our consumer but also on our shopper, who can oftentimes be different than the consumer, and the retail environment, in which these shoppers were shopping. And we elevated our engagement with our customers. We have focused on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. For example, we are delivering pan-regional innovation and commercial program. We're better leveraging total commercial investments to win with shoppers where they shop. And we've moved from a manufacturing organization to a supply chain organization, focused on optimizing asset utilization and improving gross margin. 
As a result, we're executing Project K. We're reducing our cost structure and we're eliminating complexity in the portfolio and securing our growth. And we will continue to drive underlying productivity and improved profitability. 
Also, we've made great progress in building a strong organization. These are all major undertakings, and the entire team in Latin America has done an amazing job implementing these changes to our structure while remaining focused on generating profitable sales growth. 
So how has all this played out in recent years? If you'll turn to Slide 26, you'll see some of the recent successes we've had as a result of the changes we've made to our operating model and strategy. The rate of net sales growth improved as we progressed through 2014, and year-on-year net sales grew at a double-digit rate in first quarter of 2015. And importantly, volume increased by more than 4% as a result of good innovation and strong end-market activity. And we're confident we'll see good rates of net sales growth across the remainder of the year. 
We've also seen the benefits of the work we've done in gross margin expansion in recent years. We focused on our large businesses and have achieved margin expansion in both the Mexican and the pan-regional cereal business. 
Now let's turn to Slide 27 and more detail regarding our strategy in the region. There are 5 interrelated parts: First, as I mentioned, we have a large and growing cereal business in the region, and continuing to drive category growth is one of our main priorities. We're also focused on the snack category and on driving increased consumption across the portfolio. 
Next, while our program of innovation and renovation has been successful, we can always improve. Speed to market is critical, and we've made good progress streamlining the process. 
We're also committed to winning where people shop and we're increasingly focused on high-frequency stores. This is the channel where between 50% and 70% of retail sales in the traditional food basket are made, where the majority of our shoppers shop and where affordable products are a requirement. 
We're executing Project K in the region. This means optimizing our supply chain network, developing a footprint that will serve our future growth and generating the flexibility to increase investment in the business. 
And finally, we're constantly striving to develop our people, improve their performance and provide them with exciting opportunities. We've taken big strides in this area and have what, I believe, is a world-class team dedicated to constant improvement. 
Now let me give you more detail on our investment in pan-regional innovation, how we're excelling at in-store execution and our work in high-frequency stores. Let's start with innovation on Slide 28. We've significantly increased the number of pan-regional introductions, which have increased the efficiency of our investment. We relaunched Choco Krispies in 2014, which drove an increase in volume and share in the Andean and Central American region. We restaged Special K as well and gained share in core countries of the region. And we also launched a full line of muesli, granola cereals and bars, branded with the Kellogg's brand. We've had some real success -- successes with pan-regional innovations so far, and we're really looking forward to continued progress. 
Now let's turn to Slide 29 and detail regarding the Pringles business in our region. We've increased net sales in U.S. dollars by more than 10% since the acquisition in 2012. Growth in local currencies was significantly greater. At the time we acquired Pringles, we saw Latin America as one of the areas with the most opportunity for expansion. As you can imagine, we're attacking this growth potential as quickly as possible by increasing distribution and driving significant innovation. Latin America has certainly been a success story for Pringles over the last 3 years and we expect continued strong growth in 2015 and beyond. 
Now turning to Slide 30. Our efforts on high-frequency stores have been focused in 3 areas: Optimizing our route-to-market to enhance our reach, principally in mom-and-pop stores; developing the right portfolio for this channel; and getting the right visibility in the stores. As you can see on the slide, we've developed a range of inexpensive smaller-serve products, which are available to our shoppers in high-frequency stores. There are 2 million high-frequency stores in the region and we have a goal of increasing our coverage of these by approximately 50% this year. Having said that, we do have continued opportunities to increase the coverage even further in future years. 
Slide 31 details the program designed to improve the visibility of Kellogg products in high-frequency stores, ensuring all our products are displayed, visible and accessible to our shoppers. The program includes an ideal store initiative, which leverages stores' real estate to promote the Kellogg brand and build engagement with shoppers and store owners. This program is a pan-regional initiative, and sales at these stores have increased at a double-digit rate and they've gained share. And our goal for 2015 is to have many more of these stores in place by the end of the year. 
And on Slide 32, you can see that we have more to come. We have more innovation, as I've mentioned, including Kellogg parent brand launches in various parts of the region. We're continuing to invest further in the expansion of high-frequency stores. And finally, we have significant commercial activations plan. You can see on the slide that we're proud sponsors of the Copa América soccer tournament going on this summer in Chile. We have full home-to-store support plan and expecting great results. 
So let's turn to Slide 33. I'm sure you'll agree we have an exciting opportunity for the years ahead. We've never been better positioned to grow given the dynamic categories where we participate with our leading brands, our renewed strategy and focused initiative, all with the objective of driving long-term profitable growth. And we focused on the organization. 
And I'd like to end by thanking the Latin America team for their leadership and commitment to our collective success. 
And now I'll turn it over back to John."

The Asia Pacific segment posted an increase in comparable net sales of 4% in the first quarter. We posted double-digit growth in Asia as a result of double-digit growth in India, Japan and South Korea. In India, we saw growth in our core brands and in new smaller-size packs designed to make our products more affordable. We have completed construction at our new plant in India and the facility has started production to service the increasing demand in the country. 
Sales declined in the Australian business due to weakness in the cereal and snack businesses. However, we are launching a range of innovation, including granola, muesli, gluten-free and on-the-go offerings. 
The Pringles business posted good sales growth, with results exceeding our expectations. We ran a Muesli promotion in Australia, southeast Asia and Taiwan, which drove sales at a double-digit rate during the activation period. 
So we had another quarter in this region, driven by strong growth in our Asian business. As you might imagine, we continue to expect growth from the region for 2015. 
Let's turn to the summary on Page 35. Our results for sales, operating profit and earnings per share were all ahead of our expectations in the first quarter. We saw sales growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. And we saw improving sales trends in our U.S. cereal business and our Kellogg brands gained share. 
The Project K initiative continues to go well. We are investing the savings in areas designed to drive profitable sales growth, and we're starting to see the results. 
Obviously, our investment program is a process and the benefits will build over time. Improvement in our results will also build and we know that there's no quick fix. However, we are very encouraged by some of the early signs of success we've already seen and by the plans we are making now for future periods. 
Now I'd like to end, as always, by thanking our employees around the world. It's all their hard work that's allowing us to build the foundation for growth in 2015 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll open up for questions."

Some of it's going into our sales capabilities, both in the U.S., as you've seen with the warehouse and DSD system, but also with sales force that support high-frequency stores in a number of emerging markets. Quite frankly, as we look at brand building, we have a high level of brand building as a company. We spent about twice the amount of advertising as the average food company. So we feel like we have fuel in the engine there. We believe we can get the best return by investing more to [indiscernible] as you get growth through additional capabilities, such as sales and by making sure we have food that's absolutely on trend with changing consumers' needs."

Into the -- why some of our businesses are doing better. Fruit Loops grew about 6%, and that's being driven by some great advertising programs behind evening consumption, et cetera. The Raisin Bran business was up about 7%; Rice Krispies, up 4%. In the case of Raisin Bran, we have some innovation, but also some very on-trend advertising as well. We are seeing improved distribution and merchandising from reinvesting back into our U.S. sales force. Our displays are up than Q1 last year. Quite frankly, we were down in Q1 last year.

But through the implementation, very strong consumption building and category program, we saw the elasticity improve through the back half of 2014 and, certainly, through the first quarter of 2015, where, in Mexico, we saw great volume in recovery. As far as what we're seeing in the region from a regulatory standpoint, we are -- obviously, we meet all government and regulatory requirements. And we're constantly tracking and evolving the requirements and the evolving consumer preferences. In the region, cereal, a bowl of cereal with milk, fruit still provides a very nutritious breakfast offering as -- when we compare it to other local offerings in the marketplace.

On Kashi, the Kashi wholesome snack bars actually grew in the first quarter, which is a sign of the strength of the brand, particularly when you have great food going up against it. On the Special K business, if you look at some of the softness in consumption we've had in our U.S. Snacks business, it does largely come down to Special K. But there's some good news in there. So if we look within wholesome snacks, Special K bars is the primary source of weakness within that category for us. We've come out with new Special K bars here at the beginning of the year. We've lost some distribution and some retailers, but we have maintained the distribution and velocity is up strong, which would suggest that we've got good food that's delivering upon the promise of Special K. And we have more innovation coming in behind Special K in the middle of the year. If we come to cracker, similar story. We've renovated Special K Cracker Chips offering. We've lost some distribution on those products. But where we've maintained the distribution, the velocity is up strongly again, which also suggests we have some great food out there. So I think what we're seeing is a transition. The good news is where the food's in play, we're seeing good velocities. Now our job is to rebuild the distributions based on having great food in the marketplace."

If you look at the consumption data versus the shipment data, there's 2 reasons for differences there in the first quarter. One has to do with strong growth in the non-major channel. I realize that Nielsen covers most of the business, but there are some large customers in meaningful channels that are not inside that data, as we're seeing some very good growth in those businesses. Secondly, a lot of what's happening is driven by the phasing of innovation year-on-year. So last, year innovation went out in the first quarter. This year, innovation for snacks is much more mid-year. And what's happening there is we'll see that innovation go in Q2. That'll give us more of a consumption drive and a little bit more of a shipment drive, too, as we fill the pipelines for that innovation. Last year, innovation went in, in the first quarter, which means it probably [ph] ships in Q4. And so we actually burned through inventory in Q1. We get good consumption coming from behind that innovation in Q1 last year. So a little bit of a timing issue within the year that's driving what you're seeing there. We do expect better results. I would caution on some of the April data because the shift of Easter can distort one week versus another. But we do expect to see improving consumption trends in our snacks business over time."

As we shared with you earlier in the presentation, we've made some pretty important structural changes to better address the growth opportunities in Latin America, and they're quite simple.

Traditionally, we've had pantry-size boxes of cereal going through most of our direct accounts. 50% to 70% of all food sales go through HFS, as I mentioned earlier, only 20% of cereal sales, and for us, less than 20% of our snacks. So that is the biggest opportunity. To be able to drive volume growth, John, in HFS, we need to have the right size, the right pack at the right affordable price.

We are pleased to have announced today results for currency-neutral comparable net sales, operating profit and earnings per share that were ahead of our expectations.

We are pleased to have announced today results for currency-neutral comparable net sales, operating profit and earnings per share that were ahead of our expectations. We saw good net sales growth in the international business and improving trends in several of our developed market businesses in North America. As you know, we've invested in various revenue-driving initiatives around the world, and we've seen improving sales trends.
Specifically, we posted strong double-digit net sales growth in Latin America in the quarter. We posted low single-digit net sales growth in Europe and the Asia Pacific region posted mid-single-digit net sales growth due to double-digit growth in the Asian business. And we saw improving trends in our developed Cereal business in the U.S. Category trends improved and our Kellogg brands gained share. 
As we mentioned at the CAGNY conference, we've been doing a lot of work over the last year on Project K, our efficiency and effectiveness initiative. We are on track to generate savings and to invest in the business to drive profitable net sales growth. 
Specifically, we are focused on 3 main areas of opportunity. We are investing where the shoppers shop, we are investing in our food and we're increasing our investment in the high-growth emerging markets. 
Let's start with a discussion of in-store execution. The first area of investment we're focused on is the warehouse sales force in the U.S. We made a significant investment in this area in 2014 and we are investing more in 2015. Their focus is on selling promotions, gaining share of the shelf, maximizing distribution and increasing the speed to shelf for new products. 
The second area of investment is the DSD sales team. The benefits we get from this investment build over time, but we have always seen improved display activity in the channels serviced by DSD. 
The third area of investment is in emerging markets, where we've invested in our coverage of high-frequency stores in both Asia and Latin America. We are pleased with the progress we have made so far. We have more to do, although we've already seen improved results. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 and the second area of focus, increased investment in our food. First of all, we have started some broad initiatives in the U.S. Cereal business this year, including the Origins program, which is similar to one that was successful in Europe. This program includes new food and support which stresses the simplicity and goodness of the new products. 
And we've also got some great new snacks coming. In the U.S., we have renovated our Special K bars to include more visible ingredients and we are launching Special K chewy nut bars, which include simple ingredients preferred by consumers. We've launched a variety of new mueslis in a number of countries, which are off to a good start, and we have plans to launch granolas and mueslis in other parts of the world. And very importantly, we've also done a lot of work with our Kashi business in North America. 
We have great brands in both Kashi and Bear Naked. We have a dedicated team in California, and they are making progress across 3 priorities: first, they're designing and launching a portfolio of innovative plant-based foods that deliver powerful, uplifting health; second, they're engaging with customers and partnering to develop new and exciting programs targeted at food-forward consumers; and finally, they are developing stronger marketing plans using more of a storytelling model, rather than a traditional advertising model. 
Finally, for Project K. Let's turn to Slide 6 and the investment we are making in the emerging markets. We have a strong team across the international businesses. Within these regions, we have targeted various initiatives. In Asia and Latin America, we are focused on increasing our penetration of high-frequency stores. We've driven strong sales growth in the Pringles business in the emerging markets over the last 3 years, and we've recently opened a new plant in Malaysia. In addition, we recently invested in a large biscuit manufacturer in Egypt and our joint venture in China continues to perform well. These are all initiatives designed to increase our rates of profitable sales growth and return us to our long-term model. It's early in the process, but we're seeing good sales growth in our international regions and we're confident that we'll achieve additional growth as we execute these programs. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ron."
283356,288004916,804100,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 shows the financial results for the first quarter. Reported net sales declined by 5%, primarily due to international currency devaluations.

Reported net sales declined by 5%, primarily due to international currency devaluations. Currency-neutral comparable net sales decreased slightly. We had good growth in all of our international regions and results improved in several developed businesses in North America. This quarter's improving trends were the result of new product introductions and brand-building initiatives in each of the regions and investments we've made with savings from Project K. 
Reported quarterly operating profit was $384 million and included a charge for the capitalized portion of our pension mark-to-market at year-end 2014 as well as Project K costs in the first quarter. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 1.9% in the quarter, better than our expectations. Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration cost, mark-to-market adjustments, Project K cost and other items that affect comparability, were $0.98 per share in the first quarter, again, ahead of our expectations. These results include $0.06 of currency headwind in the quarter, so currency-neutral comparable earnings increased by 3% to $1.04 per share, including a lower-than-planned tax rate resulting from some discrete items. 
So our results in the first quarter were ahead of our expectations and were in line with our guidance for the full year. 
Slide 8 shows the composition of the first quarter sales growth. Currency-neutral comparable revenues for the first quarter declined by 0.3%, reflecting an overall improvement in trends. Comparable volume decreased by 0.7% in the quarter. We saw volume growth across all our international regions, driven by both cereal and snacks, offset by results in our North America business. Price and mix increased by 0.4% and the impact of currency translation decreased sales growth by 4.7% in the quarter as many currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. 
Slide 9 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin for the first quarter. Quarterly gross margin remained unchanged at 37.9%, which is broadly in line with our expectations. Productivity improvements and savings from Project K's supply chain initiatives offset inflation in factory, distribution costs and investments in our food. As expected, commodity and packaging costs were net deflationary and we are currently approximately 85% covered. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10, which shows the currency-neutral comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions in the first quarter. North America's operating profit decreased by 8%. This was primarily driven by lower sales and investment in our U.S. sales force as well as reestablishing our Kashi business in California. Europe's operating profit increased by 13% in the first quarter, driven by the region's sales growth and net deflation in cost of goods sold, including savings from Project K. 
Operating profit increased by 5% in Latin America in the quarter. Strong sales growth included increases in volume and price actions to offset inflation. In addition, we invested in brand-building activities to support new product launches and drive market penetration. 
Operating profit decreased by 3% in the Asia Pacific region. While we had solid sales growth in the quarter, we are investing in capabilities and brand building for growth in our emerging and developing markets within the region. 
Slide 11 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Our results for cash flow were in line with our plan, and we continue to expect approximately $1 billion of cash flow for the full year, although currency has become more of a headwind to our outlook for both earnings and cash flow. 
Operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $12 million. This was driven primarily by the timing of an interest payment and an increase in cash costs in the first quarter associated with Project K. In fact, those 2 items and the impact from foreign currency translation accounted for much of the decline. 
Capital spending for the quarter was $83 million, and we are on track with investments for the year. Share repurchases in the first quarter were $285 million and we reduced our average share count by 1.4%. And dividends paid in the quarter were $174 million. So total cash returned to share owners was more than $450 million. 
Now if you'll turn to Slide 12, you'll see that our guidance for 2015 has not changed. As always, sales, operating profit and earnings per share guidance is currency-neutral comparable, excludes the items that affect comparability as detailed in our notes. As we told you last quarter, this guidance includes realistic assumptions regarding the competitive environment and the growth of our businesses in developed markets in 2015. 
We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We also continue to expect some net deflation and cost of goods sold and slight improvement in gross margin. We are approximately 85% covered for the year on commodity and packaging costs. And productivity savings should be between 3% and 4% of cost of goods sold, in line with our long-term goals. And in addition to this, we expect to see incremental savings from Project K. 
We expect that operating profit will be down between 2% and 4%. Remember, this includes a negative 3- to 4-point impact from the annual re-basing of incentive compensation costs. And we continue to expect that brand building will increase the rate faster than sales. 
We are also maintaining our guidance for currency-neutral comparable earnings per share of $3.74 to $3.82 or a range between flat and down 2%. The expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of last year's 53rd week and the impact of foreign currency translation. Our original expectations for the impact of currency translation was $0.15 per share, but we now estimate the impact could be as much as $0.24 per share. We still expect the tax rate to be between 27% and 28% and interest expense is expected to be between $215 million and $225 million. 
Cash flow after capital spending should be approximately $1 billion, which includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million for Project K. This also includes the incremental capital expenditure required by the project. So cash flow for the full year excluding Project K should be between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. We continue to expect that total capital spending will be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately 1 point of sales for incremental capital related to Project K. And we still expect that we will repurchase between $700 million and $750 million of shares during the year. 
Slide 13 shows our full year EPS walk. Remember that this outlook could be affected by any significant currency devaluations that occur during the year, such as in Venezuela. Cost associated with the integration of Pringles and the recent acquisition in Egypt are expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share, and we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, approximately 2/3 of which will come from cost of goods sold. As we mentioned last quarter, pretax P&L costs related to the project are estimated to be between $400 million and $450 million or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share for the year, approximately 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. 
And our current outlook for second quarter earnings per share is that they will account for approximately 1/4 of our estimate for the full year. Currency impact, we expect, in the second quarter is also approximately 1/4 of our estimate for the full year. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

And now let's turn to Slide 14 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. First of all, I'd like to welcome Craig Bahner to the role of President of Morning Foods.

First of all, I'd like to welcome Craig Bahner to the role of President of Morning Foods. Craig joins us most recently from Wendy's. Before that, he worked for a number of years at P&G, and we look forward to having him as an important part of the team. I'd also like to congratulate Paul Norman on being named President of Kellogg North America. I'm sure you will all agree that there's no one better than Paul for this role. 
Now onto the Morning Foods business, where comparable net sales declined by 2.9% in the quarter. This represents an improvement from the performance we saw last year. Category trends improved and Kellogg brands gained 30 basis points for cereal category share in the quarter. We saw a mid-single-digit increase in in-store displays and we activated strong commercial plans. In addition, our innovation launches performed well in the quarter. Raisin Bran Cranberry, Special K Protein and a Disney Frozen-themed cereal are all doing well, and we had approximately 44% share of innovation in the quarter. In addition, we have the Avengers-themed cereal and support coming in the second quarter. 
So overall, we were pleased with the results in the Morning Foods business in the first quarter. The team has done a great job, trends generally improved and we started to see the benefit where we have invested. As we discussed with you at the CAGNY conference, improvement will be a process, but we're encouraged by the results so far this year as there's gradual progress as we move through 2015 and into 2016. 
Let's turn to Slide 15 and our U.S. Snacks business. Comparable net sales declined by 1.1% in the first quarter. The decline in sales in the cracker category was led by the Special K Cracker Chips business. We have redesigned the food and the packaging, and the consumer communication begins in earnest in the second quarter. Velocity has improved, but we continue to be affected by prior distribution losses. 
Sales in the cookie business declined in the quarter due in part to the performance in our Right Bites 100-calorie packs. This was a result of trends in weight management foods. The majority of our 2015 cookie innovation launches at mid-year. 
Sales in the wholesome snack business also declined in the quarter, however, we saw a good performance from Rice Krispies Treats. Consumption of Special K bars declined due to distribution losses, but velocity improved and the new bars that we've introduced in December of last year were off to a good start. And we have more new products coming in the category. 
The Pringles brand posted flat net sales in Q1 against high single-digit comparisons last year due to the launch of Pringles Tortilla. So we continue to face some challenges in our U.S. Snacks business, but we've seen some success and we've already made changes, and we have some more to come. As I've said before, improvement will take some time and will be progressive. And we will be focusing our investment to drive improvement in 2015 and into 2016. 
Let's turn to Slide 16 and the U.S. Specialty segment. Net sales in the Specialty Channels business declined by 2.5% in the quarter. The primary cause of the decline was a distributor in the convenience channel that decreased levels of inventories significantly during the period. However, we did see strong underlying consumption. 
In the Convenience channel, we increased share in the cracker, wholesome snack, cookie and salty snack categories in the quarter. Consumption of Pringles grew at a single -- sorry, consumption of Pringles grew at a strong double-digit rate. The team expects full unit sales and operating profit growth in 2015, with the performance in the first quarter due primarily to the timing of sales. 
Slide 17 shows the performance of North America Other segment, which now includes the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. Net sales declined by 6.1% in the first quarter. We saw good consumption in the Frozen Foods business in the quarter, although net sales declined due in part to supply disruptions from last year's limited recall of our Morningstar Farms product. This was related to an industry-wide issue with a supplier of cumin. It is worth noting that we are back in supply now. Specifically, the Eggo franchise posted consumption growth, higher rates of penetration and share gains in the quarter. 
Now turning to the Kashi business. Net sales declined as velocities stabilized, although impacted by last year's distribution losses. We plan to rebuild distribution over time with new innovation. 
And finally, net sales for the Canadian business also declined in the first quarter. This was largely due to the timing and phasing of activity. 
Now let's turn to Slide 18 in our European business. Comparable net sales in the region increased by 1% in the quarter due to double-digit growth in the Pringles business and good growth in Northern Europe and Russia. 
Sales in the cereal business declined in the quarter due to timing of promotions and weakness in the Special K brand, although results were in line with our expectations. As is the case in many parts of the world, we have a lot planned for the Special K brand in the region in the next few months. We have newly renovated food going into the market in April and new packaging and support scheduled for the summer. 
We recently launched Muesli in Germany. We bought distribution in the first quarter and early results have been good. And the Coco Pops products that we launched recently in the U.K. is also off to a good start. 
As I mentioned, we saw double-digit net sales growth in Pringles in the quarter, which was driven by good promotions and new flavors. And we're launching Tortilla Pringles in the second quarter. 
So the European business had a good quarter, exceeding our expectations. We have a range of activity planned for both cereal and snack businesses for the remainder of the year, and we expect continued good results from the region as a result. 
Now I'll turn it over to Maria Fernanda for a discussion of our Latin American business."
283356,288004916,804100,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here today to talk about the great business we have in Latin America and to give you some insights as to why we're still optimistic regarding our potential.

I'm excited to be here today to talk about the great business we have in Latin America and to give you some insights as to why we're still optimistic regarding our potential. I'll begin with an overview of the region, then I'll share our operating model and strategy and I'll close with highlights of how we're bringing all the elements of the strategy together. 
So let's start with Slide 21 and some background about our region and the opportunities we have. As you can see, there is a large consumer base, 40% of whom are under the age of 20 and the population is urbanizing with the rising middle class. However, despite this dynamic environment, consumers in the region retain their traditions, their sense of community and family and their optimism. As you might imagine, this changing environment presents some challenges but also some great opportunities. 
Slide 22 shows the composition of Kellogg business in Latin America. Our business is largely in cereal, although we have a good core wholesome snacks business. And the acquisition of the Pringles brand gave us some meaningfully sized salty business as well. We have significant core business in Mexico, which, along with the rest of Latin America, performed well in the first quarter. And we also have growing businesses in attractive areas of the region and in growing categories and segments in those areas. 
Now let's turn to Slide 23 and one of our competitive advantages, our brand. Around the region, we have a stable of well-known global brands that consumers love. The consumer base in our region appreciate quality products, and Kellogg is one of the most trusted brands in Latin America. Consumer awareness of our brand is high and our products have some of the highest category and segment shares in the region. And the brands are expandable, as we've seen with our success in the wholesome snacks category. We've also targeted geographic expansion with Pringles and the recent introduction of our Kellogg's parent brand. 
Now let's turn to Slide 24. As you can see, we have more than 55% cereal category share across the region. Our wholesome snacks business holds approximately 24% share and is made up of snacks sold largely under our cereal brand names such as Special K, Zucaritas, All-Bran and now Kellogg's. 
And finally, you can see that our salty snacks business holds only a 1.3% share across the region, although net sales have grown significantly since the acquisition of Pringles. As a result, we see great potential across all of our categories. 
However, despite the great positioning, 3 years ago we identified some opportunity to expand the business even further. These opportunities were unleashing the potential of the region, growing in all segments of the cereal business and in high-growth areas of the region, expanding into high-frequency stores and better leveraging our supply chain. 
So now let's look at Slide 25 and a discussion regarding how we've addressed these opportunities. We implemented a new regional, multifunctional category organization and we reorganized our businesses into regional hubs, which provided increased scale and improved speed to market. We began developing our plan not only focused on our consumer but also on our shopper, who can oftentimes be different than the consumer, and the retail environment, in which these shoppers were shopping. And we elevated our engagement with our customers. We have focused on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. For example, we are delivering pan-regional innovation and commercial programs. We're better leveraging total commercial investments to win with shoppers where they shop. And we've moved from a manufacturing organization to a supply chain organization, focused on optimizing asset utilization and improving gross margin. 
As a result, we're executing Project K. We're reducing our cost structure and we're eliminating complexity in the portfolio and fueling our growth. And we will continue to drive underlying productivity and improved profitability. 
Also, we've made great progress in building a strong organization. These are all major undertakings, and the entire team in Latin America has done an amazing job implementing these changes to our structure while remaining focused on generating profitable sales growth. 
So how has all this played out in recent years? If you'll turn to Slide 26, you'll see some of the recent successes we've had as a result of the changes we've made to our operating model and strategy. The rate of net sales growth improved as we progressed through 2014, and year-on-year net sales grew at a double-digit rate in first quarter of 2015. And importantly, volume increased by more than 4% as a result of good innovation and strong end-market activity. And we're confident we'll see good rates of net sales growth across the remainder of the year. 
We've also seen the benefits of the work we've done in gross margin expansion in recent years. We focused on our large businesses and have achieved margin expansion in both the Mexican and the pan-regional cereal business. 
Now let's turn to Slide 27 and more detail regarding our strategy in the region. There are 5 interrelated parts: First, as I mentioned, we have a large and growing cereal business in the region, and continuing to drive category growth is one of our main priorities. We're also focused on the snack category and on driving increased consumption across the portfolio. 
Next, while our program of innovation and renovation has been successful, we can always improve. Speed to market is critical, and we've made good progress streamlining the process. 
We're also committed to winning where people shop and we're increasingly focused on high-frequency stores. This is the channel where between 50% and 70% of retail sales in the traditional food basket are made, where the majority of our shoppers shop and where affordable products are a requirement. 
We're executing Project K in the region. This means optimizing our supply chain network, developing a footprint that will serve our future growth and generating the flexibility to increase investment in the business. 
And finally, we're constantly striving to develop our people, improve their performance and provide them with exciting opportunities. We've taken big strides in this area and have what, I believe, is a world-class team dedicated to constant improvement. 
Now let me give you more detail on our investment in pan-regional innovation, how we're excelling at in-store execution and our work in high-frequency stores. Let's start with innovation on Slide 28. We've significantly increased the number of pan-regional introductions, which have increased the efficiency of our investment. We relaunched Choco Krispies in 2014, which drove an increase in volume and share in the Andean and Central American region. We restaged Special K as well and gained share in core countries of the region. And we also launched a full line of muesli, granola cereals and bars, branded with the Kellogg's brand. We've had some real success -- successes with pan-regional innovations so far, and we're really looking forward to continued progress. 
Now let's turn to Slide 29 and detail regarding the Pringles business in our region. We've increased net sales in U.S. dollars by more than 10% since the acquisition in 2012. Growth in local currencies was significantly greater. At the time we acquired Pringles, we saw Latin America as one of the areas with the most opportunity for expansion. As you can imagine, we're attacking this growth potential as quickly as possible by increasing distribution and driving significant innovation. Latin America has certainly been a success story for Pringles over the last 3 years and we expect continued strong growth in 2015 and beyond. 
Now turning to Slide 30. Our efforts on high-frequency stores have been focused in 3 areas: Optimizing our route-to-market to enhance our reach, principally in mom-and-pop stores; developing the right portfolio for this channel; and getting the right visibility in the stores. As you can see on the slide, we've developed a range of inexpensive smaller-serve products, which are available to our shoppers in high-frequency stores. There are 2 million high-frequency stores in the region and we have a goal of increasing our coverage of these by approximately 50% this year. Having said that, we do have continued opportunities to increase the coverage even further in future years. 
Slide 31 details the program designed to improve the visibility of Kellogg products in high-frequency stores, ensuring all our products are displayed, visible and accessible to our shoppers. The program includes an ideal store initiative, which leverages stores' real estate to promote the Kellogg brand and build engagement with shoppers and store owners. This program is a pan-regional initiative, and sales at these stores have increased at a double-digit rate and they've gained share. And our goal for 2015 is to have many more of these stores in place by the end of the year. 
And on Slide 32, you can see that we have more to come. We have more innovation, as I've mentioned, including Kellogg parent brand launches in various parts of the region. We're continuing to invest further in the expansion of high-frequency stores. And finally, we have significant commercial activations plans. You can see on the slide that we're proud sponsors of the Copa América soccer tournament going on this summer in Chile. We have full home-to-store support plan and expecting great results. 
So let's turn to Slide 33. I'm sure you'll agree we have an exciting opportunity for the years ahead. We've never been better positioned to grow given the dynamic categories where we participate with our leading brands, our renewed strategy and focused initiative, all with the objective of driving long-term profitable growth.

The Asia Pacific segment posted an increase in comparable net sales of 4% in the first quarter. We posted double-digit growth in Asia as a result of double-digit growth in India, Japan and South Korea. In India, we saw growth in our core brands and in new smaller-size packs designed to make our products more affordable. We have completed construction at our new plant in India and the facility has started production to service the increasing demand in the country. 
Sales declined in the Australian business due to weakness in the cereal and snack businesses. However, we are launching a range of innovation, including granola, muesli, gluten-free and on-the-go offerings. 
The Pringles business posted good sales growth, with results exceeding our expectations. We ran a Muesli promotion in Australia, southeast Asia and Taiwan, which drove sales at a double-digit rate during the activation period. 
So we had another quarter in this region, driven by strong growth in our Asian business. As you might imagine, we continue to expect growth from the region for 2015. 
Let's turn to the summary on Page 35. Our results for sales, operating profit and earnings per share were all ahead of our expectations in the first quarter. We saw sales growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. And we saw improving sales trends in our U.S. cereal business and our Kellogg brands gained share. 
The Project K initiative continues to go well. We are investing the savings in areas designed to drive profitable sales growth, and we're starting to see the results. 
Obviously, our investment program is a process and the benefits will build over time. Improvement in our results will also build and we know that there's no quick fix. However, we are very encouraged by some of the early signs of success we've already seen and by the plans we are making now for future periods. 
Now I'd like to end, as always, by thanking our employees around the world. It's all their hard work that's allowing us to build the foundation for growth in 2015 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll open up for questions."

On the Special K business, if you look at some of the softness in consumption we've had in our U.S. Snacks business, it does largely come down to Special K. But there's some good news in there. So if we look within wholesome snacks, Special K bars is the primary source of weakness within that category for us. We've come out with new Special K bars here at the beginning of the year. We've lost some distribution and some retailers, but where we've maintained the distribution the velocity is up strong, which would suggest that we've got good food that's delivering upon the promise of Special K.

I realize that Nielsen covers most of the business, but there are some large customers in meaningful channels that are not inside that data, as we're seeing some very good growth in those businesses. Secondly, a lot of what's happening is driven by the phasing of innovation year-on-year. So last, year innovation went out in the first quarter. This year, innovation for snacks is much more mid-year. And what's happening there is we'll see that innovation go in Q2. That'll give us more of a consumption drive and a little bit more of a shipment drive, too, as we fill the pipelines for that innovation. Last year, innovation went in, in the first quarter, which means it largely ships in Q4. And so we actually burned through inventory in Q1. We get good consumption coming from behind that innovation in Q1 last year. So a little bit of a timing issue within the year that's driving what you're seeing there. We do expect better results. I would caution on some of the April data because the shift of Easter can distort one week versus another. But we do expect to see improving consumption trends in our snacks business over time."

As we shared with you earlier in the presentation, we've made some pretty important structural changes to better address the growth opportunities in Latin America, and they're quite simple. First is high-frequency stores. Traditionally, we've had pantry-size boxes of cereal going through most of our direct accounts. 50% to 70% of all food sales go through HFS, as I mentioned earlier, only 20% of cereal sales, and for us, less than 20% of our snacks. So that is the biggest opportunity. To be able to drive volume growth, John, in HFS, we need to have the right size, the right pack at the right affordable price. And that's what we've now put in through the core of our cereal brands to address high-frequency stores. And as we ramp up Pringles, having Pringles also in affordable sizes for high-frequency stores is going to be absolutely critical."

And as we bring in new innovation mid-year, we expect to start to improve our distribution as we go forward. So mechanically, we're going to see a decline in Kashi this year. That's really loss of past distribution as opposed to a weakness in the underlying brand or food.

Results for earnings were in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Comparable sales were approximately flat to last year, and comparable earnings were $0.92 per share. The better perform",524,"Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Results for earnings were in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Comparable sales were approximately flat to last year, and comparable earnings were $0.92 per share. The better performance we saw in the U.S. Cereal business in the first quarter continued in the second quarter, and we again saw good performance across the international regions as well. The benefits we've seen from our initial investment in Project K have continued and we expect it to continue to build momentum in the second half of the year.
We are on track to meet our guidance for the full year. Specifically, we expect approximately flat currency-neutral comparable sales, a decline in currency-neutral comparable operating profit of between 2% and 4%, including a negative impact of 3 to 4 points from a basing of incentive compensation. And currency-neutral comparable earnings per share to be between flat and down 2%, also impacted by compensation.
Our performance in 2015 represents a significant improvement from 2014, and we believe that we are building a foundation for better results in the future. As a result, our improving momentum and increasing visibility into productivity programs are driving our confidence that we will achieve our long-term targets for sales and operating profit growth in 2016.
So with that in mind, I'd now like to talk about some of the things that give us that confidence. First, let's turn to Slide 4 a discussion of our momentum. Paul and the team have done a great job of improving the performance of our U.S. Cereal business this year. And while we definitely have more to do to improve category performance, we are confident that we're focusing our investment on the right drivers of sales growth to continue recent trends. We're improving our food, we've invested in our sales force and we're improving the effectiveness of our brand line.
In addition, as you've seen in recent quarters, our international businesses have been performing well. Europe has seen some better results in a difficult environment and growth has been good in Latin America and in Asia.
Secondly, our investment in Project K has helped to drive the improved momentum, has provide us with funds to invest in the Kashi organization, in a significant number of new sales reps in both our warehouse and DSD sales forces in the U.S. and in our coverage of high-frequency stores, largely in emerging markets. These investments have helped -- have already had an impact and will help to drive even better results next year.
Finally, we've made some significant structural changes to our business. Paul will bring his experience and knowledge to running the North American business. Also, we have recently hired Craig Banner to run our Morning Foods business, and we've also hired, who was most recently CMO at Kraft Foods to run our U.S. Snacks business. I believe that our management team is now the best we've had in years and represents the right mix of experience, industry professionals from outside the organization and challenges long-term Kellogg employees.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ron."

As you've likely seen, our reported results include a remeasurement of our Venezuelan business to the SIMADI rate of VEF 198 to the U.S. dollar. As well as a volatile market in our circumstances change in the second quarter, we experienced disruption in our business operations, driven by reduced access to U.S. dollars for inputs to support production. As a result, we remeasured our business accordingly. The financial impact to this remeasurement is disclosed in detail in the appendices for our presentation materials.
Reported net sales declined by 5.1% due to the devaluation of international currencies. Currency-neutral comparable net sales were essentially flat, in line with our guidance for the full year. We saw strong broad-based growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, and in addition, our U.S. Frozen Foods business grew as did our Canadian business.
Reported quarterly operating profit was $412 million and included Project K execution costs and the impacted remeasurement of the Venezuelan business. Quarterly currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 6.8%, in line with our expectations. The decline was due to timing of manufacturing costs and higher distribution costs as well as the impact of resetting incentive compensation.
Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments, Project K costs, $0.37 per share from the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business, and other items that affect comparability were $0.92 per share in the first quarter.  These results include $0.05 of currency headwind as a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $0.97 per share.
Slide 6 shows details regarding the second quarter sales growth. Comparable revenues for the quarter increased 0.1%, a slight improvement from the first quarter and included a 0.5% increase in price mix driven by our Latin America business. We saw good volume growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, driven by growth in cereal and several of our North American businesses grew volume as well. The slight decline of 0.4% is primarily due to cereal in developed markets, but as Paul will discuss later, we are seeing improving trends in U.S. Cereal. Currency is reported net sales by 5.5%, driven mostly by the euro to peso to Canadian dollar and the pound.
Slide 7 shows our year-to-date currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Year-to-date, gross margin was broadly in line with last year and with our guidance for the full year. While we have recognized lower material costs and we continue to generate strong productivity improvements across our supply chain, we are seeing higher inflation and distribution costs, and as I mentioned earlier, some timing on our manufacturing costs versus prior year.
In addition, we are investing in our food across the globe. Recall that we mentioned that some of the Project K-related savings would be invested in our food. This includes the renovation of Kashi and Special K as well as the launch of going and mueslis in a number of countries.
Slide 8 shows the quarterly currency-neutral comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's operating profit decreased by 13%. This was a result of sales declines, increased distribution costs, timing of cost in our factories and the resetting of incentive compensation levels. We do expect results to improve as we progress through the balance of the year.
Europe's operating profit increased by 6% in the quarter, driven by broad-based improvement in cost of goods sold, including Project K savings, and the timing of brand-building investments, which are weighted more to the second half of the year. Quarterly operating profit increased by 9% in Latin America as a result of strong sales growth. This quarter's growth included a significant increase in investment in brand building.
Operating profit increased by 76% in the Asia Pacific region since the result of double-digit sales growth in Asia and South Africa, lower cost of goods sold and comparisons to last year. In addition, the region saw some benefit due to the timing of brand building between the second quarter and the third quarter. The growth in operating profit also included continued investment in capabilities in the region.
Slide 9 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Year-to-date operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $323 million. Cash flow in the second quarter was $311 million, which represented an improvement of more than $50 million from the second quarter of last year. We saw good performance in our core working capital, as I'll discuss in a minute.
We continue to expect full year cash flow of approximately $1 billion. Our cash requirements for Project K are the highest in 2015, and this is impacting our year-to-date position. But we remain on track to meet our outlook for the year. And of course, returning cash to share owners remains a priority for us. In total, we returned more than $2 billion to share owners over the last 2 years through dividends and share repurchases.
Slide 10 shows our core working capital as a percentage of net sales. As you can see, our performance had flattened out over the past several years, but we've made a lot of progress improving our position recently and that best-in-class levels of working capital. We said that we would improve performance further to unlock cash flow after the acquisition of Pringles and to help us fund cash requirements for Project K, and our supplier financing initiatives has contributed significantly to this improvement.
Slide 11 details our currency-neutral comparable guidance for 2015, which has not changed. We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We now expect a relatively neutral balance between inflation and the combination of productivity improvements and Project K savings. We've seen slightly more cost come through our materials and distribution, but we have been able to manage the impact in our outlook. Our materials are more than 90% covered, and as a result, we expect the gross margin for the year to be flat to up slightly. We expect that operating profit will decline by between 2% and 4%. We also still expect the currency-neutral comparable earnings will be between $3.74 and $3.82 per share or in a range between flat and down 2%. Guidance for both operating profit and earnings per share include the impact of resetting incentive compensation.
The expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of last year's 53rd week, the impact of the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business and the impact of foreign currency translation. Our expectation for the impact of foreign currency translation is now approximately $0.29 a share, up from the $0.24 per share we expected last quarter. This includes our estimate that the currency headwind from translating future 2015 earnings for our Venezuela business at the SIMADI rate will be approximately $0.10 per share. This will offset some improvement we've seen in other currencies.
For tax rate, it's still expected to be between 27% and 28%, and interest expense is expected to be between $215 million and $225 million.
We continue to anticipate that cash flow after capital spending will be approximately $1 billion, as I mentioned. And this includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million for Project K, partially offset by benefits from our supplier financing initiative and other cash flow initiatives. Total capital spending should be in the range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately 1 point to sales for incremental capital associated with Project K. And our current plan is that we will repurchase between $700 million and $750 million of shares in 2015.
Slide 12 shows our full year earnings per share walk. Cost for the integration of Pringles and BiscoMisr in Egypt are still expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share. Project K's pretax P&L cost are anticipated to be between $400 million and $450 million or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share for the year, 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. And the impact of the remeasurement of Venezuela in addition to the translation impact of $0.10 per share is expected to be approximately $0.43 per share in total. A small amount of the remeasurement will impact our second half of the year.
Incremental savings from Project K are still expected to be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, and approximately 2/3 of this will come from cost of goods sold.
For the remainder of the year, we expect comparable earnings per share delivery, including the impact of foreign exchange, to be approximately evenly split across the next 2 quarters. Our foreign currency headwind is much greater in the third quarter as currencies had already begun to devalue in the fourth quarter of last year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul for a discussion of our North America business."

Let's first turn to the performance of the businesses within the North America segment. Let's start with the Morning Foods business. As you may have seen in public consumption data, the performance of the Cereal category has improved this year. Total consumption across all channels was approximately flat in the second quarter. And importantly, Kellogg-branded sales were essentially flat, too, with our 6 largest cereal brands collectively growing sales and share in the quarter. This performance was driven in part by the good performance of the Special K brand, one of our main areas of focus over the last year. I'll talk more about this and Morning Foods in a minute.
Moving on to U.S. Snacks. We saw mixed results in the second quarter with sales down 1.8%. Pringles grew nicely. Consumption trends in crackers and cookies improved, but we experienced continued weakness in wholesome snacks. In crackers, our cheesy brand grew sales and a 4-point of share in the quarter. In fact, excluding Special K Cracker Chips, our total cracker business grew sales and share.
On Special K Cracker Chips, velocities are improving. However, prior losses of distribution continued to weigh heavily on our year-over-year performance.
In cookies, consumption and share trends also improved in the quarter with our Fudge Shoppe Sandy's and Simply May brands all showing consumption growth. In both crackers and cookies, our innovation is weighted to the back half with new items such as Cheez It Extra Toasty, Town House for Kashi, Chips Deluxe Peanut Butter with M&Ms and Simply Made Sandwich Creams amongst the numerous launches coming to market now.
Whilst Pringles, crackers and cookies all showed positive signs in Q2, wholesome snacks continued to underperform. Rice Krispies Treats in our base Nutri-Grain foods performed quite well. However, distribution losses on prior innovation have impacted our business this year. We are committed to improving the performance of U.S. Snacks, and this will be an area of focus for me in coming months.
Moving onto the Specialty Channels business. Sales declined by approximately 1% in the second quarter, although our business improved as the quarter progressed. In the convenience channel, we saw share growth in 5 of the 7 categories in which we compete. Although we did see some weakness in Foodservice, partially due to the exit from some unprofitable business. We are confident that our Specialty Channels business will grow in the second half.
The final business is the North America Other segment. This is the combination of Frozen Foods, the Canadian and the Kashi businesses. Frozen Foods posted currency-neutral comparable net sales growth, driven by strong results from the Eggo brand. Eggo waffles saw momentum in consumption, increased share, increased base sales and gains in penetration and buy rate. In addition, Eggo handheld breakfast sandwiches continued to do really well in their first year.
And we also saw good sales growth in the Canadian business, as Cereal, Frozen food and Snacks all posted growth with sales of Pringles up at a high-teen rate. As expected, sales of the Kashi business declined in the second quarter, which led to a decline in total North America Other segment sales of about 1.3%. While sales were down, the trend improved as the team began to launch new products and reestablished distribution. I'll come back to Kashi in a minute.
And now, over the next few slides, I'd like to focus on the U.S. Cereal business and some of the progress we've made. Let's start with Slide 15. Over the past 9 months, we have made good progress on the agenda we set out. And I've seen a stabilization of our Kellogg's branded business. This is illustrated by our improving top line performance and Kellogg's branded share being up year-to-date.
Back at CAGNY, we spoke about 4 critical elements to returning Cereal to growth, as illustrated on the slide. These were: focusing on wellness; investing in our foods; engaging with consumers in new ways; and dialing up the fun and executing with impact.
Slide 16 focuses on the first of these, wellness in today's world. One of our biggest challenges has been to return the Special K brand to growth. We have moved the focus of the brand away from diet towards wellness. In the past few months, we have launched a new protein offering and introduced the gluten-free Special K. We have also launched tasty innovation, more berries to our largest variant, Special K Red Berries, and we have improved our Special K Food too. We've introduced new packaging and new communication to support all of this. I'm pleased to say we have seen steady improvement in performance over the past few months, as you can see on the slide. In fact, consumption increased by 2.4% in the latest public data. We also have more news to come in August with the launch of new Special K Apple Cinnamon Harvest.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. Our other challenge has been Kashi. Most of you have yet to see the kind of turnaround we've seen on Special K, we are seeing distribution losses subside and velocities begin to stabilize. The team is making good progress on renovation and innovation plans, and we expect to see the fruits of these efforts begin to come through in improving trends over the coming months and as we enter 2016. You can see on the slide some of the Kashi innovation we have launched recently or have coming soon, including overnight mueslis, granolas, gluten-free waffles, organic chewy granola see bars and sprouted grain and sweet potato sunshine organic cereals. As you know, we've made a significant investment in the Kashi team and organization and believe we -- we believe we have the right structure in place. The team is focused on delivering on-trend food to holistics and will leverage the Kellogg Company's infrastructure to the degree that it helps them achieve that objective.
Earlier in the year, I also mentioned the launch of Kellogg's Origins, which you can see pictured on Slide 18. This is a range of cereals, granolas and mueslis made with simple ingredients and designed to meet evolving consumer needs. The brand is now launched and early acceptance has been good.
The second critical element to returning Cereal to growth is investing more in our food. Our work on Kashi, Special K and Origins all demonstrate actions to invest more in our foods. You can see on Slide 19 that this year, we have also launched new and improved Froot Loops and Apple Jacks with lower sugar. And as we look forward, we will continue to renovate our core offerings to give consumers more of what they want in the way of nutritional benefits, such as protein, gluten-free choices and simpler ingredient lists. We know consumers are looking for foods with simpler ingredients and work is well underway to answer that call. Already in North America, 75% of our cereals are made without artificial colors, and more than half are made without artificial flavors. Further, we have been working to remove artificial colors and flavors across Kellogg's branded cereals and a variety of Kellogg's branded snack bars as well as Eggo Frozen Foods. Our goal is to complete this transition by the end of 2018.
The Cereal category is and always has been a repertoire category, offering health, taste and importantly, fun too. We believe getting this blend right is as important today as it has ever been. You can see on Slide 20 that keeping our category vibrant and on-trend also means bringing fun to life on pack and in-store in impactful ways. We have seen good results behind our Disney Frozen cereal this year and also strong end market performance behind our impact Avenger's promotion and event in April. Looking forward, we believe initiatives like these are just as important as what we do on the health and nutrition front to drive category engagement.
The final area I wanted to mention is in-store execution on Slide 21. With our dedicated sales force, including field sales reps back in place, we are seeing tangible improvements come through in the area of assortment gains, in-stock performance and merchandising behind the initiatives I outlined earlier.
So in summary, on Slide 22, whilst we still have plenty to do, we are pleased with the progress we're making on our Cereal business, behind better core brand performance, relevant innovation and renovation and better execution through the the purchase. In fact, sales are on trend to be flat to up in 2016, a great improvement.
Finally, I would like to thank the entire Morning fruits team, who have done an incredible job over the past year improving all parts of our plan.
With that, I'll turn you back to John."

Let's turn to Slide 23 in detail regarding our European business. The Pringles business in Europe had another great quarter and delivered mid-single-digit currency-neutral comparable sales growth on a difficult double-digit comparison last year. The business in the U.K. posted double-digit growth and share gains, partially as a result of increased distribution. In addition, the launch of Pringles Tortilla made an important contribution to sales although launched recently. We have a significant Pringles business in Germany as well. We saw high single-digit sales growth there as a result, distribution gains and increased commercial activity.
Consumption trends improved in the wholesome snacks business in the second quarter. We have restaged Special K bars in the region, which is helping the brand's performance. This and the renovation of some of our foods will continue to contribute, and we expect the wholesome snack business to return to growth by the end of the year.
Total comparable net sales in the region decreased by 2.5% in the quarter as the Cereal category continued to be a challenge. We restaged our Special K Cereals in July and other activity launching at the same time. In addition, we're introducing new Special K cereals on the in the second half. We've introduced mueslis in Germany and are expanding their interaction to other parts of the region.
Slide 24 shows some detail regarding our Latin America business. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales in the region increased by 14.5% in the second quarter, driven by growth in both Cereal and Snacks. Sales in the Cereal business were ahead of our expectations and included both volume growth and improvement in price mix. In addition, we gained category share across our key businesses, and we increased investment in brand building at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Specifically, we saw good growth in our portfolio of kid cereals and a benefit from the parent brand products we've launched this year.
Sales in the Snack business increased at a high single-digit rate, largely driven by new products and go-to-market programs. In addition, underlying consumption growth in Pringles was good, all of which led to increased year-to-date share gains in the Mexican, Brazilian and Colombian businesses.
As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, we executed the America software-related initiative in the second quarter and was a huge success. They're the highest customer engagement ever from a program at Latin America and has helped to drive the sales growth we saw in both Pringles and Cereal.
Also, as we discussed last quarter, we have started investing in high-frequency stores in the region. This initiative is relatively new but is already driving discussion gains and sales growth, and we see significant opportunity further gains as we expand our efforts. The team in Latin America has done a great job with new products, investing in growth and executing the plans. The results this quarter reflect all this effort.
Let's turn to Slide 25 in our Asia Pacific business. Currency-neutral comparable net sales in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa increased at a double-digit rate in the quarter due to broad-based growth. The Indian business also grew at a double-digit rate growth across brands some of our new packaging initiatives driving results. The business in Japan also grew at a double-digit rate due to continued popularity of granolas and strong growth from All-Bran. New advertising innovation helped drive sales of the Special K brand, up significantly in South Korea, and we also saw good growth in Southeast Asia. The Pringles business also posted strong net sales growth in the quarter, and consumption increased at a double-digit rate due to geographic expansion and the success of the music campaign, similar to the one we ran in Europe. Sales declined in the Australian business, which led to total quality sales growth for the region of 6.8%. While we expect the environment in Australia to remain challenging, we have plans for improvement, which include new product introductions, support with the nutritional benefits Africa and a focus on increasing distribution. The first half of the year has been strong for the Asia Pacific segment, and we expect the team will continue to execute well for the remainder of the year.
Let's turn to summary on Page 26. We are on track to meet our expectations for 2015. And importantly, this performance represent progress over 2014. As I mentioned earlier, we're building momentum. We are seeing improvement in our U.S. Cereal business, improvement in our European business and good growth in both the Latin American and Asian businesses. And we're confident that this improvement will continue into 2016. We've invested savings from Project K and have seen the benefits. This investment will continue to increase next year. We have a talented management team that will drive the results of the individual segments. We have a well-defined strategy that we are continuing to execute. And we're starting an aggressive 0-based budgeting program, which we expect will generate significant savings in addition to the savings in Project K. These 2 programs will allow us to invest in the business, while also driving improvement in operating margin. All of these gives us confidence that we will achieve our long-term targets for comparable sales and operating profit growth in 2016. We're planning an Investment Day in November, and we'll give you more details regarding our plans for next year.
With that, I'd like to end by thanking our employees around the world for all their hard work. Now I'll open up to questions."

So whether global category teams and rapidly transferring ideas around the world, the Kashi team and strong innovation pipeline we see coming from that business, investing back in in-store execution, feed on The Street in our U.S. Cereal business and the investments in our emerging market capabilities, such as high-frequency stores. Also, we have excellent productivity programs into 2016. We have additional savings from Project K. We have underlying continuous improvement programs and on top of that, we have 0-based budgeting initiatives.

We've innovated with on-trend food. We've reinvested in some of our core SKUs. We have migrated to positioning of the brand some from diet, and we've invested activated heavily. Kashi, we have a bit of a lag because we've had to do quite a lot of renovations to our foods, including GOLEAN, for example, which I'm pleased to say in Q3 '15 were now being launched project-certified. The rest of the portfolio will go that way in Q1 '16. So we've, more or less, got through the renovation phase of our work on Kashi. We also moved to put a team back in place in Kashi back in California. That team now is fully functional and in place. And we're beginning to see the benefits of the renovation and innovation work that they've been doing coming through. So I think you'll see Kashi trends improving in the back half of this year into the beginning of next year. We are seeing distribution losses, which were a big driver of those declines subside and velocity stabilizing. So I think the recipe or the ingredients are coming through together for Kashi to start to get back into growth as we finish this year and move into next year.

This is a manufacturer that was making food for our U.S. Snacks business. It was consolidated into our results over the past several years based on the accounting rules. In this quarter, the business sold itself to a third party and that triggered a change in our accounting. If you look at our 10-Q, it's been disclosed in the past, and you'll see a disclosed again obviously an impact. It's a onetime noncash item that we've excluded from our comparable results. Now if we move onto Venezuela, our situation did change in the second quarter in Venezuela. As I've mentioned in the past, we buy a small amount of inputs from outside of Venezuela to manufacture product in the country, and we typically get access to U.S. dollars to be able to do that. In the first quarter, we got access to those U.S. dollars. In the second quarter, we had no access to U.S. dollars. And in fact, the government has indicated that it is going to slow payments going forward. This created disruption to our business in the second quarter. So we reevaluated the matter, and we determined that the best rate for us to measure the business at was SIMADI rate of VEF 198 to the U.S. dollar. But we still remain a priority industry within Venezuela. We do expect to continue to manufacture and to conserve our consumers. We have a good business there, and we have a great team that's managing in a very difficult environment."

Results for earnings were in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Comparable sales were approximately flat to last year, and comparable earnings were $0.92 per share. The better perform",525,"Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Results for earnings were in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Comparable sales were approximately flat to last year, and comparable earnings were $0.92 per share. The better performance we saw in the U.S. Cereal business in the first quarter continued in the second quarter, and we again saw good performance across the international regions as well. The benefits we've seen from our initial investment in Project K have continued, and we expect it to continue to build momentum in the second half of the year.
We are on track to meet our guidance for the full year. Specifically, we expect approximately flat currency-neutral comparable sales; a decline in currency-neutral comparable operating profit of between 2% and 4%, including a negative impact of 3 to 4 points from rebasing of incentive compensation; and currency-neutral comparable earnings per share to be between flat and down 2%, also impacted by compensation.
Our performance in 2015 represents a significant improvement from 2014, and we believe that we are building a foundation for better results in the future. As a result, our improving momentum and increasing visibility into productivity programs are driving our confidence that we will achieve our long-term targets for sales and operating profit growth in 2016.
So with that in mind, I'd now like to talk about some of the things that give us that confidence. First, let's turn to Slide 4 and a discussion of our momentum. Paul and the team have done a great job of improving the performance of our U.S. Cereal business this year. And while we definitely have more to do to improve category performance, we are confident that we're focusing our investment on the right drivers of sales growth to continue recent trends. We're improving our food. We've invested in our sales force, and we're improving the effectiveness of our brand line.
In addition, as you've seen in recent quarters, our international businesses have been performing well. Europe has seen some better results in a difficult environment, and growth has been good in Latin America and in Asia.
Secondly, our investment in Project K has helped to drive the improved momentum. It has provided us with funds to invest in the Kashi organization, in a significant number of new sales reps in both our warehouse and DSD sales forces in the U.S. and in our coverage of high-frequency stores, largely in emerging markets. These investments have helped -- have already had an impact and will help to drive even better results next year.
Finally, we've made some significant structural changes to our business. Paul will bring his experience and knowledge to running the North American business. Also, we have recently hired Craig Bahner to run our Morning Foods business, and we've also hired Deanie Elsner, who was most recently CMO at Kraft Foods, to run our U.S. Snacks business. I believe that our management team is now the best we've had in years and represents the right mix of experience, industry professionals from outside the organization and talented long-term Kellogg employees.
With that, I'd turn it over to Ron."

Slide 5 shows the financial results for the second quarter. As you've likely seen, our reported results include a remeasurement of our Venezuelan business to the SIMADI rate of VEF 198 to the U.S. dollar as well as a volatile market, and our circumstances changed in the second quarter. We experienced disruption in our business operations, driven by reduced access to U.S. dollars for inputs to support production. As a result, we remeasured our business accordingly. The financial impact to this remeasurement is disclosed in detail in the appendices to our presentation materials.
Reported net sales declined by 5.1% due to the devaluation of international currencies. Currency-neutral comparable net sales were essentially flat, in line with our guidance for the full year. We saw strong broad-based growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, and in addition, our U.S. Frozen Foods business grew as did our Canadian business. Reported quarterly operating profit was $412 million and included Project K execution costs and the impact of the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business. 
Quarterly currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 6.8%, in line with our expectations. The decline was due to timing of manufacturing costs and higher distribution costs as well as the impact of resetting incentive compensation.
Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments, Project K costs, $0.37 per share from the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business and other items that affect comparability, were $0.92 per share in the first quarter. These results include $0.05 of currency headwind. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $0.97 per share.
Slide 6 shows details regarding the second quarter sales growth. Comparable revenues for the quarter increased 0.1%, a slight improvement from the first quarter and included a 0.5% increase in price/mix driven by our Latin America business. We saw good volume growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, driven by growth in cereal, and several of our North American businesses grew volume as well. The slight decline of 0.4% is primarily due to cereal in developed markets, but as Paul will discuss later, we are seeing improving trends in U.S. Cereal. Currency has lowered reported net sales by 5.5%, driven mostly by the euro, the peso, the Canadian dollar and the pound.
Slide 7 shows our year-to-date currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Year-to-date, gross margin was broadly in line with last year and with our guidance for the full year. While we have recognized lower material costs and we continue to generate strong productivity improvements across our supply chain, we are seeing higher inflation and distribution costs and, as I mentioned earlier, some timing on our manufacturing costs versus prior year.
In addition, we are investing in our food across the globe. Recall that we mentioned that some of the Project K-related savings would be invested in our food. This includes the renovation of Kashi and Special K as well as the launch of granolas and mueslis in a number of countries.
Slide 8 shows the quarterly currency-neutral comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's operating profit decreased by 13%. This was a result of sales declines, increased distribution costs, the timing of cost in our factories and the resetting of incentive compensation levels. We do expect results to improve as we progress through the balance of the year.
Europe's operating profit increased by 6% in the quarter, driven by broad-based improvement in cost of goods sold, including Project K savings, and the timing of brand-building investments, which are weighted more to the second half of the year. 
Quarterly operating profit increased by 9% in Latin America as a result of strong sales growth. This quarter's growth included a significant increase in investment in brand building.
Operating profit increased by 76% in the Asia Pacific region. This is the result of double-digit sales growth in Asia and South Africa, lower cost of goods sold and comparisons to last year. In addition, the region saw some benefit due to the timing of brand building between the second quarter and the third quarter. The growth in operating profit also included continued investment in capabilities in the region.
Slide 9 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Year-to-date operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $323 million. Cash flow in the second quarter was $311 million, which represented an improvement of more than $50 million from the second quarter of last year. We saw good performance in our core working capital, as I'll discuss in a minute.
We continue to expect full year cash flow of approximately $1 billion. Our cash requirements for Project K are the highest in 2015, and this is impacting our year-to-date position, but we remain on track to meet our outlook for the year. And of course, returning cash to share owners remains a priority for us. In total, we returned more than $2 billion to share owners over the last 2 years through dividends and share repurchases.
Slide 10 shows our core working capital as a percentage of net sales. As you can see, our performance had flattened out over the past several years, but we've made a lot of progress improving our position recently and have best-in-class levels of working capital. We said that we would improve performance further to unlock cash flow after the acquisition of Pringles and to help us fund cash requirements for Project K, and our supplier-financing initiative has contributed significantly to this improvement.
Slide 11 details our currency-neutral comparable guidance for 2015, which has not changed. We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We now expect a relatively neutral balance between inflation and the combination of productivity improvements and Project K savings. We've seen slightly more cost come through our materials and distribution, but we have been able to manage the impact in our outlook. Our materials are more than 90% covered, and as a result, we expect gross margin for the year to be flat to up slightly. We expect that operating profit will decline by between 2% and 4%. We also still expect the currency-neutral comparable earnings will be between $3.74 and $3.82 per share or in a range between flat and down 2%. Guidance for both operating profit and earnings per share include the impact of resetting incentive compensation.
The expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of last year's 53rd week, the impact of the remeasurement to the Venezuelan business and the impact of currency translation. Our expectation for the impact of foreign currency translation is now approximately $0.29 a share, up from the $0.24 per share we expected last quarter. This includes our estimate that the currency headwind from translating future 2015 earnings for our Venezuela business at the SIMADI rate will be approximately $0.10 per share. This will offset some improvement we've seen in other currencies.
Our tax rate is still expected to be between 27% and 28%, and interest expense is expected to be between $215 million and $225 million.
We continue to anticipate that cash flow after capital spending will be approximately $1 billion, as I mentioned. And this includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million for Project K, partially offset by benefits from our supplier-financing initiative and other cash flow initiatives. Total capital spending should be in the range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately 1 point to sales for incremental capital associated with Project K. And our current plan is that we will repurchase between $700 million and $750 million of shares in 2015.
Slide 12 shows our full year earnings per share walk. Cost for the integration of Pringles and Bisco Misr in Egypt are still expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share. Project K pretax P&L costs are anticipated to be between $400 million and $450 million or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share for the year, 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. And the impact of the remeasurement of Venezuela, in addition to the translation impact of $0.10 per share, is expected to be approximately $0.43 per share in total. A small amount of the remeasurement will impact our second half of the year.
Incremental savings from Project K are still expected to be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, and approximately 2/3 of this will come from cost of goods sold.
For the remainder of the year, we expect comparable earnings per share delivery, including the impact of foreign exchange, to be approximately evenly split across the next 2 quarters. Our foreign currency headwind is much greater in the third quarter as currencies had already begun to devalue in the fourth quarter of last year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul for a discussion of our North America business."

Let's first turn to the performance of the businesses within the North America segment. Let's start with the Morning Foods business. As you may have seen in public consumption data, the performance of the cereal category has improved this year. Total consumption across all channels was approximately flat in the second quarter. And importantly, Kellogg branded sales were essentially flat, too, with our 6 largest cereal brands collectively growing sales and share in the quarter. This performance was driven in part by the good performance of the Special K brand, one of our main areas of focus over the last year. I'll talk more about this and Morning Foods in a minute.
Moving on to U.S. Snacks. We saw mixed results in the second quarter, with sales down 1.8%. Pringles grew nicely. Consumption trends in crackers and cookies improved, but we experienced continued weakness in wholesome snacks. In crackers, our Cheez-It brand grew sales and a full point of share in the quarter. In fact, excluding Special K Cracker Chips, our total cracker business grew sales and share. On Special K Cracker Chips, velocities are improving. However, prior losses of distribution continued to weigh heavily on our year-over-year performance.
In cookies, consumption and share trends also improved in the quarter, with our Fudge Shoppe, Sandies and Simply Made brands all showing consumption growth. In both crackers and cookies, our innovation is weighted to the back half, with new items such as Cheez-It Extra Toasty, Town House Focaccia, Chips Deluxe Peanut Butter with M&Ms and Simply Made Sandwich Creams amongst the numerous launches coming to market now.
Whilst Pringles, crackers and cookies all showed positive signs in Q2, wholesome snacks continued to underperform. Rice Krispies Treats and our basic Nutri-Grain foods performed quite well. However, distribution losses on prior innovation have impacted our business this year. We are committed to improving the performance of U.S. Snacks, and this will be an area of focus for me in coming months.
Moving on to the Specialty Channels business. Sales declined by approximately 1% in the second quarter, although our business improved as the quarter progressed. In the Convenience channel, we saw share growth in 5 of the 7 categories in which we compete. Although we did see some weakness in Foodservice partially due to the exit from some unprofitable business, we are confident that our Specialty Channels business will grow in the second half.
The final business is the North America Other segment. This is the combination of Frozen Foods, the Canadian and the Kashi businesses. Frozen Foods posted currency-neutral comparable net sales growth, driven by strong results from the Eggo brand. Eggo Waffles saw momentum in consumption, increased share, increased base sales and gains in penetration and buy rate. In addition, Eggo handheld breakfast sandwiches continue to do really well in their first year.
And we also saw good sales growth in the Canadian business, as cereal, frozen food and snacks all posted growth, with sales of Pringles up at a high-teen rate. As expected, sales of the Kashi business declined in the second quarter, which led to a decline in total North America Other segment sales of about 1.3%. While sales were down, the trend improved as the team began to launch new products and reestablished distribution. I'll come back to Kashi in a minute.
And now over the next few slides, I'd like to focus on the U.S. Cereal business and some of the progress we've made. Let's start with Slide 15. Over the past 9 months, we have made good progress on the agenda we set out, and I've seen a stabilization of our Kellogg's branded business. This is illustrated by our improving top line performance and Kellogg's branded share being up year-to-date.
Back at CAGNY, we spoke about 4 critical elements to returning cereal to growth, as illustrated on the slide. These were focusing on wellness, investing in our foods, engaging with consumers in new ways and dialing up the fun and executing with impact.
Slide 16 focuses on the first of these, wellness in today's world. One of our biggest challenges has been to return the Special K brand to growth. We have moved the focus of the brand away from diet towards wellness. In the past few months, we have launched a new protein offering and introduced the gluten-free Special K. We have also launched tasty innovation by adding more berries to our largest variant, Special K Red Berries, and we have improved our Special K Vanilla Almond food, too. We've introduced new packaging and new communication to support all of this. I'm pleased to say we have seen steady improvement in performance over the past few months, as you can see on the slide. In fact, consumption increased by 2.4% in the latest public data. We also have more news to come in August with the launch of new Special K Apple Cinnamon Harvest.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. Our other challenge has been Kashi. Whilst we have yet to see the kind of turnaround we have seen on Special K, we are seeing distribution losses subside and velocities begin to stabilize. The team is making good progress on renovation and innovation plans, and we expect to see the fruits of these efforts begin to come through in improving trends over the coming months and as we enter 2016. You can see on the slide some of the Kashi innovation we have launched recently or have coming soon, including overnight mueslis, granolas, gluten-free waffles, organic chewy granola and seed bars and Sprouted Grain and Sweet Potato Sunshine Organic Promise cereals. As you know, we've made a significant investment in the Kashi team and organization and believe we -- we believe we have the right structure in place. The team is focused on delivering on-trend food to holistics and will leverage the Kellogg Company's infrastructure to the degree that it helps them achieve that objective.
Earlier in the year, I also mentioned the launch of Kellogg's Origins, which you can see pictured on Slide 18. This is a range of cereals, granolas and mueslis made with simple ingredients and designed to meet evolving consumer needs. The brand is now launched, and early acceptance has been good.
The second critical element to returning cereal to growth is investing more in our food. Our work on Kashi, Special K and Origins all demonstrate actions to invest more in our foods. You can see on Slide 19 that this year, we have also launched new and improved Froot Loops and Apple Jacks with lower sugar. And as we look forward, we will continue to renovate our core offerings to give consumers more of what they want in the way of nutritional benefits, such as protein, gluten-free choices and simpler ingredient lists. We know consumers are looking for foods with simpler ingredients, and work is well underway to answer that call. Already in North America, 75% of our cereals are made without artificial colors, and more than half are made without artificial flavors. Further, we have been working to remove artificial colors and flavors across Kellogg's branded cereals and a variety of Kellogg's branded snack bars as well as Eggo frozen foods. Our goal is to complete this transition by the end of 2018.
The cereal category is and always has been a repertoire category, offering health, taste and importantly, fun, too. We believe getting this blend right is as important today as it has ever been. You can see on Slide 20 that keeping our category vibrant and on-trend also means bringing fun to life on pack and in-store in impactful ways. We have seen good results behind our Disney Frozen Cereal this year and also strong end market performance behind our in-pack Avengers promotion and event in April. Looking forward, we believe initiatives like these are just as important as what we do on the health and nutrition front to drive category engagement.
The final area I wanted to mention is in-store execution on Slide 21. With our dedicated sales force, including field sales reps, back in place, we are seeing tangible improvements come through in the area of assortment gains, in-stock performance and merchandising behind the initiatives I outlined earlier.
So in summary, on Slide 22, whilst we still have plenty to do, we are pleased with the progress we're making on our cereal business, behind better core brand performance, relevant innovation and renovation and better execution through the Path to Purchase. In fact, sales are on trend to be flat to up in 2016, a great improvement.
Finally, I would like to thank the entire Morning Foods team, who have done an incredible job over the past year improving all parts of our plan.
With that, I'll turn you back to John."

And now let's turn to Slide 23 in detail regarding our European business.

And now let's turn to Slide 23 in detail regarding our European business. The Pringles business in Europe had another great quarter and delivered mid-single-digit currency-neutral comparable sales growth on a difficult double-digit comparison last year. The business in the U.K. posted double-digit growth and share gains, partially as a result of increased distribution. In addition, the launch of Pringles Tortilla made an important contribution to sales although only launched recently. We have a significant Pringles business in Germany as well. We saw high single-digit sales growth there as a result of distribution gains and increased commercial activity.
Consumption trends improved in the wholesome snacks business in the second quarter. We have restaged Special K bars in the region, which is helping the brand's performance. This and the renovation of some of our foods will continue to contribute, and we expect the wholesome snack business to return to growth by the end of the year.
Total comparable net sales in the region decreased by 2.5% in the quarter as the cereal category continued to be a challenge. We restaged our Special K cereals in July and had other activity launching at the same time. In addition, we're introducing new Special K cereals on the continent in the second half. We've introduced mueslis in Germany and are expanding their introduction to other parts of the region.
Slide 24 shows some detail regarding our Latin American business. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales in the region increased by 14.5% in the second quarter, driven by growth in both cereal and snacks. Sales in the cereal business were ahead of our expectations and included both volume growth and improvement in price/mix. In addition, we gained category share across our key businesses, and we increased investment in brand building at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Specifically, we saw good growth in our portfolio of kids cereals and a benefit from the parent brand products we've launched this year.
Sales in the snack business increased at a high single-digit rate, largely driven by new products and go-to-market programs. In addition, underlying consumption growth in Pringles was good, all of which led to increased year-to-date share gains in the Mexican, Brazilian and Colombian businesses.
As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, we executed the Copa América soccer-related initiative in the second quarter and was a huge success. They're the highest customer engagement ever from a program at Latin America and has helped to drive the sales growth we saw in both Pringles and cereal.
Also, as we discussed last quarter, we've started investing in high-frequency stores in the region. This initiative is relatively new but is already driving distribution gains and sales growth, and we see significant opportunity to further gains as we expand our efforts. The team in Latin America has done a great job with new products, investing in growth and executing the plans. The results this quarter reflect all this effort.
Let's turn to Slide 25 and our Asia Pacific business. Currency-neutral comparable net sales in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa increased at a double-digit rate in the quarter due to broad-based growth. The Indian business also grew at a double-digit rate, with [indiscernible] brands and some of our new packaging initiatives driving results. The business in Japan also grew at a double-digit rate due to continued popularity of granolas and strong growth from All-Bran. New advertising innovation helped drive sales of the Special K brand, up significantly in South Korea, and we also saw good growth in Southeast Asia. The Pringles business also posted strong net sales growth in the quarter, and consumption increased at a double-digit rate due to geographic expansion and the success of a music campaign, similar to the one we run in Europe. Sales declined in the Australian business, which led to total quarterly sales growth for the region of 6.8%. While we expect the environment in Australia to remain challenging, we have plans for improvement, which include new product introductions, support which stresses the nutritional benefits of our food and a focus on increasing distribution. The first half of the year has been strong for the Asia Pacific segment, and we expect the team will continue to execute well for the remainder of the year.
Let's turn to the summary on Page 26. We are on track to meet our expectations for 2015. And importantly, this performance represent progress over 2014. As I mentioned earlier, we're building momentum. We're seeing improvement in our U.S. Cereal business, improvement in our European business and good growth in both the Latin American and Asian businesses, and we're confident that this improvement will continue into 2016. We've invested savings from Project K and have seen the benefits. This investment will continue to increase next year. We have a talented management team that will drive the results of the individual segments. We have a well-defined strategy that we are continuing to execute. And we're starting an aggressive 0-based budgeting program, which we expect will generate significant savings in addition to the savings flowing from Project K. These 2 programs will allow us to invest in the business while also driving improvement in operating margin. All of these gives us confidence that we will achieve our long-term targets for comparable sales and operating profit growth in 2016. We're planning an Investment Day in November, and we'll give you more detail then regarding our plans for next year.
With that, I'd like to end by thanking our employees around the world for all their hard work. Now I'll open up to questions."

However, we're lapping some pretty significant distribution losses. So the biggest issue there is recapturing lost distribution to be able to get that part of the business back on trend. As you go towards wholesome, we have -- we did do some renovation on our core bars earlier in the year, and they are holding steady. We're just launching, as we speak, Special K chewy nut bars, which is a step-change in food.

So we know that consumers want nothing more than more goodies in their food when it comes to red berries, and giving them more of what they want, we're seeing them buy more from the shelf, importantly. So I think the underlying trends are positive. That's why I feel positive about the future. This isn't share rental or overly pushing the business. This is good consumer demand coming through."

Results for earnings were in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Comparable sales were approximately flat to last year, and comparable earnings were $0.92 per share. The better perform",528,"Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Results for earnings were in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Comparable sales were approximately flat to last year, and comparable earnings were $0.92 per share. The better performance we saw in the U.S. Cereal business in the first quarter continued in the second quarter, and we again saw good performance across the international regions as well. The benefits we've seen from our initial investment in Project K have continued, and we expect it to continue to build momentum in the second half of the year.
We are on track to meet our guidance for the full year. Specifically, we expect approximately flat currency-neutral comparable sales; a decline in currency-neutral comparable operating profit of between 2% and 4%, including a negative impact of 3 to 4 points from rebasing of incentive compensation; and currency-neutral comparable earnings per share to be between flat and down 2%, also impacted by compensation.
Our performance in 2015 represents a significant improvement from 2014, and we believe that we are building a foundation for better results in the future. As a result, our improving momentum and increasing visibility into productivity programs are driving our confidence that we will achieve our long-term targets for sales and operating profit growth in 2016.
So with that in mind, I'd now like to talk about some of the things that give us that confidence. First, let's turn to Slide 4 and a discussion of our momentum. Paul and the team have done a great job of improving the performance of our U.S. Cereal business this year. And while we definitely have more to do to improve category performance, we are confident that we're focusing our investment on the right drivers of sales growth to continue recent trends. We're improving our food. We've invested in our sales force, and we're improving the effectiveness of our brand line.
In addition, as you've seen in recent quarters, our international businesses have been performing well. Europe has seen some better results in a difficult environment, and growth has been good in Latin America and in Asia.
Secondly, our investment in Project K has helped to drive the improved momentum. It has provided us with the funds to invest in the Kashi organization, in a significant number of new sales reps in both our warehouse and DSD sales forces in the U.S. and in our coverage of high-frequency stores, largely in emerging markets. These investments have helped -- have already had an impact and will help to drive even better results next year.
Finally, we've made some significant structural changes to our business. Paul will bring his experience and knowledge to running the North American business. Also, we have recently hired Craig Bahner to run our Morning Foods business, and we've also hired Deanie Elsner, who was most recently CMO at Kraft Foods, to run our U.S. Snacks business. I believe that our management team is now the best we've had in years and represents the right mix of experience, industry professionals from outside the organization and talented long-term Kellogg employees.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ron."

As you've likely seen, our reported results include a remeasurement of our Venezuelan business to the SIMADI rate of VEF 198 to the U.S. dollar as well as a volati",1478,"Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 5 shows the financial results for the second quarter. As you've likely seen, our reported results include a remeasurement of our Venezuelan business to the SIMADI rate of VEF 198 to the U.S. dollar as well as a volatile market, and our circumstances changed in the second quarter. We experienced disruption in our business operations, driven by reduced access to U.S. dollars for inputs to support production. As a result, we remeasured our business accordingly. The financial impact of this remeasurement is disclosed in detail in the appendices to our presentation materials.
Reported net sales declined by 5.1% due to the devaluation of international currencies. Currency-neutral comparable net sales were essentially flat, in line with our guidance for the full year. We saw strong broad-based growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, and in addition, our U.S. Frozen Foods business grew as did our Canadian business. Reported quarterly operating profit was $412 million and included Project K execution costs and the impact of the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business. 
Quarterly currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 6.8%, in line with our expectations. The decline was due to timing of manufacturing costs and higher distribution costs as well as the impact of resetting incentive compensation.
Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments, Project K costs, $0.37 per share from the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business and other items that affect comparability, were $0.92 per share in the first quarter. These results include $0.05 of currency headwind. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $0.97 per share.
Slide 6 shows details regarding the second quarter sales growth. Comparable revenues for the quarter increased 0.1%, a slight improvement from the first quarter and included a 0.5% increase in price/mix driven by our Latin America business. We saw good volume growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, driven by growth in cereal, and several of our North American businesses grew volume as well. The slight decline of 0.4% is primarily due to cereal in developed markets, but as Paul will discuss later, we are seeing improving trends in U.S. Cereal. Currency has lowered reported net sales by 5.5%, driven mostly by the euro, the peso, the Canadian dollar and the pound.
Slide 7 shows our year-to-date currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Year-to-date, gross margin was broadly in line with last year and with our guidance for the full year. While we have recognized lower material costs and we continue to generate strong productivity improvements across our supply chain, we are seeing higher inflation and distribution costs and, as I mentioned earlier, some timing on our manufacturing costs versus prior year.
In addition, we are investing in our food across the globe. Recall that we mentioned that some of the Project K-related savings would be invested in our food. This includes the renovation of Kashi and Special K as well as the launch of granolas and mueslis in a number of countries.
Slide 8 shows the quarterly currency-neutral comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's operating profit decreased by 13%. This was a result of sales declines, increased distribution costs, the timing of cost in our factories and the resetting of incentive compensation levels. We do expect results to improve as we progress through the balance of the year.
Europe's operating profit increased by 6% in the quarter, driven by broad-based improvement in cost of goods sold, including Project K savings, and the timing of brand-building investments, which are weighted more to the second half of the year. 
Quarterly operating profit increased by 9% in Latin America as a result of strong sales growth. This quarter's growth included a significant increase in investment in brand building.
Operating profit increased by 76% in the Asia Pacific region. This is the result of double-digit sales growth in Asia and South Africa, lower cost of goods sold and comparisons to last year. In addition, the region saw some benefit due to the timing of brand building between the second quarter and the third quarter. The growth in operating profit also included continued investment in capabilities in the region.
Slide 9 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Year-to-date operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $323 million. Cash flow in the second quarter was $311 million, which represented an improvement of more than $50 million from the second quarter of last year. We saw good performance in our core working capital, as I'll discuss in a minute.
We continue to expect full year cash flow of approximately $1 billion. Our cash requirements for Project K are the highest in 2015, and this is impacting our year-to-date position, but we remain on track to meet our outlook for the year. And of course, returning cash to share owners remains a priority for us. In total, we returned more than $2 billion to share owners over the last 2 years through dividends and share repurchases.
Slide 10 shows our core working capital as a percentage of net sales. As you can see, our performance had flattened out over the past several years, but we've made a lot of progress improving our position recently and have best-in-class levels of working capital. We said that we would improve performance further to unlock cash flow after the acquisition of Pringles and to help us fund cash requirements for Project K, and our supplier-financing initiative has contributed significantly to this improvement.
Slide 11 details our currency-neutral comparable guidance for 2015, which has not changed. We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We now expect a relatively neutral balance between inflation and the combination of productivity improvements and Project K savings. We've seen slightly more cost come through our materials and distribution, but we have been able to manage the impact in our outlook. Our materials are more than 90% covered, and as a result, we expect gross margin for the year to be flat to up slightly. We expect that operating profit will decline by between 2% and 4%. We also still expect the currency-neutral comparable earnings will be between $3.74 and $3.82 per share or in a range between flat and down 2%. Guidance for both operating profit and earnings per share include the impact of resetting incentive compensation.
The expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of last year's 53rd week, the impact of the remeasurement to the Venezuelan business and the impact of currency translation. Our expectation for the impact of foreign currency translation is now approximately $0.29 a share, up from the $0.24 per share we expected last quarter. This includes our estimate that the currency headwind from translating future 2015 earnings for our Venezuela business at the SIMADI rate will be approximately $0.10 per share. This will offset some improvement we've seen in other currencies.
Our tax rate is still expected to be between 27% and 28%, and interest expense is expected to be between $215 million and $225 million.
We continue to anticipate that cash flow after capital spending will be approximately $1 billion, as I mentioned. And this includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million for Project K, partially offset by benefits from our supplier-financing initiative and other cash flow initiatives. Total capital spending should be in the range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately 1 point to sales for incremental capital associated with Project K. And our current plan is that we will repurchase between $700 million and $750 million of shares in 2015.
Slide 12 shows our full year earnings per share walk. Cost for the integration of Pringles and Bisco Misr in Egypt are still expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share. Project K's pretax P&L costs are anticipated to be between $400 million and $450 million or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share for the year, 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. And the impact of the remeasurement of Venezuela, in addition to the translation impact of $0.10 per share, is expected to be approximately $0.43 per share in total. A small amount of the remeasurement will impact our second half of the year.
Incremental savings from Project K are still expected to be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, and approximately 2/3 of this will come from cost of goods sold.
For the remainder of the year, we expect comparable earnings per share delivery, including the impact of foreign exchange, to be approximately evenly split across the next 2 quarters. Our foreign currency headwind is much greater in the third quarter as currencies had already begun to devalue in the fourth quarter of last year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul for a discussion of our North America business."

Let's first turn to the performance of the businesses within the North America segment. Let's start with the Morning Foods business. As you may have seen in public consumption data, the performance of the cereal category has improved this year. Total consumption across all channels was approximately flat in the second quarter. And importantly, Kellogg branded sales were essentially flat, too, with our 6 largest cereal brands collectively growing sales and share in the quarter. This performance was driven in part by the good performance of the Special K brand, one of our main areas of focus over the last year. I'll talk more about this and Morning Foods in a minute.
Moving on to U.S. Snacks. We saw mixed results in the second quarter, with sales down 1.8%. Pringles grew nicely. Consumption trends in crackers and cookies improved, but we experienced continued weakness in wholesome snacks. In crackers, our Cheez-It brand grew sales and a full point of share in the quarter. In fact, excluding Special K Cracker Chips, our total cracker business grew sales and share. On Special K Cracker Chips, velocities are improving. However, prior losses of distribution continued to weigh heavily on our year-over-year performance.
In cookies, consumption and share trends also improved in the quarter, with our Fudge Shoppe, Sandies and Simply Made brands all showing consumption growth. In both crackers and cookies, our innovation is weighted to the back half, with new items such as Cheez-It Extra Toasty, Town House Focaccia, Chips Deluxe Peanut Butter with M&Ms and Simply Made Sandwich Creams amongst the numerous launches coming to market now.
Whilst Pringles, crackers and cookies all showed positive signs in Q2, wholesome snacks continued to underperform. Rice Krispies Treats and our base Nutri-Grain foods performed quite well. However, distribution losses on prior innovation have impacted our business this year. We are committed to improving the performance of U.S. Snacks, and this will be an area of focus for me in coming months.
Moving on to the Specialty Channels business. Sales declined by approximately 1% in the second quarter, although our business improved as the quarter progressed. In the Convenience channel, we saw share growth in 5 of the 7 categories in which we compete. Although we did see some weakness in Foodservice partially due to the exit from some unprofitable business, we are confident that our Specialty Channels business will grow in the second half.
The final business is the North America Other segment. This is the combination of Frozen Foods, the Canadian and the Kashi businesses. Frozen Foods posted currency-neutral comparable net sales growth, driven by strong results from the Eggo brand. Eggo Waffles saw momentum in consumption, increased share, increased base sales and gains in penetration and buy rate. In addition, Eggo handheld breakfast sandwiches continue to do really well in their first year.
And we also saw good sales growth in the Canadian business, as cereal, frozen food and snacks all posted growth, with sales of Pringles up at a high-teen rate. As expected, sales of the Kashi business declined in the second quarter, which led to a decline in total North America Other segment sales of about 1.3%. While sales were down, the trend improved as the team began to launch new products and reestablished distribution. I'll come back to Kashi in a minute.
And now over the next few slides, I'd like to focus on the U.S. Cereal business and some of the progress we've made. Let's start with Slide 15. Over the past 9 months, we have made good progress on the agenda we set out, and I've seen a stabilization of our Kellogg's branded business. This is illustrated by our improving top line performance and Kellogg's branded share being up year-to-date.
Back at CAGNY, we spoke about 4 critical elements to returning cereal to growth, as illustrated on the slide. These were focusing on wellness, investing in our foods, engaging with consumers in new ways and dialing up the fun and executing with impact.
Slide 16 focuses on the first of these, Wellness in Today's World. One of our biggest challenges has been to return the Special K brand to growth. We have moved the focus of the brand away from diet towards wellness. In the past few months, we have launched a new protein offering and introduced the gluten-free Special K. We have also launched taster innovation by adding more berries to our largest variant, Special K Red Berries, and we have improved our Special K Vanilla Almond food, too. We've introduced new packaging and new communication to support all of this. I'm pleased to say we have seen steady improvement in performance over the past few months, as you can see on the slide. In fact, consumption increased by 2.4% in the latest public data. We also have more news to come in August with the launch of new Special K Apple Cinnamon Harvest.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. Our other challenge has been Kashi. Whilst we have yet to see the kind of turnaround we have seen on Special K, we are seeing distribution losses subside and velocities begin to stabilize. The team is making good progress on renovation and innovation plans, and we expect to see the fruits of these efforts begin to come through in improving trends over the coming months and as we enter 2016. You can see on the slide some of the Kashi innovation we have launched recently or have coming soon, including overnight mueslis, granolas, gluten-free waffles, organic chewy granola and seed bars and Sprouted Grain and Sweet Potato Sunshine Organic Promise cereals. As you know, we've made a significant investment in the Kashi team and organization and believe we -- we believe we have the right structure in place. The team is focused on delivering on-trend food to holistics and will leverage the Kellogg Company's infrastructure to the degree that it helps them achieve that objective.
Earlier in the year, I also mentioned the launch of Kellogg's Origins, which you can see pictured on Slide 18. This is a range of cereals, granolas and mueslis made with simple ingredients and designed to meet evolving consumer needs. The brand is now launched, and early acceptance has been good.
The second critical element to returning cereal to growth is investing more in our food. Our work on Kashi, Special K and Origins all demonstrate actions to invest more in our foods. You can see on Slide 19 that this year, we have also launched new and improved Froot Loops and Apple Jacks with lower sugar. And as we look forward, we will continue to renovate our core offerings to give consumers more of what they want in the way of nutritional benefits, such as protein, gluten-free choices and simpler ingredient lists. We know consumers are looking for foods with simpler ingredients, and work is well underway to answer that call. Already in North America, 75% of our cereals are made without artificial colors, and more than half are made without artificial flavors. Further, we have been working to remove artificial colors and flavors across Kellogg's branded cereals and a variety of Kellogg's branded snack bars as well as Eggo frozen foods. Our goal is to complete this transition by the end of 2018.
The cereal category is and always has been a repertoire category, offering health, taste and importantly, fun, too. We believe getting this blend right is as important today as it has ever been. You can see on Slide 20 that keeping our category vibrant and on-trend also means bringing fun to life on pack and in-store in impactful ways. We have seen good results behind our Disney Frozen Cereal this year and also strong end market performance behind our in-pack Avengers promotion and event in April. Looking forward, we believe initiatives like these are just as important as what we do on the health and nutrition front to drive category engagement.
The final area I wanted to mention is in-store execution on Slide 21. With our dedicated sales force, including field sales reps, back in place, we are seeing tangible improvements come through in the area of assortment gains, in-stock performance and merchandising behind the initiatives I outlined earlier.
So in summary, on Slide 22, whilst we still have plenty to do, we are pleased with the progress we're making on our cereal business, behind better core brand performance, relevant innovation and renovation and better execution through the Path to Purchase. In fact, sales are on trend to be flat to up in 2016, a great improvement.
Finally, I would like to thank the entire Morning Foods team who have done an incredible job over the past year improving all parts of our plan.
With that, I'll turn you back to John."

And now let's turn to Slide 23 in detail regarding our European business.

And now let's turn to Slide 23 in detail regarding our European business. The Pringles business in Europe had another great quarter and delivered mid-single-digit currency-neutral comparable sales growth on a difficult double-digit comparison last year. The business in the U.K. posted double-digit growth and share gains, partially as a result of increased distribution. In addition, the launch of Pringles Tortilla made an important contribution to sales although only launched recently. We have a significant Pringles business in Germany as well. We saw high single-digit sales growth there as a result of distribution gains and increased commercial activity.
Consumption trends improved in the wholesome snacks business in the second quarter. We have restaged Special K bars in the region, which is helping the brand's performance. This and the renovation of some of our foods will continue to contribute, and we expect the wholesome snack business to return to growth by the end of the year.
Total comparable net sales in the region decreased by 2.5% in the quarter as the cereal category continued to be a challenge. We restaged our Special K cereals in July and had other activity launching at the same time. In addition, we're introducing new Special K cereals on the continent in the second half. We've introduced mueslis in Germany and are expanding their introduction to other parts of the region.
Slide 24 shows some detail regarding our Latin American business. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales in the region increased by 14.5% in the second quarter, driven by growth in both cereal and snacks. Sales in the cereal business were ahead of our expectations and included both volume growth and improvement in price/mix. In addition, we gained category share across our key businesses, and we increased investment in brand building at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Specifically, we saw good growth in our portfolio of kids cereals and a benefit from the parent brand products we've launched this year.
Sales in the snack business increased at a high single-digit rate, largely driven by new products and go-to-market programs. In addition, underlying consumption growth in Pringles was good, all of which led to increased year-to-date share gains in the Mexican, Brazilian and Colombian businesses.
As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, we executed the Copa América soccer-related initiative in the second quarter and was a huge success. They're the highest customer engagement ever from a program at Latin America and has helped to drive the sales growth we saw in both Pringles and cereal.
Also, as we discussed last quarter, we've started investing in high-frequency stores in the region. This initiative is relatively new but is already driving distribution gains and sales growth, and we see significant opportunity for further gains as we expand our efforts. The team in Latin America has done a great job with new products, investing in growth and executing the plans. The results this quarter reflect all this effort.
Let's turn to Slide 25 and our Asia Pacific business. Currency-neutral comparable net sales in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa increased at a double-digit rate in the quarter due to broad-based growth. The Indian business also grew at a double-digit rate, with [indiscernible] cross brands with some of our new packaging initiatives driving results. The business in Japan also grew at a double-digit rate due to the continued popularity of granolas and strong growth from All-Bran. New advertising innovation helped drive sales of the Special K brand, up significantly in South Korea, and we also saw good growth in Southeast Asia. The Pringles business also posted strong net sales growth in the quarter, and consumption increased at a double-digit rate due to geographic expansion and the success of a music campaign, similar to the one we run in Europe. Sales declined in the Australian business, which led to total quarterly sales growth for the region of 6.8%. While we expect the environment in Australia to remain challenging, we have plans for improvement, which include new product introductions, support which stresses the nutritional benefits of our food and a focus on increasing distribution. The first half of the year has been strong for the Asia Pacific segment, and we expect that the team will continue to execute well for the remainder of the year.
Let's turn to the summary on Page 26. We are on track to meet our expectations for 2015. And importantly, this performance represent progress over 2014. As I mentioned earlier, we're building momentum. We're seeing improvement in our U.S. Cereal business, improvement in our European business and good growth in both the Latin American and Asian businesses, and we're confident that this improvement will continue into 2016. We've invested savings from Project K and have seen the benefits. This investment will continue to increase next year. We have a talented management team that will drive the results of the individual segments. We have a well-defined strategy that we are continuing to execute. And we're starting an aggressive 0-based budgeting program, which we expect will generate significant savings in addition to the savings flowing from Project K. These 2 programs will allow us to invest in the business while also driving improvement in operating margin. All of this gives us confidence that we will achieve our long-term targets for comparable sales and operating profit growth in 2016. We're planning an Investment Day in November, and we'll give you more detail then regarding our plans for next year.
And with that, I'd like to end by thanking our employees around the world for all their hard work. Now I'll open up for questions."

We expect that momentum to build into 2016. What's driving that momentum is the returns on our Project K investments, so whether that be the global category teams and rapidly transferring ideas around the world, the Kashi team and the strong innovation pipeline we see coming from that business, investing back in in-store execution, feet on the street in our U.S. Cereal business and the investments in our emerging market capabilities such as high-frequency stores. Also, we have excellent productivity programs into 2016. We have additional savings from Project K. We have underlying continuous improvement programs, and on top of that, we have the 0-based budgeting initiative. So while it's too early to give specific guidance for 2016, we want to give investors a sense as we go into '16, we do expect to be back on our long-term goals. We could obviously hold for the third quarter call or the fourth quarter call to do that, but we've given a commitment to investors to get back on those goals as quickly as possible.

This is a co-manufacturer that was making food for our U.S. Snacks business. It was consolidated into our results over the past several years based on the accounting rules. In this quarter, the business sold itself to a third party, and that triggered a change in our accounting. If you look at our 10-Q, it's been disclosed in the past, and you'll see it disclosed again, obviously, and the impact. It's a onetime noncash item that we've excluded from our comparable results. Now if we move on to Venezuela, our situation did change in the second quarter in Venezuela. As I've mentioned in the past, we buy a small amount of inputs from outside of Venezuela to manufacture product in the country, and we typically get access to U.S. dollars to be able to do that. In the first quarter, we got access to those U.S. dollars. In the second quarter, we had no access to U.S. dollars, and in fact, the government has indicated that it is going to slow payments going forward. This created disruption to our business in the second quarter. So we reevaluated the matter, and we determined that the best rate for us to measure the business at was at SIMADI rate of VEF 198 to the U.S. dollar. But we still remain a priority industry within Venezuela. We do expect to continue to manufacture and to serve our consumers. We have a good business there, and we have a great team that's managing in a very difficult environment."

We have no inventory issues within the U.S. Special K is interesting because the brand was up. Base sales, as the quarter progressed, went into progression as well. So when you got base movement off the shelf, this isn't purely incrementally driven through display and price promotion. It's actually good fundamentals coming through in terms of base consumption. So we know that consumers want nothing more than more goodies in their food when it comes to red berries, and giving them more of what they want, we're seeing them buy more from the shelf, importantly.

Results for earnings were in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Comparable sales were approximately flat to last year, and comparable earnings were $0.92 per share. The better perform",528,"Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Results for earnings were in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Comparable sales were approximately flat to last year, and comparable earnings were $0.92 per share. The better performance we saw in the U.S. Cereal business in the first quarter continued in the second quarter, and we again saw good performance across the international regions as well. The benefits we've seen from our initial investment in Project K have continued, and we expect it to continue to build momentum in the second half of the year.
We are on track to meet our guidance for the full year. Specifically, we expect approximately flat currency-neutral comparable sales; a decline in currency-neutral comparable operating profit of between 2% and 4%, including a negative impact of 3 to 4 points from rebasing of incentive compensation; and currency-neutral comparable earnings per share to be between flat and down 2%, also impacted by compensation.
Our performance in 2015 represents a significant improvement from 2014, and we believe that we are building a foundation for better results in the future. As a result, our improving momentum and increasing visibility into productivity programs are driving our confidence that we will achieve our long-term targets for sales and operating profit growth in 2016.
So with that in mind, I'd now like to talk about some of the things that give us that confidence. First, let's turn to Slide 4 and a discussion of our momentum. Paul and the team have done a great job of improving the performance of our U.S. Cereal business this year. And while we definitely have more to do to improve category performance, we are confident that we're focusing our investment on the right drivers of sales growth to continue recent trends. We're improving our food. We've invested in our sales force, and we're improving the effectiveness of our brand line.
In addition, as you've seen in recent quarters, our international businesses have been performing well. Europe has seen some better results in a difficult environment, and growth has been good in Latin America and in Asia.
Secondly, our investment in Project K has helped to drive the improved momentum. It has provided us with the funds to invest in the Kashi organization, in a significant number of new sales reps in both our warehouse and DSD sales forces in the U.S. and in our coverage of high-frequency stores, largely in emerging markets. These investments have helped -- have already had an impact and will help to drive even better results next year.
Finally, we've made some significant structural changes to our business. Paul will bring his experience and knowledge to running the North American business. Also, we have recently hired Craig Bahner to run our Morning Foods business, and we've also hired Deanie Elsner, who was most recently CMO at Kraft Foods, to run our U.S. Snacks business. I believe that our management team is now the best we've had in years and represents the right mix of experience, industry professionals from outside the organization and talented long-term Kellogg employees.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ron."

Slide 5 shows the financial results for the second quarter. As you've likely seen, our reported results include a remeasurement of our Venezuelan business to the SIMADI rate of VEF 198 to the U.S. dollar as well as a volatile market, and our circumstances changed in the second quarter. We experienced disruption in our business operations, driven by reduced access to U.S. dollars for inputs to support production. As a result, we remeasured our business accordingly. The financial impact of this remeasurement is disclosed in detail in the appendices to our presentation materials.
Reported net sales declined by 5.1% due to the devaluation of international currencies. Currency-neutral comparable net sales were essentially flat, in line with our guidance for the full year. We saw strong broad-based growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, and in addition, our U.S. Frozen Foods business grew as did our Canadian business. Reported quarterly operating profit was $412 million and included Project K execution costs and the impact of the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business. 
Quarterly currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 6.8%, in line with our expectations. The decline was due to timing of manufacturing costs and higher distribution costs as well as the impact of resetting incentive compensation.
Comparable earnings per share, which exclude integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments, Project K costs, $0.37 per share from the remeasurement of the Venezuelan business and other items that affect comparability, were $0.92 per share in the first quarter. These results include $0.05 of currency headwind. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $0.97 per share.
Slide 6 shows details regarding the second quarter sales growth. Comparable revenues for the quarter increased 0.1%, a slight improvement from the first quarter and included a 0.5% increase in price/mix driven by our Latin America business. We saw good volume growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, driven by growth in cereal, and several of our North American businesses grew volume as well. The slight decline of 0.4% is primarily due to cereal in developed markets, but as Paul will discuss later, we are seeing improving trends in U.S. Cereal. Currency has lowered reported net sales by 5.5%, driven mostly by the euro, the peso, the Canadian dollar and the pound.
Slide 7 shows our year-to-date currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Year-to-date, gross margin was broadly in line with last year and with our guidance for the full year. While we have recognized lower material costs and we continue to generate strong productivity improvements across our supply chain, we are seeing higher inflation and distribution costs and, as I mentioned earlier, some timing on our manufacturing costs versus prior year.
In addition, we are investing in our food across the globe. Recall that we mentioned that some of the Project K-related savings would be invested in our food. This includes the renovation of Kashi and Special K as well as the launch of granolas and mueslis in a number of countries.
Slide 8 shows the quarterly currency-neutral comparable operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's operating profit decreased by 13%. This was a result of sales declines, increased distribution costs, the timing of cost in our factories and the resetting of incentive compensation levels. We do expect results to improve as we progress through the balance of the year.
Europe's operating profit increased by 6% in the quarter, driven by broad-based improvement in cost of goods sold, including Project K savings, and the timing of brand-building investments, which are weighted more to the second half of the year. 
Quarterly operating profit increased by 9% in Latin America as a result of strong sales growth. This quarter's growth included a significant increase in investment in brand building.
Operating profit increased by 76% in the Asia Pacific region. This is the result of double-digit sales growth in Asia and South Africa, lower cost of goods sold and comparisons to last year. In addition, the region saw some benefit due to the timing of brand building between the second quarter and the third quarter. The growth in operating profit also included continued investment in capabilities in the region.
Slide 9 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Year-to-date operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $323 million. Cash flow in the second quarter was $311 million, which represented an improvement of more than $50 million from the second quarter of last year. We saw good performance in our core working capital, as I'll discuss in a minute.
We continue to expect full year cash flow of approximately $1 billion. Our cash requirements for Project K are the highest in 2015, and this is impacting our year-to-date position, but we remain on track to meet our outlook for the year. And of course, returning cash to share owners remains a priority for us. In total, we returned more than $2 billion to share owners over the last 2 years through dividends and share repurchases.
Slide 10 shows our core working capital as a percentage of net sales. As you can see, our performance had flattened out over the past several years, but we've made a lot of progress improving our position recently and have best-in-class levels of working capital. We said that we would improve performance further to unlock cash flow after the acquisition of Pringles and to help us fund cash requirements for Project K, and our supplier-financing initiative has contributed significantly to this improvement.
Slide 11 details our currency-neutral comparable guidance for 2015, which has not changed. We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We now expect a relatively neutral balance between inflation and the combination of productivity improvements and Project K savings. We've seen slightly more cost come through our materials and distribution, but we have been able to manage the impact in our outlook. Our materials are more than 90% covered, and as a result, we expect gross margin for the year to be flat to up slightly. We expect that operating profit will decline by between 2% and 4%. We also still expect the currency-neutral comparable earnings will be between $3.74 and $3.82 per share or in a range between flat and down 2%. Guidance for both operating profit and earnings per share include the impact of resetting incentive compensation.
The expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of last year's 53rd week, the impact of the remeasurement to the Venezuelan business and the impact of currency translation. Our expectation for the impact of foreign currency translation is now approximately $0.29 a share, up from the $0.24 per share we expected last quarter. This includes our estimate that the currency headwind from translating future 2015 earnings for our Venezuela business at the SIMADI rate will be approximately $0.10 per share. This will offset some improvement we've seen in other currencies.
Our tax rate is still expected to be between 27% and 28%, and interest expense is expected to be between $215 million and $225 million.
We continue to anticipate that cash flow after capital spending will be approximately $1 billion, as I mentioned. And this includes total incremental cash costs of $350 million for Project K, partially offset by benefits from our supplier-financing initiative and other cash flow initiatives. Total capital spending should be in the range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately 1 point to sales for incremental capital associated with Project K. And our current plan is that we will repurchase between $700 million and $750 million of shares in 2015.
Slide 12 shows our full year earnings per share walk. Cost for the integration of Pringles and Bisco Misr in Egypt are still expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share. Project K's pretax P&L costs are anticipated to be between $400 million and $450 million or approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per share for the year, 75% of which will be in cost of goods sold. And the impact of the remeasurement of Venezuela, in addition to the translation impact of $0.10 per share, is expected to be approximately $0.43 per share in total. A small amount of the remeasurement will impact our second half of the year.
Incremental savings from Project K are still expected to be between $90 million to $100 million for the full year, and approximately 2/3 of this will come from cost of goods sold.
For the remainder of the year, we expect comparable earnings per share delivery, including the impact of foreign exchange, to be approximately evenly split across the next 2 quarters. Our foreign currency headwind is much greater in the third quarter as currencies had already begun to devalue in the fourth quarter of last year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul for a discussion of our North America business."

Let's first turn to the performance of the businesses within the North America segment. Let's start with the Morning Foods business. As you may have seen in public consumption data, the performance of the cereal category has improved this year. Total consumption across all channels was approximately flat in the second quarter. And importantly, Kellogg branded sales were essentially flat, too, with our 6 largest cereal brands collectively growing sales and share in the quarter. This performance was driven in part by the good performance of the Special K brand, one of our main areas of focus over the last year. I'll talk more about this and Morning Foods in a minute.
Moving on to U.S. Snacks. We saw mixed results in the second quarter, with sales down 1.8%. Pringles grew nicely. Consumption trends in crackers and cookies improved, but we experienced continued weakness in wholesome snacks. In crackers, our Cheez-It brand grew sales and a full point of share in the quarter. In fact, excluding Special K Cracker Chips, our total cracker business grew sales and share. On Special K Cracker Chips, velocities are improving. However, prior losses of distribution continued to weigh heavily on our year-over-year performance.
In cookies, consumption and share trends also improved in the quarter, with our Fudge Shoppe, Sandies and Simply Made brands all showing consumption growth. In both crackers and cookies, our innovation is weighted to the back half, with new items such as Cheez-It Extra Toasty, Town House Focaccia, Chips Deluxe Peanut Butter with M&Ms and Simply Made Sandwich Creams amongst the numerous launches coming to market now.
Whilst Pringles, crackers and cookies all showed positive signs in Q2, wholesome snacks continued to underperform. Rice Krispies Treats and our base Nutri-Grain foods performed quite well. However, distribution losses on prior innovation have impacted our business this year. We are committed to improving the performance of U.S. Snacks, and this will be an area of focus for me in coming months.
Moving on to the Specialty Channels business. Sales declined by approximately 1% in the second quarter, although our business improved as the quarter progressed. In the Convenience channel, we saw share growth in 5 of the 7 categories in which we compete. Although we did see some weakness in Foodservice partially due to the exit from some unprofitable business, we are confident that our Specialty Channels business will grow in the second half.
The final business is the North America Other segment. This is the combination of Frozen Foods, the Canadian and the Kashi businesses. Frozen Foods posted currency-neutral comparable net sales growth, driven by strong results from the Eggo brand. Eggo Waffles saw momentum in consumption, increased share, increased base sales and gains in penetration and buy rate. In addition, Eggo handheld breakfast sandwiches continue to do really well in their first year.
And we also saw good sales growth in the Canadian business, as cereal, frozen food and snacks all posted growth, with sales of Pringles up at a high-teen rate. As expected, sales of the Kashi business declined in the second quarter, which led to a decline in total North America Other segment sales of about 1.3%. While sales were down, the trend improved as the team began to launch new products and reestablished distribution. I'll come back to Kashi in a minute.
And now over the next few slides, I'd like to focus on the U.S. Cereal business and some of the progress we've made. Let's start with Slide 15. Over the past 9 months, we have made good progress on the agenda we set out, and I've seen a stabilization of our Kellogg's branded business. This is illustrated by our improving top line performance and Kellogg's branded share being up year-to-date.
Back at CAGNY, we spoke about 4 critical elements to returning cereal to growth, as illustrated on the slide. These were focusing on wellness, investing in our foods, engaging with consumers in new ways and dialing up the fun and executing with impact.
Slide 16 focuses on the first of these, Wellness in Today's World. One of our biggest challenges has been to return the Special K brand to growth. We have moved the focus of the brand away from diet towards wellness. In the past few months, we have launched a new protein offering and introduced the gluten-free Special K. We have also launched taste to innovation by adding more berries to our largest variant, Special K Red Berries, and we have improved our Special K Vanilla Almond food, too. We've introduced new packaging and new communication to support all of this. I'm pleased to say we have seen steady improvement in performance over the past few months, as you can see on the slide. In fact, consumption increased by 2.4% in the latest public data. We also have more news to come in August with the launch of new Special K Apple Cinnamon Harvest.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. Our other challenge has been Kashi. Whilst we have yet to see the kind of turnaround we have seen on Special K, we are seeing distribution losses subside and velocities begin to stabilize. The team is making good progress on renovation and innovation plans, and we expect to see the fruits of these efforts begin to come through in improving trends over the coming months and as we enter 2016. You can see on the slide some of the Kashi innovation we have launched recently or have coming soon, including overnight mueslis, granolas, gluten-free waffles, organic chewy granola and seed bars and Sprouted Grain and Sweet Potato Sunshine Organic Promise cereals. As you know, we've made a significant investment in the Kashi team and organization and believe we -- we believe we have the right structure in place. The team is focused on delivering on-trend food to holistics and will leverage the Kellogg Company's infrastructure to the degree that it helps them achieve that objective.
Earlier in the year, I also mentioned the launch of Kellogg's Origins, which you can see pictured on Slide 18. This is a range of cereals, granolas and mueslis made with simple ingredients and designed to meet evolving consumer needs. The brand is now launched, and early acceptance has been good.
The second critical element to returning cereal to growth is investing more in our food. Our work on Kashi, Special K and Origins all demonstrate actions to invest more in our foods. You can see on Slide 19 that this year, we have also launched new and improved Froot Loops and Apple Jacks with lower sugar. And as we look forward, we will continue to renovate our core offerings to give consumers more of what they want in the way of nutritional benefits, such as protein, gluten-free choices and simpler ingredient lists. We know consumers are looking for foods with simpler ingredients, and work is well underway to answer that call. Already in North America, 75% of our cereals are made without artificial colors, and more than half are made without artificial flavors. Further, we have been working to remove artificial colors and flavors across Kellogg's branded cereals and a variety of Kellogg's branded snack bars as well as Eggo frozen foods. Our goal is to complete this transition by the end of 2018.
The cereal category is and always has been a repertoire category, offering health, taste and importantly, fun, too. We believe getting this blend right is as important today as it has ever been. You can see on Slide 20 that keeping our category vibrant and on-trend also means bringing fun to life on pack and in-store in impactful ways. We have seen good results behind our Disney Frozen Cereal this year and also strong end market performance behind our in-pack Avengers promotion and event in April. Looking forward, we believe initiatives like these are just as important as what we do on the health and nutrition front to drive category engagement.
The final area I wanted to mention is in-store execution on Slide 21. With our dedicated sales force, including field sales reps, back in place, we are seeing tangible improvements come through in the area of assortment gains, in-stock performance and merchandising behind the initiatives I outlined earlier.
So in summary, on Slide 22, whilst we still have plenty to do, we are pleased with the progress we're making on our cereal business, behind better core brand performance, relevant innovation and renovation and better execution through the Path to Purchase. In fact, sales are on trend to be flat to up in 2016, a great improvement.
Finally, I would like to thank the entire Morning Foods team who have done an incredible job over the past year improving all parts of our plan.
With that, I'll turn you back to John."

And now let's turn to Slide 23 in detail regarding our European business. The Pringles business in Europe had another great quarter and delivered mid-single-digit currency-neutral comparable sales growth on a difficult double-digit comparison last year. The business in the U.K. posted double-digit growth and share gains, partially as a result of increased distribution. In addition, the launch of Pringles Tortilla made an important contribution to sales although only launched recently. We have a significant Pringles business in Germany as well. We saw high single-digit sales growth there as a result of distribution gains and increased commercial activity.
Consumption trends improved in the wholesome snacks business in the second quarter. We have restaged Special K bars in the region, which is helping the brand's performance. This and the renovation of some of our foods will continue to contribute, and we expect the wholesome snack business to return to growth by the end of the year.
Total comparable net sales in the region decreased by 2.5% in the quarter as the cereal category continued to be a challenge. We restaged our Special K cereals in July and had other activity launching at the same time. In addition, we're introducing new Special K cereals on the continent in the second half. We've introduced mueslis in Germany and are expanding their introduction to other parts of the region.
Slide 24 shows some detail regarding our Latin American business. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales in the region increased by 14.5% in the second quarter, driven by growth in both cereal and snacks. Sales in the cereal business were ahead of our expectations and included both volume growth and improvement in price/mix. In addition, we gained category share across our key businesses, and we increased investment in brand building at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Specifically, we saw good growth in our portfolio of kids cereals and a benefit from the parent brand products we've launched this year.
Sales in the snack business increased at a high single-digit rate, largely driven by new products and go-to-market programs. In addition, underlying consumption growth in Pringles was good, all of which led to increased year-to-date share gains in the Mexican, Brazilian and Colombian businesses.
As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, we executed the Copa América soccer-related initiative in the second quarter and was a huge success. They're the highest customer engagement ever from a program at Latin America and has helped to drive the sales growth we saw in both Pringles and cereal.
Also, as we discussed last quarter, we've started investing in high-frequency stores in the region. This initiative is relatively new but is already driving distribution gains and sales growth, and we see significant opportunity for further gains as we expand our efforts. The team in Latin America has done a great job with new products, investing in growth and executing the plans. The results this quarter reflect all this effort.
Let's turn to Slide 25 and our Asia Pacific business. Currency-neutral comparable net sales in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa increased at a double-digit rate in the quarter due to broad-based growth. The Indian business also grew at a double-digit rate, with [indiscernible] cross brands with some of our new packaging initiatives driving results. The business in Japan also grew at a double-digit rate due to the continued popularity of granolas and strong growth from All-Bran. New advertising innovation helped drive sales of the Special K brand, up significantly in South Korea, and we also saw good growth in Southeast Asia. The Pringles business also posted strong net sales growth in the quarter, and consumption increased at a double-digit rate due to geographic expansion and the success of a music campaign, similar to the one we run in Europe. Sales declined in the Australian business, which led to total quarterly sales growth for the region of 6.8%. While we expect the environment in Australia to remain challenging, we have plans for improvement, which include new product introductions, support which stresses the nutritional benefits of our food and a focus on increasing distribution. The first half of the year has been strong for the Asia Pacific segment, and we expect that the team will continue to execute well for the remainder of the year.
Let's turn to the summary on Page 26. We are on track to meet our expectations for 2015. And importantly, this performance represent progress over 2014. As I mentioned earlier, we're building momentum. We're seeing improvement in our U.S. Cereal business, improvement in our European business and good growth in both the Latin American and Asian businesses, and we're confident that this improvement will continue into 2016. We've invested savings from Project K and have seen the benefits. This investment will continue to increase next year. We have a talented management team that will drive the results of the individual segments. We have a well-defined strategy that we are continuing to execute. And we're starting an aggressive 0-based budgeting program, which we expect will generate significant savings in addition to the savings flowing from Project K. These 2 programs will allow us to invest in the business while also driving improvement in operating margin. All of this gives us confidence that we will achieve our long-term targets for comparable sales and operating profit growth in 2016. We're planning an Investment Day in November, and we'll give you more detail then regarding our plans for next year.
And with that, I'd like to end by thanking our employees around the world for all their hard work. Now I'll open up for questions."

Also, we have excellent productivity programs into 2016. We have additional savings from Project K. We have underlying continuous improvement programs, and on top of that, we have the 0-based budgeting initiative. So while it's too early to give specific guidance for 2016, we want to give investors a sense as we go into '16, we do expect to be back on our long-term goals.

Remember, when we started the year, we said that all up with the productivity, savings, the input inflation and then Project K savings. We may be net a little bit deflationary. Whilst we've come through the front part of this year, we've encountered avian influenza. That is having an impact on our egg costs, and it's relatively significant for us. So it's having an impact, particularly on our back half cost structure. So we're expecting it to be relatively neutral now. We do believe our gross margin will be flat, though, to up slightly."

Kashi, we have a bit of a lag because we've had to do quite a lot of renovation to our foods, including GOLEAN, for example, which I'm pleased to say in Q3 '15, we'll now be non-GMO project certified. The rest of the portfolio will go that way in Q1 '16. So we've more or less got through the renovation phase of our work on Kashi. We also moved to put a team back in place in Kashi back in California. That team now is fully functional and in place, and we're beginning to see the benefits of the renovation and innovation work they've been doing coming through. So I think you'll see Kashi trends improving in the back half of this year into the beginning of next year. We are seeing distribution losses, which were a big driver of those declines, subside and velocity stabilizing. So I think the recipe or the ingredients are coming together for Kashi to start to get back into growth as we finish this year and move into next year.

This is a co-manufacturer that was making food for our U.S. Snacks business. It was consolidated into our results over the past several years based on the accounting rules. In this quarter, the business sold itself to a third party, and that triggered a change in our accounting. If you look at our 10-Q, it's been disclosed in the past, and you'll see it disclosed again, obviously, and the impact. It's a onetime noncash item that we've excluded from our comparable results. Now if we move on to Venezuela, our situation did change in the second quarter in Venezuela. As I've mentioned in the past, we buy a small amount of inputs from outside of Venezuela to manufacture product in the country, and we typically get access to U.S. dollars to be able to do that. In the first quarter, we got access to those U.S. dollars. In the second quarter, we had no access to U.S. dollars, and in fact, the government has indicated that it is going to slow payments going forward. This created disruption to our business in the second quarter. So we reevaluated the matter, and we determined that the best rate for us to measure the business at was at SIMADI rate of VEF 198 to the U.S. dollar. But we still remain a priority industry within Venezuela. We do expect to continue to manufacture and to serve our consumers. We have a good business there, and we have a great team that's managing in a very difficult environment."

We are pleased with the momentum we've seen so far this year has continued to build through the third quarter. Total currency-neutral comparable revenue growth of 1% was above our top line guidance for the full year and are build on the flat growth we posted in the first half of the year. We saw sales respond to investments we have made, continued stabilization in many of our businesses in the quarter and growth in the U.S. Specialty Channels, Canadian, Latin American and Asia Pacific businesses. In addition, we continued to make great progress with our productivity initiatives.
Overall currency-neutral comparable operating profit was in line with our expectations and included a significant impact from this year's rebasing of incentive compensation. Ron will discuss this in more detail. But excluding this impact, currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth would have been approximately 6% in the quarter.
We are raising our guidance for cash flow to $1.1 billion in 2015. We're on track to meet our guidance for currency-neutral comparable sales, operating profit and earnings per share in 2015, and we will achieve these results while setting up an even better year in 2016.
The momentum we're building and our aggressive productivity programs give us confidence that we'll meet our long-term targets for currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth in 2016 and beyond. We'll give you more color regarding our overall business at our Investor Day in a few weeks, but we're excited about the plans we have for each of our businesses and performance we expect as a result.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results."

Currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 1%, greater than our full year guidance for growth. We saw strong growth across many of our emerging and developing markets in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe. We are pleased with the performance of our U.S. Cereal business. U.S. Snacks improved sequentially, and we grew in the U.S. Specialty Channel and Canadian businesses. And Pringles posted increased sales growth in each of our regions.
Reported net sales declined by 8.5% due to foreign currency translation. Comparable operating profit declined by 2.3%. However, as John mentioned, that decline includes a headwind from the rebasing of incentive compensation this year. Without this impact, comparable operating profit would have been 8 points higher and would have shown growth of approximately 6%. This reinforces our previous comments on the operating leverage in our business.
Reported operating profit was $334 million in the third quarter, including items affecting comparability as detailed in the appendices to our presentation. Comparable earnings per share were $0.85 in the quarter, and these results include $0.11 of currency headwind. So currency-neutral comparable earnings per share were $0.96, an increase of 2.1% from the third quarter of last year.
Slide 5 shows the components of the quarter sales growth. We had good price/mix realization despite some adverse country mix in Europe and Asia Pacific. Overall, volume declined by 1.6%, and while volume declined in our U.S. Cereal and Snacks businesses, we continue to see signs of stabilization. The Asia Pacific region posted good volume growth as did Mexico, the Mediterranean and Middle East regions and Specialty Channels in the U.S. And we continue to see strong volume performance from Pringles across the globe.
The impact of foreign exchange lowered reported net sales by almost 10%, driven by a wide basket of currencies. And note that our devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at mid-year represents almost half of the 10-point impact to sales.
Slide 6 shows details regarding our third quarter currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Gross margin in the third quarter improved by 20 basis points. Year-to-date, gross margin remain unchanged from last year.
Overall, commodity and packaging costs are deflationary and our strong productivity initiatives, combined with Project K savings, are benefiting our supply chain costs. However, we are seeing continued higher transportation costs.
In addition, we are investing more money in our foods. Examples include our launch of granolas and mueslis across the globe and renovation of existing foods such as Special K. The combination of these factors has resulted in relatively flat gross margins year-to-date.
Slide 7 shows the third quarter operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 3%. This was due to the slight decline in sales and the significant impact of rebasing incentive compensation. The rebasing reduced operating profit by 8 points in the quarter. We expect further improvement in North America's currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth in the fourth quarter.
Europe's operating profit increased by 3% in the third quarter. This growth was the result of deflation in commodities and strong productivity in cost of goods sold. And it also included an increase in brand building in the quarter. Operating profit in Latin America increased by 15% as a result of strong sales growth in the region, including the impact from Venezuela. While we did see some adverse shift in the timing of sales in certain parts of the region impacting our third quarter, we are growing volume and sales year-to-date.
Operating profit decreased by 20% in the Asia Pacific region. We are investing some Project K savings in this region to drive growth, so the result includes investment in our brands and capabilities.
Slide 8 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Year-to-date operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $580 million. This result includes year-to-date investment in Project K of approximately $260 million. And as I mentioned last quarter, cash cost for Project K in 2015 will be approximately $350 million, the most in any year of the project.
As you can see on the chart, we now expect full year cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of $100 million from our original estimate. This increase is due to accelerated performance of our supplier-financing initiative in the fourth quarter. In fact, we expect that this initiative will offset the approximately $350 million in full year cash costs for Project K.
Slide 9 shows our core working capital as a percentage of net sales. In the past, we have discussed our focus on working capital improvements and our supplier-financing initiative in particular. Over the first 9 months of this year, we have reduced our core working capital as a percentage of sales by more than 1 point. And as I said, we expect accelerated progress on supplier financing in the fourth quarter, and we are also evaluating new initiatives to unlock even more cash from our working capital.
Slide 10 shows our guidance for 2015. We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We now expect gross margin for the year to be relatively flat also. We continue to expect that operating profit will decline by between 2% and 4%. And we also still expect the currency-neutral comparable earnings per share will be in a range between flat to down 2%. And results for both currency-neutral comparable operating profit and earnings per share still include a negative impact of 3 to 4 points from the resetting of incentive compensation.
The expectation for sales, operating profit and earnings per share do exclude the impact of items affecting comparability. Our expectation for the impact of foreign exchange translation is now approximately $0.31 a share, an increase from the $0.29 per share we expected last quarter. This change is due to the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling and the Australian dollar.
Our expectations for net interest expense have increased to between $225 million and $230 million, driven by slightly higher levels of debt associated with our acquisitions in Nigeria and Egypt. We now expect that the full year tax rate will be between 26% and 27%, which will cover the impact of higher interest cost and other below-the-line items.
Guidance for total capital spending remains in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately 1 point of sales for incremental capital to execute Project K. And we still expect share repurchases approximately $700 million to $750 million for this year.
Slide 11 shows our full year earnings per share walk. Cost for the integration of acquisitions are still expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share, although they could be to the high end of that range given the recent acquisitions in Egypt and Nigeria. And we now anticipate that Project K's pretax profit and loss costs will be between $350 million and $400 million or approximately $0.70 to $0.80 per share for the year. We expect that 2/3 of these costs will be in cost of goods sold. The change in the expected cost is simply due to the timing of projects between years. Project K remains on track, and our estimate for savings in 2015 and 2016 has not changed.
Slide 12 shows our guidance for 2016. As we communicated on our Q2 call, we expect our currency-neutral comparable sales to be in our long-term guidance range for low single-digit growth. We also expect 4% to 6% growth in currency-neutral comparable operating profit. As we mentioned last quarter, if current sales growth trends continue, it could put us at the lower end of our long-term sales targets. But even if this happens, we will still meet our goals for operating profit growth due to the significant productivity programs we have underway. We expect currency-neutral comparable earnings per share growth of between 6% and 8%. And our outlook assumes a similar amount of share repurchases to the $700 million to $750 million we expect in 2015.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John for a discussion of operating performance by segment."
283356,311248873,889922,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Ron. And now let's turn to Slide 13 in the U.S. Morning Foods business. Results for the third quarter came in as we expected. The Kellogg brand gained share in the quarter and so continued sequential improvement and consumption. In fact, our total",2249,"Thanks, Ron. And now let's turn to Slide 13 in the U.S. Morning Foods business. Results for the third quarter came in as we expected. The Kellogg brand gained share in the quarter and so continued sequential improvement and consumption. In fact, our total consumption was essentially flat and we gained share. Importantly, category-based sales were up in the quarter, and we outpaced the category.
Our 6 core cereals grew in combination and gained share, raisin bran towards double-digit growth to the great advertising and popular Cranberry innovation. Overall, many weeks did well as core bite-sized growth in both base and incremental sales and our second half innovation did well, included pumpkin spice wheat, which were a big hit.
As you can see on the chart, Special K continued to benefit from activity that began in the second quarter. The bran posted increased sales and share gains again, just as it did last quarter. And our adult cereals in total, which would be an area of softness, returned to growth.
And finally, for Morning Foods, we've had a great reception to the innovation we have planned for the first quarter. For example, we're launching Special K Nourish, which is a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients that consumer can see in the food. There are 2 SKUs in the U.S., Cranberry Coconut Almond and Apple Raspberry Almond and both made with a multigrain flake. So the food and goods fruits, nuts and on trends grains like word. You remember that this cereal has been very popular in other parts of the world, and retailer acceptance in the U.S. has been encouraging. It activity planned for launch, and we're excited about the potential.
Let's turn to Slide 14 and our U.S. Snacks business. Overall, we saw sequential improvement in the cracker, cookie, wholesome snack and Pringles businesses in the third quarter. In all channels, overall consumption of our crackers was essentially flat in the quarter, and our big 3 brands posted low single-digit consumption growth in measured channels. The Cheez-It brand posted consumption growth of 3%, driven by increased display and the success of 2 new products: Cheez-It and Extra Toasty. In addition, Cheez-It also grew base sales at a mid-single-digit rate, much faster than the category average.
The Club brand also posted increased consumption and share gains as the core business performed well and the new Town House Kashi also gained share and now holds 0.6 share of the overall category. That Special K Cracker and Popcorn Chips, which have been an adverse headwind, continued to impact results. And while we're continuing to be impacted by past losses in distribution, the products early this year posted slight consumption growth in the quarter.
In the cookie category, the Chips Deluxe, Famous Amos, strengths and Mothers brands all posted consumption growth in the quarter. We have some strong brands, which respond well to activity and we're encouraged by recent performance. We're pleased that we're seeing sequential improvement in the business although we have been impacted by decline of 100 pack this year as we've discussed before.
The wholesome snack business posted a low single-digit decline in consumption in measured channels plus the Club channel. And the Special K been posted an increase in consumption of almost 3% across the same channels, driven by new Special K chewy nut bars.
The Pringles business posted low single-digit sales growth, building on high single-digit growth last year. Across all channels, including Club and Convenience combined, Pringles posted mid-single-digit growth in the quarter.
So the team is being -- has been doing a lot of work in each of the categories, and we're seeing sequential improvement as a result. There's a lot more to come as well, and we'll hear more about some of those plans at the Investor Day scheduled for later in the month.
Slide 15 shows highlights regarding the U.S. specialty segment. Comparable net sales in the Specialty Channels increased by 6% in the quarter. The Foodservice, Convenience and Bending channels all posted growth. The Foodservice performance was driven by the growth of whole grain offerings in the K through 12 school business.
The Convenience business had an easier comp last year due to customer the inventory. In addition, we also saw excellent broad-based growth across the categories in the Convenience channel. And year-to-date, we're growing share in the cereal, cracker, wholesome snack and cookie categories.
Finally for specialty, the Pringles business also continues to do well. As you can see on the slide, our new products, Pringles and It Together, won the retailer choice award for best new product in the Convenience channel and help the overall Pringles business post double-digit growth and gain share in Q3. The team continues to expect a strong fourth quarter for both sales and operating profit, and we're excited about our prospects to 2016.
Slide 16 highlights the performance of the North America Other segment, including the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. In the Frozen Foods business, our Eggo handheld sandwiches continued to perform well in the quarter. As you've seen in public data, consumption increased at a strong double-digit rate and we gained share.
Elsewhere in the business, a number of items affected performance, including egg prices, network improvements, the timing of activity and the drawing down of inventories in anticipation of exciting change to packaging. We ended the third quarter with lower levels of retail inventory, and we expect a continued impact in the fourth quarter with improvement in 2016.
The Kashi business is staying stabilized distribution and sequential improvement in cereal consumption and share performance, although sales still declined. In cereal, our Sweet Potato Sunshine and ready Grain Cereals are doing well. In fact, overall consumption trends improved significantly as the year has progressed. In the latest data, year-to-date cereal consumption was down 13%. 12-week consumption was down 7% and 4-week consumption was down only 3%. So the team has done a great job, and we're on track to return the business to growth in 2016. And we're increasingly confident about next year. We're focused on progressive nutrition and some great introductions planned. In fact, our total weight of innovation in 2016 is twice what it has been in 2015.
And finally, net sales for the Canadian business increased in wholesome snacks, Pringles and Frozen Foods, and we grew share in the cereal category. Unfortunately, the combination of the performance of Frozen Food and Kashi businesses led to a quarterly sales decline in the segment.
Let's turn to Slide 17 in our European business. The Pringles business in Europe posted strong double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. The base business posted growth in the launch of Pringles Tortilla in the U.K. and Germany also contributed to the overall performance. In addition, we had strong commercial initiatives across the region, and we expect continued good performance in the fourth quarter, traditionally, the quarter of the year with the highest level of sales.
We have exciting plans for the regions wholesome snack business in the fourth quarter and into 2016. As in many parts of the world, we are making significant investment in our food in Europe. This includes the relaunch of Special K bars, an extensive innovation that will include completely new foods with fruits, nuts and seeds.
The Cereal business declined in the quarter as a result of continued difficult environment in the U.K. and partially word. The focus for the team is to strengthen the overall plan and improve performance. With this in mind, we have included additional activity in the U.K., focused on crunchy nut, Crave, word, a tie-in with Star Wars and increased levels of holiday promotions. In addition, there's exciting activity coming in the first quarter. We're taking lessons learned from the U.S. and applying them in the region. We're adding more Red Berries in Special K, and we're launching new products, including cereals, mueslis and granolas and also launching Special K nourished cereal.
Slide 18 shows highlights for our Latin American business. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales increased at a double-digit rate. Cereal sales in the region increased significantly, and we're seeing good volume growth and have held our increased year-to-date share in strategic businesses like Mexico, Columbia and Brazil. These share gains have been driven by children's and family brands in the introduction of Kellogg's branded granolas and mueslis.
Sales in the Snack business also increased the quarter, driven by innovation and go-to-market activity. And we're gaining year-to-date share in the wholesale businesses in Brazil and Colombia.
The Pringles business continued to perform well and we launched Pringles Tortilla in the region. And our initiative to drive sales in high-frequency stores continues to go well. We have gained year-to-date share in this channel in Mexico, Columbia and Brazil and have increased the number of stores we're reaching at a double-digit rate. There's a lot of opportunity in these channels in both the Latin American and Asian regions, and they will continue to be a focus for us next year.
The team in Latin America is expecting strong fourth quarter results due to high-frequency store program, the continued impact of granolas and mueslis, new bars launching in Brazil, new Special K protein in Mexico and some significant brand-building events across the region. Plans for 2016 include more great innovation and brand-building events. However, as you know, a number of countries are facing a slowdown in their economies, and while we have plans to deal with this, and the impact of transactional foreign exchange, it will remain a headwind in 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 19 in our Asia Pacific business. We saw strong double-digit growth in the Asian business in the third quarter. The Indian business posted double-digit growth, driven by single-served packs and strong results from the core brands. The Japanese business grew at a double-digit rate as a result of continued popularity of granola and packaging innovation, and the Korean business also grew at a double-digit rate.
The business in sub-Saharan Africa in the Pringles business both posted high single-digit sales growth. On Pringles specifically, we continued to see great results in the region, and our activity and investment have gained traction. In addition, our new Pringles plant in Malaysia is performing well.
The overall Asia Pacific segment posted currency-neutral comparable sales growth of 2% in the quarter. The Australian business continues to be difficult. And we also faced the impact of differences in the year-on-year timing of promotions in the quarter. We expect declines in Australia to moderate in the fourth quarter, and we have plans to further improvement in 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 20 and comments on our JVs in Asia. Although they're not reported in Asia Pacific's results, both the Chinese and Nigerian businesses posted very strong growth in the quarter. In China, both cereal and snacks grew at a double-digit rate, and we gained share in the cereal category.
As you know, we announced in September our investment in West Africa. Specifically, we announced the acquisition of a 50% stake in multi-, a premier sales and distribution company in Nigeria and Ghana. And we announced the creation of a snacks and breakfast joint venture across West Africa with Africa, one of the largest food companies in the region. We are very excited about the investment and this region is experiencing explosive growth with a great middle-class. Nigeria alone has the largest population and economy in all of Africa.
At the time of the transaction, we announced that the total company sales for we expected to be approximately $750 million in 2015. Just to put that into perspective, our Asia Pacific business posted total sales of slightly less than $1 billion last year. So you can see the transformational impact this acquisition has on the region, and why we're so excited about the potential. our Head of Asia Pacific, will discuss both partnerships in more detail at the Investor Day, but also that we're very pleased to have these great relationships in place, and we're confident that they will be significant contributors to total corporate results in the years to come.
Let's turn to the summary on Page 21. Results for net sales growth and operating profit were in line with our expectations, and we continue to build momentum. Currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 1% and currency-neutral comparable operating profit, excluding the impact of resetting incentive compensation increased by approximately 6%. And we also increased guidance to full year cash flow.
In the quarter, we saw improving trends in our U.S. Cereal business. We saw a sequential improvement in our U.S. Snacks business; the Kashi brand continue to improve as we expected; our international business continued to perform well; and importantly, our productivity programs continue to generate significant savings. And we are on track with both Project K and our zero-based budgeting initiatives. These 2 cost-savings programs, in conjunction with our underlying productivity programs, give us a significant amount of visibility into future results. So as I said, we are building momentum. The group performance in the third quarter and our visibility into increased efficiency give us confidence that we'll meet our targets for 2015, 2016 and beyond. We recognize that we have a lot to do, but we have a plan. We know we can achieve our targets. Our employees around the world are doing great work and, as always, I'd like to end by thanking them all.
And now, I'll open it up for questions."

I mean, clarify the double the weight of innovation is actually a comment only for Kashi in 2016 here in the U.S. And we've done a lot to invest back in our innovation process as a company to improve the performance of our innovation.

In the case of Kashi, specifically, pulling the team back in La Jolla, back in California and allowing them to focus on the longer-term innovation to move at a faster pace as is required in that particular segment of the market, is showing dividends. I think you've seen that in the Kashi business performance improving and also in that greater innovation coming through next year. And also as you think about innovation, I think you can see more from us in the area of packaging as we try to hit the right package price product offering by channel, by market. So I think as innovation pipeline going forward is both a stronger pipeline in terms of what we have a longer-term pipeline, global category teams as a more diverse pipeline not just more food, it's food, it's packaging, it's in the core parts of the business as well as in the leading segment of the business as well."

And that specifically in North America. And you may recall, we said we're interrogating around $2 billion worth of discretionary spend. Now that is just $2 billion within North America. So far, we've identified a number of things. We're looking across supply chain costs, supply chain overhead, distribution costs and SG&A as well. We've noted a number of areas around our policies and practices based on benchmarks that we have from this process. Example is traveling people-related costs. We found it we're investing, we're spending more money in some of those areas, and there's a great opportunity to pull back. We've interrogated professional services as well. And we're looking into brand building as well and dissecting our brand-building investment, both from a working perspective and a non-working perspective.

Now let me assure you, both of these are absolutely critical to our business. We remain focused on investing behind our brands, in building our brands and maintaining a strong gross margin. But the advent of zero-based budgeting and how that may change the complexion of our profit loss statement and as well as the changing landscape, how you build brands, the shift to TV media to digital media as well and the investments we're putting back in our food make it difficult for us to provide specifics on those items."

So on the potential deflationary impact on cost of goods and how could that play out in the marketplace, if you look at cost categories, our categories are very rational.

They are intensely competitive categories, but they're ones that tend to be fairly stable in pricing over time. So I feel good about the dynamic there. I don't see that necessarily being disrupted. On the question of sales guidance, I think there's some may be some confusion there. If you look at the company, we are building momentum. Last year, our sales -- internal sales went down around 2%. This year, we're around flat. And next year, we're giving guidance of 1% to 3%. So give you straight line through that trend line, you get down to flat say up to [ph]. The point we try to make on our guidance for next year is we don't need to deliver 2%, 3% sales growth in order to deliver the 4% to 6% operating profit growth. Our comment there was about the strength and visibility we have into our productivity programs. And so we believe that if we hit even the low end of our sales guidance or even if we were flat in our sales performance next year, we can still -- we still have the visibility in those productivity programs to hit the 4% to 6% operating profit range. If I'd add to that, if I'm thinking about our guidance for next year and you asked me the question where is the risk within that guidance, I think the risk is more on the sales guidance than in operating profit guidance.

And the strength of our brands is something we're absolutely focused on. And you",359,"It's great question. It's probably spending a little bit talking about brand building. Obviously, brand building is critical to the long-term performance the Kellogg Company. And the strength of our brands is something we're absolutely focused on. And you can see that we have industry-leading levels of brand building and we're committed to those bands. At the same time, we are seeing a transformational change in how you build brands. Think about the transformational changes we've seen in the past from print to radio to TV and now to social, mobile, digital, et cetera. And as you go through each of these transformational changes, the amount and how you spend brand building fundamentally changes. And so as we see people skipping more ads on TV, as we see people, particularly millennials, using their mobile devices, social media or et cetera having a larger impact, we have to change our brand-building model. And as we do this, we have to both identify what's not working as well as it has in the past and where should we invest more money. Now we see very good ROAs on digital-type spend. So we're seeing more of our money migrate in that direction. But because of this seachange, it's very hard for us to say where our brand building is going in the future. I certainly feel like we spent enough money on brand building. And so as we look say into 2016, we will have zero-based budgeting savings and brand building. Some or all of that will get reinvested back into brand building. But I don't think we need to continue to increase our brand building as such. And so our brand building as a percentage of sales may be flat, maybe even declined slightly. But don't take that as a lack of commitment to brand building. Take that as a recognition that how you build brands, how you engage with consumers as they engage with media differently is changing in such a pace here that we have to reevaluate our entire model and continue to push the edge on how much we need to spend to build these great brands."

So first of all, in Venezuela, let me remind you of how that remeasurement has impacted our results and then as well there's a translational impact. So in the second quarter, we took a significant charge as a result of our revaluing our balance sheet",327,"Yes. So first of all, in Venezuela, let me remind you of how that remeasurement has impacted our results and then as well there's a translational impact. So in the second quarter, we took a significant charge as a result of our revaluing our balance sheet. We took a small charges well in the third quarter, worth about 41 pennies of earnings per share impact. It's more the transactional impact of remeasuring that business. Also in the third quarter, we would've taken the translational impact of remeasuring that business to the VEF 200 to the U.S. dollar. And that's roughly around $0.04 or so of earnings per share impact. And as I said, in terms of the sales impact, it was a low less than half the 10-point impact to sales. As you think about what's happening in Latin America generally, there's no question that Venezuela drove the sales growth we saw in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, at local currency growth, x Venezuela would be up low single digits. But it's worth remembering within that, that our Pringles business is a U.S. dollar-denominated business. And so what you're seeing is actually U.S. dollar growth in Pringles as opposed to true local currency growth. Local currency Pringles is up double -- strong double digits. But that obviously translates very low U.S. dollar performance given where the exchange rates have moved. So it's actually kind of hard within our results to get back to a pure local currency x Venezuela for Latin America. What I would say in Latin America is we are seeing a slowdown in economies in Latin America in general and in our business as well. We are gaining share in key businesses, such as Brazil, Mexico, Columbia. As we go into 2016, we expect this business to continue to be challenged a little bit with the macroeconomic headwinds of the exchange rate movements and how that's impacting consumer demand in the region."

We are pleased that the momentum we've seen so far this year has continued to build through the third quarter. Total currency-neutral comparable revenue growth of 1% was above our top line guidance for the full year and have built on the flat growth we posted in the first half of the year. We saw sales respond to the investment we've made, continuous stabilization in many of our businesses in the quarter and growth in the U.S. Specialty Channels, Canadian, Latin American and Asia Pacific businesses. In addition, we continue to make great progress with our productivity initiatives.
Overall currency-neutral comparable operating profit was in line with our expectations and included a significant impact from this year's rebasing of incentive compensation. Ron will discuss this in more detail. But excluding this impact, currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth would have been approximately 6% in the quarter.
We are raising our guidance for cash flow to $1.1 billion in 2015. We're on track to meet our guidance for currency-neutral comparable sales, operating profit and earnings per share in 2015, and we will achieve these results while setting up an even better year in 2016.
The momentum we're building and our aggressive productivity programs give us confidence that we'll meet our long-term targets for currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth in 2016 and beyond. We'll give you more color regarding our overall business at our Investor Day in a few weeks, but we're excited about the plans we have for each of our businesses and the performance we expect as a result.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results."

Currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 1%, greater than our full year guidance for growth. We saw strong growth across many of our emerging and developing markets in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe. We are pleased with the performance of our U.S. Cereal business. U.S. Snacks improved sequentially, and we grew in the U.S. Specialty Channel and Canadian businesses. And Pringles posted increased sales growth in each of our regions.
Reported net sales declined by 8.5% due to foreign currency translation. Comparable operating profit declined by 2.3%. However, as John mentioned, that decline includes a headwind from the rebasing of incentive compensation this year. Without this impact, comparable operating profit would have been 8 points higher and would have shown growth of approximately 6%. This reinforces our previous comments on the operating leverage in our business.
Reported operating profit was $334 million in the third quarter, including items affecting comparability, as detailed in the appendices to our presentation. Comparable earnings per share were $0.85 in the quarter, and these results include $0.11 of currency headwind. So currency-neutral comparable earnings per share were $0.96, an increase of 2.1% from the third quarter last year.
Slide 5 shows the components of the quarter sales growth. We had good price/mix realization despite some adverse country mix in Europe and Asia Pacific. Overall, volume declined by 1.6%. And while volume declined in our U.S. Cereal and Snacks businesses, we continue to see signs of stabilization. The Asia Pacific region posted good volume growth as did Mexico, the Mediterranean and Middle East regions and Specialty Channels in the U.S. And we continue to see strong volume performance from Pringles across the globe.
The impact of foreign exchange lowered reported net sales by almost 10%, driven by a wide basket of currencies. And note that our devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at midyear represents almost half of the 10-point impact to sales.
Slide 6 shows details regarding our third quarter currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Gross margin in the third quarter improved by 20 basis points. Year-to-date, gross margin remain unchanged from last year.
Overall, commodity and packaging costs are deflationary, and our strong productivity initiatives, combined with Project K savings, are benefiting our supply chain costs. However, we are seeing continued higher transportation costs.
In addition, we are investing more money in our foods. Examples include our launch of granolas and mueslis across the globe and renovation of existing foods such as Special K. The combination of these factors has resulted in relatively flat gross margins year-to-date.
Slide 7 shows the third quarter operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 3%. This was due to the slight decline in sales and the significant impact of rebasing incentive compensation. The rebasing reduced operating profit by 8 points in the quarter. We expect further improvement in North America's currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth in the fourth quarter.
Europe's operating profit increased by 3% in the third quarter. This growth was the result of deflation in commodities and strong productivity in cost of goods sold, and it also included an increase in brand building in the quarter. Operating profit in Latin America increased by 15% as a result of strong sales growth in the region, including the impact from Venezuela. While we did see some adverse shift in the timing of sales in certain parts of the region impacting our third quarter, we are growing volume and sales year-to-date.
Operating profit decreased by 20% in the Asia Pacific region. We are investing some Project K savings in this region to drive growth, so the result includes investment in our brands and capabilities.
Slide 8 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Year-to-date operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $580 million. This result includes year-to-date investment in Project K of approximately $260 million. And as I mentioned last quarter, cash cost for Project K in 2015 will be approximately $350 million, the most in any year of the project.
As you can see on the chart, we now expect full year cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of $100 million from our original estimate. This increase is due to accelerated performance of our supplier-financing initiative in the fourth quarter. In fact, we expect that this initiative will offset the approximately $350 million in full year cash costs for Project K.
Slide 9 shows our core working capital as a percentage of net sales. In the past, we have discussed our focus on working capital improvements and our supplier-financing initiative, in particular. Over the first 9 months of this year, we have reduced our core working capital as a percentage of sales by more than 1 point. And as I said, we expect accelerated progress on supplier financing in the fourth quarter, and we are also evaluating new initiatives to unlock even more cash from our working capital.
Slide 10 shows our guidance for 2015. We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We now expect gross margin for the year to be relatively flat also. We continue to expect that operating profit will decline by between 2% and 4%. And we also still expect that currency-neutral comparable earnings per share will be in a range between flat and down 2%. And results for both currency-neutral comparable operating profit and earnings per share still include a negative impact of 3 to 4 points from the resetting of incentive compensation.
The expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share do exclude the impact of items affecting comparability. Our expectation for the impact of foreign exchange translation is now approximately $0.31 a share, an increase from the $0.29 per share we expected last quarter. This change is due to the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling and the Australian dollar.
Our expectations for net interest expense have increased to between $225 million and $230 million, driven by slightly higher levels of debt associated with our acquisitions in Nigeria and Egypt. We now expect that the full year tax rate will be between 26% and 27%, which will cover the impact of higher interest cost and other below-the-line items.
Guidance for total capital spending remains in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately 1 point of sales for incremental capital to execute Project K. And we still expect share repurchases of approximately $700 million to $750 million for this year.
Slide 11 shows our full year earnings per share walk. Costs for the integration of acquisitions are still expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share, although they could be to the high end of that range given the recent acquisitions in Egypt and Nigeria. And we now anticipate that Project K's pretax profit and loss statement costs will be between $350 million and $400 million or approximately $0.70 to $0.80 per share for the year. We expect that 2/3 of these costs will be in cost of goods sold. The change in the expected cost is simply due to the timing of projects between years. Project K remains on track, and our estimate for savings in 2015 and 2016 has not changed.
Slide 12 shows our guidance for 2016. As we communicated on our Q2 call, we expect our currency-neutral comparable sales to be in our long-term guidance range for low single-digit growth. We also expect 4% to 6% growth in currency-neutral comparable operating profit. As we mentioned last quarter, if current sales growth trends continue, it could put us at the lower end of our long-term sales targets. But even if this happens, we will still meet our goals for operating profit growth due to the significant productivity programs we have underway. We expect currency-neutral comparable earnings per share growth of between 6% and 8%. And our outlook assumes a similar amount of share repurchases to the $700 million to $750 million we expect in 2015.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John for a discussion of operating performance by segment."

And now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. Results for the third quarter came in as we expected. The Kellogg brand gained share in the quarter and so continued sequential improvement and consumption. In fact, our total consumption was essentially flat, and we gained share. Importantly, category-based sales were up in the quarter, and we outpaced the category.
Our 6 core cereals grew in combination and gained share, Raisin Bran towards a double-digit growth due to great advertising and the popular Cranberry innovation. Overall, Mini-Wheats did well as core bite-size posted growth in both base and incremental sales, and our second half innovation did well, including Pumpkin Spice Mini-Wheats, which were a big hit.
As you can see on the chart, Special K continued to benefit from activity that began in the second quarter. The brand posted increased sales and share gains again, just as it did last quarter. And our adult cereals in total, which have been an area of softness, returned to growth.
And finally, for Morning Foods, we've had a great reception to the innovation we have planned for the first quarter. For example, we're launching Special K Nourish, which is a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients that consumer can see in the food. There are 2 SKUs in the U.S., Cranberry Coconut Almond and Apple Raspberry Almond, and both are made with a multigrain quinoa flake. So the food includes fruits, nuts and on-trend grains like quinoa. You remember that this ready-to-eat cereal has been very popular in other parts of the world, and retailer acceptance in the U.S. has been encouraging. We've got a lot of activity planned for launch, and we're excited about the potential.
Let's turn to Slide 14 and our U.S. Snacks business. Overall, we saw sequential improvement in the cracker, cookie, wholesome snack and Pringles businesses in the third quarter. In all channels, overall consumption of our crackers was essentially flat in the quarter, and our big 3 brands posted low single-digit consumption growth in measured channels. The Cheez-It brand posted consumption growth of 3%, driven by increased display and the success of 2 new products: Cheez-It Grooves and Extra Toasty. In addition, Cheez-It also grew base sales at a mid-single-digit rate, much faster than the category average.
The Club brand also posted increased consumption and share gains as the core business performed well, and the new Town House Focaccia also gained share and now holds 0.6 share of the overall category. Now Special K Cracker and Popcorn Chips, which have been an adverse headwind, continue to impact results. And while we're continuing to be impacted by past losses in distribution, the products we restaged early this year posted slight consumption growth in the quarter.
In the cookie category, the Fudge Shoppe, Chips Deluxe, Famous Amos, Fudge Stripes and Mother's brands all posted consumption growth in the quarter. We have some strong brands which respond well to activity, and we're encouraged by recent performance. We're pleased that we're seeing sequential improvement in the business, although we have been impacted by a decline in 100-calorie packs this year, as we've discussed before.
The wholesome snack business posted a low single-digit decline in consumption in measured channels plus the Club channel. And the Special K brand posted an increase in consumption of almost 3% across the same channels, driven by new Special K chewy nut bars.
The Pringles business posted low single-digit sales growth, building on high single-digit growth last year. Across all channels, including Club and Convenience combined, Pringles posted mid-single-digit growth in the quarter.
So the team is being -- has been doing a lot of work in each of the categories, and we're seeing sequential improvement as a result. There's a lot more to come as well, and we'll hear more about some of those plans at the Investor Day scheduled for later in the month.
Slide 15 shows highlights regarding the U.S. Specialty segment. Comparable net sales in the Specialty Channels increased by 6% in the quarter. The Foodservice, Convenience and Vending channels all posted growth. The Foodservice performance was driven by the growth of whole grain offerings in the K-through-12 school business.
The Convenience business had an easier comp last year due to customer lowering of inventory. In addition, we also saw excellent broad-based growth across the categories in the Convenience channel. And year-to-date, we're growing share in the cereal, cracker, wholesome snack and cookie categories.
Finally, for Specialty, the Pringles business also continues to do well. As you can see on the slide, our new Zip Dip product, Pringles and dip together, won the Retailer Choice Award for Best New Product in the Convenience Channel and helped the overall Pringles business post double-digit growth and gain share in Q3. The team continues to expect a strong fourth quarter for both sales and operating profit, and we're excited about our prospects for 2016.
Slide 16 highlights the performance of the North America Other segment, including the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. In the Frozen Foods business, our Eggo handheld sandwiches continued to perform well in the quarter. As you've seen in public data, consumption increased at a strong double-digit rate, and we gained share.
Elsewhere in the business, a number of items affected performance, including egg prices, network improvements, the timing of activity and the drawing down of inventories in anticipation of exciting change of packaging. We ended the third quarter with low levels of retail inventory, and we expect a continued impact in the fourth quarter with improvement in 2016.
The Kashi business is seeing stabilized distribution and sequential improvement in cereal consumption and share performance, although sales still declined. In cereal, our Sweet Potato Sunshine and Sprouted Grain cereals are doing well. In fact, overall consumption trends improved significantly as the year has progressed. In the latest data, year-to-date cereal consumption was down 13%. 12-week consumption was down 7%, and 4-week consumption was down only 3%. So the team has done a great job, and we're on track to return the business to growth in 2016. And we're increasingly confident about next year. We're focused on progressive nutrition and have some great introductions planned. In fact, our total weight of innovation in 2016 is twice what it has been in 2015.
And finally, net sales for the Canadian business increased in the quarter due to growth in wholesome snacks, Pringles and Frozen Foods, and we grew share in the cereal category. Unfortunately, the combination of the performance of Frozen Food and Kashi businesses led to a quarterly sales decline in the segment.
Let's turn to Slide 17 and our European business. The Pringles business in Europe posted strong double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. The base business posted growth, and the launch of Pringles Tortilla in the U.K. and Germany also contributed to the overall performance. In addition, we had strong commercial initiatives across the region, and we expect continued good performance in the fourth quarter, traditionally the quarter of the year with the highest level of sales.
We have exciting plans for the region's wholesome snack business in the fourth quarter and into 2016. As in many parts of the world, we are making significant investment in our food in Europe. This includes the relaunch of Special K bars, an extensive innovation that will include completely new foods with fruits, nuts and seeds.
The cereal business declined in the quarter as a result of continued difficult environment in the U.K. and parts of the continent. The focus for the team is to strengthen the overall plan and improve performance. With this in mind, we have included additional activity in the U.K. focused on Crunchy Nut, Krave, our porridge products, a tie-in with Star Wars and increased levels of holiday promotions. In addition, there's exciting activity coming in the first quarter. We're taking lessons learned from the U.S. and applying them in the region. We're adding more red berries in Special K, and we're launching new products, including cereals, mueslis and granolas and also launching Special K Nourish cereal.
Slide 18 shows highlights for our Latin American business. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales increased at a double-digit rate. Cereal sales in the region increased significantly, and we're seeing good volume growth and have held or increased year-to-date share in strategic businesses like Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. These share gains have been driven by children's and family brands and the introduction of Kellogg's branded granolas and mueslis.
Sales in the snack business also increased in the quarter, driven by innovation and go-to-market activity. And we're gaining year-to-date share in the wholesome snack businesses in Brazil and Colombia.
The Pringles business continued to perform well, and we've launched Pringles Tortilla in the region. And our initiative to drive sales in high-frequency stores continues to go well. We have gained year-to-date share in this channel in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil and have increased the number of stores we're reaching at a double-digit rate. There's a lot of opportunity in these channels in both the Latin American and Asian regions, and they will continue to be a focus for us next year.
The team in Latin America is expecting strong fourth quarter results due to the high-frequency store program, the continued impact of granolas and mueslis, new bars launching in Brazil, new Special K Protein in Mexico and some significant brand-building events across the region. Plans for 2016 include more great innovation and brand-building events. However, as you know, a number of countries are facing a slowdown in their economies, and while we have plans to deal with this and the impact of transactional foreign exchange, it will remain a headwind in 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 19 and our Asia Pacific business. We saw strong double-digit growth in the Asian business in the third quarter. The Indian business posted double-digit growth, driven by single-serve packs and strong results from the core brands. The Japanese business grew at a double-digit rate as a result of continued popularity of granola and packaging innovation, and the Korean business also grew at a double-digit rate. The business in sub-Saharan Africa and the Pringles business both posted high single-digit sales growth. On Pringles specifically, we continued to see great results in the region, and our activity and investment have gained traction. In addition, our new Pringles plant in Malaysia is performing well.
The overall Asia Pacific segment posted currency-neutral comparable sales growth of 2% in the quarter. The Australian business continues to be difficult, and we also faced the impact of differences in the year-on-year timing of promotions in the quarter. We expect declines in Australia to moderate in the fourth quarter, and we have plans for further improvement in 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 20 and comments on our JVs in Asia. Although they're not reported in Asia Pacific's results, both the Chinese and Nigerian businesses posted very strong growth in the quarter. In China, both cereal and snacks grew at a double-digit rate, and we gained share in the cereal category.
As you know, we announced in September our investment in West Africa. Specifically, we announced the acquisition of a 50% stake in Multipro, a premier sales and distribution company in Nigeria and Ghana. And we announced the creation of a snacks and breakfast joint venture across West Africa with Tolaram Africa, one of the largest food companies in the region. We are very excited about the investment as this region is experiencing explosive growth with a growing middle class. Nigeria alone has the largest population and economy in all of Africa.
At the time of the transaction, we announced that the total company sales for Multipro we expected to be approximately $750 million in 2015. Just to put that into perspective, our Asia Pacific business posted total sales of slightly less than $1 billion last year. So you can see the transformational impact this acquisition has on the region and why we're so excited about the potential. Amit Banati, our Head of Asia Pacific, will discuss both partnerships in more detail at the Investor Day. But I'll also say that we're very pleased to have these great relationships in place, and we're confident that they will be significant contributors to total corporate results in the years to come.
Let's turn to the summary on Page 21. Results for net sales growth and operating profit were in line with our expectations, and we continue to build momentum. Currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 1%, and currency-neutral comparable operating profit, excluding the impact of resetting incentive compensation, increased by approximately 6%. And we also increased guidance for full year cash flow.
In the quarter, we saw improving trends in our U.S. Cereal business. We saw a sequential improvement in our U.S. Snacks business. The Kashi brand continued to improve as we expected. Our international business continued to perform well. And importantly, our productivity programs continue to generate significant savings, and we are on track with both Project K and our zero-based budgeting initiatives. These 2 cost-savings programs, in conjunction with our underlying productivity programs, give us a significant amount of visibility into future results. So as I said, we are building momentum. The group performance in the third quarter and our visibility into increased efficiency give us confidence that we'll meet our targets for 2015, 2016 and beyond. We recognize that we have a lot to do, but we have a plan. We know we can achieve our targets. Our employees around the world are doing great work, and as always, I'd like to end by thanking them all.
And now I'll open up for questions."

Let me just clarify. The double the weight of innovation is actually a comment only for Kashi in 2016 here in the U.S. And we've done a lot to invest back into our innovation process as a company to improve the performance of our innovation. We established our global category team, so we have a longer-term innovation pipeline coming out of those global category teams. In the case of Kashi, specifically, pulling the team back in La Jolla, back in California, and allowing them to focus on the longer-term innovation to move at a faster pace as is required in that particular segment of the market is showing dividends. I think you've seen that in the Kashi business performance improving and also in that greater innovation coming through next year. And also, as you think about innovation, I think you can see more from us in the area of packaging as we try to hit the right package, price, product offering by channel, by market. So I think as you look at our innovation pipeline going forward, it's both a stronger pipeline in terms of we have a longer-term pipeline with our global category teams and a more diverse pipeline.

We have not started that work yet, but that should be beginning in 2016. We continue to have very good visibility to the $100 million of savings that we communicated on zero-based budgeting, and that's specifically in North America. And you may recall, we said we're interrogating around $2 billion worth of discretionary spend. Now that is just $2 billion within North America. So far, we've identified a number of things. We're looking across supply chain costs, supply chain overhead, distribution costs and SG&A as well. We've noted a number of areas around our policies and practices based on benchmarks that we have in this process. An example is travel and people-related costs. We found that we're investing, we're spending more money in some of those areas, and there's a great opportunity to pull back. We've interrogated professional services as well. And we're looking into brand building as well and dissecting our brand-building investment, both from a working perspective and a non-working perspective. One other thing that I do want to point out as well, as we get into 2016 and we provide more information on our guidance, we are unlikely to provide guidance around our gross margin percent and our brand-building percent to sales as well. Now let me assure you, both of these are absolutely critical to our business. We remain focused on investing behind our brands, in building our brands and maintaining a strong gross margin. But the advent of zero-based budgeting and how that may change the complexion of our profit and loss statement as well as the changing landscape, how you build brands, the shift of TV media to digital media as well and the investments we're putting back in our food make it difficult for us to provide specifics on those items."

We were seeing on breakfast -- we've actually seen consumption of breakfast at home growing. So it's not really the issue around QSRs, et cetera. It's more how we compete at that breakfast occasion at home. If you go back to the 2000s, obviously, our business and the category grew quite strongly. And what was growing our business at that time was the adult cereals. If you recall what's happened here more recently, those adult cereals, particularly Special K and Kashi, went quite soft. But in the third quarter, we actually saw adult cereals return back to growth. You're seeing Special K return to growth behind movement in positioning. It got caught in a little bit more of a diet positioning towards a wellness positioning now, with new foods coming out that support that. Kashi, between the team in California ramping up the innovation, staying on trend with foods that are evolving and emerging in the marketplace, and you're seeing how the innovation is starting to drive that business back to a better place. And then even in business like Raisin Bran, where we have a Cranberry innovation, some great advertising that's on trend. And we're seeing double-digit growth in that brand. So I think a lot of this has to do with what we are doing to drive our business. And quite frankly, the category performance is a combination of what manufacturers do rather than a determiner of how well manufacturers do. So if all manufacturers do better, the category does better."

All 3 of those are great investments, combination of snacks, emerging markets, et cetera. And so as you think about our M&A strategy, obviously, the intersection of snacks and emerging markets is a very interesting place for us to play. We also would look at M&A in a market like North America, in natural and other areas. That would be good bolt-ons to our business. On snacks itself, we have an outstanding DSD platform. It's a company-owned DSD platform. It's an advantaged platform compared to a lot of other DSD platforms out there, and we believe we have an opportunity to keep driving that platform over time.

So on the potential deflationary impact on cost of goods and how could that play out in the marketplace, if you look across our categories, our categories are very rational. They compete more on the quality of brands, on the quality of innovation, on ideas, on in-store execution. They are intensely competitive categories, but they're ones that tend to be fairly stable in pricing over time. So I feel good about the dynamic there and don't see that necessarily being disrupted. On the question of sales guidance, I think there's some -- maybe some confusion there. If we look at the company, we are building momentum. Last year, our sales -- internal sales went down around 2%. This year, we're around flat, and next year, we're giving guidance of 1% to 3%. So if you draw a straight line through that trend line, you get down 2%, flat, say, up 2%. The point we try to make on our guidance for next year is we don't need to deliver 2%, 3% sales growth in order to deliver the 4% to 6% operating profit growth. Our comment there was about the strength and visibility we have into our productivity programs. And so we believe that if we hit even the low end of our sales guidance, or even if we were flat on our sales performance next year, we can still -- we still have the visibility in those productivity programs to hit the 4% to 6% operating profit range. If I'd add to that -- if I'm thinking about our guidance for next year and you asked me the question where is the risk within that guidance, I think the risk is more on the sales guidance than in the operating profit guidance. It's another way of getting what we're trying to say."

In terms of innovation, they're renovating the current foods. And so when you ask the question, well, how much is that new versus the base? Take Special K Red Berries. Adding more red berries in Special K and reinforcing the berries in there really has had a very positive impact on the Special K business in the U.S. And so it's hard for me to tease apart what is food and what is nonfood-related.

Probably, we're spending a little bit of time talking about brand building. Obviously, brand building is critical to the long-term performance of the Kellogg Company, and the strength of our brands is something that we're absolutely focused on. And you can see that, that we have industry-leading levels of brand building, and we're committed to those bands. At the same time, we're seeing a transformational change in how you build brands. Think about the transformational changes we've seen in the past from print to radio to TV and now to social, mobile, digital, et cetera. And as you go through each of these transformational changes, the amount and how you spend brand building fundamentally changes. And so as we see people skipping more ads on TV, as we see people, particularly millennials, using their mobile devices, social media or et cetera having a larger impact, we have to change our brand-building model. And as we do this, we have to both identify what's not working as well as it has in the past and where should we invest more money. Now we see very good ROIs on digital-type spend, so we're seeing more of our money migrate in that direction. But because of this sea change, it's very hard for us to say where our brand building is going in the future. I certainly feel like we spend enough money on brand building. And so as we look, say, into 2016, we will have zero-based budgeting savings in brand building. Some or all of that will get reinvested back into brand building. But I don't think we need to continue to increase our brand building as such. And so our brand building as a percentage of sales may be flat, may even decline slightly. But don't take that as a lack of commitment to brand building. Take that as a recognition that how you build brands, how you engage with consumers as they engage with media differently is changing in such a pace here that we have to reevaluate our entire model and continue to push the edge on how much we need to spend to build these great brands."

So first of all, in Venezuela, let me remind you how that remeasurement has impacted our results, and then as well, there's a translational impact. So in the second quarter, we took a significant charge as a result of revaluing our balance sheet. We took a small charge as well in the third quarter of about $0.41 of earnings per share impact. It's more the transactional impact of remeasuring that business. Also in the third quarter, we would have taken the translational impact of remeasuring that business to the VEF 200 to the U.S. dollar. And that's roughly around $0.04 or so of earnings per share impact. And as I said, in terms of the sales impact, it was a little less than half of that 10-point impact to sales. As you think about what's happening in Latin America generally, there's no question that Venezuela drove the sales growth you saw in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our local currency growth ex Venezuela would be up low single digits. But it's worth remembering within that, that our Pringles business is a U.S. dollar-denominated business, and so what you're seeing there is actually U.S. dollar growth in Pringles as opposed to true local currency growth. Local currency Pringles is up double -- strong double digits. But that obviously translates to a very low U.S. dollar performance given where the exchange rates have moved. So it's actually kind of hard within our results to get back to a pure local currency ex Venezuela for Latin America. What I would say in Latin America is we are seeing a slowdown in economies in Latin America in general and in our business as well. We are gaining share in key businesses such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia. As we go into 2016, we expect this business to continue to be challenged a little bit with the macroeconomic headwinds of the exchange rate movements and how that's impacting consumer demand in the region."

So we were well over $200 million last year, approximately $350 million this year. So our cash requirements are a bit less as we move into 2016 and 2017 and then closing up in 2018. The other thing that I think is important to note, in both 2014 and 2015, we focused on our working capital improvements. And essentially, we have been able to offset that impact of the increased cash for Project K through working capital improvements and specifically, the supplier-financing initiative."

We are pleased that the momentum we've seen so far this year has continued to build through the third quarter. Total currency neutral comparable revenue growth of 1% was above our top line guidance for the full year and it builds on the flat growth we posted in the first half of the year. We saw sales respond to the investment we've made, continued stabilization in many of our businesses in the quarter and growth in the U.S. Specialty Channels, Canadian, Latin American and Asia Pacific businesses. In addition, we continue to make great progress with our productivity initiatives.
Overall currency neutral comparable operating profit was in line with our expectations and included a significant impact from this year's rebasing of incentive compensation. Ron will discuss this in more detail. But excluding this impact, currency neutral comparable operating profit growth would have been approximately 6% in the quarter.
We are raising our guidance for cash flow to $1.1 billion in 2015. We're on track to meet our guidance for currency neutral comparable sales, operating profit and earnings per share in 2015, and we will achieve these results while setting up an even better year in 2016.
The momentum we're building and our aggressive productivity programs give us confidence that we'll meet our long-term targets for currency neutral comparable net sales and operating profit growth in 2016 and beyond. We'll give you more color regarding our overall business at our Investor Day in a few weeks, but we're excited about the plans we have for each of our businesses and the performance we expect as a result.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results."

Currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 1%, greater than our full year guidance for growth. We saw strong growth across many of our emerging and developing markets in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe. We are pleased with the performance of our U.S. Cereal business. U.S. Snacks improved sequentially, and we grew in the U.S. Specialty Channel and Canadian businesses. And Pringles posted increased sales growth in each of our regions.
Reported net sales declined by 8.5% due to foreign currency translation. Comparable operating profit declined by 2.3%. However, as John mentioned, that decline includes a headwind from the rebasing of incentive compensation this year. Without this impact, comparable operating profit would have been 8 points higher and would have shown growth of approximately 6%. This reinforces our previous comments on the operating leverage in our business.
Reported operating profit was $334 million in the third quarter, including items affecting comparability, as detailed in the appendices to our presentation. Comparable earnings per share were $0.85 in the quarter, and these results include $0.11 of currency headwind. So currency neutral comparable earnings per share were $0.96, an increase of 2.1% from the third quarter last year.
Slide 5 shows the components of the quarter sales growth. We had good price/mix realization despite some adverse country mix in Europe and Asia Pacific. Overall, volume declined by 1.6%. And while volume declined in our U.S. Cereal and Snacks businesses, we continue to see signs of stabilization. The Asia Pacific region posted good volume growth, as did Mexico, the Mediterranean and Middle East regions and Specialty Channels in the U.S. And we continue to see strong volume performance from Pringles across the globe.
The impact of foreign exchange lowered reported net sales by almost 10%, driven by a wide basket of currencies. And note that our devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar at midyear represents almost half of the 10-point impact to sales.
Slide 6 shows details regarding our third quarter currency neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Gross margin in the third quarter improved by 20 basis points. Year-to-date, gross margin remain unchanged from last year.
Overall, commodity and packaging costs are deflationary, and our strong productivity initiatives, combined with Project K savings, are benefiting our supply chain costs. However, we are seeing continued higher transportation costs.
In addition, we are investing more money in our foods. Examples include our launch of granolas and mueslis across the globe and renovation of existing foods such as Special K. The combination of these factors has resulted in relatively flat gross margins year-to-date.
Slide 7 shows the third quarter operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's currency neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 3%. This was due to the slight decline in sales and a significant impact of rebasing incentive compensation. The rebasing reduced operating profit by 8 points in the quarter. We expect further improvement in North America's currency neutral comparable operating profit growth in the fourth quarter.
Europe's operating profit increased by 3% in the third quarter. This growth was the result of deflation in commodities and strong productivity and cost of goods sold, and it also included an increase in brand building in the quarter. Operating profit in Latin America increased by 15% as a result of strong sales growth in the region, including the impact from Venezuela. While we did see some adverse shift in the timing of sales in certain parts of the region impacting our third quarter, we are growing volume and sales year-to-date.
Operating profit decreased by 20% in the Asia Pacific region. We are investing some Project K savings in this region to drive growth, so the result includes investment in our brands and capabilities.
Slide 8 shows our year-to-date cash flow. Year-to-date operating cash flow after capital expenditure was $580 million. This result includes year-to-date investment in Project K of approximately $260 million. And as I mentioned last quarter, cash costs for Project K in 2015 will be approximately $350 million, the most in any year of the project.
As you can see on the chart, we now expect full year cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of $100 million from our original estimate. This increase is due to accelerated performance of our supplier-financing initiative in the fourth quarter. In fact, we expect that this initiative will offset the approximately $350 million in full year cash costs for Project K.
Slide 9 shows our core working capital as a percentage of net sales. In the past, we have discussed our focus on working capital improvements and our supplier-financing initiative, in particular. Over the first 9 months of this year, we have reduced our core working capital as a percentage of sales by more than 1 point. And as I said, we expect accelerated progress on supplier financing in the fourth quarter, and we are also evaluating new initiatives to unlock even more cash from our working capital.
Slide 10 shows our guidance for 2015. We continue to expect that net sales will be approximately flat for the year. We now expect gross margin for the year to be relatively flat also. We continue to expect that operating profit will decline by between 2% and 4%. And we also still expect that currency neutral comparable earnings per share will be in a range between flat and down 2%. And results for both currency neutral comparable operating profit and earnings per share still include a negative impact of 3 to 4 points from the resetting of incentive compensation.
The expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share do exclude the impact of items affecting comparability. Our expectation for the impact of foreign exchange translation is now approximately $0.31 a share, an increase from the $0.29 per share we expected last quarter. This change is due to the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling and the Australian dollar.
Our expectations for net interest expense have increased to between $225 million and $230 million, driven by slightly higher levels of debt associated with our acquisitions in Nigeria and Egypt. We now expect that the full year tax rate will be between 26% and 27%, which will cover the impact of higher interest cost and other below-the-line items.
Guidance for total capital spending remains in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including approximately 1 point of sales for incremental capital to execute Project K. And we still expect share repurchases of approximately $700 million to $750 million for this year.
Slide 11 shows our full year earnings per share walk. Costs for the integration of acquisitions are still expected to be between $0.04 and $0.06 per share, although they could be to the high end of that range given the recent acquisitions in Egypt and Nigeria. And we now anticipate that Project K's pretax profit and loss statement costs will be between $350 million and $400 million or approximately $0.70 to $0.80 per share for the year. We expect that 2/3 of these costs will be in cost of goods sold. The change in the expected costs is simply due to the timing of projects between years. Project K remains on track, and our estimate for savings in 2015 and 2016 has not changed.
Slide 12 shows our guidance for 2016. As we communicated on our Q2 call, we expect our currency neutral comparable sales to be in our long-term guidance range for low single-digit growth. We also expect 4% to 6% growth in currency neutral comparable operating profit. As we mentioned last quarter, if current sales growth trends continue, it could put us at the lower end of our long-term sales targets. But even if this happens, we will still meet our goals for operating profit growth due to the significant productivity programs we have underway. We expect currency neutral comparable earnings per share growth of between 6% and 8%. And our outlook assumes a similar amount of share repurchases to the $700 million to $750 million we expect in 2015.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John for a discussion of operating performance by segment."
283356,311248873,890567,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Ron.

And now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. Results for the third quarter came in as we expected. The Kellogg brand gained share in the quarter and saw continued sequential improvement in consumption. In fact, our total consumption was essentially flat, and we gained share. Importantly, category base sales were up in the quarter, and we outpaced the category.
Our 6 core cereals grew in combination and gained share, Raisin Bran posted double-digit growth due to great advertising and the popular Cranberry innovation. Overall, Mini-Wheats did well as core bite-size posted growth in both base and incremental sales, and our second half innovation did well, including Pumpkin Spice Mini-Wheats, which were a big hit.
As you can see on the chart, Special K continued to benefit from activity that began in the second quarter. The brand posted increased sales and share gains again, just as it did last quarter. And our adult cereals in total, which have been an area of softness, returned to growth.
And finally, for Morning Foods, we've had a great reception to the innovation we have planned for the first quarter. For example, we're launching Special K Nourish, which is a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients the consumer can see in the food. There are 2 SKUs in the U.S., cranberry coconut almond and apple raspberry almond, and both are made with a multigrain quinoa flake. So the food includes fruits, nuts and on-trend grains like quinoa. You remember that this ready-to-eat cereal has been very popular in other parts of the world, and retailer acceptance in the U.S. has been encouraging. We've got a lot of activity planned for launch, and we're excited about the potential.
Let's turn to Slide 14 and our U.S. Snacks business. Overall, we saw sequential improvement in the cracker, cookie, wholesome snack and Pringles businesses in the third quarter. In all channels, overall consumption of our crackers was essentially flat in the quarter, and our big 3 brands posted low single-digit consumption growth in measured channels. The Cheez-It brand posted consumption growth of 3%, driven by increased display and the success of 2 new products: Cheez-It Grooves and Extra Toasty. In addition, Cheez-It also grew base sales at a mid-single-digit rate, much faster than the category average.
The Club brand also posted increased consumption and share gains as the core business performed well, and the new Town House Focaccia also gained share and now holds 0.6 share of the overall category. Now Special K Cracker and Popcorn Chips, which have been an adverse headwind, continue to impact results. And while we continue to be impacted by past losses in distribution, the products we restaged early this year posted slight consumption growth in the quarter.
In the cookie category, the Fudge Shoppe, Chips Deluxe, Famous Amos, Fudge Stripes and Mother's brands all posted consumption growth in the quarter. We have some strong brands which respond well to activity, and we're encouraged by recent performance. We're pleased that we're seeing sequential improvement in the business, although we have been impacted by a decline in 100-calorie packs this year, as we've discussed before.
The wholesome snack business posted a low single-digit decline in consumption in measured channels plus the Club channel. And the Special K brand posted an increase in consumption of almost 3% across the same channels, driven by new Special K chewy nut bars.
The Pringles business posted low single-digit sales growth, building on high single-digit growth last year. Across all channels, including Club and Convenience combined, Pringles posted mid-single-digit growth in the quarter.
So the team is being -- has been doing a lot of work in each of the categories, and we're seeing sequential improvement as a result. There's a lot more to come as well, and we'll hear more about some of those plans at the Investor Day scheduled for later in the month.
Slide 15 shows highlights regarding the U.S. Specialty segment. Comparable net sales in the Specialty Channels increased by 6% in the quarter. The Foodservice, Convenience and Vending channels all posted growth. The Foodservice performance was driven by the growth of whole grain offerings in the K-through-12 school business.
The Convenience business had an easier comp last year due to a customer lowering of inventory. In addition, we also saw excellent broad-based growth across the categories in the Convenience channel. And year-to-date, we've grown share in the cereal, cracker, wholesome snack and cookie categories.
Finally, for Specialty, the Pringles business also continues to do well. As you can see on the slide, our new Zip Dip product, Pringles and dip together, won the Retailer Choice Award for Best New Product in the Convenience Channel and helped the overall Pringles business post double-digit growth and gain share in Q3. The team continues to expect a strong fourth quarter for both sales and operating profit, and we're excited about our prospects for 2016.
Slide 16 highlights the performance of the North America Other segment, including the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. In the Frozen Foods business, our Eggo handheld sandwiches continued to perform well in the quarter. As you've seen in public data, consumption increased at a strong double-digit rate, and we gained share.
Elsewhere in the business, a number of items affected performance, including egg prices, network improvements, the timing of activity and the drawing down of inventories in anticipation of an exciting change to packaging. We ended the third quarter with low levels of retail inventory, and we expect a continued impact in the fourth quarter with improvement in 2016.
The Kashi business is seeing stabilized distribution and sequential improvement in cereal consumption and share performance, although sales still declined. In cereal, our Sweet Potato Sunshine and Sprouted Grain cereals are doing well. In fact, overall consumption trends improved significantly as the year has progressed. In the latest data, year-to-date cereal consumption was down 13%. 12-week consumption was down 7%, and 4-week consumption was down only 3%. So the team has done a great job, and we're on track to return the business to growth in 2016. And we're increasingly confident about next year. We're focused on progressive nutrition and have some great introductions planned. In fact, our total weight of innovation in 2016 is twice what it has been in 2015.
And finally, net sales for the Canadian business increased in the quarter due to growth in wholesome snacks, Pringles and Frozen Foods, and we grew share in the cereal category. Unfortunately, the combination of the performance of the Frozen Food and Kashi businesses led to a quarterly sales decline in the segment.
Let's turn to Slide 17 and our European business. The Pringles business in Europe posted strong double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. The base business posted growth, and the launch of Pringles Tortilla in the U.K. and Germany also contributed to the overall performance. In addition, we had strong commercial initiatives across the region, and we expect continued good performance in the fourth quarter, traditionally the quarter of the year for our highest level of sales.
We have exciting plans for the region's wholesome snack business in the fourth quarter and into 2016. As in many parts of the world, we are making significant investment in our food in Europe. This includes the relaunch of Special K bars, an extensive innovation that will include completely new foods with fruits, nuts and seeds.
The cereal business declined in the quarter as a result of continued difficult environment in the U.K. and parts of the continent. The focus for the team is to strengthen the overall plan and improve performance. With this in mind, we have included additional activity in the U.K. focused on Crunchy Nut, Krave, our porridge products, a tie-in with Star Wars and increased levels of holiday promotions. In addition, there's exciting activity coming in the first quarter. We're taking lessons learned from the U.S. and applying them in the region. We're adding more red berries in Special K, and we're launching new products, including cereals, mueslis and granolas and also launching Special K Nourish cereal.
Slide 18 shows highlights for our Latin American business. Total currency neutral comparable net sales increased at a double-digit rate. Cereal sales in the region increased significantly, and we're seeing good volume growth and have held or increased year-to-date share in strategic businesses like Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. These share gains have been driven by children's and family brands and the introduction of Kellogg's branded granolas and mueslis.
Sales in the snack business also increased in the quarter, driven by innovation and go-to-market activity. And we've gained year-to-date share in the wholesome snack businesses in Brazil and Colombia.
The Pringles business continued to perform well, and we've launched Pringles Tortilla in the region. And our initiative to drive sales in high-frequency stores continues to go well. We have gained year-to-date share in this channel in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil and have increased the number of stores we're reaching at a double-digit rate. There's a lot of opportunity in these channels in both the Latin American and Asian regions, and they will continue to be a focus for us next year.
The team in Latin America is expecting strong fourth quarter results due to the high-frequency store program, the continued impact of granolas and mueslis, new bars launching in Brazil, new Special K Protein in Mexico and some significant brand-building events across the region. Plans for 2016 include more great innovation and brand-building events. However, as you know, a number of countries are facing a slowdown in their economies, and while we have plans to deal with this and the impact of transactional foreign exchange, it will remain a headwind in 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 19 and our Asia Pacific business. We saw strong double-digit growth in the Asian business in the third quarter. The Indian business posted double-digit growth, driven by single-serve packs and strong results from the core brands. The Japanese business grew at a double-digit rate as a result of continued popularity of granola and packaging innovation, and the Korean business also grew at a double-digit rate. The business in sub-Saharan Africa and the Pringles business both posted high single-digit sales growth. On Pringles specifically, we continued to see great results in the region, and our activity and investment have gained traction. In addition, our new Pringles plant in Malaysia is performing well.
The overall Asia Pacific segment posted currency neutral comparable sales growth of 2% in the quarter. The Australian business continues to be difficult, and we also faced the impact of differences in the year-on-year timing of promotions in the quarter. We expect declines in Australia to moderate in the fourth quarter, and we have plans for further improvement in 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 20 and comments on our JVs in Asia. Although they're not reported in Asia Pacific's results, both the Chinese and Nigerian businesses posted very strong growth in the quarter. In China, both cereal and snacks grew at a double-digit rate, and we gained share in the cereal category.
As you know, we announced in September our investment in West Africa. Specifically, we announced the acquisition of a 50% stake in Multipro, a premier sales and distribution company in Nigeria and Ghana. And we announced the creation of a snacks and breakfast joint venture across West Africa with Tolaram Africa, one of the largest food companies in the region. We are very excited about the investment as this region is experiencing explosive growth with a growing middle class. Nigeria alone has the largest population and economy in all of Africa.
At the time of the transaction, we announced that the total company sales for Multipro were expected to be approximately $750 million in 2015. Just to put that into perspective, our Asia Pacific business posted total sales of slightly less than $1 billion last year. So you can see the transformational impact this acquisition has on the region and why we're so excited about the potential. Amit Banati, our Head of Asia Pacific, will discuss both partnerships in more detail at the Investor Day. But I will say that we're very pleased to have these great relationships in place, and we're confident that they will be significant contributors to total corporate results in the years to come.
Let's turn to the summary on Page 21. Results for net sales growth and operating profit were in line with our expectations, and we continue to build momentum. Currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 1%, and currency neutral comparable operating profit, excluding the impact of resetting incentive compensation, increased by approximately 6%. And we also increased guidance for full year cash flow.
In the quarter, we saw improving trends in our U.S. Cereal business. We saw a sequential improvement in our U.S. Snacks business. The Kashi brand continued to improve as we expected. Our international business continued to perform well. And importantly, our productivity programs continue to generate significant savings, and we are on track with both Project K and our zero-based budgeting initiatives. These 2 cost-savings programs, in conjunction with our underlying productivity programs, give us a significant amount of visibility into future results. So as I said, we are building momentum. The good performance in the third quarter and our visibility into increased efficiency give us confidence that we'll meet our targets for 2015, 2016 and beyond. We recognize that we have a lot to do, but we have a plan. We know we can achieve our targets. Our employees around the world are doing great work, and as always, I'd like to end by thanking them all.
And now I'll open up for questions."

In the case of Kashi, specifically, pulling the team back in La Jolla, back in California, and allowing them to focus on the longer-term innovation to move at a faster pace as is required in that particular segment of the market is showing dividends. I think you've seen that in the Kashi business performance improving and also in that greater innovation coming through next year. And also, as you think about innovation, I think you can see more from us in the area of packaging as we try to hit the right package, price, product offering by channel, by market. So I think as you look at our innovation pipeline going forward, it's both a stronger pipeline in terms of we have a longer-term pipeline with our global category teams and it's a more diverse pipeline. And there's not just more food, it's food, it's packaging, it's in the core parts of the business, as well as in the leading segments of the business as well."

We have not started that work yet, but that should be beginning in 2016. We continue to have very good visibility to the $100 million of savings that we communicated on zero-based budgeting, and that's specifically in North America. And you may recall, we said we're interrogating around $2 billion worth of discretionary spend. Now that is just $2 billion within North America. So far, we've identified a number of things. We're looking across supply chain costs, supply chain overhead, distribution costs and SG&A as well. We've noted a number of areas around our policies and practices based on benchmarks that we have in this process. An example is travel and people-related costs. We found that we're investing, we're spending more money in some of those areas, and there's a great opportunity to pull back. We've interrogated professional services as well. And we're looking into brand building as well and dissecting our brand-building investment, both from a working perspective and a non-working perspective. One other thing that I do want to point out as well, as we get into 2016 and we provide more information on our guidance, we are unlikely to provide guidance around our gross margin percent and our brand-building percent to sales as well. Now let me assure you, both of these are absolutely critical to our business. We remain focused on investing behind our brands, in building our brands and maintaining a strong gross margin. But the advent of zero-based budgeting and how that may change the complexion of our profit and loss statement, as well as the changing landscape, how you build brands, the shift of TV media to digital media as well and the investments we're putting back in our food make it difficult for us to provide specifics on those items."

But it's in the third quarter, we actually saw our adult cereals return back to growth. You're seeing Special K return to growth behind movement in positioning. It got caught in a little bit more of a diet positioning, towards a wellness positioning now, with new foods coming out that support that. Kashi, between the team in California ramping up the innovation, staying on trend with foods that are evolving and emerging in the marketplace, and you're seeing how the innovation is starting to drive that business back to a better place.

So on the potential deflationary impact on cost of goods and how could that play out in the marketplace, if you look across our categories, our categories are very rational.

They are intensely competitive categories, but they're ones that tend to be fairly stable in pricing over time. So I feel good about the dynamic there and don't see that necessarily being disrupted. On the question of sales guidance, I think there's some -- maybe some confusion there. If you look at the company, we are building momentum. Last year, our sales -- internal sales went down around 2%. This year, we're around flat, and next year, we're giving guidance of 1% to 3%. So if you draw a straight line through that trend line, you get down 2%, flat, say, up 2%. The point we tried to make on our guidance for next year is we don't need to deliver 2%, 3% sales growth in order to deliver the 4% to 6% operating profit growth. Our comment there was about the strength and visibility we have into our productivity programs. And so we believe that if we hit even the low end of our sales guidance, or even if we were flat on our sales performance next year, we can still -- we still have the visibility in those productivity programs to hit the 4% to 6% operating profit range.

I think we are seeing the brand make that transition to more of a wellness brand -- weight wellness brand than a diet brand. The turnaround in Special K, of course, is not just that positioning in isolation. It's also changing the food, in some cases, to be consistent with that positioning. I think where we've made changes to our food, we've seen even more progress than where we have some legacy foods in place. A lot of the food changes, though, are not just new foods. In terms of innovation, they're renovating the current foods. And so when you ask the question, well, how much is that new versus the base? Take Special K Red Berries. Adding more red berries in Special K and reinforcing the berries in there really has had a very positive impact on the Special K business in the U.S. And so it's hard for me to tease apart what is food and what is nonfood-related. But the good news is we're definitely seeing people respond to that program, not just here in the U.S. but also in Canada, and we're seeing the brand do better."

It's probably worth spending a little bit of time talking about brand building. Obviously, brand building is critical to the long-term performance of the Kellogg Company, and the strength of our brands is something that we're absolutely focused on. And you can see that, in that we have industry leading levels of brand building, and we're committed to those bands. At the same time, we are seeing a transformational change in how you build brands. Think about the transformational changes we've seen in the past from print to radio to TV and now to social, mobile, digital, et cetera. And as you go through each of these transformational changes, the amount and how you spend brand building fundamentally changes. And so as we see people skipping more ads on TV, as we see people, particularly millennials, using their mobile devices, social media, et cetera having a larger impact, we have to change our brand-building model. And as we do this, we have to both identify what's not working as well as it has in the past and where should we invest more money. Now, we see very good ROIs on digital-type spend, so we're seeing more of our money migrate in that direction. But because of this sea change, it's very hard for us to say where our brand building is going in the future. I certainly feel like we spend enough money on brand building. And so as we look, say, into 2016, we will have zero-based budgeting savings in brand building. Some or all of that will get reinvested back into brand building. But I don't think we need to continue to increase our brand building as such. And so our brand building as a percentage of sales may be flat, may even decline slightly. But we -- don't take that as a lack of commitment to brand building. Take that as a recognition that how you build brands, how you engage with consumers as they engage with media differently is changing at such a pace here that we have to reevaluate our entire model and continue to push the edge on how much we need to spend to build these great brands."

So in the second quarter, we took a significant charge as a result of revaluing our balance sheet. We took a small charge as well in the third quarter. With about $0.41 of earnings per share impact, it's more the transactional impact of remeasuring that business. Also, in the third quarter, we would have taken the translational impact of remeasuring that business to the VEF 200 to the U.S. dollar. And that's roughly around $0.04 or so of earnings per share impact. And as I said, in terms of the sales impact, it was a little less than half of that 10-point impact to sales."

But it's worth remembering within that, that our Pringles business is a U.S. dollar-denominated business, and so what you're seeing there is actually U.S. dollar growth in Pringles as opposed to true local currency growth. Local currency Pringles is up double -- strong double digits. But that obviously translates to a very low U.S. dollar performance given where the exchange rates have moved. So it's actually kind of hard within our results to get back to a pure local currency ex Venezuela for Latin America. What I would say in Latin America is we are seeing a slowdown in economies in Latin America in general and in our business as well. We are gaining share in key businesses such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia. As we go into 2016, we expect this business to continue to be challenged a little bit with the macroeconomic headwinds of the exchange rate movements and how that's impacting consumer demand in the region."
