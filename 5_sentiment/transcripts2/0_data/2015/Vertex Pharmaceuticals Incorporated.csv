And we made significant progress this past year in establishing a foundation for sustainable growth. First, we expanded the number of patients treated with KALYDECO through geographic and label expansion efforts. Second, we announced positive data from our Phase III studies of lumacaftor ivacaftor and submitted an NDA in the U.S. and MAA in the EU, paving the way to treat significantly more people with CF.
Third, we continue to manage our financial position, ending the year with approximately $1.4 billion in cash to support the future of our business. These accomplishments have fundamentally changed the outlook for our business and increased our confidence in the company's plans for the future and for people with CF and their families.
I had the opportunity to meet with many of our investors and analysts at the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference earlier this month and to talk about our strategy. So let me remind everyone about our priorities for 2015. First, approval and successful launch of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination while continuing to increase KALYDECO revenues, enabling us to treat even more people with CF and to accelerate our revenue growth. Second, significantly advancing our CF pipeline with a focus on next-generation medicines that have the potential to create regimens that may increase the benefit for CF patients. And third, expanding and diversifying our pipeline into other areas as evidenced by multiple programs advancing into the clinic during 2015.
If we are successfully meeting our goals, we expect to deliver to Vertex and its shareholders, a long-term financial profile that includes significant revenue and earnings growth.
Before turning the call over to Stuart, I wanted to take the opportunity to mention how proud we are at Vertex to be at the forefront of a new approach in developing medicines, broadly referred to as precision medicine. KALYDECO and hopefully soon, the combination of lumacaftor/ivacaftor are benefiting CF patients around the world and demonstrating the potential of this approach in developing medicines. We are pleased that our successes provided part of the basis for new research initiatives, discussed for the first time in the State of the Union address last week, to apply precision medicine approaches across a broad range of businesses. And we look forward to working closely with regulators and other government entities to apply the learnings of precision medicine so that we can help more patients and do it faster. With that, I'll turn it over to Stuart."

Tonight I'll review the sales performance of KALYDECO in 2014 and outline our expectations for KALYDECO in 2015 that reflect strong underlying demand and the positive impact of label and geographic expansion. I will also",718,"Thanks, Jeff and hello, everyone. Tonight I'll review the sales performance of KALYDECO in 2014 and outline our expectations for KALYDECO in 2015 that reflect strong underlying demand and the positive impact of label and geographic expansion. I will also discuss our progress in preparing for the approval and launch of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination. 
KALYDECO has shown rapid growth since it was approved in 2012. Product sales increased 25% in 2014 to $464 million. At the start of 2014, nearly all eligible patients with the G551D mutation in the U.S. and Europe were being treated with KALYDECO. Growth in 2014 was driven by both additional patients initiating therapy in new and existing international markets and the U.S. approval of KALYDECO for use in 8 additional mutations.
Turning to 2015, there are again multiple potential growth drivers based on achieving reimbursement approvals and further label expansions. In the first half of 2015, we expect rapid uptake of KALYDECO by eligible patients in Australia, following the completion of reimbursement discussions in late 2014. There are more than 200 children and adults with CF who are expected to be eligible for treatment.
In the U.S. KALYDECO  was approved for use in children and adults ages 6 and older with the R117H mutation on December 29 last year. The first patients have already initiated treatment and we expect to see continued uptake in the months ahead.
In the second half of 2015, we expect to see the revenue impact from achieving reimbursement for gating mutations in some European countries. We also anticipate a potential approval in children with CF ages 2 to 5 with the G551D or other gating mutations in the U.S., which would be a growth driver in the second half of 2015. As a result, we expect the number of patients eligible for KALYDECO to increase from 3,100 today to more than 3,700 by the end of this year. Although all eligible patients will not be on treatment by the end of the year and the enrollment of the VX-661 pivotal study in gating patients will have an adverse impact on patients receiving commercial product, we expect another year of significant revenue growth and KALYDECO net sales in the range of $560 million to $580 million in 2015.
Now to the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. We submitted the NDA and MAA in the U.S. and EU, respectively in November 2014 for children and adults with CF ages 12 and older to have 2 copies of the F5 08 Dell mutation. In the U.S. we received prior to review, with a PDUFA date of July 5, 2015. In the EU, we were granted accelerated assessment and we anticipate EU approval around Q4 of this year if discussions with regulators progress as expected. Following regulatory approval in the EU, individual reimbursement discussions will begin on a country by country basis.
I'm pleased to report our launch planning is on track. There are around 8,500 F5 08 Dell homozygous patients ages 12 years and older in the U.S. who are treated in approximately 275 CF centers. This represents an order of magnitude more patients than we currently treat. A key priority for us ahead of launch in the U.S. is to scale up our patient services team so that we can help providers and patients navigate the reimbursement process and also help with patient education and compliance. We have been adding case managers and we are also working to understand how CF centers plan to manage patient initiations.
We are investing in disease education to help payers estimate the number of eligible patients they may have in their plans and also from a medical perspective, to understand cystic fibrosis as a disease, its impact on patients and caregivers and the systemic effects of CFTR modulation.
Internationally, we are building out the required infrastructure in new and existing European markets to support the lumacaftor/ivacaftor launch. Infrastructure for each new country consists of a small number of medical and commercial staff. 
In summary, geographical and label extension will continue to drive significant growth in KALYDECO sales and we are well-positioned for long-term revenue growth as the number of people we treat with CF significantly increases with the launch of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination later this year. I'll now hand the call over to Ian."
36235,281186192,750425,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening to everyone. Tonight I would like to discuss our 2014 results then our 2015 guidance and how that puts us on track for long-term sustainable revenue and earnings growth. I'll be brief on the 2014 results and for a more det",812,"Thanks, Stuart, and good evening to everyone. Tonight I would like to discuss our 2014 results then our 2015 guidance and how that puts us on track for long-term sustainable revenue and earnings growth. I'll be brief on the 2014 results and for a more detailed discussion of these results, please refer to our press release we issued earlier today.
2014 financial performance was marked by the continuing growth in KALYDECO revenues, controlling the level of our operating expenses and completing the year with a strong balance sheet. As we look to 2015 and beyond, we see revenue growth continuing based on treating more patients with KALYDECO and then accelerating this revenue growth with the potential approval and launch of the lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination. As we anticipate this growth in our CF revenues, we also expect to control the level of operating investments into our company. We anticipate that this will enable us to deliver a future financial profile that includes high operating margins and significant earnings growth.
Now to the 2014 results. We generated $536 million in total non-GAAP revenues in 2014, including $464 million in KALYDECO revenues. This was a significant increase over 2013 KALYDECO revenues and we expect this growth to continue. We also recorded $72 million in royalty and collaborative revenues, including $35 million in revenue from the outlicense of VX-787 on novel flu medicine to Janssen.
When looking at the main components of our non-GAAP operating expenses, our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $920 million in 2014, a decrease of $177 million compared to the prior year. This decrease reflects our prioritization towards CF medicines and continued focus on managing operating expenses.
The non-GAAP loss was $511 million or $2.17 per share compared to prior year loss of $203 million. This increased loss was the result of significantly reduced HCV revenues from 2013 and they are now excluded from our 2014 non-GAAP financials.
With the expectation of increasing CF revenues in 2015 and controlling our operating expenses, we see 2014 as a transition year into revenue growth and future profitability.
Now let's turn to 2015 and our financial guidance for the year and specifically KALYDECO revenues and the main components of our operating expenses. With the recent regulatory submissions and approvals for reimbursement, KALYDECO is well-positioned for 2015. We expect KALYDECO net revenues to be in the range of $560 million to $580 million as we continue to expand the number of patients we treat. Next, to the lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination. We look forward to this midyear launch to further accelerate our revenue growth. However, the revenues from this launch will be primarily US-based in 2015.
Based on regulatory timelines in the EU and the subsequent reimbursement time lines, we anticipate the first commercial revenues from ex U.S. territories will likely go in 2016. Now to the main components of our operating expenses. As previously announced, we expect the combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense will be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion for the full year and we expect these expenses to be fairly consistent each quarter of this year. We expect the non-GAAP R&D expense to be in the range of $770 million to $800 million, an increase of $75 million to $105 million compared to the prior year.
Now breaking down the R&D spend into its principal components. We expect to spend approximately $200 million investing in R or basic research to support the creation of future transformational medicines and specifically in CF. We expect to progress a next-generation corrector into the clinic later this year. This is very similar to basic research spending in prior years.
Now to the D or development spend, which we expect to be between $570 million and $600 million and this is primarily driven by CF clinical programs. More specifically, the Phase III pivotal program with VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor and the ongoing investment in lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination to patients who remain on long-term extension study. Other areas of focus for Vertex in research and development are programs in oncology and neurology, an expectation that certain programs will enter and advance in the clinic in 2015 is Incorporated into our guidance.
Turning now to 2015 SG&A guidance. We expect to spend $280 million to $300 million, which is an increase of $55 million to $75 million compared to 2014. The increase reflects cross-cultural investment in supporting ivacaftor/lumacaftor combination launch and establishing a larger international presence as we significantly increase the number of patients we expect to treat with our medicines.
I'll close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering a financial profile consistent with our large cut biotech peers and move forward to updating you on the execution of our strategy throughout this year. With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

The way we're thinking about the heterozygotes and in terms of 661 and KALYDECO is really in 2 buckets. You remember last year, we published a Phase II study. And adding 661 to KALYDECO in patients who had a 508 allele mutation on 1 allele and some sort of gating mutation, that gets G551D on the other allele and we're able to show, if you remember, that once those patients, once they're stable on KALYDECO, if we added 661, we saw greater than a 4.5% improvement in absolute FEV1. And so the first part of the heterozygotes strategy that we're going to test in the Phase III program is basically a pivotal program around that population where we're trying to maximize the benefit that we can bring by adding 661 to KALYDECO in patients who are heterozygotes from 508 and the gating allele. And so if you think about that population, it's about 80% of all gating patients who have 508 on the other allele. The other population is what we call the heterozygotes, min population, not a very good term, I admit. But its patients have 508 on one allele and basically a non-KALYDECO responsive mutation on the other allele. So about 1,700 patients worldwide. As we've said, this is the hardest to treat population because those patients express half of the amount of the delta 508 protein than a delta 508 homozygote expresses, so they need better correction. 
We know, for example, that 809-plus KALYDECO doesn't work in that population. We looked at that in our TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT trials, you'll remember. So we're taking a two-pronged approach for these patients. Because today, they don't have any CFTR correction therapy, we're going to take an admittedly high risk but more rapid approach and try them with 661 plus KALYDECO, the 2-drug combination as part of our pivotal program and we'll start the program, as we said, in the first half of this year. The idea there is if we can see an effect, then we'll be able to get the medicines to patients much more quickly. But the high probability approach we're taking is the 3-drug combination and that's where we take 661 KALYDECO and the next-generation corrector, our cell based data suggest that will work in this population with a higher probability but, of course, that's slower because our next-generation corrector is in our lead optimization now and our goal to put the first of those and perhaps multiple in the clinic this year. And so that's the high probability but longer-term approach."

One is that in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, we had 2 doses in that study which obviously complicates the sizing of the studies and that's a very big difference and we were very pleased to be able to focus on one dose as we move 661 into phase III.

So in terms of a destination, if I can describe it that way in terms of the overall level of uptake we're anticipating, we expect the level of uptake, the peak penetration, if you want to think of it that way, to be very high for the lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination, based on the things that you already know. It's an incredibly serious disease. The F5 08 dell mutation is a serious form of the disease and there aren't any other treatment options currently available to treat the underlying course of the disease. So everything we know about the profile of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and the reaction it has had from patients and providers since the Phase III data became available is very positive. So we're expecting the peak uptake to be very significant. In terms of the rate of uptake, I'm anticipating it's going to be lower than with G551D and really, that's just driven by the sheer volume of patients. You have to think about here, in the U.S. there's about 1,000 G551D patients that's treated at about 250 to 275 CF centers, that's on average, 3 or 4 patients per center. You think about the F5 08 Dell homozygotes population 12 and above, it's about an 8, 500 patients, so nearly in order of magnitude, greater, that's more like 30 patients per CF center on average. And so just the sheer volume of patients in the effort that goes into initiating a new patient on the therapy, the education, the counseling, navigating the reimbursement process, is going to take a significant amount of time and just the sheer volume of patients, I think, is going to lead to the absolute rate of uptake to be somewhat lower than we saw with G551D which you know well know was virtually vertical."

As you noted that we are going to roll about 120 patients in the initial cohort, were going to then pause enrollment and clinical data from those patients will be collected and be reviewed by the DMC. We won't actually here at Vertex be seeing that data will be conducted independently by the DFC. And the goal of that is actually too assisted probability whether we can actually know from that amount of data that it is low probability, that it's unlikely that, that combination is going to be beneficial for the patients. If that's the case, the SMB will tell us and we'll stop the study. If they see something that we cannot conclude that, then we will restart enrollment and complete the study. And that's really the way it's going to roll out. I would also note that even if the study continues, we don't know for sure and we really won't know that the study is going to be positive until we get to the end.

It helps me to talk more broadly about, let's say the direction of our operating or expected direction of the operating investment. Clearly, there's a great expectation on our revenue line, which is significant growth. But as we look at the operating expense line moving from 2014 into 2015, but then onwards, we see this increase from '14 into '15 as I described in my remarks earlier today. And that's because we are doing practically 2 Phase III studies through along, a lot of 2015. But then also, we're supporting the launch of ivacaftor and lumacaftor to treat many more patients. And those are driving the increase between 2014 and '15. However, as we look at '15 into '16 and '17, we see relatively little additional costs and the reason for that is because the company is now tried to move into a steady-state and when you look at all different aspects of the company that drive the resulting operating expense, we start becoming a study state in that we are committed to our levels of research, we like what we've got going on in our research, we like the productivity and production of the molecules that come from our research investment. Our development pipeline or our clinical pipeline is Phase I assets go to phase III assets and we expect that to continue to roll so as a Phase III program comes to an end, we hope that a Phase II program ends with a Phase III. So it rolls. And then as far as the SG&A is concerned, while our infrastructure already exists for the company to scale it and then as Stuart mentioned, with the launch of the ivacaftor lumacaftor, we are building up commercial infrastructure globally. But that starts to hit steady-states as well to serve the patients that we think we will treat in the future. So it helps to understand why we'd look into 2016 and '17 and talk about controlling the operating expense once we make this increased investment from 2014 into 2015. For that reason, bringing it backwards at a growth of the revenue line, we do believe that in future years and the successful launch of ivacaftor lumacaftor, that we do actually turn to profitability and growth in earnings and cash flow. And we look for the high operating margins."

And we made significant progress this past year in establishing a foundation for sustainable growth. First, we expanded the number of patients treated with KALYDECO through geographic and label expansion efforts. Second, we announced positive data from our Phase III studies of lumacaftor, ivacaftor and submitted an NDA in the U.S. and MAA in the EU, paving the way to treat significantly more people with CF.
Third, we continue to manage our financial position, ending the year with approximately $1.4 billion in cash to support the future of our business. These accomplishments have fundamentally changed the outlook for our business and increased our confidence in the company's plans for the future and for people with CF and their families.
I had the opportunity to meet with many of our investors and analysts at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference earlier this month and to talk about our strategy. So let me remind everyone about our priorities for 2015. First, approval and successful launch of the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination while continuing to increase KALYDECO revenues, enabling us to treat even more people with CF and to accelerate our revenue growth. Second, significantly advancing our CF pipeline with a focus on next-generation medicines that have the potential to create regimens that may increase the benefit for CF patients. And third, expanding and diversifying our pipeline into other areas as evidenced by multiple programs advancing into the clinic during 2015.
If we are successfully in meeting our goals, we expect to deliver to Vertex and its shareholders, a long-term financial profile that includes significant revenue and earnings growth.
Before turning the call over to Stuart, I wanted to take the opportunity to mention how proud we are at Vertex to be at the forefront of a new approach in developing medicines, broadly referred to as precision medicine. KALYDECO and hopefully soon, the combination of lumacaftor, ivacaftor are benefiting CF patients around the world and demonstrating the potential of this approach in developing medicines. We are pleased that our successes provided part of the basis for new research initiatives, discussed for the first time in the State of the Union address last week, to apply precision medicine approaches across a broad range of diseases. And we look forward to working closely with regulators and other government entities to apply the learnings of precision medicine so that we can help more patients and do it faster. With that, I'll turn it over to Stuart."

Tonight I'll review the sales performance of KALYDECO in 2014 and outline our expectations for KALYDECO in 2015 that reflect strong underlying demand and the positive impact of label and geographic expansion. I will also discuss our progress in preparing for the approval and launch of the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination. 
KALYDECO has shown rapid growth since it was approved in 2012. Product sales increased 25% in 2014 to $464 million. At the start of 2014, nearly all eligible patients with the G551D mutation in the U.S. and Europe were being treated with KALYDECO. Growth in 2014 was driven by both additional patients initiating therapy in new and existing international markets, and the U.S. approval of KALYDECO for use in 8 additional mutations.
Turning to 2015, there are again multiple potential growth drivers based on achieving reimbursement approvals and further label expansions. In the first half of 2015, we expect rapid uptake of KALYDECO by eligible patients in Australia, following the completion of reimbursement discussions in late 2014. There are more than 200 children and adults with CF who are expected to be eligible for treatment.
In the U.S. KALYDECO  was approved for use in children and adults ages 6 and older with the R117H mutation on December 29 last year. The first patients have already initiated treatment and we expect to see continued uptake in the months ahead.
In the second half of 2015, we expect to see the revenue impact from achieving reimbursement for gating mutations in some European countries. We also anticipate a potential approval in children with CF ages 2 to 5 with the G551D or other gating mutations in the U.S., which would be a growth driver in the second half of 2015. As a result, we expect the number of patients eligible for KALYDECO to increase from 3,100 today to more than 3,700 by the end of this year. Although all eligible patients will not be on treatment by the end of the year and the enrollment of the VX-661 pivotal study in gating patients will have an adverse impact on patients receiving commercial product, we expect another year of significant revenue growth and KALYDECO net sales in the range of $560 million to $580 million in 2015.
Now to the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. We submitted the NDA and MAA in the U.S. and EU, respectively in November 2014 for children and adults with CF ages 12 and older to have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. In the U.S. we received prior to review, with a PDUFA date of July 5, 2015. In the EU, we were granted accelerated assessment and we anticipate EU approval around Q4 of this year if discussions with regulators progress as expected. Following regulatory approval in the EU, individual reimbursement discussions will begin on a country-by-country basis.
I'm pleased to report our launch planning is on track. There are around 8,500 F508del homozygous patients ages 12 years and older in the U.S. who are treated at approximately 275 CF centers. This represents an order of magnitude more patients than we currently treat. A key priority for us ahead of launch in the U.S. is to scale up our patient services team so that we can help providers and patients navigate the reimbursement process and also help with patient education and compliance. We have been adding case managers and we are also working to understand how CF centers plan to manage patient initiations.
We're investing in disease education to help payers estimate the number of eligible patients they may have in their plans, and also from a medical perspective, understand cystic fibrosis as a disease, its impact on patients and caregivers and the systemic effects of CFTR modulation.
Internationally, we are building out the required infrastructure in new and existing European markets to support the lumacaftor, ivacaftor launch. Infrastructure for each new country consists of a small number of medical and commercial staff. 
In summary, geographic and label expansion will continue to drive significant growth in KALYDECO sales and we are well-positioned for long-term revenue growth as the number of people we treat with CF significantly increases with the launch of the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination later this year. I'll now hand the call over to Ian."

Tonight I would like to discuss our 2014 results then our 2015 guidance and how that puts us on track to long term sustainable revenue and earnings growth. I'll be brief on the 2014 results, and for a more detailed discussion of these results, please refer to our press release we issued earlier today.
2014 financial performance was marked by the continuing growth in KALYDECO revenues, controlling the level of our operating expenses and completing the year with a strong balance sheet. As we look in 2015 and beyond, we see revenue growth continuing based on treating more patients with KALYDECO and then accelerating this revenue growth with the potential approval and launch of the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination. As we anticipate this growth in our CF revenues, we also expect to control the level of operating investments into our company. We anticipate that this will enable us to deliver a future financial profile that includes high operating margins and significant earnings growth.
Now to the 2014 results. We generated $536 million in total non-GAAP revenues in 2014, including $464 million in KALYDECO revenues. This was a significant increase over 2013 KALYDECO revenues and we expect this growth to continue. We also recorded $72 million in royalty and collaborative revenues, including $35 million in revenue from the out-license of VX-787 on novel flu medicine to Janssen.
When looking at the main components of our non-GAAP operating expenses, our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $920 million in 2014, a decrease of $177 million compared to the prior year. This decrease reflects our prioritization towards the CF medicines and continued focus on managing operating expenses.
The non-GAAP loss was $511 million or $2.17 per share compared to prior year loss of $203 million. This increased loss was the result of significantly reduced HCV revenues from 2013 and they are now excluded from our 2014 non-GAAP financials.
With the expectation of increasing CF revenues in 2015 and controlling our operating expenses, we see 2014 as a transition year into revenue growth and future profitability.
Now let's turn to 2015 and our financial guidance for the year, and specifically KALYDECO revenues and the main components of our operating expenses. With the recent regulatory submissions and approvals for reimbursement, KALYDECO is well-positioned for 2015. We expect KALYDECO net revenues to be in the range of $560 million to $580 million as we continue to expand the number of patients we treat. Next, to the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination. We look forward to this midyear launch to further accelerate our revenue growth. However, the revenues from this launch will be primarily US-based in 2015.
Based on regulatory timelines in the EU and the subsequent reimbursement time lines, we anticipate the first commercial revenues from x U.S. territories will likely occur in 2016. Now to the main components of our operating expenses. As previously announced, we expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense will be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion for the full year, and we expect these expenses to be fairly consistent each quarter of this year. We expect the non-GAAP R&D expense to be in the range of $770 million to $800 million, an increase of $75 million to $105 million compared to the prior year.
Now breaking down the R&D spend into its principal components. We expect to spend approximately $200 million investing in R or basic research to support the creation of future transformational medicines and specifically in CF. We expect to progress a next-generation corrector into the clinic later this year. This is very similar to basic research spending in prior years.
Now to the D or development spend, which we expect to be between $570 million and $600 million and this is primarily driven by CF clinical programs. More specifically, the Phase III pivotal program with VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor and the ongoing investment in lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination to patients who remain on long-term extension study. Other areas of focus for Vertex in research and early development are programs in oncology and neurology, an expectation that certain programs will enter and advance in the clinic in 2015 is incorporated into our guidance.
Turning now to 2015 SG&A guidance. We expect to spend $280 million to $300 million, which is an increase of $55 million to $75 million compared to 2014. The increase reflects cross-functional investment in supporting ivacaftor, lumacaftor combination launch and establishing a larger international presence as we significantly increase the number of patients we expect to treat with our medicines.
I'll close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering a financial profile consistent with our large cap biotech peers, and we look forward to updating you on the execution of our strategy throughout this year. With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

The way we're thinking about the heterozygotes and in terms of 661 and KALYDECO is really in 2 bucket. You remember that last year, we published a Phase II study on adding 661 to KALYDECO in patients who had a 508 allele mutation on 1 allele and some sort of gating mutation, in that case G551D on the other allele. And we're able to show, if you remember, that once -- those patients, once they were stable on KALYDECO, if we added 661, we saw greater than a 4.5% improvement in absolute FEV1. And so the first part of the heterozygotes strategy that we're going to test in the Phase III program is basically a pivotal program around that population where we're trying to maximize the benefit that we can bring by adding 661 to KALYDECO in patients who are heterozygotes for 508 and the gating allele. And so if you think about that population, it's about 80% of all gating patients who have 508 on the other allele. The other population is what we call the heterozygous men population, not a very good term, I admit. But its patients who have 508 on one allele and basically a non-KALYDECO responsive mutation on the other allele. It's about 17,000 patients worldwide. As we've said, this is the hardest to treat population because those patients express half of the amount of the Delta F508 protein than a Delta F508 homozygote expresses, so they need better correction. 
We know, for example, that 809-plus KALYDECO doesn't work in that population. We looked at that in our TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT trials, you'll remember. So we're taking a two-pronged approach with these patients. Because today, they don't have any CFTR correction therapy, we're going to take an admittedly high-risk, but more rapid approach and try them with 661 plus KALYDECO, the 2-drug combination as part of our pivotal program and we'll start the program, as we said, in the first half of this year. The idea there is if we can see an effect, then we'll be able to get the medicines to patients much more quickly. But the high probability approach we were taking is the 3-drug combination, and that's where we take 661 KALYDECO and the next-generation corrector, our cell based data suggest that, that will work in this population with a higher probability but, of course, that's slower because our next-generation correctors are in lead optimization now and our goal is to put the first to those and perhaps multiple in the clinic this year. And so that's the high probability but longer-term approach."

And as -- I don't think our mind will change in terms of the risks and the speed of these 2 approaches we're going to take, there's no doubt, no matter what we see, that the 2-drug domination is a high-risk but more rapid way to get to these patients who today don't have any therapy. There's also no doubt in my mind that the 3-drug combination from everything we've seen is a much higher probably to approach, but unfortunately, it's going to take us bit longer."

So in terms of a destination, if I can describe it that way in terms of the overall level of uptake we're anticipating, we expect the level of uptake, the peak penetration, if you want to think of it that way, to be very high for the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination, based on the things that you already know. It's an incredibly serious disease. The F508del mutation is a serious form of the disease and there aren't any other treatment options currently available to treat the underlying course of the disease. And so everything we know about the profile of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and the reaction it has had from patients and providers since the Phase III data became available is very positive. So we're expecting the peak uptake to be very significant. In terms of the rate of uptake, I'm anticipating it's going to be lower than with G551D, and really that's just driven by the sheer volume of patients. You have to think about here in the U.S. there's about 1,000 G551D patients that's treated at about 250 to 275 CF centers, that's on average, 3 or 4 patients per center. You think about the F508del homozygous population 12 and above, it's about 8,500 patients, so nearly in order of magnitude, greater, that's more like 30 patients per CF center on average. And so just the sheer volume of patients and the effort that goes into initiating a new patient on the therapy, the education, the counseling, navigating the reimbursement process, is going to take a significant amount of time and just the sheer volume of patients, I think, is going to lead to the absolute rate of uptake to be somewhat lower than we saw with G551D which you know -- well know was virtually vertical."

We don't have an exact final rule that we're going to use in the study, so we can't give you specifics. But let me take a moment and walk you through how it's going to work to put it in perspective. As you noted that we are going to roll about 120 patients in the initial cohort, we're going to then pause enrollment and clinical data from those patients will be collected and be reviewed by the DMC. We won't actually, here at Vertex be seeing that data, it will be conducted independently by the DMC. And the goal of that is actually to assess the probability whether we can actually know from that amount of data that it is low probability, that it's unlikely that, that combination is going to be beneficial for the patients. If that's the case, the SMB will tell us and we'll stop the study. If they see something that we cannot conclude that, then we will restart enrollment and complete the study. And that's really the way it's going to roll out. I would also note that the -- even if the study continues, we don't know for sure and we really won't know that the study is going to be positive until we get to the end. It's just that at that interim point, do we have enough information already to know that it's not working. That's the way the analysis is structured. And then your other question about pulmonary exacerbation and so forth. We will surely collect that data. We'll look at it. There's a difference between saying that we haven't sized the study to fully power for versus that we will try to look and get all the information that we can out of the study."

It helps me to talk more broadly about, let's say the direction of our operating -- our expected direction of the operating investment. Clearly, there's a great expectation on our revenue line, which is significant growth. But as we look at the operating expense line moving from 2014 into 2015, but then onwards, we see this increase from '14 into '15 as I described in my remarks earlier today. And that's because we are doing practically 2 Phase III studies through a long, a lot of 2015. But then also, we're supporting the launch of ivacaftor and lumacaftor to treat many more patients. And those are driving the increase between 2014 and '15. However, as we look at '15 into '16 and '17, we see relatively little additional costs, and the reason for that is because the company is now starting to move into a steady-state and when you look at all the different aspects of the company that drive the resulting operating expense, we start to become on a steady state in that we're committed to our levels of research, we like what we've got going on in research, we like the productivity and the production of the molecules that come from our research investment. Our development pipeline or our clinical pipeline is staged now, Phase I assets go to Phase III assets and we expect that to continue to roll so as a Phase III program comes to an end, we'd hope that a Phase II program ends to Phase III. So it rolls. And then as far as the SG&A is concerned, while our infrastructure is -- already exists to support the company to scale at this, and as Stuart has mentioned, with the launch of the ivacaftor, lumacaftor, we are building out commercial infrastructure globally. But that starts to hit steady-states as well to serve the patients that we think we will treat in the future. So it helps you understand why we look into 2016 and '17 and talk about controlling of the operating expense once we make this increased investment from 2014 into 2015. For that reason, bringing it backwards at a growth of the revenue line, we do believe that in future years and the successful launch of ivacaftor and lumacaftor, that we do actually turn to profitability and growth in earnings and cash flow. And we look for high operating margins."

And we made significant progress this past year in establishing a foundation for sustainable growth. First, we expanded the number of patients treated with KALYDECO through geographic and label expansion efforts. Second, we announced positive data from our Phase III studies of lumacaftor, ivacaftor and submitted an NDA in the U.S. and MAA in the EU, paving the way to treat significantly more people with CF.
Third, we continue to manage our financial position, ending the year with approximately $1.4 billion in cash to support the future of our business. These accomplishments have fundamentally changed the outlook for our business and increased our confidence in the company's plans for the future and for people with CF and their families.
I had the opportunity to meet with many of our investors and analysts at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference earlier this month and to talk about our strategy. So let me remind everyone about our priorities for 2015. First, approval and successful launch of the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination while continuing to increase KALYDECO revenues, enabling us to treat even more people with CF and to accelerate our revenue growth. Second, significantly advancing our CF pipeline with a focus on next-generation medicines that have the potential to create regimens that may increase the benefit for CF patients. And third, expanding and diversifying our pipeline into other areas as evidenced by multiple programs advancing into the clinic during 2015.
If we are successfully in meeting our goals, we expect to deliver to Vertex and its shareholders, a long-term financial profile that includes significant revenue and earnings growth.
Before turning the call over to Stuart, I wanted to take the opportunity to mention how proud we are at Vertex to be at the forefront of a new approach in developing medicines, broadly referred to as precision medicine. KALYDECO and hopefully soon, the combination of lumacaftor, ivacaftor are benefiting CF patients around the world and demonstrating the potential of this approach in developing medicines. We are pleased that our successes provided part of the basis for new research initiatives, discussed for the first time in the State of the Union address last week, to apply precision medicine approaches across a broad range of diseases. And we look forward to working closely with regulators and other government entities to apply the learnings of precision medicine so that we can help more patients and do it faster. With that, I'll turn it over to Stuart."

KALYDECO has shown rapid growth since it was approved in 2012. Product sales increased 25% in 2014 to $464 million. At the start of 2014, nearly all eligible patients with the G551D mutation in the U.S. and Europe were being treated with KALYDECO. Growth in 2014 was driven by both additional patients initiating therapy in new and existing international markets, and the U.S. approval of KALYDECO for use in 8 additional mutations.
Turning to 2015, there are again multiple potential growth drivers based on achieving reimbursement approvals and further label expansions. In the first half of 2015, we expect rapid uptake of KALYDECO by eligible patients in Australia, following the completion of reimbursement discussions in late 2014. There are more than 200 children and adults with CF who are expected to be eligible for treatment.
In the U.S. KALYDECO  was approved for use in children and adults ages 6 and older with the R117H mutation on December 29 last year. The first patients have already initiated treatment and we expect to see continued uptake in the months ahead.
In the second half of 2015, we expect to see the revenue impact from achieving reimbursement for gating mutations in some European countries. We also anticipate a potential approval in children with CF ages 2 to 5 with the G551D or other gating mutations in the U.S., which would be a growth driver in the second half of 2015. As a result, we expect the number of patients eligible for KALYDECO to increase from 3,100 today to more than 3,700 by the end of this year. Although all eligible patients will not be on treatment by the end of the year and the enrollment of the VX-661 pivotal study in gating patients will have an adverse impact on patients receiving commercial product, we expect another year of significant revenue growth and KALYDECO net sales in the range of $560 million to $580 million in 2015.
Now to the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. We submitted the NDA and MAA in the U.S. and EU, respectively in November 2014 for children and adults with CF ages 12 and older who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. In the U.S. we received prior to review, with a PDUFA date of July 5, 2015. In the EU, we were granted accelerated assessment and we anticipate EU approval around Q4 of this year if discussions with regulators progress as expected. Following regulatory approval in the EU, individual reimbursement discussions will begin on a country-by-country basis.
I'm pleased to report our launch planning is on track. There are around 8,500 F508del homozygous patients ages 12 years and older in the U.S. who are treated at approximately 275 CF centers. This represents an order of magnitude more patients than we currently treat. A key priority for us ahead of launch in the U.S. is to scale up our patient services team so that we can help providers and patients navigate the reimbursement process and also help with patient education and compliance. We have been adding case managers and we are also working to understand how CF centers plan to manage patient initiations.
We're investing in disease education to help payers estimate the number of eligible patients they may have in their plans, and also from a medical perspective, understand cystic fibrosis as a disease, its impact on patients and caregivers and the systemic effects of CFTR modulation.
Internationally, we are building out the required infrastructure in new and existing European markets to support the lumacaftor, ivacaftor launch. Infrastructure for each new country consists of a small number of medical and commercial staff. 
In summary, geographic and label expansion will continue to drive significant growth in KALYDECO sales and we are well-positioned for long-term revenue growth as the number of people we treat with CF significantly increases with the launch of the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination later this year. I'll now hand the call over to Ian."

Tonight I would like to discuss our 2014 results then our 2015 guidance and how that puts us on track to long term sustainable revenue and earnings growth. I'll be brief on the 2014 results, and for a more det",819,"Thanks, Stuart, and good evening to everyone. Tonight I would like to discuss our 2014 results then our 2015 guidance and how that puts us on track to long term sustainable revenue and earnings growth. I'll be brief on the 2014 results, and for a more detailed discussion of these results, please refer to our press release we issued earlier today.
2014 financial performance was marked by the continuing growth in KALYDECO revenues, controlling the level of our operating expenses and completing the year with a strong balance sheet. As we look to 2015 and beyond, we see revenue growth continuing based on treating more patients with KALYDECO and then accelerating this revenue growth with the potential approval and launch of the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination. As we anticipate this growth in our CF revenues, we also expect to control the level of operating investments into our company. We anticipate that this will enable us to deliver a future financial profile that includes high operating margins and significant earnings growth.
Now to the 2014 results. We generated $536 million in total non-GAAP revenues in 2014, including $464 million in KALYDECO revenues. This was a significant increase over 2013 KALYDECO revenues and we expect this growth to continue. We also recorded $72 million in royalty and collaborative revenues, including $35 million in revenue from the out-license of VX-787, our novel flu medicine to Janssen.
When looking at the main components of our non-GAAP operating expenses, our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $920 million in 2014, a decrease of $177 million compared to the prior year. This decrease reflects our prioritization towards the CF medicines and continued focus on managing operating expenses.
The non-GAAP loss was $511 million or $2.17 per share compared to prior year loss of $203 million. This increased loss was the result of significantly reduced HCV revenues from 2013 and they are now excluded from our 2014 non-GAAP financials.
With the expectation of increasing CF revenues in 2015 and controlling our operating expenses, we see 2014 as a transition year into revenue growth and future profitability.
Now let's turn to 2015 and our financial guidance for the year, and specifically KALYDECO revenues and the main components of our operating expenses. With the recent regulatory submissions and approvals for reimbursement, KALYDECO is well-positioned for 2015. We expect KALYDECO net revenues to be in the range of $560 million to $580 million as we continue to expand the number of patients we treat. Next, to the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination. We look forward to this midyear launch to further accelerate our revenue growth. However, the revenues from this launch will be primarily US-based in 2015.
Based on regulatory timelines in the EU and the subsequent reimbursement time lines, we anticipate the first commercial revenues from x U.S. territories will likely occur in 2016. 
Now to the main components of our operating expenses. As previously announced, we expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense will be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion for the full year, and we expect these expenses to be fairly consistent each quarter of this year. We expect the non-GAAP R&D expense to be in the range of $770 million to $800 million, an increase of $75 million to $105 million compared to the prior year.
Now breaking down the R&D spend into its principal components. We expect to spend approximately $200 million investing in R, or basic research, to support the creation of future transformational medicines and specifically in CF. We expect to progress a next-generation corrector into the clinic later this year. This is very similar to basic research spending in prior years.
Now to the D, or development spend, which we expect to be between $570 million and $600 million and this is primarily driven by CF clinical programs. More specifically, the Phase III pivotal program of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor and the ongoing investment in lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination to patients who remain on long-term extension study. Other areas of focus for Vertex in research and early development are programs in oncology and neurology, an expectation that certain programs will enter and advance in the clinic in 2015 is incorporated into our guidance.
Turning now to 2015 SG&A guidance. We expect to spend $280 million to $300 million, which is an increase of $55 million to $75 million compared to 2014. The increase reflects cross-functional investment in supporting ivacaftor, lumacaftor combination launch and establishing a larger international presence as we significantly increase the number of patients we expect to treat with our medicines.
I'll close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering a financial profile consistent with our large cap biotech peers, and we look forward to updating you on the execution of our strategy throughout this year. With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

Thanks for the question. The way we're thinking about the heterozygotes and in terms of 661 and KALYDECO is really in 2 buckets.

The way we're thinking about the heterozygotes and in terms of 661 and KALYDECO is really in 2 buckets. You remember that last year, we published a Phase II study on adding 661 to KALYDECO in patients who had a 508 allele mutation on 1 allele and some sort of gating mutation, in that case G551D on the other allele. And we're able to show, if you remember, that once -- those patients, once they were stable on KALYDECO, if we added 661, we saw greater than a 4.5% improvement in absolute FEV1. And so the first part of the heterozygotes strategy that we're going to test in the Phase III program is basically a pivotal program around that population where we're trying to maximize the benefit that we can bring by adding 661 to KALYDECO in patients who are heterozygotes for 508 and the gating allele. And so if you think about that population, it's about 80% of all gating patients who have 508 on the other allele. The other population is what we call the heterozygous min population, not a very good term, I admit. But it's patients who have 508 on one allele and basically a non-KALYDECO responsive mutation on the other allele. It's about 17,000 patients worldwide. As we've said, this is the hardest to treat population because those patients express half of the amount of the Delta F508 protein than a Delta F508 homozygote expresses, so they need better correction. 
We know, for example, that 809-plus KALYDECO doesn't work in that population. We looked at that in our TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT trials, you'll remember. So we're taking a two-pronged approach with these patients. Because today, they don't have any CFTR correction therapy, we're going to take an admittedly high-risk, but more rapid approach and try them with 661 plus KALYDECO, the 2-drug combination as part of our pivotal program. And we'll start the program, as we said, in the first half of this year. The idea there is if we can see an effect, then we'll be able to get the medicines to patients much more quickly. But the high probability approach we were taking is the 3-drug combination, and that's where we take 661, KALYDECO and the next-generation corrector, our cell-based data suggest that, that will work in this population with a higher probability but, of course, that's slower because our next-generation correctors are in lead optimization now and our goal is to put the first to those, and perhaps multiple, in the clinic this year. And so that's the high probability but longer-term approach."

Second area of focus has been to consider other technological or research-based approaches to creating medicines. I mean, Vertex has been very successful over the years with small molecule development and targeting certain molecular targets, but there are other things that are going on out there right now that we need to get involved in. So we're considering expanding our scientific footprint as well. And then the third area of focus has been, can we diversify our pipeline? And by that it's both out-licensing non-core assets, which we've been successful with. While also considering bringing on other opportunities into our pipeline that fit with Vertex's future.

With respect to the ATR, yes, you're right.

And I'll also add that, that data was discussed with the regulatory authorities to allow us to proceed into that Phase III program. As far as the timing of the results from the Phase III program, we'd anticipate 2016. We'll provide you with a more clear update once we get an understanding of the rate of recruitment to the studies but we don't anticipate results within 2015."

When I look at the design that you've chosen for Phase II trials, I'm particularly struck by the design of the heterozygous min population where you're planning to enroll 270 patients. If memory serves, that's only about half the size of the TRAFFIC and -- each of the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT trials, which were adequately powered trials in and of themselves. So presumably, the power of 270 patients to the effect in FEV benefit is substantially less than it was in TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT. If I were a company designing a trial and choosing that, I would interpret that as having great confidence  I'm going to see a big benefit. Why am I correct or incorrect in that line of logic, so to speak? And then finally, just a follow-up on the Phase IIb coming out for the 661, KALYDECO combination. Is there any reason biologically or study design-wise and the length is different to assume or postulate that the data, the FEV data would be significantly different from the roughly 4.8% improvement in absolute we saw in the prior experience?"

In terms of your question around comparing the 661 het min study versus TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, I do think there are couple of very important considerations that differ between them. One is that in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, we had 2 doses in that study which obviously complicates the sizing of the studies, and that's a very big difference and we were very pleased to be able to focus on one dose as we move 661 into Phase III. The other piece of that is that another consideration -- an important consideration in the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies was around secondary endpoints and being able to detect secondary endpoints.

So in terms of a destination, if I can describe it that way in terms of the overall level of uptake we're anticipating, we expect the level of uptake, the peak penetration, if you want to think of it that way, to be very high for the lumacaftor, ivacaftor combination, based on the things that you already know. It's an incredibly serious disease. The F508del mutation is a serious form of the disease and there aren't any other treatment options currently available to treat the underlying cause of the disease. And so everything we know about the profile of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and the reaction it has had from patients and providers since the Phase III data became available is very positive. So we're expecting the peak uptake to be very significant. In terms of the rate of uptake, I'm anticipating it's going to be lower than with G551D, and really that's just driven by the sheer volume of patients. You have to think about here in the U.S. there's about 1,000 G551D patients that's treated at about 250 to 275 CF centers, that's on average, 3 or 4 patients per center. You think about the F508del homozygous population 12 and above, it's about 8,500 patients, so nearly in order of magnitude, greater, that's more like 30 patients per CF center on average. And so just the sheer volume of patients and the effort that goes into initiating a new patient on the therapy, the education, the counseling, navigating the reimbursement process, is going to take a significant amount of time and just the sheer volume of patients, I think, is going to lead to the absolute rate of uptake to be somewhat lower than we saw with G551D which you know -- well know was virtually vertical."

We don't have an exact final rule that we're going to use in the study, so we can't give you specifics. But let me take a moment and walk you through how it's going to work to put it in perspective. As you noted that we are going to roll about 120 patients in the initial cohort, we're going to then pause enrollment and clinical data from those patients will be collected and be reviewed by the DMC. We won't actually, here at Vertex, be seeing that data, it will be conducted independently by the DMC. And the goal of that is actually to assess the probability whether we can actually know from that amount of data that it is low probability, that it's unlikely that, that combination is going to be beneficial for the patients. If that's the case, the SMB will tell us and we'll stop the study. If they see something that we cannot conclude that, then we will restart enrollment and complete the study.

I would also note that the -- even if the study continues, we don't know for sure and we really won't know that the study is going to be positive until we get to the end.

We don't see a big impact to our revenue line, we have a hedge program for our x U.S. revenues, both a hedge against those revenues but also the natural hedge for our investments in the different countries as well. So we don’t see a big impact to the revenue line because of that hedging program. And we also compared it to spot at the beginning of the year."

It helps me to talk more broadly about, let's say the direction of our operating -- our expected direction of the operating investment. Clearly, there's a great expectation on our revenue line, which is significant growth. But as we look at the operating expense line moving from 2014 into 2015, but then onwards, we see this increase from '14 into '15 as I described in my remarks earlier today. And that's because we are doing practically 2 Phase III studies through a long, a lot of 2015. But then also, we're supporting the launch of ivacaftor and lumacaftor to treat many more patients. And those are driving the increase between 2014 and '15. However, as we look at '15 into '16 and '17, we see relatively little additional costs, and the reason for that is because the company is now starting to move into a steady-state and when you look at all the different aspects of the company that drive the resulting operating expense, we start to become on a steady state in that we're committed to our levels of research, we like what we've got going on in research, we like the productivity and the production of the molecules that come from our research investment. Our development pipeline or our clinical pipeline is staged now, Phase I assets go to Phase III assets and we expect that to continue to roll so as a Phase III program comes to an end, we'd hope that a Phase II program enters Phase III. So it rolls. And then as far as the SG&A is concerned, while our infrastructure is -- already exists to support the company to scale at this, and as Stuart has mentioned, with the launch of the ivacaftor, lumacaftor, we are building out commercial infrastructure globally. But that starts to hit steady-state as well to serve the patients that we think we will treat in the future. So it helps you understand why we look into 2016 and '17 and talk about controlling of the operating expense whilst we make this increased investment from 2014 into 2015. For that reason, bringing it back with the growth of the revenue line, we do believe that in future years and the successful launch of ivacaftor and lumacaftor, that we do actually turn to profitability and growth in earnings and cash flow. And we look for high operating margins."

Vertex is the leader in the development of cystic fibrosis medicines that address the underlying cause of the disease. Our goal in CF is to treat as many people as possible and to enhance the benefits for those we treat. I want to start by acknowledging all of the CF patients and families who continue to reach out to us. We and they are eagerly awaiting the availability. I want to thank them for their support and encouragement as we seek to improve the lives of more people with CF.
There are 3 strategic priorities that we believe will allow Vertex to continue delivering on our vision to make the transformative medicines available to patients globally. We are focused on delivering on those priorities.
First, we're focused on getting approval in successfully launching ORKAMBI while continuing to grow KALYDECO, enabling us to treat even more people with CF. KALYDECO continues to treat more patients through both geographic end label expansion and we anticipate approximately 3,900 patients to be eligible for KALYDECO by the end of this year.
In addition, we are ready to bring ORKAMBI to the approximately 8,500 patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. who have 2 copies of the F508 Del mutation. We look forward to our meeting with the FDA advisory committee on May 12 to discuss ORKAMBI for the F 508 Del homozygous population who currently have don't have any treatment options to target the underlying cause of their disease.
Also we have just completed enrollment in the Phase III safety study evaluating this combination medicine in children ages 6 through 11 who have 2 copies of F508 Del mutation, which if successful positions us to provide ORKAMBI to these younger patients in the U.S. 
Our second priority. We are advancing our CF development pipeline with novel medicines with the potential to create regimens that may increase the benefit for CF patients. We believe that the X-661  can play an important role in the treatment of CF as a key component of a 2 or 3-drug combination. We're no enrolling 2 of the 4 studies included in the broad VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program in the third study we'll start in early May.
And our third priority is expanding and diversifying our early-stage pipeline. We continue to expect the next-generation CFTR corrector, as well as multiple programs outside of CF to enter the clinic by the end of 2015.
In summary, we continue to make significant progress in realizing our long-term vision to treat more people with cystic fibrosis and to enhance the benefit of those we treat. Of the continued execution on our strategy gives us the confidence that we will achieve sustainable growth in revenues and earnings and cash flows and create new medicines to treat other serious diseases beyond CF. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart."

KALYDECO revenues increased 31% over the same quarter last year. Global sales this quarter were $130 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $72 million and X U.S. sales of approximately $58 million. There has been rapid uptake of KALYDECO by eligible patients in Australia, following the completion of reimbursement discussions in late 2014. There are more than 200 children and adults with CF in Australia who are eligible for treatment and the vast majority of those have already started to take KALYDECO."

More than 150 of these patients have already initiated treatment. And in March, the KALYDECO label was expended in the West to include children with CF ages 2 to 5 with 1 of 10 different CF mutations. The first children under the age of 5 have already begun treatment.
We are delighted that so many new children and adults with CF now have access to KALYDECO and later in 2015, we expect to make further progress as we achieve reimbursement approval to the gating mutations in the major European countries where these mutations are prevalent.
In summary, multiple growth drivers are in place with KALYDECO this year as we continue to deliver on our geographic and label expansion plans.
Now turning to ORKAMBI. Our PDUFA date in the U.S. is July 5 and our team is ready to bring this medicine to the many patients who are eagerly awaiting its approval. Our patient services team who help patients navigate the reimbursement process and also help with patient education and compliance is fully staffed and trained. We are having ongoing and productive discussions with payers. One of the main areas of focus is disease education to help payers understand cystic fibrosis as ABCs, its impact on patients and caregivers and also to estimate the number of eligible patients they may have in their plans. And from a supply chain perspective, our launch and supply is ready to be shipped shortly after approval and we now have sufficient supply to meet what we anticipate to be strong demand.
In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO and we are well-positioned for additional long-term revenue growth with the launch of ORKAMBI for F508 Del homozygous patients.

Tonight, I'd like to discuss our first quarter 2015 financial results and then our 2015 financial guidance. 
Firstly to the financials, KALYDECO revenues were $130 million this quarter and are up 31% versus the first quarter of 2014 as we continue to expand the number of patients we treat. Our first quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $246 million, an increase of $13 million compared to last year. This increase mainly being attributable to an increase in SG&A expenses as we prepare for the potential launch of ORKAMBI. 
And our non-GAAP net loss was $148 million, similar to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $151 million. Form a balance sheet perspective, we maintained a strong position with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter. 
Let's turn to our 2015 financial guidance, specifically the reiteration of KALYDECO revenues and combined R&D and SG&A expenses. KALYDECO revenues are on track and we continue to expect 2015 revenues to be between $560 million to $580 million and we also continue to expect the combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion for the full year. And just now before closing that we expect our operating expenses will be higher than the second half of this year compared to the first half mainly as a result of anticipated progress with the VX-661 pivotal program and the investment to support the potential launch Orkambi.
I'll close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today and focus on delivering a future financial profile consistent with our large-cap biotech peers. And we look forward to updating you on the continued execution of our strategy throughout this year. With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

The first one is kind of systemic, if you like. It's the process that each country has and some have a very formalized process with very well laid out and rigid timelines. And others are much more fluid. So I think there's always that, which affects -- not just us, it affects every product which we're trying to secure reimbursement. And then specifically as it relates to us, it really is going to be discussions around the severity of the disease, level of unmet needs, the nature of the product and then the patient population. And as you say, one of the big considerations in Europe you alluded to, is the budget impact and that's where discussions around the patient population and making sure that payers understand the size of the place of patient population that this is and an orphan disease and that initial indication hopefully for Orkambi will be for a subset of the F508 homozygous population. So they really have a good sense of the size of the patient population and how relatively small it is, is obviously a really informed consideration for them if they're thinking through the budget impact.

Let me take the first question and I'll turn it over to Ian for the second. In terms of the second-gen correctors, again, let me just sort of remind you from my view, but for some who may not be as familiar. The idea here is, we have shown data that by adding a second generation corrector to a first GEN corrector like 809 or 661 plus KALYDECO, we can get very significant enhancement of chloride TRANSPORT, both in del 508 homozygous cells and in the del 508 het cells, which is obviously important. And so this is really a sort of 2-edged approach. One is to, we think it has a high likelihood of allowing us to treat patients, which we know are so difficult with the 2-drug application and the other one is, it enhances the benefit of the homozygous patients who frankly, anybody who has a Delta F508, thing single delta 508 allele. And so that's the idea. When we started the project, there were really 2 challenges. One was really a biologic challenge. That is, is that hypothesis correct? Could you actually identify molecule that would synergize with first-generation correctors and increase chloride TRANSPORT? And we've now definitively answered that question. We have multiple molecules that do that and provide very significant synergy. To me, that was actually the more challenging or question. The second part of course, is once you have such molecules turning them into drugs. And that's really a matter of lead optimization around parameters of PK and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. And that's the stage we're in now with multiple of these molecules. We're on track for what we have -- what our goal was this year, which is to get the first of those molecules in the clinic this year with multiple other molecules following thereafter. We -- and we have shown you a second part of the question which we have shown data to demonstrate that synergy? And we have shown that data. I'll refer you back to NACF even a year and a half ago or so I believe, where we showed several pieces of data on the synergy that we can produce with those second GEN correctors."

And especially thanks, that I get a chance to reiterate the comments what we target financially for the company few years from now. And it is to be a company similar to our larger cap peers and that's one of high operating margins. I think we have the opportunity to do that as a business given the disease areas that we're in, specifically with the KALYDECO revenue growth that we're starting to see and we anticipate should increase with the label expansion and the geographic expansion. And then later this year, following the potential approval of Orkambi, we should see an acceleration of that revenue growth and that should accumulate to a significant revenue line. And if we continue to control our operating expenses, what that means is growing revenue line cascades over an operating base that allows us to achieve high operating margins as a business. I would also point out the main that financial profile, because of the scale of the revenue growth, we're still able to invest in R&D, which is a core principle of the company. So we're still able to reinvest in R&D while maintaining those high operating margins. So as we look out 3, 4 years from now, we do see that we're in a very strong position financially."

And those are the questions that we expect to be discussed with the ad COM. Based on the data that you've already seen, we are very confident in our answers to all of those questions because we feel there's very significant clinical benefit. The drug was well tolerated from the safety perspective and when you put those together, you get a favorable benefit risk. In patients who today don't have any underlying therapy that treats the underlying cause of the disease. And that's consistent with what we're also hearing as feedback from KOLs or from the community. So we're looking forward to the discussion.

We have had and are continuing to have ongoing and very productive discussions with payers. One of the main areas of focus for us is obviously educating them on the disease and the seriousness of the disease, CF being an orphan disease and not necessarily something they've spent a lot of time focusing on, to talk about the disease, the impact it has on patients and caregivers, making sure they really understand the disease and the level of unmet need. It's clearly been a very important part of our early discussions with them. The other critical point of the discussion has really been around helping them understand the patient population. And as you know, one of the things that payers are very keen on understanding is having a high level of certainty and that's certainly one of the things that we can offer them in cystic fibrosis, is this is an incredibly well defined orphan population. So you're helping them understand the size of the population in total and specifically, the size of the eligible patient population likely to be in their plans or in their geographies has been really important. And then when we've been talking about the science behind the product, the fact that they treat the underlying cause of the disease, whether really is there anything that does that in the market today, when you put all those factors together, I think the general impression we've been getting is that this is the sort of innovation that they like to see and that they want to reimburse."

We do believe that it's first-generation and second-generation corrector target different sites, different parts of the folding mechanism or folding pathway and we have direct evidence that shows that. And so the idea here is that the delta 508 mutant CFTR actually has multiple defects at different points in the folding pathway. The first generation correctors like 809 or 661 target one of those, which is actually relatively early on in the folding pathway. But then we then search for second generation correctors that can target the second one that's further downstream in the pathway. The theory or the idea being that those 2 should be added over synergistic. And as I said before, we've been able to show that, I think very definitively. We can identify multiple molecules like that. They do add or synergize with the first generation correctors and our confidence in those is really based upon the totality of all the HB cell data that we have, which in each case, is translated into the clinic. And so we've shown you data that the first-generation, second-generation corrector, KALYDECO can produce significantly more chloride TRANSPORT in those cells in just the first GEN corrector in KALYDECO and that's why we're so confident that we translated into more benefit in the clinic.

We can produce quite a bit more, at least equivalent to what we see with KALYDECO on a G551D cell. And so the goal is to optimize those with the HBE's because we're very confident that, that translates into the clinic.

I think it's perhaps more straightforward than people would imagine. First, let me just remind you about this trial. The idea was, we needed more safety data than we had to move into Phase III and so this trial is really designed predominantly as a safety trial to get us 12 weeks safety data that will cover us so we can accelerate into Phase III. And the first lining I would emphasize that we were particularly pleased with the fact that we didn't see any new safety concerns and that allowed us to accelerate pivotal program as you know, which is enrolling now. The other efficacy end points, as you said, predominantly FEV1. And what you're really asking us what was that sort of pattern that we saw. I would characterize it as this. First of all, the changes in FEV1 that we saw were consistent with what we've seen before, in that 4% range in multiple studies. The pattern was very similar to what we've seen before with all CFTR correctors, which means that the changes were rapid, it's on within 2 weeks and they were sustained through the 12 weeks of the study. It was a small study so there was some bouncing around on those but none of those were statistically significant. First thing went up by 2 weeks went up to 12 weeks and it was consistent through the 12 weeks of the trial. And that's consistent with the biology. We know that when you get underlying CFTR correction, there has been something that you've seen that's stable. And it's sustained. In terms of making a point estimate about what the effect is, we're certainly not going to be able to do that from these small Phase II trials, that's really going to wait for the Phase III trial, which is going to be much larger, obviously, and allow us to directly make the accurate point estimate. But there is nothing here in terms of FEV1 that was in any way consistent with what we've seen with 661 or frankly, with the other CFTR correctors in terms of the pattern. Did that answer your question?"

Broadly speaking, we are dissipating the demand and patients to be very high for Orkambi given the seriousness of the disease, the level of unmet need given that there's no currently available treatments that address the underlying course of the disease and the communities positive reaction to the medical profile. So generally speaking, we are expecting there to be significant demand and quick update, specifically to address your question about what might be different around the uptake, the biggest difference I think is going to be around the patient volume. And if you have to think about, it's about 275 CF centers in the U.S, so for KALYDECO and G551D, they were seeing about 3 to 4 patients for the F508 del homozygous population 12 and over we've got about 8,500 patients so we're going to be seeing 30-plus patients in the average CF center, if there is such thing. And lastly, the initial decision to initiate therapy may be made very quickly by the physician in consultation with the patient, just that sheer volume of patients and the level of administrative burden that goes along with initiating the patient going to the reimbursement process prior authorizations and that sort of thing, I think these likely to lead to a slower relative rate of uptake relative to KALYDECO. The one last thing I do want to say though, relative KALYDECO is the important phrase that I mean, the KALYDECO uptake was virtually vertical. I mean, we were at 90% of peak penetration in 6 months. The fastest launch I've ever been involved in. So while we're seeing the relative uptake with Orkambi may be slightly slower as a result of some of these increased patient volume factors as I say, I we're still expecting the demand to be very significant from both patients and physicians."

Actually, Stuart can follow my answer but still, because I heard 2 questions, Stuart can also help you understand where we are in the commercial preparations as well for launch of Orkambi. The way we look at this is, profitability should come with the launch of Orkambi and we continue to drive the revenue line with KALYDECO. With geographic and label expansion as we stated earlier on this call. Clearly, the revenue growth is accelerated by the potential approval of Orkambi. Therefore, as we look towards the end of this year and maybe in the beginning of next year, we start to see the company turn cash flow positive and profitable. As far as the operating expense is concerned and the future operating expense is concerned as you're asking. In the short term, we're committed to financial guidance of $1 billion to $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion and we reiterated that on the call tonight. So it helps you understand how we think about this year. And then as we think about the out years, I made some comments earlier that we continue to control that operating expense but with the revenue growth that we have, we see the opportunities to make significant operating margins. To use what you just said in the question, we do not see the company taking a proportion of its revenues and allocating those to R&D. The R&D investments in the company is based on our commitment to a research function that's been highly productive over the years. We like where we are with that and then the development spend and developments investment is a function of the opportunity of the products that we may create. And so we don't look at it as a financial metric to spend away the revenue line. it is more a function of control and having efficient R&D, having a control and efficient operating expense for controlling that to allow the revenues to generate significant operating margins.

Yes, In terms of the launch preparations. In the U.S, we are launch ready. The additional commercial infrastructure we need here in the U.S, which was largely in our patient services team, which is the team that supports patients through the reimbursement process and helps with education and compliance, that team has been scaled up to reflect the larger patient population we hope to serve when Orkambi is approved later this year. So in the U.S, we're fully scaled up and launch ready. X U.S., essentially, we'll be using largely the same infrastructure that they've used for KALYDECO in those markets where we commercialize KALYDECO. The real growth in our X U.S. market is driven by us needing to build infrastructure in markets where we don't currently have a presence because there isn't really a large bowl of KALYDECO-eligible patients in those markets. And so that expansion is really happening in the second half of the year as we get ready for the approval. And then subsequent reimbursement submissions in Europe towards the back end of this year."

I'm wondering if you anticipate that you'll have the capacity to drive the bottom line while simultaneously being opportunistic with acquisitions, whether inside or outside of CF. And then I guess, as it specifically relates to CF, what's your view on the most value ad timing of a potential deal? In other words, much proof of concept do you need to see before trying to go after an asset?"

The priori",417,"I think you mentioned this on a number of earlier calls. So we have a very firm and committed corporate and business development strategy and I'll just go over that once again and then comment on the last part of your question, which is timing. The priority within business corporate development for us today is cystic fibrosis and so we continue to evaluate opportunities of other technologies or medicines that may enhance our approach to creating best combination medicines for our patients, as well as thinking about other modalities of how we may treat patients many years away from now. We're committed to the space. And so we continue to evaluate different technologies and different medicines at various different points of research and development to give them consideration of whether they would be better in combination with our based therapy. Second priority for us in the area is scientific footprint. Vertex has been highly successful in a small molecule drug development and looking at electric targets. It's time for us to continue and to consider other things and so we're looking at other modalities of science and there's a lot of exciting stuff out there and with working very hard on evaluating those as well. And then third, there is this consideration of being more opportunistic within licensing, I would say it's smaller scale. I don't want you to take away from this call, but Vertex is trying to buy revenue. We have a lot of internal growth with our own compounds. We got a lot to execute on in the CF space alone. So we don't need at this point to go out and take on risk of M&A to buy revenue. But we would consider balancing our pipeline opportunistically. And then to your point -- question of do we think about the timing, ideal timing for bringing in potential CF assets. We look at it by looking at our HVAC assets, to be honest, if we have an opportunity to study an external asset with our own assets and evaluate the combination therapies or even the standalone therapies to our HBE cells, we take a lot of confidence from that. And if we can at least do those kinds of lab experiments, it gives us confidence there to move forward. Where then, potentially the risk in the clinic is one mainly focused on safety. So for us, the ideal time is around this preclinical or translational time of medicines to look to do the combinations."

It's a market that's of the right size, it is clearly a specialty market and very consistent size with markets like CF and other specialty markets on that, requiring large commercial infrastructure. And there was preclinical and early clinical data that was suggested of an effect.

The first one is really interesting because it points to what I think is a fundamental property of these correctors in particular but also the potentiators, which is, that they don't stay bound to the target. In fact, that's important that they help with the bowling and they likely come off the target. At least, everything that we've seen since that happened. Which also gives us some interesting insights into the kinds of policy that you might really want to look at. I think that's one of the reasons we don't get and another reason, of course, is the size of these molecules compared to the size of these proteins is quite small. But I actually think it's the first reason more than anything else. These are binders which tend to come up, I think, during the folding process. And your second question is about exhaustion. I think in a way, that will be a nice problem to have in terms of driving chloride, driving CFQ-R and TRANSPORT up so high that you get exhaustion. But in fact, what we're seeing so far anyway is that you can drive these up very significantly with these 3 drug combinations and that the CFTR that's on the cell surface is functional, that's of course the most important thing and we're not saying what you might worry about, which is increased recycling of the CFTR or abnormal function the CFTR when it's folded by these 3 molecules, that's really not what we're seeing."

And that's typically is what happens when you show the kinds of success that we've shown pension. I think the strategy that we're taking is, to as quickly as possible, find the maximal regimens and get the most patients we can on them. We do think we have a pretty considerable headstart. Most of these other assets are preclinical for just entering the clinic. And so as I told you, for the reasons I told you, we're confident that for instance, a 3-drug regimen will allow us to address 80s and 90% of the patients and get essentially maximal effects end that does of course, provide a barrier to entry, both in terms of even enrolling in clinical trials and certainly in terms of the commercially once you're already there. So that's already the competitive strategy. And it's supplemented by our business bonus strategy at the  inset. So if some of those assets come from externally and we can put them together and see even better combinations, all the better for patients and of course, for us. On the first question, really, what our confidence around 661 and as I said, the FEV1 response that we saw in that study in the delta 508 homozygous patients, it was pretty comparable to what we've seen in the other Phase II studies. So if anything that increase our confidence in the effects we're seeing since 1 through 12 weeks. I'd also remind you that there's a lot of other Phase II data out there. For example, adding 661 to patients who are on KALYDECO, who had a gating mutation in which in a Phase II study, we showed, I think about a 4.6% further increase in their FEV1. And of course, that's become a part of our Phase III program. I think one of the key questions that we have that others have is, what is the likelihood of success of the 2-drug combinations, 661-plus KALYDECO in the heterozygous min population. But they're really the most difficult population to treat. And as we said before, we think that has a lower probability. We haven't actually tested the drug yet there. But on the other hand, those patients have nothing today. So the way we're managing that in the Phase III program is, there is a separate study in that population. But it looks quite different, You're going to enroll a reasonably small number of patients about 120 and then we're going to do a futility analysis based on those 120 to decide whether to continue and enroll another 150, which will give us the 4 pivotal trials. So it allows us to manage the risk there if you look, while we're also bringing forward, of course, the next generation of correctors we think have a higher likelihood of success in that population."

PK, drug-drug interaction and toxicity.

Our plan is actually to pick multiple versions here, they have slightly different flavors, they're buying to different sites, we believe, and so we will test multiple versions and multiple combinations in the clinic and as I said, starting this year and certainly going into next year.

Good evening, everyone. 2015 is a very important year for Vertex. Vertex is the leader in the development of cystic fibrosis medicines that address the underlying cause of the disease. Our goal in CF is to treat as many people as possible",488,"Thanks, Michael. Good evening, everyone. 2015 is a very important year for Vertex. Vertex is the leader in the development of cystic fibrosis medicines that address the underlying cause of the disease. Our goal in CF is to treat as many people as possible and to enhance the benefits for those we treat. I want to start by acknowledging all of the CF patients and families who continue to reach out to us. We and they are eagerly awaiting the availability of Orkambi. I want to thank them for their support and encouragement, as we seek to improve the lives of more people with CF.
There are 3 strategic priorities that we believe will allow Vertex to continue delivering on our vision to make new transformative medicines available to patients globally. We are focused on delivering on those priorities.
First, we're focused on gaining approval and successfully launching Orkambi while continuing to grow KALYDECO, enabling us to treat even more people with CF. KALYDECO continues to treat more patients through both geographic and label expansion, and we anticipate approximately 3,900 patients to be eligible for KALYDECO by the end of this year.
In addition, we are ready to bring Orkambi to the approximately 8,500 patients, ages 12 and older in the U.S. who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. We look forward to our meeting with the FDA advisory committee on May 12 to discuss Orkambi for the F508del homozygous population who currently don't have any treatment options that target the underlying cause of their disease.
Also we have just completed enrollment in the Phase III safety study evaluating this combination medicine in children ages 6 through 11 who have 2 copies of F508del mutation, which if successful, positions us to provide Orkambi to these younger patients in the U.S. 
Our second priority. We are advancing our CF development pipeline with novel medicines with the potential to create regimens that may increase the benefit for CF patients. We believe that the VX-661 could play an important role in the treatment of CF, as a key component of a 2 or 3-drug combination. We're now enrolling 2 of the 4 studies included in the broad VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program, and the third study will start in early May.
And our third priority is expanding and diversifying our early-stage pipeline. We continue to expect the next-generation CFTR corrector as well as multiple programs outside of CF to enter the clinic by the end of 2015.
In summary, we continue to make significant progress in realizing our long-term vision to treat more people with cystic fibrosis and to enhance the benefit for those we treat. The continued execution on our strategy gives us the confidence that we will achieve sustainable growth in revenues, earnings and cash flows and create new medicines to treat other serious diseases beyond CF. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart."

There are more than 200 children and adults with CF in Australia who are eligible for treatment and the vast majority of those have already started to take KALYDECO. Late last year, KALYDECO was approved in the U.S. for use in children and adults ages 6 and older with the R117H mutation. More than 150 of these patients have already initiated treatment. And in March, the KALYDECO label was expanded in the U.S. to include children with CF ages 2 to 5 with 1 of 10 different CF mutations. The first children under the age of 5 have already begun treatment.
We are delighted that so many new children and adults with CF now have access to KALYDECO. And later in 2015, we expect to make further progress as we achieve reimbursement approval for gating mutations in the major European countries where these mutations are prevalent.
In summary, multiple growth drivers are in place for KALYDECO this year as we continue to deliver on our geographic and label expansion plans.
Now turning to Orkambi. Our PDUFA date in the U.S. is July 5, and our team is ready to bring this medicine to the many patients who are eagerly awaiting its approval. Our patient services team who help patients navigate the reimbursement process and also help with patient education and compliance is fully staffed and trained. We are having ongoing and productive discussions with payers. One of the main areas of focus is disease education to help payers understand cystic fibrosis as a disease, its impact on patients and caregivers and also to estimate the number of eligible patients they may have in their plans. And from a supply chain perspective, our launch supply is ready to be shipped shortly after approval and we have sufficient supply to meet what we anticipate to be strong demand.
In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO and we are well-positioned for additional long-term revenue growth with the launch of Orkambi for F508del homozygous patients. 
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."

Tonight, I'd like to discuss our first quarter 2015 financial results and then our 2015 financial guidance. 
Firstly to the financials. KALYDECO revenues were $130 million this quarter and are up 31% versus the first quarter of 2014, as we continue to expand the number of patients we treat. Our first quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $246 million, an increase of $13 million compared to last year, this increase mainly being attributable to an increase in SG&A expenses as we prepare for the potential launch of Orkambi. 
And our non-GAAP net loss was $148 million, similar to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $151 million. From a balance sheet perspective, we maintained a strong position with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter. 
Let's turn to our 2015 financial guidance, specifically the reiteration of KALYDECO revenues and combined R&D and SG&A expenses. KALYDECO revenues are on track, and we continue to expect 2015 revenues to be between $560 million to $580 million. And we also continue to expect the combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion for the full year. I would just note before closing that we expect our operating expenses will be higher in the second half of this year compared to the first half, mainly as a result of anticipated progress with the VX-661 pivotal program and the investment to support the potential launch of Orkambi.
I'll close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering a future financial profile consistent with our large-cap biotech peers. And we look forward to updating you on the continued execution of our strategy throughout this year. With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

The first one is kind of systemic, if you like. It's the process that each country has, and some have a very formalized process with very well laid out and rigid timelines. And others are much more fluid. So I think there's always that, which affects -- not just us, it affects every product which is trying to secure reimbursement. And then specifically, as it relates to us, it really is going to be discussions around the severity of the disease, level of unmet need, the nature of the product and then the patient population. And as you say, one of the big considerations in Europe you alluded to, is the budget impact and that's where discussions around the patient population and making sure that payers understand the size of the patient population that this is an orphan disease and that the initial indication hopefully for Orkambi will be for a subset of the F508 homozygous population. So they really have a good sense of the size of the patient population and how relatively small it is, is obviously a really important consideration for them as they're thinking through the budget impact. So those, I think, are the 2 types of considerations: one, systemic around the process; and then the others, which are very specific to us and to Orkambi."

Let me take the first question. Then I'll turn it over to Ian for the second. In terms of the second gen correctors, again, let me just sort of remind you -- not from my view, but for some who may not be as familiar. The idea here is that we have shown data that by adding a second generation corrector to a first gen corrector like 809 or 661 plus KALYDECO, we can get very significant enhancement of chloride transport, both in Delta 508 homozygous cells and in Delta 508 het min cells, which is obviously important. And so this is really a sort of 2-edged approach. One is to -- we think it has a high likelihood of allowing us to treat the het min patients, which we know are so difficult with the 2-drug combination. And the other one is, it enhances the benefit of the homozygous patients and frankly, anybody who has a Delta 508, a single Delta 508 allele. So that's the idea. And when we started the project, there were really 2 challenges. One was really a biologic challenge. That is, was that hypothesis correct? Could you actually identify molecules that would synergize with first-generation correctors and increase chloride transport. And we've now definitively answered that question. We have multiple molecules that do that and provide very significant synergy. To me, that was actually the more challenging or worrisome question. The second part, of course, is once you have such molecules, turning them into drugs. And that's really a matter of lead optimization around parameters of PK and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. And that's the stage we're in now with multiple of these molecules. We're on track for what we have -- what our goal was this year, which is to get the first of those molecules in the clinic this year with multiple other molecules following thereafter. We -- and we have shown -- your second part of the question was, have we have shown data to demonstrate that synergy? And we have shown that data. I'd refer you back to NACF even 1.5 years ago or so, I believe, where we showed several pieces of data on the synergy that we can produce with those second gen correctors."

Especially thanks, so that I get a chance to reiterate the comments of what we target financially for the company few years from now. And it is to be a company similar to our larger cap peers, and that's one of high operating margins. I think we have the opportunity to do that as a business given the disease areas that we're in, specifically with the KALYDECO revenue growth that we're starting to see, and we anticipate should increase with the label expansion and the geographic expansion. And then later this year, following the potential approval of Orkambi, we should see an acceleration of that revenue growth and that should accumulate to a significant revenue line. And if we continue to control our operating expenses, what that means is that growing revenue line cascades over an operating base that allows us to achieve high operating margins as a business. I would also point out in that financial profile, because of the scale of the revenue growth, we're still able to reinvest in R&D, which is a core principle of the company. We're still able to reinvest in R&D, while maintaining those high operating margins. So as we look out to 3, 4 years from now, we do see that we're in a very strong position financially."

And those are the questions that we expect to be discussed at the AdCom. Based on the data that you've already seen, we are very confident in our answers to all of those questions because we feel that there's very significant clinical benefit, there's -- the drug was well tolerated from a safety perspective and when you put those together, you get a favorable benefit risk in patients who today don't have any underlying therapy that treats the underlying cause of the disease. And that's consistent with what we're also hearing as feedback from KOLs and from the community. So we're looking forward to the discussion.

We have had and are continuing to have ongoing and very productive discussions with payers. One of the main areas of focus for us is obviously educating them on the disease and the seriousness of the disease. CF being an orphan disease and not necessarily something that they've spent a lot of time focusing on, so talking about the disease, the impact it has on patients and caregivers, making sure they really understand the disease and the level of unmet need, has clearly been a very important part of our early discussions with them. The other critical point of the discussion has really been around helping them understand the patient population. And as you know, one of the things that payers are very keen on understanding is having a high level of certainty and that's certainly one of the things that we can offer them in cystic fibrosis, is this is incredibly well-defined orphan population. So you're helping them understand the size of the population in total and specifically, the size of the eligible patient population likely to be in their plans or in their geographies has been really important. And then when we've been talking about the science behind the product, the fact that it treats the underlying cause of the disease, where there really isn't anything that does that in the market today, when you put all those factors together, I think the general impression we've been getting is that this is the sort of innovation that they like to see and that they want to reimburse."

We do believe that the first generation and second generation corrector target different sites, different parts of the folding mechanism or folding pathway, and we have direct evidence that shows that. And so the idea here is that the Delta 508 mutant CFTR actually has multiple defects at different points in the folding pathway. That first generation correctors like 809 or 661 target one of those, which is actually relatively early on in the folding pathway. But that we then search for second generation correctors that could target a second one that's further downstream in the pathway, the theory or the idea being that those 2 should be added over synergistic. And as I said before, we've been able to show that, I think, very definitively. We can identify multiple molecules like that. They do add or synergize with the first generation correctors, and our confidence in those is really based upon the totality of all the HBE cell data that we have, which in each case, is translated into the clinic. And so we've shown you data that -- so first generation corrector, second generation corrector, KALYDECO can produce significantly more chloride transport in those cells than just the first gen corrector in KALYDECO, and that's why we're so confident that, that will translate into more benefit in the clinic, in anyone who basically has one or more Delta 508 allele.

We do have at least 150, more than 150 patients we know who've initiated therapy. And without getting to break them down into all sorts of different age groups, we are seeing use across the range of ages from, as you know, our approved indication is for patients 6 and older, and we are seeing patients from the younger age groups into the older age groups as well. So it's distributed across the age groups. In terms of the exacerbation data, yes, you're absolutely right. We have been gathering data on a number of different elements on exacerbations, things like the number and frequency of them, the severity of them, the impact it has on patients and caregivers and also the cost of the overall health care system. And that data is all going to be very important, as we're putting together the dossiers that we will need to submit for reimbursement. And so making sure that we have a really very up-to-date set of information on those exacerbation rates by the major countries has been an important part of the work that our Health Economics team has been doing in preparation for the launch."

I think it's perhaps more straightforward than people imagine. First, let me just remind you about this trial. The idea here was we needed more safety data than we had had to move into Phase III, and so this trial was really designed predominantly as a safety trial to get us 12 weeks of safety data that would cover us so we could accelerate into Phase III. And the first finding that I would emphasize that we were particularly pleased with was the fact that we didn't see any new safety concerns and that allowed us to accelerate the pivotal program, as you know, which is enrolling now. The other -- there were efficacy endpoints, as you said, predominantly FEV1. And what you're really asking is what was the sort of pattern that we saw. I would characterize it this way. First of all, the changes in FEV1 that we saw were consistent with what we've seen before, in that 4% range in multiple studies. The pattern was very similar to what we've seen before with all CFTR correctors, which means that the changes were rapid. You saw them within 2 weeks, and they were sustained through the 12 weeks of the study. It was a small study, so there was some bouncing around of those, but none of those were statistically significant. This thing went up by 2 weeks, went out to 12 weeks, and it was consistent through the 12 weeks of the trial. And that's consistent with the biology. We know that when you get underlying CFTR correction, that has been something that we've seen that's stable and is sustained. In terms of making a point estimate about what the effect is, we're certainly not going to be able to do that from these small Phase II trials. That's really going to wait for the Phase III trial, which is going to be much larger, obviously, and allow us to directly make the accurate point estimate. But there was nothing here in terms of FEV1 that was in anyway inconsistent with what we've seen with 661 or frankly, with the other CFTR correctors in terms of the pattern. Does that answer your question?"

Masha, it's Stuart here. Broadly speaking, we are anticipating the demand from patients and physicians to be very high for Orkambi given the seriousness of the disease, the level of unmet need given that there's no currently available treatments that address the underlying course of the disease and the community's positive reaction to the clinical profile. So generally speaking, we are expecting there to be significant demand and quick uptake. Specifically to address your question about what might be different around the uptake, the biggest difference, I think, is going to be around the patient volume. And if you think about it, there's about 275 CF centers in the U.S. So for KALYDECO and G551D, they were seeing about 3 to 4 patients. For the F508del homozygous population, 12. I know we've got about 8,500 patients. So they're going to be seeing 30-plus patients in the average CF center, if there is such a thing. And whilst the initial decision to initiate therapy may be made very quickly by the physician in consultation with the patient, just that sheer volume of patients and the level of administrative burden that goes along with initiating a patient going to the reimbursement process, prior authorizations and that sort of thing, I think, is likely to lead to a slower relative rate of uptake relative to KALYDECO. The one last thing I do want to say though, relative to KALYDECO is the important phrase that I mean, the KALYDECO uptake was virtually vertical. I mean, we were at 90% of peak penetration in 6 months, the fastest launch personally I've ever been involved in. And so whilst we're saying the relative rate of uptake with Orkambi may be slightly slower as a result of some of these increased patient volume factors, as I say, we're still expecting the demand to be very significant from both patients and physicians."

Stuart can also help you understand where we are in commercial preparation as well for launch of Orkambi. The way we look at this is, profitability should come with the launch of Orkambi and we continue to drive the revenue line with KALYDECO, with geographic and label expansion as we stated earlier on this call. Clearly, the revenue growth is accelerated by the potential approval of Orkambi. Therefore, as we look towards the end of this year and maybe beginning of next year, we start to see the company turn cash flow positive and profitable. As far as the operating expense is concerned and the future operating expense is concerned, as you're asking, in the short term, we've committed to financial guidance of $1 billion -- $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, and we reiterated that on the call tonight. So it helps you understand how we think about this year. And then as we think about the out years, I made some comments earlier that we continue to control that operating expense but with revenue growth that we have, we see the opportunity to make significant operating margins. To use what you just said in the question, we do not see the company taking a proportion of its revenues and allocating those to R&D. The R&D investment in the company is based on our commitment to a research function that's been highly productive over the years. We like where we are with that, and then the development spend and development investment is a function of the opportunity of the products that we may create. And so we don't look at it as a financial metric to spend away the revenue line. It is more a function of controlling and having efficient R&D, having a controlled and efficient operating expense, but controlling that to allow the revenues to generate significant operating margins. And Stuart, do you want to comment on Orkambi?"

So in the U.S., we're fully scaled up and launch ready. And x U.S., essentially, we'll be using largely the same infrastructure that we've used for KALYDECO in those markets where we commercialize KALYDECO. The real growth in our x U.S. market is driven by us needing to build infrastructure in markets where we don't currently have a presence because there isn't really a large bolus of KALYDECO-eligible patients in those markets.

So we have a very firm and committed corporate and business development strategy, and I'll just go over that once again and then comment on your last part of the question, which is timing. The priority within business and corporate development for us today is cystic fibrosis. And so we continue to evaluate opportunities of other technologies or medicines that may enhance our approach to creating the best combination medicines for our patients, as well as thinking about other modalities of how we may treat patients many years away from now. We're committed to the space. And so we continue to evaluate different technologies and different medicines that are at various different points of research and development to give them consideration of whether they would be better in combination with our base therapy. Second priority for us in the area is scientific footprint. Vertex has been highly successful in small molecule drug development and looking at molecular targets. It's time for us to continue and consider other things, and so we're looking at other modalities of science and there's lot of very exciting stuff out there and working very hard on evaluating those as well. And then third, there is this consideration of being more opportunistic with -- in licensing. I would say it's smaller scale. I don't want you to take away from this call that Vertex is trying to buy revenue. We have a lot of internal growth with our own compounds. We've got a lot to execute on in the CF space alone. So we don't need at this point to go out and take on risk of M&A to buy revenue. But we would consider balancing our pipeline opportunistically. And then to your point -- question of how do we think about the timing, the ideal timing for bringing in potential CF assets. We look at it by looking at our HBE assays, to be honest. We -- if we have an opportunity to study an external asset with our own assets and evaluate the combination therapies or even the standalone therapy through our HBE cells, we take a lot of confidence from that. And if we can at least do those kind of lab experiments, it gives us confidence there to move forward with, and potentially the risk in the clinic is one mainly focused on safety. So for us, the ideal time is around this preclinical or translational time of medicines to look to do the combinations."

The first one is really interesting because it points to what I think is a fundamental property of these correctors in particular but also the potentiators, which is, that they don't stay bound to the target. In fact, that's important that they help with the folding and they likely come off the target. At least, everything that we've seen says that, that happens. Which also gives you some interesting insights into the kinds of potency that you might really want to look at. So I think that's one of the reasons we don't get steric hindrance and another reason, of course, is the size of these small molecules compared to the size of these proteins is quite small. But I actually think it's the first reason more than anything else. These are binders, which tend to come off, I think, during the folding process. And your second question is about exhaustion. In a way, that would be a nice problem to have in terms of driving chloride transport, driving CFTR traffic and chloride transport up so high that you get exhaustion. But in fact, what we're seeing so far anyway is that you can drive this up very significantly with these 3 drug combinations and that the CFTR that's on the cell surface is functional. That's, of course, the most important thing, and we're not seeing what you might worry about, which is increased recycling of the CFTR or abnormal function the CFTR when it's folded by these 3 molecules.

And In fact, our assumption is typically in Europe that one would need both an efficacy endpoint and a safety endpoint. And so at the current time, although we're still discussing it with European regulators, we're planning a second study in Europe that would have both the efficacy and safety endpoints about the same size to apply for approval in Europe in this patient population. And we would assume that, that would likely start sort of mid year."

That typically is what happens when you show the kinds of success that we've shown. I think the strategy that we're taking is, to as quickly as possible, find the maximal regimens and get the most patients we can on them. We do think we have a pretty considerable headstart. Most of these other assets are preclinical. We're just entering the clinic. And so as I told you, for the reasons I've told you, we're confident that for instance, a 3-drug regimen will allow us to address 80% to 90% of the patients and get essentially maximal effects and that does, of course, provide a barrier to entry, both in terms of even enrolling clinical trials and certainly in terms of commercially once you're already there. So that's really the competitive strategy. And it's supplemented by our business development strategy, as Ian said. So if some of those assets come from externally and we can put them together and with even better combinations, all the better for patients and, of course, for us. And the first question is really, what's our confidence around 661. And as I said, the FEV1 response that we saw in that study in the Delta 508 homozygous patients, was pretty comparable to what we've seen in the other Phase II studies. So if anything, that increased our confidence in the effects we're seeing since it went through 12 weeks. I'd also remind you that there's a lot of other Phase II data out there. For example, adding 661 to patients who are on KALYDECO, who have a gating mutation in which in a Phase II study, we showed, I think about a 4.6% further increase in their FEV1. And of course, that's become a part of our Phase III program. I think one of the key questions that we have and that others have is, what is the likelihood of success of the 2-drug combinations, 661 plus KALYDECO in the heterozygous min population. That they're really the most difficult population to treat. And as we've said before, we think that has a lower probability. We haven't actually tested the drug yet there. But on the other hand, those patients have nothing today. So the way we're managing that in the Phase III program is, there is a separate study in that population. But it looks quite different, And we're going to enroll a reasonably small number of patients, about 120, and then we're going to do a futility analysis based on those 120 to decide whether to continue and enroll another 150, which would give us the full pivotal trial. So it allows us to manage the risk there, if you will, while we're also bringing forward, of course, the next generation correctors that we think have a higher likelihood of success in that population."

And so these molecules are various stages there of optimizing PK tox and drug-drug interaction and when we get the first one, which we expect to do this year, optimize for those, we'll take that into the clinic. But our plan is not to just pick one and take it into the clinic. Our plan is actually to pick multiple versions here. They have different flavors. They buy into different sites, we believe, and so we will test multiple versions and multiple combinations in the clinic and as I said, starting this year and then certainly going into next year.

Good evening, everyone. 2015 is a very important year for Vertex. Vertex is the leader in the development of cystic fibrosis medicines that address the underlying cause of the disease.

Vertex is the leader in the development of cystic fibrosis medicines that address the underlying cause of the disease. Our goal in CF is to treat as many people as possible and to enhance the benefits for those we treat. I want to start by acknowledging all of the CF patients and families who continue to reach out to us. We and they are eagerly awaiting the availability of Orkambi. I want to thank them for their support and encouragement, as we seek to improve the lives of more people with CF.
There are 3 strategic priorities that we believe will allow Vertex to continue delivering on our vision to make new transformative medicines available to patients globally. We are focused on delivering on those priorities.
First, we're focused on gaining approval and successfully launching Orkambi while continuing to grow KALYDECO, enabling us to treat even more people with CF. KALYDECO continues to treat more patients through both geographic and label expansion, and we anticipate approximately 3,900 patients to be eligible for KALYDECO by the end of this year.
In addition, we are ready to bring Orkambi to the approximately 8,500 patients ages 12 and older in the U.S. who have 2 copies of the F508del mutation. We look forward to our meeting with the FDA advisory committee on May 12 to discuss Orkambi for the F508del homozygous population who currently don't have any treatment options that target the underlying cause of their disease.
Also we have just completed enrollment in the Phase III safety study evaluating this combination medicine in children ages 6 through 11 who have 2 copies of F508del mutation, which if successful, positions us to provide Orkambi to these younger patients in the U.S. 
Our second priority. We are advancing our CF development pipeline with novel medicines that have the potential to create regimens that may increase the benefit for CF patients. We believe that the VX-661 could play an important role in the treatment of CF, as a key component of a 2- or 3-drug combination. We're now enrolling 2 of the 4 studies included in the broad VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program, and the third study will start in early May.
And our third priority is expanding and diversifying our early-stage pipeline. We continue to expect a next-generation CFTR corrector as well as multiple programs outside of CF to enter the clinic by the end of 2015.
In summary, we continue to make significant progress in realizing our long-term vision to treat more people with cystic fibrosis and to enhance the benefit for those we treat. The continued execution on our strategy gives us the confidence that we will achieve sustainable growth in revenues, earnings and cash flows and create new medicines to treat other serious diseases beyond CF. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart."

I'll begin by reviewing KALYDECO performance in the first quarter, which reflects strong underlying demand, as well as the impact of label and geographic expansion. I will also discuss our progress in preparing for the anticipated approval and launch of Orkambi in the middle of this year in the United States.
KALYDECO revenues increased 31% over the same quarter last year. Global sales this quarter were $130 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $72 million and X U.S. sales of approximately $58 million. There has been rapid uptake of KALYDECO by eligible patients in Australia, following the completion of reimbursement discussions in late 2014. There are more than 200 children and adults with CF in Australia who are eligible for treatment and the vast majority of those have already started to take KALYDECO. Late last year, KALYDECO was approved in the U.S. for use in children and adults ages 6 and older with the R117H mutation. More than 150 of these patients have already initiated treatment. And in March, the KALYDECO label was expanded in the U.S. to include children with CF ages 2 to 5 with 1 of 10 different CF mutations. The first children under the age of 5 have already begun treatment.
We are delighted that so many new children and adults with CF now have access to KALYDECO. And later in 2015, we expect to make further progress as we achieve reimbursement approval for gating mutations in the major European countries where these mutations are prevalent.
In summary, multiple growth drivers are in place for KALYDECO this year as we continue to deliver on our geographic and label expansion plans.
Now turning to Orkambi. Our PDUFA date in the U.S. is July 5, and our team is ready to bring this medicine to the many patients who are eagerly awaiting its approval. Our patient services team who help patients navigate the reimbursement process and also help with patient education and compliance is fully staffed and trained. We are having ongoing and productive discussions with payers. One of the main areas of focus is disease education to help payers understand cystic fibrosis as a disease, its impact on patients and caregivers and also to estimate the number of eligible patients they may have in their plans. And from a supply chain perspective, our launch supply is ready to be shipped shortly after approval and we have sufficient supply to meet what we anticipate to be strong demand.
In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO and we are well-positioned for additional long-term revenue growth with the launch of Orkambi for F508del homozygous patients.

Tonight, I'd like to discuss our first quarter 2015 financial results and then our 2015 financial guidance. 
Firstly to the financials. KALYDECO revenues were $130 million this quarter and are up 31% versus the first quarter of 2014, as we continue to expand the number of patients we treat. Our first quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $246 million, an increase of $13 million compared to last year, this increase mainly being attributable to an increase in SG&A expenses as we prepare for the potential launch of Orkambi. 
And our non-GAAP net loss was $148 million, similar to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $151 million. From a balance sheet perspective, we maintained a strong position with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter. 
Let's turn to our 2015 financial guidance, specifically the reiteration of KALYDECO revenues and combined R&D and SG&A expenses. KALYDECO revenues are on track, and we continue to expect 2015 revenues to be between $560 million to $580 million. And we also continue to expect the combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion for the full year. I would just note before closing that we expect our operating expenses will be higher in the second half of this year compared to the first half, mainly as a result of anticipated progress with the VX-661 pivotal program and the investment to support the potential launch of Orkambi.
I'll close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering a future financial profile consistent with our large-cap biotech peers. And we look forward to updating you on the continued execution of our strategy throughout this year. With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

And then specifically, as it relates to us, it really is going to be discussions around the severity of the disease, level of unmet need, the nature of the product and then the patient population. And as you say, one of the big considerations in Europe you alluded to, is the budget impact and that's where discussions around the patient population and making sure that payers understand the size of the patient population that this is an orphan disease and that the initial indication hopefully for Orkambi will be for a subset of the F508 homozygous population. So they really have a good sense of the size of the patient population and how relatively small it is, is obviously a really important consideration for them as they're thinking through the budget impact. So those, I think, are the 2 types of considerations: one, systemic around the process; and then the others, which are very specific to us and to Orkambi."

Let me take the first question. Then I'll turn it over to Ian for the second. In terms of the second gen correctors, again, let me just sort of remind you -- not from my view, but for some who may not be as familiar. The idea here is that we have shown data that by adding a second generation corrector to a first gen corrector like 809 or 661 plus KALYDECO, we can get very significant enhancement of chloride transport, both in Delta 508 homozygous cells and in Delta 508 het min cells, which is obviously important. And so this is really a sort of 2-edged approach. One is to -- we think it has a high likelihood of allowing us to treat the het min patients, which we know are so difficult with the 2-drug combination. And the other one is, it enhances the benefit of the homozygous patients and frankly, anybody who has a Delta 508, a single Delta 508 allele. So that's the idea. And when we started the project, there were really 2 challenges. One was really a biologic challenge. That is, was that hypothesis correct? Could you actually identify molecules that would synergize with first-generation correctors and increase chloride transport. And we've now definitively answered that question. We have multiple molecules that do that and provide very significant synergy. To me, that was actually the more challenging or worrisome question. The second part, of course, is once you have such molecules, turning them into drugs. And that's really a matter of lead optimization around parameters of PK and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. And that's the stage we're in now with multiple of these molecules. We're on track for what we have -- what our goal was this year, which is to get the first of those molecules in the clinic this year with multiple other molecules following thereafter. We -- and we have shown -- your second part of the question was, have we shown data to demonstrate that synergy? And we have shown that data. I'd refer you back to NACF even 1.5 years ago or so, I believe, where we showed several pieces of data on the synergy that we can produce with those second gen correctors."

I think we have the opportunity to do that as a business given the disease areas that we're in, specifically with the KALYDECO revenue growth that we're starting to see, and we anticipate should increase with the label expansion and the geographic expansion. And then later this year, following the potential approval of Orkambi, we should see an acceleration of that revenue growth and that should accumulate to a significant revenue line. And if we continue to control our operating expenses, what that means is that growing revenue line cascades over an operating base that allows us to achieve high operating margins as a business. I would also point out in that financial profile, because of the scale of the revenue growth, we're still able to reinvest in R&D, which is a core principle of the company. We're still able to reinvest in R&D, while maintaining those high operating margins. So as we look out to 3, 4 years from now, we do see that we're in a very strong position financially."

And those are the questions that we expect to be discussed at the AdCom. Based on the data that you've already seen, we are very confident in our answers to all of those questions because we feel that there's very significant clinical benefit, there's -- the drug was well tolerated from a safety perspective and when you put those together, you get a favorable benefit risk in patients who today don't have any underlying therapy that treats the underlying cause of the disease. And that's consistent with what we're also hearing as feedback from KOLs and from the community. So we're looking forward to the discussion.

We have had and are continuing to have ongoing and very productive discussions with payers. One of the main areas of focus for us is obviously educating them on the disease and the seriousness of the disease. CF being an orphan disease is not necessarily something that they've spent a lot of time focusing on, so talking about the disease, the impact it has on patients and caregivers, making sure they really understand the disease and the level of unmet need, has clearly been a very important part of our early discussions with them. The other critical point of the discussion has really been around helping them understand the patient population. And as you know, one of the things that payers are very keen on understanding is having a high level of certainty and that's certainly one of the things that we can offer them in cystic fibrosis, is this is incredibly well-defined orphan population. So you're helping them understand the size of the population in total and specifically, the size of the eligible patient population likely to be in their plans or in their geographies has been really important. And then when we've been talking about the science behind the product, the fact that it treats the underlying cause of the disease, where there really isn't anything that does that in the market today, when you put all those factors together, I think the general impression we've been getting is that this is the sort of innovation that they like to see and that they want to reimburse."

We do believe that the first generation and second generation corrector target different sites, different parts of the folding mechanism or folding pathway, and we have direct evidence that shows that. And so the idea here is that the Delta 508 mutant CFTR actually has multiple defects at different points in the folding pathway. That the first generation correctors like 809 or 661 target one of those, which is actually relatively early on in the folding pathway. But that we then search for second generation correctors that could target a second one that's further downstream in the pathway, the theory or the idea being that those 2 should be added over synergistic. And as I said before, we've been able to show that, I think, very definitively. We can identify multiple molecules like that. They do add or synergize with the first generation correctors, and our confidence in those is really based upon the totality of all the HBE cell data that we have, which in each case, is translated into the clinic. And so we've shown you data that -- so first generation corrector, second generation corrector, KALYDECO can produce significantly more chloride transport in those cells than just the first gen corrector in KALYDECO, and that's why we're so confident that, that will translate into more benefit in the clinic, in anyone who basically has one or more Delta 508 allele.

We can produce quite a bit more, at least equivalent to what we see with KALYDECO on a 551D cell.

I think it's perhaps more straightforward than people imagine. First, let me just remind you about this trial. The idea here was we needed more safety data than we had had to move into Phase III, and so this trial was really designed predominantly as a safety trial to get us 12 weeks of safety data that would cover us so we could accelerate into Phase III. And the first finding that I would emphasize that we were particularly pleased with was the fact that we didn't see any new safety concerns and that allowed us to accelerate the pivotal program, as you know, which is enrolling now. The other -- there were efficacy endpoints, as you said, predominantly FEV1. And what you're really asking is what was the sort of pattern that we saw. I would characterize it this way. First of all, the changes in FEV1 that we saw were consistent with what we've seen before, in that 4% range in multiple studies. The pattern was very similar to what we've seen before with all CFTR correctors, which means that the changes were rapid. You saw them within 2 weeks, and they were sustained through the 12 weeks of the study. It was a small study, so there was some bouncing around of those, but none of those were statistically significant. This thing went up by 2 weeks, went out to 12 weeks, and it was consistent through the 12 weeks of the trial. And that's consistent with the biology. We know that when you get underlying CFTR correction, that has been something that we've seen that's stable and is sustained. In terms of making a point estimate about what the effect is, we're certainly not going to be able to do that from these small Phase II trials. That's really going to wait for the Phase III trial, which is going to be much larger, obviously, and allow us to directly make the accurate point estimate. But there was nothing here in terms of FEV1 that was in any way inconsistent with what we've seen with 661 or frankly, with the other CFTR correctors in terms of the pattern.

Masha, it's Stuart here. Broadly speaking, we are anticipating the demand from patients and physicians to be very high for Orkambi given the seriousness of the disease, the level of unmet need given that there's no currently available treatmen",316,"Yes, great. Masha, it's Stuart here. Broadly speaking, we are anticipating the demand from patients and physicians to be very high for Orkambi given the seriousness of the disease, the level of unmet need given that there's no currently available treatments that address the underlying cause of the disease and the community's positive reaction to the clinical profile. So generally speaking, we are expecting there to be significant demand and quick uptake. Specifically to address your question about what might be different around the uptake, the biggest difference, I think, is going to be around the patient volume. And if you think about it, there's about 275 CF centers in the U.S. So for KALYDECO and G551D, they were seeing about 3 to 4 patients. For the F508del homozygous population 12 and over, we've got about 8,500 patients. So they're going to be seeing 30-plus patients in the average CF center, if there is such a thing. And whilst the initial decision to initiate therapy may be made very quickly by the physician in consultation with the patient, just that sheer volume of patients and the level of administrative burden that goes along with initiating a patient going through the reimbursement process, prior authorizations and that sort of thing, I think, is likely to lead to a slower relative rate of uptake relative to KALYDECO. The one last thing I do want to say though, relative to KALYDECO is the important phrase that I mean, the KALYDECO uptake was virtually vertical. I mean, we were at 90% of peak penetration in 6 months, the fastest launch personally I've ever been involved in. And so whilst we're saying the relative rate of uptake with Orkambi may be slightly slower as a result of some of these increased patient volume factors, as I say, we're still expecting the demand to be very significant from both patients and physicians."

I'll actually -- Stuart can follow my answer but Stuart can -- because I heard 2 questions. Stuart can also help you understand where we are in commercial preparation as well for the launch of Orkambi. The way we look at this is, profitability should come with the launch of Orkambi and we continue to drive the revenue line with KALYDECO, with geographic and label expansion as we stated earlier on this call. Clearly, the revenue growth is accelerated by the potential approval of Orkambi. Therefore, as we look towards the end of this year and maybe beginning of next year, we start to see the company turn cash flow positive and profitable. As far as the operating expense is concerned and the future operating expense is concerned, as you're asking, in the short term, we've committed to financial guidance of $1 billion -- $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, and we reiterated that on the call tonight. So it helps you understand how we think about this year. And then as we think about the out years, I made some comments earlier that we continue to control that operating expense but with the revenue growth that we have, we see the opportunity to make significant operating margins. To use what you just said in the question, we do not see the company taking a proportion of its revenues and allocating those to R&D. The R&D investment in the company is based on our commitment to a research function that's been highly productive over the years. We like where we are with that, and then the development spend and development investment is a function of the opportunity of the products that we may create. And so we don't look at it as a financial metric to spend away the revenue line. It is more a function of controlling and having efficient R&D, having a controlled and efficient operating expense, but controlling that to allow the revenues to generate significant operating margins. And Stuart, do you want to comment on Orkambi?"

The additional commercial infrastructure we need here in the U.S., which was largely in our patient services team, which is the team that supports patients through the reimbursement process and helps with education and compliance, that team has been scaled up to reflect the larger patient population we hope to serve when Orkambi is approved later this year. So in the U.S., we're fully scaled up and launch ready. And x U.S., essentially, we'll be using largely the same infrastructure that we've used for KALYDECO in those markets where we commercialize KALYDECO. The real growth in our x U.S. market is driven by us needing to build infrastructure in markets where we don't currently have a presence because there isn't really a large bolus of KALYDECO-eligible patients in those markets. And so that expansion is really happening in the second half of the year, as we get ready for the approval and then subsequent reimbursement submissions in Europe towards the back end of this year."

I think I've mentioned this on a number of earlier calls. So we have a very firm and committed corporate and business development strategy, and I'll just go over that once again and then comment on your last part of the question, which is timing. The priority within business and corporate development for us today is cystic fibrosis. And so we continue to evaluate opportunities of other technologies or medicines that may enhance our approach to creating the best combination medicines for our patients, as well as thinking about other modalities of how we may treat patients many years away from now. We're committed to the space. And so we continue to evaluate different technologies and different medicines that are at various different points of research and development to give them consideration of whether they would be better in combination with our base therapy. Second priority for us in the area is scientific footprint. Vertex has been highly successful in small molecule drug development and looking at molecular targets. It's time for us to continue and consider other things, and so we're looking at other modalities of science and there's a lot of very exciting stuff out there and working very hard on evaluating those as well. And then third, there is this consideration of being more opportunistic with -- in licensing. I would say it's smaller scale. I don't want you to take away from this call that Vertex is trying to buy revenue. We have a lot of internal growth with our own compounds. We've got a lot to execute on in the CF space alone. So we don't need at this point to go out and take on risk of M&A to buy revenue. But we would consider balancing our pipeline opportunistically. And then to your point -- question of how do we think about the timing, the ideal timing for bringing in potential CF assets. We look at it by looking at our HBE assays, to be honest. We -- if we have an opportunity to study an external asset with our own assets and evaluate the combination therapies or even the standalone therapy through our HBE cells, we take a lot of confidence from that. And if we can at least do those kind of lab experiments, it gives us confidence there to move forward with, and potentially the risk in the clinic is one mainly focused on safety. So for us, the ideal time is around this preclinical or translational time of medicines to look to do the combinations."

It's clearly a specialty market and are very consistent in size with markets like CF and other specialty markets, so not requiring large commercial infrastructure. And there was preclinical and early clinical data that was suggestive of an effect. And it was, I think, economically also, a very good deal for Vertex in terms of acquiring an option for what could be a very valuable asset to patients and us.

The first one is really interesting because it points to what I think is a fundamental property of these correctors in particular but also the potentiators, which is that they don't stay bound to the target. In fact, that's important that they help with the folding and they likely come off the target. At least, everything that we've seen says that, that happens. Which also gives you some interesting insights into the kinds of potency that you might really want to look at. So I think that's one of the reasons we don't get steric hindrance and another reason, of course, is the size of these small molecules compared to the size of these proteins is quite small. But I actually think it's the first reason more than anything else. These are binders, which tend to come off, I think, during the folding process. And your second question is about exhaustion. In a way, that would be a nice problem to have in terms of driving chloride transport, driving CFTR traffic and chloride transport up so high that you get exhaustion. But in fact, what we're seeing so far anyway is that you can drive this up very significantly with these 3 drug combinations and that the CFTR that's on the cell surface is functional. That's, of course, the most important thing, and we're not seeing what you might worry about, which is increased recycling of the CFTR or abnormal function the CFTR when it's folded by these 3 molecules. That's really not what we're seeing."

That typically is what happens when you show the kinds of success that we've shown. I think the strategy that we're taking is, to as quickly as possible, find the maximal regimens and get the most patients we can on them. We do think we have a pretty considerable head start. Most of these other assets are preclinical or just entering the clinic. And so as I told you, for the reasons I've told you, we're confident that for instance, a 3-drug regimen will allow us to address 80% to 90% of the patients and get essentially maximal effects and that does, of course, provide a barrier to entry, both in terms of even enrolling clinical trials and certainly in terms of commercially once you're already there. So that's really the competitive strategy. And it's supplemented by our business development strategy, as Ian said. So if some of those assets come from externally and we can put them together into even better combinations, all the better for patients and, of course, for us. And the first question is really, what's our confidence around 661. And as I said, the FEV1 response that we saw in that study in the Delta 508 homozygous patients, was pretty comparable to what we've seen in the other Phase II studies. So if anything, that increased our confidence in the effects we're seeing since it went through 12 weeks. I'd also remind you that there's a lot of other Phase II data out there. For example, adding 661 to patients who are on KALYDECO, who have a gating mutation in which in a Phase II study, we showed, I think about a 4.6% further increase in their FEV1. And of course, that's become a part of our Phase III program. I think one of the key questions that we have and that others have is, what is the likelihood of success of the 2-drug combinations, 661 plus KALYDECO in the heterozygous min population, the really the most difficult population to treat. And as we've said before, we think that has a lower probability. We haven't actually tested the drug yet there. But on the other hand, those patients have nothing today. So the way we're managing that in the Phase III program is, there is a separate study in that population. But it looks quite different, and we're going to enroll a reasonably small number of patients, about 120, and then we're going to do a futility analysis based on those 120 to decide whether to continue and enroll another 150, which would give us the full pivotal trial. So it allows us to manage the risk there, if you will, while we're also bringing forward, of course, the next generation correctors that we think have a higher likelihood of success in that population."

The approval of Orkambi on July 2 was an important milestone in our shared journey with the cystic fibrosis community. Orkambi is the first FDA approved medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF for the approximately 8,500 people in the U.S,  12 years and older, with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. This is a big step forward toward a long-term vision of helping more people with CF. We feel very fortunate to be part of the CF community and we appreciate all of the positive feedback we have received and continue to receive from patients, caregivers, healthcare providers and the broader CF community. 
At the beginning of this year, we outlined 3 strategic priorities that will allow Vertex to continue to deliver on our vision to make new transformative medicines available to patients globally. Let me briefly review our progress toward meeting those goals. First, through both geographic and label expansion, we have continued to grow the number of patients treated with KALYDECO resulting in strong revenue growth. With the Orkambi approval and launch in the U.S., we have an even greater opportunity to treat more patients, resulting in additional revenue growth. 
Second, we know that there's still much more to do. We continue to make significant investments into multiple programs to create more CF medicines that may enable us to treat even more patients and to improve the benefit for the patients we treat. 
All 4 studies included in the VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program are initiated, and we also remain on track to bringing in next-generation CFTR corrector into the clinic by the end of 2015. 
And third, we have expanded and diversified our pipeline through our collaboration with to develop and commercialize investigational epithelial sodium channel, or E-mac inhibitors, for CF and other pulmonary diseases. We also continue to advance early-stage development programs outside of CF, including clinical programs in oncology and research programs focused in other areas. We look forward to updating you on these programs later this year. 
The continued execution on our strategy has fundamentally changed the outlook for our business. Specifically, moving forward, we expect to deliver a financial profile of growing revenues, earnings and cash flows, while also continuing to invest to create new medicines to treat more patients with CF and other serious diseases. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart."

I will review KALYDECO performance in the second quarter and also make a few comments regarding our progress in making Orkambi available to eligible patients in the U.S.. Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $155",409,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. I will review KALYDECO performance in the second quarter and also make a few comments regarding our progress in making Orkambi available to eligible patients in the U.S.. 
Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $155 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $93 million and X U.S. sales of approximately $62 million. This represents a 37% increase compared to $113 million in the same quarter last year. The strong growth of KALYDECO is a result of both geographic and label expansion. We have seen good uptick in patients with the R117H mutation following approval in the U.S. in late 2014 and in children ages 2 to 5 with eligible mutations following U.S. approval at the end of March 2015. 
Internationally, there's also been rapid uptake of KALYDECO by eligible patients in Australia following the reimbursement agreement reached in late 2014. Also during the second quarter, we achieved reimbursement approval for nonG551D gating mutations in several European countries where these mutations are prevalent, including Italy, France, England and The Netherlands. As a result, today, more than 85% of eligible gating patients in Europe now have access to KALYDECO.
So the growth in patients receiving KALYDECO will be tempered by enrollment in the VX-661 program as previously described, and this is reflected in our KALYDECO revenue guidance. 
Now turning to Orkambi. Since the FDA approval of Orkambi on July  2, we have been working to get the medicine to the approximately 8,500 eligible patients as rapidly as possible. Our field teams around the country had been educating healthcare providers on the Orkambi prescribing information. Since approval, they have visited the vast majority of the 275 CF centers in the U.S.. 
As we anticipated, interest in the medicine is very high. We believe that all eligible patients with CF should have access to Orkambi. Our public and private payer interactions to date have been productive, and our patient support team has begun to help patients navigate the reimbursement process. Thanks to these efforts and the commitment of healthcare providers that CF centers across the country, I'm happy to report that the first patients are already receiving Orkambi in the U.S.. 
In summary, geographic and labor expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO. And with the launch of Orkambi, we are significantly expanding the number of eligible CF patients we treat. 
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."

Tonight, I'd like to discuss our second quarter 2015 financial results and then update our 2015 financial guidance. 
Firstly to the financials. KALYDECO revenues were $155 million this quarter and we're up 37% from the second quarter of 2014, and up 18% sequentially compared to our first quarter this year. We continued to nicely expand the number of our eligible patients we treat with KALYDECO. 
Our second quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $254 million, an increase of $17 million compared to last year, mainly due to an increase in SG&A expenses supporting the launch of Orkambi. Our non-GAAP net loss was $131 million compared to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $142 million. 
From a bouncy perspective, we maintained a strong position with approximately $1 billion of cash at the end of the quarter. 
Let's now turn to the 2015 financial guidance and specifically KALYDECO revenues and combined R&D and SG&A expenses. Earlier this year, we anticipated 2015 KALYDECO revenues to be between $560 million and $580 million. And based on an increased uptake due the label and geographic expansions as Stuart previously mentioned, we now expect KALYDECO revenues to be between $575 million and $590 million for the full year 2015. 
For the non-GAAP operating expenses, we continue to expect the combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion for the full year. I'll just note that we expect our operating expense to be higher in the second of this year compared to the first half, mainly as a result of the anticipated progress with the VX-661 pivotal program and investment to support the launch of Orkambi. 
I will close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today. We are growing our revenues, and we expect to show a additional growth for Orkambi. We will continue to invest to create even more medicines and support access to those medicines already approved. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

So in terms of the process of reimbursement, essentially, payers fall into a couple of different camps. Some comes in making formal decisions very quickly, and we've seen some of those. Most have a process where they're going to have kind of the equivalent of a PMT committee and review the product. And those who often then put in serve interim policy as it were where they'll evaluate on a case-by-case basis where a patient can be initiated on Orkambi. And so as a result of those interim policy and some initial policy decisions, that's why we have already seen patient start on Orkambi in the first few weeks following launch. And then over the next few months, more and more payers will come to their final determinations on their coverage policies for Orkambi. As I say, based on the discussions we've had so far, we do continue to anticipate that we are going to have broaden and positive reimbursement for Orkambi. And I pass it over to Ian to the expense question."

I may take a little broader if you don't mind, really comment on what is our goal on, let's say, the Vertex financial profile. And it starts with growing revenue stream, which we are very confident around, given the recent approval of Orkambi. We look at growing that rapidly by providing access to the medicines that are already approved and basically holding the steady-state, our operating expenses in a -- in the company. The primary driver within our operating expense structure is R&D. That's a function of our commercial model is because we get provide access to the medicines around the world, which is highly leveraged with small investment required to provide access to these medicines actually. Access to medicines is more about education than it is about selling the drug. So that allows us as the business to reinvest in R&D yet still aim to have high operating margins. And as we see out over the next 3, 4 years, we do see ourselves as the business that if we can drive up our medicines to patients and hold our operating expense, which is exactly what we expect, that we generate high operating margins and operating margins that are consistent with our, let's say, logic cap biotech peers."

So I'm going to take the R&D questions. Thanks for asking this question. We've been talking for some time, both with Wall Street and with regulators, about innovation that we are eager to explore additional endpoints to FEV1, particularly for younger population where it's more difficult to consistently good FEV1 for 2 or 3 years old. And as part of that, we've explored 3 or 4 different endpoints, including lunch clearance index. And this was a very nice opportunity in talking with European regulators about this younger population to begin to use lung clearance index, which is much less and much more consistent particularly in young patients as an efficacy endpoint. So it will be interesting from see the results of this study, which we think will be highly predictive using this endpoint. And we also plan to use of those kinds of results to begin to discuss without the regulators whether these other endpoints might be useful, particularly in the young -- very young patients."

With respect to the Orkambi inhibitors, yes, we do view them very much as complementary. And they could be complementary in a couple of ways, right? Because they fall outside of the classic CFTR correction. They may have activity as monotherapy, particularly in populations that don't have anything. And frankly, and other lung diseases as well, but we're particularly eager to study them on top of our current regiments, like Orkambi because they may amplify the signal that we're seeing here. So I wouldn't view them as one or the other, I would definitely view them as complimentary.

And within that number of patients, we have patients who have commercial insurance to their primary insurance. We also have patients who have government insurance in the number people who've already been initiated. But to give 1 specific number for Medicaid is just impractical because there's really 50 answers to that particular question. And for the second part of the question, I'll hand it over to Jeff."

And so you can think about it as -- and it's actually even an interaction with CFTR. So CFTR's corrigenda that's then you ENaC it tells hybrid the mucus. And so the rationale is based upon preclinical studies is that if you combine the ENaC inhibitor with the potentiator, for example, or corrector potentiator, you get even better hydration of the mucus, which then should lead to better lung function. So what we're doing with the ENaC inhibitor program is were acting the question was best that ENaC inhibitor alone have the activity to help hydrate. Us and improve the functioning of mutations? And then if we think the ENaC inhibitor and added to KALYDECO or Orkambi, can we get better hydration them because of the single agent the loan? And the rationale is really based upon the work we've done in our human epithelial cell essays that sake then you had any ENaC inhibitor to a CFTR corrector or a corrector plus  potential, you actually get even better hydration.

And either QD or BID, both of those seem pretty accessible to patients and that's a certain our target profile with the next-gen correctors and combination. Do other question was, could we need 3 correctors? The answer is, we don't yet fully know, but certainly, our goal is to try to keep this to as few medicines as from drug-drug interaction and standpoint. From equal formulation standpoint. So again, if he asked me what our target profile, how was profile today, it would be he first GEN corrector or second Jen corrector and potentiator."

The approval of ORKAMBI on July 2 was an important milestone in our shared journey with the cystic fibrosis community. ORKAMBI is the first FDA-approved medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF for the approximately 8,500 people in the U.S.  12 years and older with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. This is a big step forward toward our long-term vision of helping more people with CF. We feel very fortunate to be part of the CF community, and we appreciate all of the positive feedback we have received and continue to receive from patients, caregivers, health care providers and the broader CF community. 
At the beginning of this year, we outlined 3 strategic priorities that will allow Vertex to continue to deliver on our vision to make new transformative medicines available to patients globally. Let me briefly review our progress toward meeting those goals. First, through both geographic and label expansion, we have continued to grow the number of patients treated with KALYDECO, resulting in strong revenue growth. With the ORKAMBI approval and launch in the U.S., we have an even greater opportunity to treat more patients, resulting in additional revenue growth. 
Second, we know that there is still much more to do. We continue to make significant investment into multiple programs to create more CF medicines that may enable us to treat even more patients and to improve the benefit for the patients we treat. All 4 studies included in the VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program are initiated, and we also remain on track to bringing a next-generation CFTR corrector into the clinic by the end of 2015. 
And third, we have expanded and diversified our pipeline, through our collaboration with Parion, to develop and commercialize investigational epithelial sodium channel, or ENaC inhibitors, for CF and other pulmonary diseases. We also continue to advance early-stage development programs outside of CF, including clinical programs in oncology and research programs focused on other areas. We look forward to updating you on these programs later this year. 
The continued execution on our strategy has fundamentally changed the outlook for our business. Specifically, moving forward, we expect to deliver a financial profile of growing revenues, earnings and cash flows, while also continuing to invest to create new medicines to treat more patients with CF and other serious diseases. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart."

I will review KALYDECO performance in the second quarter and also make a few comments regarding our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S.
Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $155 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $93 million and x U.S. sales of approximately $62 million. This represents a 37% increase compared to $113 million in the same quarter last year. The strong growth of KALYDECO is a result of both geographic and label expansion. We have seen good uptake in patients with the R117H mutation following approval in the U.S. in late 2014 and in children ages 2 to 5 with eligible mutations following U.S. approval at the end of March 2015. 
Internationally, there has also been rapid uptake of KALYDECO by eligible patients in Australia following the reimbursement agreement reached in late 2014. Also, during the second quarter, we achieved reimbursement approval for non-G551D gating mutations in several European countries where these mutations are prevalent, including Italy, France, England and The Netherlands. As a result, today, more than 85% of eligible gating patients in Europe now have access to KALYDECO.
Further growth in patients receiving KALYDECO will be tempered by enrollment in the VX-661 pivotal program, as previously described, and this is reflected in our KALYDECO revenue guidance. 
Now turning to ORKAMBI. Since the FDA approval of ORKAMBI on July 2, we have been working to get the medicine to the approximately 8,500 eligible patients as rapidly as possible. Our field teams around the country have been educating health care providers on the ORKAMBI prescribing information. Since approval, they have visited the vast majority of the 275 CF centers in the U.S. 
As we anticipated, interest in the medicine is very high. We believe that all eligible patients with CF should have access to ORKAMBI. Our public and private payer interactions to date have been productive, and our patient support team has begun to help patients navigate the reimbursement process. Thanks to these efforts and the commitment of health care providers at CF centers across the country, I'm happy to report that the first patients are already receiving ORKAMBI in the U.S.
In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO. And with the launch of ORKAMBI, we are significantly expanding the number of eligible CF patients we treat.

Tonight, I'd like to discuss our second quarter 2015 financial results, and then, update our 2015 financial guidance. 
Firstly to the financials. KALYDECO revenues were $155 million this quarter and were up 37% from the second quarter of 2014 and up 18% sequentially compared to our first quarter this year. We continued to nicely expand the number of our eligible patients we treat with KALYDECO. 
Our second quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $254 million, an increase of $17 million compared to last year, mainly due to an increase in SG&A expenses supporting the launch of ORKAMBI. Our non-GAAP net loss was $131 million compared to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $142 million. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we maintained a strong position with approximately $1 billion of cash at the end of the quarter. 
Let's now turn to the 2015 financial guidance and, specifically, KALYDECO revenues and combined R&D and SG&A expenses. Earlier this year, we anticipated 2015 KALYDECO revenues to be between $560 million and $580 million. And based on an increased uptake due to label and geographic expansions, as Stuart previously mentioned, we now expect KALYDECO net revenues to be between $575 million and $590 million for the full year 2015. 
For the non-GAAP operating expenses, we continue to expect the combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion for the full year. I'll just note that we expect our operating expense to be higher in the second half of this year compared to the first half, mainly as a result of the anticipated progress with the VX-661 pivotal program and the investment to support the launch of ORKAMBI. 
I will close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today. We are growing our revenues, and we expect to show a additional growth from ORKAMBI. We will continue to invest to create even more medicines and support access to those medicines already approved.

So in terms of the process for reimbursement, essentially, payers fall into a couple of different camps. Some come to making formal decisions very quickly, and we've seen some of those. Most have a process where they're going to have kind of the equivalent of a P&T committee and review the product. And those will often, then, put in sort of interim policies as it were, where they'll evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether a patient can be initiated on ORKAMBI. And so as a result of those interim policies and some initial policy decisions, that's why we have already seen patients start on ORKAMBI in the first few weeks following launch. And then, over the next few months, more and more payers will come to their final determinations on their coverage policies for ORKAMBI. As I say, based on the discussions we've had so far, we do continue to anticipate that we are going to have broadened and positive reimbursement for ORKAMBI.

I'm going to take it a little broader, if you don't mind, and really comment on what is our goal with, let's say, the Vertex financial profile. And it starts with growing -- a growing revenue stream, which we are very confident around, given the recent approval of ORKAMBI. We look at growing that rapidly by providing access to the medicines that are already approved and, basically, holding at a steady state our operating expenses in a -- in the company. Now the primary driver within our operating expense structure is R&D that's a function of our commercial model, is because we get -- provide access to the medicines around the world, which is highly leveraged with small investment required to provide access to these medicines, actually. Providing access to the medicines is more about education than it is about selling a drug. So that allows us, as a business, to reinvest in R&D yet still aim to have high operating margins. And as we see out over the next 3, 4 years, we do see ourselves as a business that if we can drive up our medicines to patients and hold our operating expense, which is exactly what we expect, that we'd generate high operating margins and operating margins that are consistent with our, let's say, larger-cap biotech peers."

And as part of that, we've explored 3 or 4 different endpoints, including lung clearance index. And this was a very nice opportunity, in talking with European regulators about this younger population, to begin to use lung clearance index, which is much less effort-dependent and much more consistent, particularly in young patients, as an efficacy endpoint.

And that's progressing nicely, and we are on track. With respect to the ENaC inhibitors, yes, we do view them very much as complementary. And they could be complementary in a couple of ways, right, because they fall outside of the classic CFTR correction. They may have activity as monotherapy, particularly in populations like het-mins that don't have anything and, frankly, in other lung diseases as well. But we're particularly eager to study them on top of our current regimens like ORKAMBI because they may amplify the signal that we're seeing here. So I wouldn't view them as one or the other, I would definitely view them as complementary. And I guess, your question is sort of getting at do they, in any way, slow down or de-prioritize our next-gen correctors? And the answer is no. We're full speed ahead on the next-gen correctors."

Europe is where we're starting to continue to recruit new patients potentially, based on the label expansion of KALYDECO. And instead of going on to KALYDECO, we're starting to recruit those into our 661 studies.

Ian described this in terms of the ocean and seaweed, but I can't be nearly that eloquent, so I'll just take it from a more scientific standpoint, maybe. The way we think about ENaC and the way the ENaC inhibitors work, as you know, is that ENaC is a separate channel, the sodium channel, that is also involved in hydrating the secretions and the mucus in the lung. And so you could think about it as -- and there's actually even an interaction with CFTR. So CFTR's a chloride channel that helps hydrate the mucus; ENaC's the sodium channel, it helps hydrate the mucus. And so the rationale and it's based upon preclinical studies, is that if you combine an ENaC inhibitor with a potentiator, for example, or corrector potentiator, you'll get the even better hydration of the mucus, which, then, should lead to better lung function. So what we're doing with the ENaC inhibitor program is were asking the question, does the ENaC inhibitor alone have activity to help hydrate for mucus and improve lung function in all mutations? And then, if we take the ENaC inhibitor and add it to KALYDECO or ORKAMBI, can we get better hydration than we get with a single agent alone? And the rationale is really based upon the work we've done in our human bronchial epithelial cell assays that say when you add an ENaC inhibitor to a CFTR corrector or to a corrector plus potentiator, you actually get even better hydration. So the question is, does that translate into the clinic and improvements in FEV1? And we definitely are going to be looking at hard endpoints like FEV1."

And as I said, we're on track to bring the first of those into the clinic this year, and our goal is to bring at least 2 or 3 additional behind that, following completion of lead-optimization for those additional molecules and to compare several different next-generation correctors. And then, your question about lung clearance index. Lung clearance index is actually a fairly widely used measure of the ability to empty the lungs of air effectively. And there is data from a number of studies showing, for instance, that when patients, such as G551D patients, were treated with KALYDECO, there's a significant improvement in lung clearance index. And we're happy to send you some of those studies. So it is an endpoint that's been pharmacologically validated, if you want to think about it that way."

Just to refer to an earlier comment Jeff Leiden made, which was the initial part of -- this initial cohort of patients that enters the het-min study with 661. The idea of that is that there is futility assessment. That futility assessment, if an independent advisory board deems that it is worth progressing forward, we will just continue to recruit patients and the study will be ongoing. We will not be at a disclosure point. At that point, we'll just continue to recruit into the study and wait for the complete and final results of that study. If the board deems that it is futile, effectively futile in dosing those patients, they will advise us so, and we will curtail the study on stopping that study and working the patients off the drug. We will provide a disclosure to let you know that, that study is no longer going forward. So I think, the way to think about this is that if there is no news, it is because the study will progress, that we'll continue to recruit het-min patients, and if there is an early closure of that study, we'll advise you at that point in time."

So you -- I think while it's early days, I think our experience in the first 4 weeks is the sort of factors that we were anticipating are really playing out as we anticipated they would. And those factors, just to remind you, is that the volume of patients is obviously much greater than it was when KALYDECO was initially approved, just the G551D patients. So there's a volume of patients that centers needed to get in. Then, obviously, when a physician is making the decision to start a patient on a new drug, then, obviously, there's a fair amount of discussion. Education is going to want to go on there, explaining the product, the mechanism of action, how to take it, all those sorts of things. And then, obviously, we move on to the sort of reimbursement approval process. And so all of those factors that we anticipated prior to launch, being involved in how the launch is going to go, have certainly been playing out exactly as we thought we -- as we thought they would. In terms of what we're doing to support centers, we're doing a number of things, clearly, providing education materials to support their discussions with their patients. We're providing them with help in terms of the sort of materials they need to submit to the various payers, be it prior authorization, documentation and stuff like that; providing them help with what documentation they're going to need, where the right place to send it is. And then, from a patient-support point of view, obviously, our patient services group is there to support individual patients navigate the reimbursement process as well. And so we're -- as compliantly as possible, we are providing as much support as we can to help patients get access to the medicine. On the second point, I'll pass it over to Ian."

So that is one tactic. And so we're continuing with CF, and I think it is -- it behooves the company to continue to raise the bar in terms of the benefit we provide patients with our medicines, and that's why we reinvest. We also reinvest in other areas within the company, and I hope that later this year and early next year, we can tell you a little bit more  about those other disease areas that we're in as well as other business development efforts, which are looking to expand our scientific footprint. And then, also, just to consider other products that may diversify and stage our pipeline. It tends to be earlier-stage ideas. I think that's appropriate for a company at our stage as we progress forward, and our priority is still cystic fibrosis. I'll throw it over Jeff Leiden, though, because I think there's just much more of a -- kind of a strategic comment that's worth making here, which is while we're successful in CF, we're not taking our eye off that we want to go into other disease areas.

And we've said many times, our goal is to get to the majority, more than 90% of patients with medicines that have KALYDECO-like or better effects. And I think we're executing well on that, and we're well on track. At the same time, obviously, we are investing in areas outside of CF. As I've said, we'll bring more new compounds into the clinic this year at Vertex than we ever have in the history of the company. We're not talking a lot about that yet, but you'll start to hear more news us we begin to get clinical results, I think, later and certainly the next year. And then, the third part, as Ian said, is that we're going to have the financial resources to also invest in innovation outside the company. And we're spending significantly more time, effort, and money on our BD activities. You've heard a couple of deals, but I think you can anticipate more, again, typically focused on earlier-stage scientific platforms or assets.

They go into Phase I in normal single-ascending dose, multi-ascending dose. And following, hopefully, successful safety results from those studies, we would put them both as monotherapy and as combination therapy into patients. And I think we've figured out -- we've learned a lot over the last few years about how to do those studies very quickly and very efficiently with small numbers of patients.

ORKAMBI is the first FDA approved medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF for the approximately 8,500 people in the U.S.  12 years and older with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. This is a big step forward toward our long term vision of helping more people with CF. We feel very fortunate to be part of the CF community, and we appreciate all of the positive feedback we have received and continue to receive from patients, caregivers, health care providers and the broader CF community. 
At the beginning of this year, we outlined 3 strategic priorities that will allow Vertex to continue to deliver on our vision to make new transformative medicines available to patients globally. Let me briefly review our progress toward meeting those goals. First, through both geographic and label expansion, we have continued to grow the number of patients treated with KALYDECO, resulting in strong revenue growth. With the ORKAMBI approval and launch in the U.S., we have an even greater opportunity to treat more patients, resulting in additional revenue growth. 
Second, we know that there is still much more to do. We continue to make significant investment into multiple programs to create more CF medicines that may enable us to treat even more patients and to improve the benefit for the patients we treat. All 4 studies included in the VX 661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program are initiated, and we also remain on track to bring a next generation CFTR corrector into the clinic by the end of 2015. 
And third, we have expanded and diversified our pipeline, through our collaboration with Parion, to develop and commercialize investigational epithelial sodium channel, or ENaC inhibitors, for CF and other pulmonary diseases. We also continue to advance early stage development programs outside of CF, including clinical programs in oncology and research programs focused on other areas. We look forward to updating you on these programs later this year. 
The continued execution on our strategy has fundamentally changed the outlook for our business. Specifically, moving forward, we expect to deliver a financial profile of growing revenues, earnings and cash flows, while also continuing to invest to create new medicines to treat more patients with CF and other serious diseases. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart."

I will review KALYDECO performance in the second quarter and also make a few comments regarding our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S. Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $155",414,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. I will review KALYDECO performance in the second quarter and also make a few comments regarding our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S. 
Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $155 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $93 million and ex U.S. sales of approximately $62 million. This represents a 37% increase compared to $113 million in the same quarter last year. The strong growth of KALYDECO is a result of both geographic and label expansion. We have seen good uptake in patients with the R117H mutation following approval in the U.S. in late 2014 and in children ages 2 to 5 with eligible mutations following U.S. approval at the end of March 2015. 
Internationally, there has also been rapid uptake of KALYDECO by eligible patients in Australia following the reimbursement agreement reached in late 2014. Also, during the second quarter, we achieved reimbursement approval for non G551D gating mutations in several European countries where these mutations are prevalent, including Italy, France, England and The Netherlands. As a result, today, more than 85% of eligible gating patients in Europe now have access to KALYDECO.
Further growth in patients receiving KALYDECO will be tempered by enrollment in the VX 661 pivotal program, as previously described, and this is reflected in our KALYDECO revenue guidance. 
Now turning to ORKAMBI. Since the FDA approval of ORKAMBI on July 2, we have been working to get the medicine to the approximately 8,500 eligible patients as rapidly as possible. Our field teams around the country have been educating health care providers on the ORKAMBI prescribing information. Since approval, they have visited the vast majority of the 275 CF centers in the U.S. 
As we anticipated, interest in the medicine is very high. We believe that all eligible patients with CF should have access to ORKAMBI. Our public and private payer interactions to date have been productive, and our patient support team has begun to help patients navigate the reimbursement process. Thanks to these efforts and the commitment of health care providers at CF centers across the country, I'm happy to report that the first patients are already receiving ORKAMBI in the U.S. 
In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO. And with the launch of ORKAMBI, we are significantly expanding the number of eligible CF patients we treat. 
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."

Tonight, I would like to discuss our second quarter 2015 financial results, and then, update our 2015 financial guidance. 
Firstly to the financials. KALYDECO revenues were $155 million this quarter and were up 37% from the second quarter of 2014 and up 18% sequentially compared to our first quarter this year. We continued to nicely expand the number of eligible patients we treat with KALYDECO. 
Our second quarter non GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $254 million, an increase of $17 million compared to last year, mainly due to an increase in SG&A expenses supporting the launch of ORKAMBI. Our non GAAP net loss was $131 million compared to prior year non GAAP net loss of $142 million. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we maintained a strong position with approximately $1 billion of cash at the end of the quarter. 
Let's now turn to the 2015 financial guidance and, specifically, KALYDECO revenues and combined R&D and SG&A expenses. Earlier this year, we anticipated 2015 KALYDECO revenues to be between $560 million and $580 million. And based on an increased uptake due to label and geographic expansions, as Stuart previously mentioned, we now expect KALYDECO net revenues to be between $575 million and $590 million for the full year 2015. 
For the non GAAP operating expenses, we continue to expect the combined non GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion for the full year. I'll just note that we expect our operating expenses to be higher in the second half of this year compared to the first half, mainly as a result of the anticipated progress with the VX 661 pivotal program and the investment to support the launch of ORKAMBI. 
I will close by stating that we are in a strong financial position today. We are growing our revenues, and we expect to show a additional growth from ORKAMBI. We will continue to invest to create even more medicines and support access to those medicines already approved. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

So in terms of the process for reimbursement, essentially, payers fall into a couple of different camps. Some come to making formal decisions very quickly, and we've seen some of those. Most have a process where they're going to have kind of the equivalent of a P&T committee and review the product. And those will often, then, put in sort of interim policies as it were, where they'll evaluate on a case by case basis whether a patient can be initiated on ORKAMBI. And so as a result of those interim policies and some initial policy decisions, that's why we have already seen patients start on ORKAMBI in the first few weeks following launch. And then, over the next few months, more and more payers will come to their final determinations on their coverage policies for ORKAMBI. As I say, based on the discussions we've had so far, we do continue to anticipate that we are going to have broadened and positive reimbursement for ORKAMBI. And I'll pass it over to Ian handle the expenses question."

I'm going to take it a little broader, if you don't mind, and really comment on what is our goal with, let's say, the Vertex financial profile. And it starts with growing    a growing revenue stream, which we are very confident around, given the recent approval of ORKAMBI. We look at growing that rapidly, providing access to the medicines that are already approved and, basically, holding at a steady state our operating expenses in a    in the company. The primary driver within our operating expense structure is R&D. That's a function of our commercial model as we get    provide access to the medicines around the world, which is highly leveraged with small investment required to provide access to these medicines, actually. Providing access to the medicines is more about education than it is about selling a drug. So that allows us, as a business, to reinvest in R&D yet still aim to have high operating margins. And as we see out over the next 3, 4 years, we do see ourselves as a business that if we can drive up our medicines to patients and hold our operating expense, which is exactly what we expect, that we'd generate high operating margins and operating margins that are consistent with our, let's say, larger cap biotech peers."

And as part of that, we've explored 3 or 4 different endpoints, including lung clearance index. And this was a very nice opportunity, in talking with European regulators about this younger population, to begin to use lung clearance index, which is much less effort dependent and much more consistent, particularly in young patients, as an efficacy endpoint. So it'll be interesting from    to see the results of this study, which, we think, will be highly predictive using this endpoint. And we also plan to use of those kinds of results to begin to discuss with other regulators whether these other endpoints might be useful, particularly in the young, very young patients."

And they could be complementary in a couple of ways, right, because they fall outside of the classic CFTR correction. They may have activity as monotherapy, particularly in populations like het mins that don't have anything and, frankly, in other lung diseases as well. But we're particularly eager to study them on top of our current regimens like ORKAMBI because they may amplify the signal that we're seeing here.

Ian described this in terms of the ocean and seaweed, but I can't be nearly that eloquent, so I'll just take it from a more scientific standpoint, maybe. The way we think about ENaC and the way the ENaC inhibitors work, as you know, is that ENaC is a separate channel, the sodium channel, that is also involved in hydrating the secretions and the mucus in the lung. And so you could think about it as    and there's actually even an interaction with CFTR. So CFTR's a chloride channel that helps hydrate the mucus; ENaC's the sodium channel, it helps hydrate the mucus. And so the rationale and based upon preclinical studies, is that if you combine an ENaC inhibitor with a potentiator, for example, or corrector potentiator, you'll get even better hydration of the mucus, which, then, should lead to better lung function. So what we're doing with the ENaC inhibitor program is were asking the question, does the ENaC inhibitor alone have activity to help hydrate the mucus and improve lung function in all mutations? And then, if we take the ENaC inhibitor and add it to KALYDECO or ORKAMBI, can we get better hydration than we get with a single agent alone? And the rationale is really based upon the work we've done in our human bronchial epithelial cell assays that say when you add an ENaC inhibitor to a CFTR corrector or to a corrector plus potentiator, you actually get even better hydration. So the question is, does that translate into the clinic and improvements in FEV1? And we definitely are going to be looking at hard endpoints like FEV1."

And there is data from a number of studies showing, for instance, that when patients, such as G551D patients, were treated with KALYDECO, there's a significant improvement in lung clearance index.

Your other question was, could we need 3 correctors? The answer is we don't yet fully know, but certainly, our goal is to try to keep this to as few medicines as possible, simply from drug drug interaction standpoint, from a co formulation standpoint. So again, if you ask me what our target profile    product profile was today, it would be a first gen corrector, a second gen corrector and a potentiator."

I guess, about 80% of KALYDECO responders have probably shown improvement on VX 661 plus ivacaftor based on the Phase 2 data, and it doesn't look like there'd be a meaningful amount of clinical efficacy above and beyond ORKAMBI for the combo.

Good evening, everyone. 3 years ago, we outlined a clearly strategy designed to establish a foundation for sustainable business growth. This evening, I'm pleased report that we continue to make excellent progress toward achieving our long-term vision for 2016 and beyond. Significant revenues and revenue growth for multiple high-value medicines, high operating margins and a pipeline of additional transformational medicines. 
Our goal in CF is to reach the vast majority of people with this serious disease and to continue to enhance the benefits for the patients who we treat, and we continue to build on the track record of innovations discover, develop and deliver transformative medicines more people with CF. 
Let me summarize our recent commercial success in development progress in CF.
In July, ORKAMBI became the first FDA-approved medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF for the approximately 8,500 people in the U.S. 12 years and older, with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. And as of September 30, 2015, we already were treating more than 3,000 of these patients.
Our sNDA has been accepted by the FDA for the expanded use of KALYDECO in people aged 2 and older, with 1 of 23 residual function mutations that result in CF. This may accelerate access to KALYDECO for more than 1,500 patients in the U.S.
The European Union CHMP recently issued 3 positive opinions for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, all with the potential to significantly expand the number of eligible patients for our CF medicines. In fact, at this time last year, we were approved to treat approximately 2,600 people with CF worldwide. Whereas today, there are more than 25,000 patients approved or under regulatory submissions for our medicines.
We are currently conducting 2 Phase III clinical studies for ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 years old, and plan to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the first half of 2016. There are approximately 5,500 children with CF in the U.S. and Europe with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
Following closely behind ORKAMBI, we have the VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program underway, which is expected to enroll more than 1,000 people with CF across 4 studies. We expect to complete enrollment in mid-2016.
At the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference, we announced that we are advancing 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440 into the clinic, and we expect to dose first healthy volunteer with VX-440 this week. We believe these new correctors hold tremendous promise as part of a triple combination regimen for the 80% to 90% of CF patients with at least 1 F508del allele. Thereby, possibly allowing us to treat patients we are not yet treating and also to enhance the benefit for those we already treat.
The strength of the ORKAMBI launch to date and the continued expansion of the number of people eligible for KALYDECO are further evidence that we continue to execute against our key goal to become a company that can reinvest to create future medicines and deliver returns to shareholders.
As I noted at the NACF conference, we also continue to advance early stage development programs outside of CF. For the treatment of cancer, pain and other diseases, which represents an important diversification of our development portfolio. 
Dr. David Altshuler, our Chief Scientific Officer, will discuss our research strategy and some of our emerging compounds later on this call. As you know, David was 1 of the 4 founding members of Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, where he served as Deputy Director and Chief Academic Officer. David is an experienced physician and human geneticist, and we tapped him to lead our research organization earlier this year, so we can bring his experience to bear as we continue to deliver transformational medicines to more people. 
Before I turn the call over to Stuart, I wanted to mention how delighted we are to have entered into a research collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. 
Gene editing represents a new and powerful technology platform that could represent a future paradigm shift in the treatment of CF as well as other genetic diseases. And we're excited to be working with CRISPR, the company at the forefront of using gene editing to create new treatments. With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart to discuss Vertex's third quarter sales performance."

Tonight, I will review KALYDECO performance in the third quarter and our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S. Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $166 million, comprised of U.S.",627,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review KALYDECO performance in the third quarter and our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S. 
Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $166 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $95 million and ex-U.S. sales of approximately $71 million. This represents a 31% increase over the $127 million we recorded in the same quarter last year.
The growth of KALYDECO is a result of continued geographic and label expansion. We have seen strong uptake in patients with the R117H mutation, following approval in the U.S. in late 2014. And in children ages 2 to 5 with eligible mutations following U.S. approval at the end of March 2015. 
Internationally, there's also been a rapid uptake of KALYDECO eligible patients in Australia and in patients with non-G551D gating mutations in several European countries where these mutations are prevalent. 
We've made significant progress in securing reimbursement in Europe this year. As a result, the vast majority of eligible gating patients in Europe now have access to KALYDECO.
We expect that growth in the number of patients receiving KALYDECO globally in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016 will be tempered by enrollment in the VX-661 pivotal program as previously described.
Now turning to ORKAMBI. Since the FDA approval of ORKAMBI on July 2, we have been focused on educating health care providers on the medicine and working with payers to secure reimbursement for the approximately 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. 
Sales for the third quarter totaled $131 million. More than 3,000 patients have started treatment in the U.S., underscoring the important advance this medicine represents in the treatment of CF and the strong interest from both patients and their doctors. Our field teams around the country have visited all of the 275 CF centers in the U.S. since approval. And virtually, every center has initiated patients in ORKAMBI. As we anticipated, interest in the medicine is very high, which has put a significant administrative burden on centers as they work to initiate patients on treatment. 
As expected, we're seeing broad coverage of and access to ORKAMBI, which reflects payer understanding and appreciation of the seriousness of the disease and a significant value of a medicine that treats the underlying cause of CF. 
The majority of commercial and government payers with eligible patients are reimbursing for ORKAMBI. In those plans with published policies and/or defined prior authorization criteria, almost all are reimbursing to label. There are a small number of plans not yet allowing access to ORKAMBI. And we anticipate they will complete their formal ORKAMBI reviews and define their final policies in the coming months.
Our patient support team has been working diligently to help patients navigate the reimbursement process and is working to reduce the time it takes the patients to get their prescriptions filled. For any chronic medication, compliance and adherence are important facets of patient care, so they will be increasing their focus to ensure patients are able to take ORKAMBI as prescribed and so benefit from the medicine.
Outside of the U.S., we continue to expect approval in the EU in the fourth quarter of this year. Our EU commercial infrastructure is largely in place. And upon approval, we will then begin pricing and reimbursement discussions on a country-by-country basis to secure reimbursement for eligible patients who may benefit from ORKAMBI.
With KALYDECO, the completion of reimbursement discussions took 9 to 20 months following approval. 
In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO. And with the launch of ORKAMBI, we are significantly expanding the number of eligible CF patients we treat.
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."

Firstly to the financials. Our CF revenues were $297 million this quarter as we significantly increased the number of eligible people we treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. KALYDECO sales of $166 million were up 31",570,"Thanks, Stuart, and good evening, everyone. Firstly to the financials. Our CF revenues were $297 million this quarter as we significantly increased the number of eligible people we treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. KALYDECO sales of $166 million were up 31% versus the third quarter last year and up 7% versus second quarter of 2015. 
Now ORKAMBI. The launch in the U.S. is off to a strong start. We recorded $131 million in net revenues. Inventory levels are normal, with 1 to 2 weeks in the channel. Gross-to-net adjustments were in the high single digits due to more rapid uptake for patients within commercial plans as compared to government paid plans. We continue to expect Medicaid mix to be 35% to 40% in the longer-term, which will increase gross-to-net adjustment into the midteens by late 2016. We expect continued revenue growth into 26 industry approach peak penetration in the U.S. market in the second half of 2016.
As for Europe and other ex-U.S. countries, we expect to recognize the first  ORKAMBI revenues in Europe in the first half of 2016. These revenues will be mainly generated in Germany, given that pricing and reimbursement approvals in other countries will take some time to finalize.
We do expect French regulatory authority to grant an ATU, or temporary authorization for use, for ORKAMBI in 2015, but we'll not recognize revenue from these sales until we receive formal reimbursement approval in France.
Our third quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $278 million, an increase of $66 million compared to last year. This increase is mainly attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses supporting the launch of ORKAMBI and research and development cost to support the advancement of our CF medicines. The scale of our R&D organization and SG&A infrastructure is appropriate for our business. We expect modest increases in operating expense in 2016, and these will be driven by the progression of our CF medicines in development and geographic expansion to support the international launch of ORKAMBI. But we are rapidly moving towards steady-state. While we expect to continue to invest significantly in R&D, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to ensure significant operating margins moving forward.
Our non-GAAP net loss has narrowed to $32 million compared to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $86 million, and this is primarily driven by a significant increase in CF product revenues. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we maintained a strong position with approximately $1 billion of cash at the end of the quarter.
Now let's turn to the 2015 financial guidance specifically KALYDECO revenues and the combined R&D and SG&A expenses. The time of our second quarter 2015 earnings call in July, we anticipate 2015 KALYDECO net revenues to be between $575 million and $590 million. We are now increasing KALYDECO net revenue guidance to be between $605 million and $620 million for the full year of 2015.
For the non-GAAP operating expenses, we now expect our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense for the full year to be in the middle of the range we provided in January of this year of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. 
In summary, we are in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering financial profile that include sustainable revenue and earnings growth, while continuing to invest to create more medicines and support access to those medicines already approved.

At Vertex, our strategy is to invest in science to create transformative medicines for serious diseases and specialty markets. This is an enormous challenge because doing anything for the first time involves considerable risk. But it's also great opportunity because we live in a time of accelerating breakthroughs in science that can be applied to solve important problems that were previously thought to the intractable. 
There are 3 main points I would like to make about Vertex's research and I'll make comments on each of them. First, CF represents Vertex's most significant success to date, and it's where we expect our research and early development will continue to have the biggest impact in the near-term. Second, cystic fibrosis provides good template to understand the kind of diseases we expect to pursue in the future. And third, lessons from our work in CF are guiding our early clinical programs in other areas. I'll reference 5 different candidate medicines in pain and oncology that were discovered by Vertex's scientists and that are progressing in early development.
As you know, in CF, we are advancing 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440 out of our labs and into first in-human studies. In vitro data show that in combination with VX-661 and ivacaftor, this compound resulted in chloride transport that was approximately threefold greater than the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination in these cells. These data give us optimism in that hopefully one day, we will be able to address the vast majority of CF patients with a triple combination therapy, and also the continue to enhance the benefit for those we are already treating.
Our research strategy with CF is not limited to our internal programs. We're also looking externally to bring in compounds that complement our CFTR modulators, and this is enabled by our CF research expertise. Our CF research platform allows us to robustly characterize the activity of external compounds and their potential to work in combination with our existing regimens. This approach formed the basis for the collaboration we signed with Perry for ENaC inhibitors. And we showed at NACF the of ENaC inhibitor to enhance the effects of ORKAMBI in vitro. 
We are looking far into the future of CF treatment to understand what impact new treatment modalities could have. This week we announced the collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to use the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing platform to create new medicines. 
CRISPR-Cas9 is an important scientific and technical breakthrough that holds significant promise for the future discovery of potentially transformative treatments and this collaboration will evaluate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 across multiple diseases where targets have been validated through human genetics. 
We are excited to begin our initial gene editing research on discovering treatments to address the mutations and genes known to cause and contribute to CF and sickle cell disease.
Thinking about CF more conceptually, the combination of what we learned through our CF research and the increasing flow of information from human genetics forms a template for our future discovery of precision medicines.
First, our CF research program was directed at a target that was validated as an underlying cost based on human genetics. Second, by understanding the natural history of disease and using proprietary in vitro assays, we have a highly focused goal for CFTR modulations. Third, we had early markers of clinical effect that were highly predictive of late stage success. And finally, these features have led to repeated success from the lab to the clinic. There are many lessons here that we can apply so we can invest wisely and increase our chances of success in the future. Our investments are being evaluated based on insights from human biology, the therapeutic approach and clinical development path criteria that we learn from our work in CF and can now apply to other diseases.
In the area of pain, we have 2 compounds in early development. VX-150 and VX-241 targets sodium channels with strong rationale for the treatment of pain based on human genetics and well-documented roles in pain sensation. Specifically, the basis of our program is a key insight from human biology that gain or loss of function mutations in key sodium channels can increase or decrease pain sensation.
In cancer, we have 3 compounds in early development, VX-970, VX-803 and VX-984 that target key cellular pathways responsible for DNA repair, a fundamental mechanism underlying the development and growth of cancer. In fact, DNA repair was recognized in 2015 with the Nobel Prize in chemistry, citing 3 academic scientists for their pioneering efforts to map at a molecular level how the cells repair damaged DNA. The Nobel committee specifically cited the implication of this work for the development of new cancer treatments.
In healthy cells, properly functioning DNA repair mechanisms protect against the development of problematic mutations. In cancer, however, these systems of DNA repair are known to go awry, allowing cancer cells to both accumulate mutations and increase their ability to survive and proliferate. The new Vertex cancer medicines now in early development, target 2 key nodes in the DNA repair system, kinase known as ATR and DNA PK. Modulating activity of these 2 kinases is predicted to be critical to continued cancer cell survival in the face of DNA damage. In addition, we believe that these new compounds can be targeted to patients based upon the knowledge of the genomic alterations or characteristics in each patient's cancer, allowing a precision medicine approach to help increased benefit by targeting those patients more likely to respond. 
With the most advanced compound, VX-970, we and the National Cancer Institute are now conducting a number of early studies in tumor types that are predicted to be responsive to an ATR inhibitor. The first Phase I clinical data for VX-970, we presented at the Triple meeting in Boston in November.
In closing, we are pleased with the significant progress we are making in developing additional CF medicines, especially for the tens of thousands of patients living with CF, who do not have a medicine that targets the underlying cause of their disease. We look forward to selling you more about our research strategy and our emerging clinical programs as they progress. 
And with, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

It's right in that $15 million to $20 million was the initial inventory build for ORKAMBI. The rest is really driven by organic patient demand. In terms of our comments about the burden on CF centers, this is really just reflecting what we heard from centers actually prior to the launch, and we are seeing it play out during the launch that this is just a larger volume of patients than they have to try and get initiated on KALYDECO when we launched it. And so that administrative burden of helping payers -- helping patients through the payer reimbursement process is a very burden in some of the centers. And they certainly are relaying that to us. However, as we said in our prepared remarks, through the end of September, we have seen over 3,000 patients initiating therapies, so that the centers are really working through that process. And I don't think we really are seeing it as a seasonal impact. It's really just a function of working through a new launch with payers. In terms of the EU..."

We're certainly may taking the same sort of things into account the seriousness of the disease, the clinical value we've demonstrated through treating the underlying cause of the disease, the investments we've made and continue to want to make in R&D to discover and develop future transformative medicines for CF patients and in other diseases, but we're also going to have to be sensitive to the economic environment in Europe, including the potential budget impact that ORKAMBI could have in almost all cases, are single-payer markets.

And just to comment, it's a great question because as we turn profitable, which we do anticipate in the fourth quarter, we're now cash accumulation and over the years we have been cash preservation while we reinvest in the business, so we are a different company as we head into the fourth quarter. As we think about the allocation of cash, I start with the receipt of cash is actually the revenue, and just to be basic about this, but the receipt of cash is the revenue. As we think about reinvestment on allocation of that capital, it does go towards R&D for our business, the internal R&D. But as we develop our business, we also consider the external investment in R&D. And I think you saw that with the example this week of signing a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics that we're very excited about. We've also seen it earlier this year with those licensing products that complement our approach in CF. So we're already starting to allocate that revenue capital towards internal R&D. And also acquire products or expand our scientific footprint. As far as -- we anticipate that to continue. As far as thinking about other allocation of capital, rather than just accumulate on the balance sheet, we do think about our capital structure and the shares outstanding. And we need to continue to think about that going forward. But it becomes a prioritization and first, it is about investments in medicines for the future, which provides growth. However, the capital becomes available that we would consider addressing our capital structure, we'd also make that choice as well."

And not only where they picked for their performance in preclinical assays with their efficacy and safety, but also their pharmaceutical properties. So we believe that we're in a very good position to move those into clinic very shortly into the healthy studies. And then next year, to move them into triple combination studies and see some results in patients. So we're looking forward to that."

And based on the data there, we'll be able to determine how to sort of craft these regimens for each patient subset. But that would be the theoretical expectations based on what we've seen in HBE cell. Does that make sense?"

Good evening, everyone. 3 years ago, we outlined a clear strategy designed to establish a foundation for sustainable business growth. This evening, I'm pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress toward achieving our long-term vision for 2016 and beyond. Significant revenues and revenue growth for multiple high-value medicines, high operating margins and a pipeline of additional transformational medicines.
Our goal in CF is to reach the vast majority of people with serious disease and to continue to enhance the benefit for the patients who we treat, and we continue to build on a track record of innovations: discover; develop; and deliver transformative medicines to more people with CF.
Let me summarize our recent commercial success and development progress in CF. In July, ORKAMBI became the first FDA-approved medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF for the approximately 8,500 people in the U.S. 12 years and older, with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. And as of September 30, 2015, we already were treating more than 3,000 of these patients.
Our sNDA has been accepted by the FDA for the expanded use of KALYDECO in people aged 2 and older with 1 of 23 residual function mutations that result in CF. This may accelerate access to KALYDECO for more than 1,500 patients in the U.S.
The European Union CHMP recently issued 3 positive opinions for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, all with the potential to significantly expand the number of eligible patients for our CF medicines. In fact, at this time last year, we were approved to treat approximately 2,600 people with CF worldwide. Whereas today, there are more than 25,000 patients approved or under regulatory submissions for our medicines.
We are currently conducting 2 Phase III clinical studies for ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 years old and plan to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the first half of 2016. There are approximately 5,500 children with CF in the U.S. and Europe with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
Following closely behind ORKAMBI, we have the VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program underway, which is expected to enroll more than 1,000 people with CF across 4 studies. We expect to complete enrollment in mid-2016.
At the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference, we announced that we are advancing 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440 into the clinic, and we expect to dose the first healthy volunteer with VX-440 this week. We believe these new correctors hold tremendous promise as part of a triple combination regimen for the 80% to 90% of CF patients with at least 1 F508del allele, thereby possibly allowing us to treat patients we are not yet treating and also to enhance the benefit for those we already treat.
The strength of the ORKAMBI launch to date and the continued expansion in the number of people eligible for KALYDECO are further evidence that we continue to execute against our key goal to become a company that can reinvest to create future medicines and deliver returns to shareholders.
As I noted at the NACF Conference, we also continue to advance early stage development programs, outside of CF, for the treatment of cancer, pain and other diseases, which represents an important diversification of our development portfolio.
Dr. David Altshuler, our Chief Scientific Officer, will discuss our research strategy and some of our emerging compounds later on this call. As you know, David was 1 of the 4 founding members of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, where he served as Deputy Director and Chief Academic Officer. David is an experienced physician and human geneticist, and we tapped him to lead our research organization earlier this year so that we can bring his experience to bear as we continue to deliver transformational medicines to more people.
Before I turn the call over to Stuart, I wanted to mention how delighted we are to have entered into a research collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease.
Gene editing represents a new and powerful technology platform that could represent a future paradigm shift in the treatment of CF as well as other genetic diseases, and we're excited to be working with CRISPR, the company at the forefront of using gene editing to create new treatments.
With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart to discuss Vertex's third quarter sales performance."
36235,313254007,884769,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review KALYDECO performance in the third quarter and our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S.Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $166 million, comprised of U.S. s",627,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review KALYDECO performance in the third quarter and our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S.
Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $166 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $95 million and ex-U.S. sales of approximately $71 million. This represents a 31% increase over the $127 million we recorded in the same quarter last year.
The growth of KALYDECO is a result of continued geographic and label expansion. We have seen strong uptake in patients with the R117H mutation following approval in the U.S. in late 2014 and in children ages 2 to 5 with eligible mutations following U.S. approval at the end of March 2015.
Internationally, there's also been a rapid uptake of KALYDECO eligible patients in Australia and in patients with non-G551D gating mutations in several European countries where these mutations are prevalent.
We've made significant progress in securing reimbursement in Europe this year. As a result, the vast majority of eligible gating patients in Europe now have access to KALYDECO.
We expect that growth in the number of patients receiving KALYDECO globally in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016 will be tempered by enrollment in the VX-661 pivotal program, as previously described.
Now turning to ORKAMBI. Since the FDA approval of ORKAMBI on July 2, we have been focused on educating health care providers on the medicine and working with payers to secure reimbursement for the approximately 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. 
Sales for the third quarter totaled $131 million. More than 3,000 patients have started treatment in the U.S., underscoring the important advance this medicine represents in the treatment of CF and the strong interest from both patients and their doctors. Our field teams around the country have visited all of the 275 CF centers in the U.S. since approval, and virtually, every center has initiated patients in ORKAMBI. As we anticipated, interest in the medicine is very high, which has put a significant administrative burden on centers as they work to initiate patients on treatment.
As expected, we're seeing broad coverage of and access to ORKAMBI, which reflects payer understanding and appreciation of the seriousness of the disease and a significant value of a medicine that treats the underlying cause of CF.
The majority of commercial and government payers with eligible patients are reimbursing for ORKAMBI. In those plans with published policies and/or defined prior authorization criteria, almost all are reimbursing to label. There are a small number of plans not yet allowing access to ORKAMBI, and we anticipate they will complete their formal ORKAMBI reviews and define their final policies in the coming months.
Our patient support team has been working diligently to help patients navigate the reimbursement process and is working to reduce the time it takes for patients to get their prescriptions filled. For any chronic medication, compliance and adherence are important facets of patient care, so they will be increasing their focus to ensure patients are able to take ORKAMBI as prescribed and so benefit from the medicine.
Outside of the U.S., we continue to expect approval in the EU in the fourth quarter of this year. Our EU commercial infrastructure is largely in place. And upon approval, we will then begin pricing and reimbursement discussions on a country-by-country basis to secure reimbursement for eligible patients who may benefit from ORKAMBI. With KALYDECO, the completion of reimbursement discussions took 9 to 20 months following approval.
In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO. And with the launch of ORKAMBI, we are significantly expanding the number of eligible CF patients we treat.
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."
36235,313254007,884769,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening, everyone. Firstly to the financials. Our CF revenues were $297 million this quarter, as we significantly increased the number of eligible people we treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. KALYDECO sales of $166 million were up 3",573,"Thanks, Stuart, and good evening, everyone. Firstly to the financials. Our CF revenues were $297 million this quarter, as we significantly increased the number of eligible people we treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. KALYDECO sales of $166 million were up 31% versus the third quarter last year and up 7% versus the second quarter of 2015.
Now ORKAMBI. The launch in the U.S. is off to a strong start. We recorded $131 million in net revenues. Inventory levels are normal with 1 to 2 weeks in the channel. Gross-to-net adjustments were in the high single digits due to a more rapid uptake for patients within commercial plans as compared to government paid plans. We continue to expect Medicaid mix to be 35% to 40% in the longer-term, which will increase gross-to-net adjustments into the midteens by late 2016. We expect continued revenue growth into 2016 as we approach peak penetration in the U.S. market in the second half of 2016.
As for Europe and other ex-U.S. countries, we expect to recognize the first ORKAMBI revenues in Europe in the first half of 2016. These revenues will be mainly generated in Germany, given that pricing and reimbursement approvals in other countries will take some time to finalize.
We do expect French regulatory authority to grant an ATU, or temporary authorization for use, for ORKAMBI in 2015, but we'll not recognize revenues from these sales until we receive formal reimbursement approval in France.
Our third quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $278 million, an increase of $66 million compared to last year. This increase is mainly attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses supporting the launch of ORKAMBI and research and development cost to support the advancement of our CF medicines. The scale of our R&D organization and SG&A infrastructure is appropriate for our business. We expect modest increases in operating expense in 2016, and these will be driven by the progression of our CF medicines in development and geographic expansion to support the international launch of ORKAMBI. But we are rapidly moving towards steady-state. While we expect to continue to invest significantly in R&D, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to ensure significant operating margins moving forward.
Our non-GAAP net loss has narrowed to $32 million compared to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $86 million, and this is primarily driven by a the increase in CF product revenues.
From a balance sheet perspective, we maintained a strong position with approximately $1 billion of cash at the end of the quarter.
Now let's turn to the 2015 financial guidance, specifically KALYDECO revenues and the combined R&D and SG&A expenses. By the time of our second quarter 2015 earnings call in July, we anticipated 2015 KALYDECO net revenues to be between $575 million and $590 million. We are now increasing KALYDECO net revenue guidance to be between $605 million and $620 million for the full year of 2015.
For the non-GAAP operating expenses, we now expect our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense for the full year to be in the middle of the range we provided in January of this year of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion.
In summary, we're in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering financial profile that includes sustainable revenue and earnings growth, while continuing to invest to create more medicines and support access to those medicines already approved.
Now over to David."

At Vertex, our strategy is to invest in science to create transformative medicines for serious diseases and specialty markets. This is an enormous challenge, because doing anything for the first time involves considerable risk. But it's also a great opportunity, because we live in a time of accelerating breakthroughs in science that can be applied to solve important problems that were previously thought to the intractable.
There are 3 main points I would like to make about Vertex's research, and I'll make comments on each of them. First, CF represents Vertex's most significant success to date, and it's where we expect our research and early development will continue to have the biggest impact in the near-term. Second, cystic fibrosis provides a good template to understand the kind of diseases we expect to pursue in the future. And third, lessons from our work in CF are guiding our early clinical programs in other areas. I'll reference 5 different candidate medicines in pain and oncology that were discovered by Vertex's scientists and that are progressing in early development.
As you know, in CF, we are advancing 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440, out of our labs and into first in-human studies. In vitro data show that in combination with VX-661 and ivacaftor, these compounds resulted in chloride transport that was approximately threefold greater than the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination in these cells. These data give us optimism. In that, hopefully, one day, we will be able to address the vast majority of CF patients with a triple combination therapy and also to continue to enhance the benefit for those we are already treating.
Our research strategy with CF is not limited to our internal programs. We're also looking externally to bring in compounds that complement our CFTR modulators, and this is enabled by our CF research expertise. Our CF research platform allows us to robustly characterize the activity of external compounds and their potential to work in combination with our existing regimens. This approach formed the basis for the collaboration we signed with Parion for ENaC inhibitors. And we showed at NACF the ability of Parion's ENaC inhibitor to enhance the effects of ORKAMBI in vitro.
We are looking far into the future of CF treatment to understand what impact new treatment modalities could have. This week, we announced a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to use the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing platform to create new medicines.
CRISPR-Cas9 is an important scientific and technical breakthrough that holds significant promise for the future discovery of potentially transformative treatments, and this collaboration will evaluate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 across multiple diseases where targets have been validated through human genetics.
We are excited to begin our initial gene editing research on discovering treatments to address the mutations and genes known to cause and contribute to CF and sickle cell disease.
Thinking about CF more conceptually, the combination of what we learned through our CF research and the increasing flow of information from human genetics forms a template for our future discovery of precision medicines.
First, our CF research program was directed at a target that was validated as an underlying cost based on human genetics. Second, by understanding the natural history of disease and using proprietary in vitro assays, we had a highly focused goal for CFTR modulation. Third, we had early markers of clinical effect that were highly predictive of late stage success. And finally, these features have led to repeated success from the lab to the clinic. There are many lessons here that we can apply, so that we can invest wisely and increase our chances of success in the future. Our investments are being evaluated based on insights from human biology, the therapeutic approach and clinical development path criteria that we learned from our work in CF and can now apply to other diseases.
In the area of pain, we have 2 compounds in early development. VX-150 and VX-241 targets sodium channels with strong rationale for the treatment of pain based on human genetics and well-documented roles in pain sensation. Specifically, the basis of our program is a key insight from human biology that gain or loss of function mutations in key sodium channels can increase or decrease pain sensation.
In cancer, we have 3 compounds in early development; VX-970, VX-803 and VX-984; that target key cellular pathways responsible for DNA repair, a fundamental mechanism underlying the development and growth of cancer. In fact, DNA repair was recognized in 2015 with the Nobel Prize in chemistry, citing 3 academic scientists for their pioneering efforts to map, at a molecular level, how cells repair damaged DNA. The Nobel committee specifically cited the implication of this work for the development of new cancer treatments.
In healthy cells, properly functioning DNA repair mechanisms protect against the development of problematic mutations. In cancer, however, these systems of DNA repair are known to go awry, allowing cancer cells to both accumulate mutations and increase their ability to survive and proliferate. The new Vertex cancer medicines, now in early development, target 2 key nodes in the DNA repair system, kinases known as ATR and DNA PK. Modulating activity of these 2 kinases is predicted to be critical to continued cancer cell survival in the face of DNA damage. In addition, we believe that these new compounds can be targeted to patients based upon the knowledge of the genomic alterations or characteristics in each patient's cancer, allowing a precision medicine approach to help increase benefit by targeting those patients more likely to respond.
With the most advanced compound, VX-970, we and the National Cancer Institute are now conducting a number of early studies in tumor types that are predicted to be responsive to an ATR inhibitor. The first Phase I clinical data for VX-970, we presented at the Triple meeting in Boston in November.
In closing, we are pleased with the significant progress we are making in developing additional CF medicines, especially for the tens of thousands of patients living with CF, who do not have a medicine that targets the underlying cause of their disease. We look forward to telling you more about our research strategy and our emerging clinical programs as they progress.
And with that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

This is just a larger volume of patients than they have to try and get initiated on KALYDECO when we launched it. And so that administrative burden of helping payers -- helping patients through the payer reimbursement process is very burdensome one for the centers, and they certainly are relaying that to us. However, as we said in our prepared remarks, through the end of September, we have seen over 3,000 patients initiating on therapies, so the centers are really working through that process.

And so to finish on that and just to reiterate what Ian said in our prepared remarks, we do expect to recognize revenues for ORKAMBI in the EU in 2016, but these revenues are going to be primarily from Germany with minimal, if any, contribution from other countries."

Obviously, it's very early and so that number moves around a lot as patients kind of move through the process. But right now, it's approximately a month. In terms of the profile, I guess, I'd say the only difference is that, obviously, TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT had FEV1 criteria, inclusion, exclusion criteria, so that the 40 to 90. And certainly, we are aware that there are patients who've been initiated with FEV1 below 40 and patients who've been initiated with FEV1's above 90 because the vast majority of payers are reimbursing to label and the label doesn't include any FEV1 restriction.

And just to comment, it's a great question because as we turn profitable, which we do anticipate in the fourth quarter, we're now cash accumulation, and over the years, we have been cash preservation while we reinvest in the business. So we are a different company as we head into the fourth quarter. As we think about the allocation of cash, I start with the receipt of cash is actually the revenue, just to be basic about this, but the receipt of cash is the revenue. As we think about reinvestment on allocation of that capital, it does go towards R&D for our business, the internal R&D. But as we develop our business, we also consider the external investment in R&D, and I think you saw that with the example this week of signing a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, that we're very excited about. You've also seen it earlier this year with us -- in licensing products that complement our approach in CF. So we're already starting to allocate that revenue capital towards internal R&D and also acquire products or expand our scientific footprint. As far as -- and you should anticipate that to continue. As far as thinking about other allocation of capital rather than just to accumulate on the balance sheet, we do think about our capital structure and the shares outstanding, and we need to continue to think about that going forward. But it becomes a prioritization and first, it is about investments in medicines for the future, which provides growth. However, if the capital becomes available, that we would consider addressing our capital structure, we'd also make that choice as well."

But with respect to Galapagos, just as Stuart [indiscernible] as Ian said, we really don't comment on any of the competitor compounds or programs. I would just reiterate what Ian said about our programs, which is we like our position really for 3 reasons. Number one, we have 2 drugs in the combination, 661 and KALYDECO, that are either approved or very well characterized. So when you put a 3-drug combination together, we feel that's a nice position to be in. And number two, we spend a lot of time optimizing the pharmaceutic properties of both next-gen correctors. And that's important as you put a 3-drug combination together. And number three, we showed you the chloride data from the HBE cells with those -- with that 3-drug combination which were getting at levels which are at or north of what KALYDECO does in G551D. And so far, those assays have predicted quite well what we see in the clinic. So we're excited to see the first Phase II results. We'll start those studies next year."

Our knowledge of those will increase obviously as plans publish those criteria or make those criteria known. Of the ones that we've seen so far, they aren't really setting a really very high clinical bar, to use your terminology. Most of them are essentially just ensuring that the patients continue to be within our label or show improvement across a number of clinical parameters in the opinion of the treating physicians. So -- but as I say, that's on a limited basis right now because it is early for plans to be publishing reauthorization criteria."

Good evening, everyone. 3 years ago, we outlined a clear strategy designed to establish a foundation for sustainable business growth. This evening, I'm pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress toward achieving our long-term vision for 2016 and beyond. Significant revenues and revenue growth for multiple high-value medicines, high operating margins and a pipeline of additional transformational medicines.
Our goal in CF is to reach the vast majority of people with serious disease and to continue to enhance the benefit for the patients who we treat, and we continue to build on a track record of innovations: discover; develop; and deliver transformative medicines to more people with CF.
Let me summarize our recent commercial success and development progress in CF. In July, ORKAMBI became the first FDA-approved medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF for the approximately 8,500 people in the U.S. 12 years and older, with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. And as of September 30, 2015, we already were treating more than 3,000 of these patients.
Our sNDA has been accepted by the FDA for the expanded use of KALYDECO in people aged 2 and older with 1 of 23 residual function mutations that result in CF. This may accelerate access to KALYDECO for more than 1,500 patients in the U.S.
The European Union CHMP recently issued 3 positive opinions for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, all with the potential to significantly expand the number of eligible patients for our CF medicines. In fact, at this time last year, we were approved to treat approximately 2,600 people with CF worldwide. Whereas today, there are more than 25,000 patients approved or under regulatory submissions for our medicines.
We are currently conducting 2 Phase III clinical studies for ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 years old and plan to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the first half of 2016. There are approximately 5,500 children with CF in the U.S. and Europe with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
Following closely behind ORKAMBI, we have the VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program underway, which is expected to enroll more than 1,000 people with CF across 4 studies. We expect to complete enrollment in mid-2016.
At the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference, we announced that we are advancing 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440 into the clinic, and we expect to dose the first healthy volunteer with VX-440 this week. We believe these new correctors hold tremendous promise as part of a triple combination regimen for the 80% to 90% of CF patients with at least 1 F508del allele, thereby possibly allowing us to treat patients we are not yet treating and also to enhance the benefit for those we already treat.
The strength of the ORKAMBI launch to date and the continued expansion in the number of people eligible for KALYDECO are further evidence that we continue to execute against our key goal to become a company that can reinvest to create future medicines and deliver returns to shareholders.
As I noted at the NACF Conference, we also continue to advance early stage development programs, outside of CF, for the treatment of cancer, pain and other diseases, which represents an important diversification of our development portfolio.
Dr. David Altshuler, our Chief Scientific Officer, will discuss our research strategy and some of our emerging compounds later on this call. As you know, David was 1 of the 4 founding members of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, where he served as Deputy Director and Chief Academic Officer. David is an experienced physician and human geneticist, and we tapped him to lead our research organization earlier this year so that we can bring his experience to bear as we continue to deliver transformational medicines to more people.
Before I turn the call over to Stuart, I wanted to mention how delighted we are to have entered into a research collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease.
Gene editing represents a new and powerful technology platform that could represent a future paradigm shift in the treatment of CF as well as other genetic diseases, and we're excited to be working with CRISPR, the company at the forefront of using gene editing to create new treatments.
With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart to discuss Vertex's third quarter sales performance."
36235,313254007,884800,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review KALYDECO performance in the third quarter and our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S.Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $166 million, comprised of U.S. s",627,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review KALYDECO performance in the third quarter and our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S.
Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $166 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $95 million and ex-U.S. sales of approximately $71 million. This represents a 31% increase over the $127 million we recorded in the same quarter last year.
The growth of KALYDECO is a result of continued geographic and label expansion. We have seen strong uptake in patients with the R117H mutation following approval in the U.S. in late 2014 and in children ages 2 to 5 with eligible mutations following U.S. approval at the end of March 2015.
Internationally, there's also been a rapid uptake of KALYDECO eligible patients in Australia and in patients with non-G551D gating mutations in several European countries where these mutations are prevalent.
We've made significant progress in securing reimbursement in Europe this year. As a result, the vast majority of eligible gating patients in Europe now have access to KALYDECO.
We expect that growth in the number of patients receiving KALYDECO globally in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016 will be tempered by enrollment in the VX-661 pivotal program, as previously described.
Now turning to ORKAMBI. Since the FDA approval of ORKAMBI on July 2, we have been focused on educating health care providers on the medicine and working with payers to secure reimbursement for the approximately 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. 
Sales for the third quarter totaled $131 million. More than 3,000 patients have started treatment in the U.S., underscoring the important advance this medicine represents in the treatment of CF and the strong interest from both patients and their doctors. Our field teams around the country have visited all of the 275 CF centers in the U.S. since approval, and virtually, every center has initiated patients in ORKAMBI. As we anticipated, interest in the medicine is very high, which has put a significant administrative burden on centers as they work to initiate patients on treatment.
As expected, we're seeing broad coverage of and access to ORKAMBI, which reflects payer understanding and appreciation of the seriousness of the disease and a significant value of a medicine that treats the underlying cause of CF.
The majority of commercial and government payers with eligible patients are reimbursing for ORKAMBI. In those plans with published policies and/or defined prior authorization criteria, almost all are reimbursing to label. There are a small number of plans not yet allowing access to ORKAMBI, and we anticipate they will complete their formal ORKAMBI reviews and define their final policies in the coming months.
Our patient support team has been working diligently to help patients navigate the reimbursement process and is working to reduce the time it takes for patients to get their prescriptions filled. For any chronic medication, compliance and adherence are important facets of patient care, so they will be increasing their focus to ensure patients are able to take ORKAMBI as prescribed and so benefit from the medicine.
Outside of the U.S., we continue to expect approval in the EU in the fourth quarter of this year. Our EU commercial infrastructure is largely in place. And upon approval, we will then begin pricing and reimbursement discussions on a country-by-country basis to secure reimbursement for eligible patients who may benefit from ORKAMBI. With KALYDECO, the completion of reimbursement discussions took 9 to 20 months following approval.
In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO. And with the launch of ORKAMBI, we are significantly expanding the number of eligible CF patients we treat.
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."
36235,313254007,884800,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening, everyone. Firstly to the financials. Our CF revenues were $297 million this quarter, as we significantly increased the number of eligible people we treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. KALYDECO sales of $166 million were up 3",572,"Thanks, Stuart, and good evening, everyone. Firstly to the financials. Our CF revenues were $297 million this quarter, as we significantly increased the number of eligible people we treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. KALYDECO sales of $166 million were up 31% versus the third quarter last year and up 7% versus the second quarter of 2015.
Now ORKAMBI. The launch in the U.S. is off to a strong start. We recorded $131 million in net revenues. Inventory levels are normal with 1 to 2 weeks in the channel. Gross-to-net adjustments were in the high single digits due to a more rapid uptake for patients within commercial plans as compared to government paid plans. We continue to expect Medicaid mix to be 35% to 40% in the longer-term, which will increase gross-to-net adjustments into the midteens by late 2016. We expect continued revenue growth into 2016 as we approach peak penetration in the U.S. market in the second half of 2016.
As for Europe and other ex-U.S. countries, we expect to recognize the first ORKAMBI revenues in Europe in the first half of 2016. These revenues will be mainly generated in Germany, given that pricing and reimbursement approvals in other countries will take some time to finalize.
We do expect French regulatory authority to grant an ATU, or temporary authorization for use, for ORKAMBI in 2015, but we'll not recognize revenues from these sales until we receive formal reimbursement approval in France.
Our third quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $278 million, an increase of $66 million compared to last year. This increase is mainly attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses supporting the launch of ORKAMBI and research and development costs to support the advancement of our CF medicines. The scale of our R&D organization and SG&A infrastructure is appropriate for our business. We expect modest increases in operating expense in 2016, and these will be driven by the progression of our CF medicines in development and geographic expansion to support the international launch of ORKAMBI. But we are rapidly moving towards steady-state. While we expect to continue to invest significantly in R&D, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to ensure significant operating margins moving forward.
Our non-GAAP net loss has narrowed to $32 million compared to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $86 million, and this is primarily driven by the increase in CF product revenues.
From a balance sheet perspective, we maintained a strong position with approximately $1 billion of cash at the end of the quarter.
Now let's turn to the 2015 financial guidance, specifically KALYDECO revenues and the combined R&D and SG&A expenses. By the time of our second quarter 2015 earnings call in July, we anticipated 2015 KALYDECO net revenues to be between $575 million and $590 million. We are now increasing KALYDECO net revenue guidance to be between $605 million and $620 million for the full year of 2015.
For the non-GAAP operating expenses, we now expect our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense for the full year to be in the middle of the range we provided in January of this year of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion.
In summary, we're in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering financial profile that includes sustainable revenue and earnings growth, while continuing to invest to create more medicines and support access to those medicines already approved.
Now over to David."

At Vertex, our strategy is to invest in science to create transformative medicines for serious diseases and specialty markets. This is an enormous challenge, because doing anything for the first time involves considerable risk. But it's also a great opportunity, because we live in a time of accelerating breakthroughs in science that can be applied to solve important problems that were previously thought to the intractable.
There are 3 main points I would like to make about Vertex's research, and I'll make comments on each of them. First, CF represents Vertex's most significant success to date, and is where we expect our research and early development will continue to have the biggest impact in the near-term. Second, cystic fibrosis provides a good template to understand the kind of diseases we expect to pursue in the future. And third, lessons from our work in CF are guiding our early clinical programs in other areas. I'll reference 5 different candidate medicines in pain and oncology that were discovered by Vertex's scientists and that are progressing in early development.
As you know, in CF, we are advancing 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440, out of our labs and into first in-human studies. In vitro data show that in combination with VX-661 and ivacaftor, these compounds resulted in chloride transport that was approximately threefold greater than the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination in these cells. These data give us optimism. In that, hopefully, one day, we will be able to address the vast majority of CF patients with a triple combination therapy and also to continue to enhance the benefit for those we are already treating.
Our research strategy with CF is not limited to our internal programs. We're also looking externally to bring in compounds that complement our CFTR modulators, and this is enabled by our CF research expertise. Our CF research platform allows us to robustly characterize the activity of external compounds and their potential to work in combination with our existing regimens. This approach formed the basis for the collaboration we signed with Parion for ENaC inhibitors. And we showed at NACF the ability of Parion's ENaC inhibitor to enhance the effects of ORKAMBI in vitro.
We are looking far into the future of CF treatment to understand what impact new treatment modalities could have. This week, we announced a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to use the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing platform to create new medicines.
CRISPR-Cas9 is an important scientific and technical breakthrough that holds significant promise for the future discovery of potentially transformative treatments, and this collaboration will evaluate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 across multiple diseases where targets have been validated through human genetics.
We are excited to begin our initial gene editing research on discovering treatments to address the mutations and genes known to cause and contribute to CF and sickle cell disease.
Thinking about CF more conceptually, the combination of what we learned through our CF research and the increasing flow of information from human genetics forms a template for our future discovery of precision medicines.
First, our CF research program was directed at a target that was validated as an underlying cost based on human genetics. Second, by understanding the natural history of disease and using proprietary in vitro assays, we had a highly focused goal for CFTR modulation. Third, we had early markers of clinical effect that were highly predictive of late stage success. And finally, these features have led to repeated success from the lab to the clinic. There are many lessons here that we can apply, so that we can invest wisely and increase our chances of success in the future. Our investments are being evaluated based on insights from human biology, the therapeutic approach and clinical development path criteria that we learned from our work in CF and can now apply to other diseases.
In the area of pain, we have 2 compounds in early development. VX-150 and VX-241 targets sodium channels with strong rationale for the treatment of pain based on human genetics and well-documented roles in pain sensation. Specifically, the basis of our program is a key insight from human biology that gain or loss of function mutations in key sodium channels can increase or decrease pain sensation.
In cancer, we have 3 compounds in early development; VX-970, VX-803 and VX-984; that target key cellular pathways responsible for DNA repair, a fundamental mechanism underlying the development and growth of cancer. In fact, DNA repair was recognized in 2015 with the Nobel Prize in chemistry, citing 3 academic scientists for their pioneering efforts to map, at a molecular level, how cells repair damaged DNA. The Nobel committee specifically cited the implication of this work for the development of new cancer treatments.
In healthy cells, properly functioning DNA repair mechanisms protect against the development of problematic mutations. In cancer, however, these systems of DNA repair are known to go awry, allowing cancer cells to both accumulate mutations and increase their ability to survive and proliferate. The new Vertex cancer medicines, now in early development, target 2 key nodes in the DNA repair system, kinases known as ATR and DNA PK. Modulating activity of these 2 kinases is predicted to be critical to continue cancer cell survival in the face of DNA damage. In addition, we believe that these new compounds can be targeted to patients based upon the knowledge of the genomic alterations or characteristics in each patient's cancer, allowing a precision medicine approach to help increase benefit by targeting those patients more likely to respond.
With the most advanced compound, VX-970, we and the National Cancer Institute are now conducting a number of early studies in tumor types that are predicted to be responsive to an ATR inhibitor. The first Phase I clinical data for VX-970, we presented at the Triple meeting in Boston in November.
In closing, we are pleased with the significant progress we are making in developing additional CF medicines, especially for the tens of thousands of patients living with CF, who do not have a medicine that targets the underlying cause of their disease. We look forward to telling you more about our research strategy and our emerging clinical programs as they progress.
And with that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

In terms of our comments about the burden on CF centers, this is really just reflecting what we heard from centers actually prior to the launch, and we are seeing it play out during the launch. This is just a larger volume of patients than they have to try and get initiated on KALYDECO when we launched it. And so that administrative burden of helping payers -- helping patients through the payer reimbursement process is a very burdensome one for the centers, and they certainly are relaying that to us. However, as we said in our prepared remarks, through the end of September, we have seen over 3,000 patients initiating on therapies, so the centers are really working through that process.

We're certainly taking the same sort of things into account, the seriousness of the disease, the clinical value we've demonstrated through treating the underlying cause of the disease, the investments we've made and continue to want to make in R&D to discover and develop future transformative medicines for CF patients and in other diseases, but we're also going to have to be sensitive to the economic environment in Europe, including the potential budget impact that ORKAMBI could have in what in almost all cases, are single-payer markets. And so to finish on that and just to reiterate what Ian said in our prepared remarks, we do expect to recognize revenues for ORKAMBI in the EU in 2016, but these revenues are going to be primarily from Germany with minimal, if any, contribution from other countries."

The amount that was actually in the channel relating to 1 to 2 weeks at this stage of the launch was approximately $17 million, so that's $15 million to $20 million that was mentioned before. I think the key to take away is this is a normal level of inventory as we move quarter-to-quarter through the year end. And then on the actual number of eligible patients who are on it, it's actually more like 35% rather than the 50%, Matt, 3,000 patients out of the approximately 8,500 eligible patients here in the U.S. And so as we said, we wouldn't expect it to continue in a linear way.

And just to comment, it's a great question because as we turn profitable, which we do anticipate in the fourth quarter, we're now cash accumulation, and over the years, we have been cash preservation while we reinvest in the business. So we are a different company as we head into the fourth quarter. As we think about the allocation of cash, I start with the receipt of cash is actually the revenue, just to be basic about this, but the receipt of cash is the revenue. As we think about reinvestment on allocation of that capital, it does go towards R&D for our business, the internal R&D. But as we develop our business, we also consider the external investment in R&D, and I think you saw that with the example this week of signing a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, that we're very excited about. You've also seen it earlier this year with us -- in licensing products that complement our approach in CF. So we're already starting to allocate that revenue capital towards internal R&D and also acquire products or expand our scientific footprint. As far as -- and you should anticipate that to continue. As far as thinking about other allocation of capital rather than just to accumulate on the balance sheet, we do think about our capital structure and the shares outstanding, and we need to continue to think about that going forward. But it becomes a prioritization and first, it is about investments in medicines for the future, which provides growth. However, if the capital becomes available, that we would consider addressing our capital structure, we'd also make that choice as well."

I won't really know until our team over in Europe begins those reimbursement discussions with the relevant authorities. That's why I said it's really, really difficult to predict. They all have different processes and a number of them, those processes are changing. They're not even the same process that we went through with KALYDECO. So I really can't predict with any sense of confidence or accuracy whether we're going to go faster or slower with ORKAMBI. We won't really know until we begin that process after we receive regulatory approval, which we continue to anticipate will happen later this quarter."

And they'll obviously need to continue to do that because whilst there are over 3,000 patients initiated, there's still a lot more patients that physicians are going to want to initiate on ORKAMBI. But for those who are now started on therapy, then we have a number of programs. And essentially, it's really helping educate patients on the mode of action of ORKAMBI, how it treats the underlying cause of their disease and providing them to the extent they want to receive educational materials and refill reminders and things of that nature. And so we kind of tailor that to the individual patients as they desire."

Good evening, everyone. 3 years ago, we outlined a clear strategy designed to establish a foundation for sustainable business growth. This evening, I'm pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress toward achieving our long-term vision for 2016 and beyond. Significant revenues and revenue growth for multiple high-value medicines, high operating margins and a pipeline of additional transformational medicines.
Our goal in CF is to reach the vast majority of people with serious disease and to continue to enhance the benefit for the patients who we treat, and we continue to build on a track record of innovations: discover; develop; and deliver transformative medicines to more people with CF.
Let me summarize our recent commercial success and development progress in CF. In July, ORKAMBI became the first FDA-approved medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF for the approximately 8,500 people in the U.S. 12 years and older, with 2 copies of the F508del mutation. And as of September 30, 2015, we already were treating more than 3,000 of these patients.
Our sNDA has been accepted by the FDA for the expanded use of KALYDECO in people aged 2 and older with 1 of 23 residual function mutations that result in CF. This may accelerate access to KALYDECO for more than 1,500 patients in the U.S.
The European Union CHMP recently issued 3 positive opinions for KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, all with the potential to significantly expand the number of eligible patients for our CF medicines. In fact, at this time last year, we were approved to treat approximately 2,600 people with CF worldwide. Whereas today, there are more than 25,000 patients approved or under regulatory submissions for our medicines.
We are currently conducting 2 Phase III clinical studies for ORKAMBI in children ages 6 to 11 years old and plan to submit an sNDA to the FDA in the first half of 2016. There are approximately 5,500 children with CF in the U.S. and Europe with 2 copies of the F508del mutation.
Following closely behind ORKAMBI, we have the VX-661 plus ivacaftor pivotal Phase III development program underway, which is expected to enroll more than 1,000 people with CF across 4 studies. We expect to complete enrollment in mid-2016.
At the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference, we announced that we are advancing 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440 into the clinic, and we expect to dose the first healthy volunteer with VX-440 this week. We believe these new correctors hold tremendous promise as part of a triple combination regimen for the 80% to 90% of CF patients with at least 1 F508del allele, thereby possibly allowing us to treat patients we are not yet treating and also to enhance the benefit for those we already treat.
The strength of the ORKAMBI launch to date and the continued expansion in the number of people eligible for KALYDECO are further evidence that we continue to execute against our key goal to become a company that can reinvest to create future medicines and deliver returns to shareholders.
As I noted at the NACF Conference, we also continue to advance early stage development programs, outside of CF, for the treatment of cancer, pain and other diseases, which represents an important diversification of our development portfolio.
Dr. David Altshuler, our Chief Scientific Officer, will discuss our research strategy and some of our emerging compounds later on this call. As you know, David was 1 of the 4 founding members of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, where he served as Deputy Director and Chief Academic Officer. David is an experienced physician and human geneticist, and we tapped him to lead our research organization earlier this year so that we can bring his experience to bear as we continue to deliver transformational medicines to more people.
Before I turn the call over to Stuart, I wanted to mention how delighted we are to have entered into a research collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease.
Gene editing represents a new and powerful technology platform that could represent a future paradigm shift in the treatment of CF as well as other genetic diseases, and we're excited to be working with CRISPR, the company at the forefront of using gene editing to create new treatments.
With that, I'll hand it over to Stuart to discuss Vertex's third quarter sales performance."
36235,313254007,885598,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review KALYDECO performance in the third quarter and our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S.Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $166 million, comprised of U.S. s",627,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Tonight, I will review KALYDECO performance in the third quarter and our progress in making ORKAMBI available to eligible patients in the U.S.
Global sales of KALYDECO this quarter were $166 million, comprised of U.S. sales of approximately $95 million and ex-U.S. sales of approximately $71 million. This represents a 31% increase over the $127 million we recorded in the same quarter last year.
The growth of KALYDECO is a result of continued geographic and label expansion. We have seen strong uptake in patients with the R117H mutation following approval in the U.S. in late 2014 and in children ages 2 to 5 with eligible mutations following U.S. approval at the end of March 2015.
Internationally, there's also been a rapid uptake of KALYDECO eligible patients in Australia and in patients with non-G551D gating mutations in several European countries where these mutations are prevalent.
We've made significant progress in securing reimbursement in Europe this year. As a result, the vast majority of eligible gating patients in Europe now have access to KALYDECO.
We expect that growth in the number of patients receiving KALYDECO globally in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016 will be tempered by enrollment in the VX-661 pivotal program, as previously described.
Now turning to ORKAMBI. Since the FDA approval of ORKAMBI on July 2, we have been focused on educating health care providers on the medicine and working with payers to secure reimbursement for the approximately 8,500 eligible patients in the U.S. 
Sales for the third quarter totaled $131 million. More than 3,000 patients have started treatment in the U.S., underscoring the important advance this medicine represents in the treatment of CF and the strong interest from both patients and their doctors. Our field teams around the country have visited all of the 275 CF centers in the U.S. since approval, and virtually, every center has initiated patients in ORKAMBI. As we anticipated, interest in the medicine is very high, which has put a significant administrative burden on centers as they work to initiate patients on treatment.
As expected, we're seeing broad coverage of and access to ORKAMBI, which reflects payer understanding and appreciation of the seriousness of the disease and a significant value of a medicine that treats the underlying cause of CF.
The majority of commercial and government payers with eligible patients are reimbursing for ORKAMBI. In those plans with published policies and/or defined prior authorization criteria, almost all are reimbursing to label. There are a small number of plans not yet allowing access to ORKAMBI, and we anticipate they will complete their formal ORKAMBI reviews and define their final policies in the coming months.
Our patient support team has been working diligently to help patients navigate the reimbursement process and is working to reduce the time it takes for patients to get their prescriptions filled. For any chronic medication, compliance and adherence are important facets of patient care, so they will be increasing their focus to ensure patients are able to take ORKAMBI as prescribed and so benefit from the medicine.
Outside of the U.S., we continue to expect approval in the EU in the fourth quarter of this year. Our EU commercial infrastructure is largely in place. And upon approval, we will then begin pricing and reimbursement discussions on a country-by-country basis to secure reimbursement for eligible patients who may benefit from ORKAMBI. With KALYDECO, the completion of reimbursement discussions took 9 to 20 months following approval.
In summary, geographic and label expansion continue to drive significant growth in the number of patients we treat with KALYDECO. And with the launch of ORKAMBI, we are significantly expanding the number of eligible CF patients we treat.
I'll now hand the call over to Ian."
36235,313254007,885598,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good evening, everyone. Firstly to the financials. Our CF revenues were $297 million this quarter, as we significantly increased the number of eligible people we treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. KALYDECO sales of $166 million were up 3",572,"Thanks, Stuart, and good evening, everyone. Firstly to the financials. Our CF revenues were $297 million this quarter, as we significantly increased the number of eligible people we treat with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. KALYDECO sales of $166 million were up 31% versus the third quarter last year and up 7% versus the second quarter of 2015.
Now ORKAMBI. The launch in the U.S. is off to a strong start. We recorded $131 million in net revenues. Inventory levels are normal with 1 to 2 weeks in the channel. Gross-to-net adjustments were in the high single digits due to a more rapid uptake for patients within commercial plans as compared to government paid plans. We continue to expect Medicaid mix to be 35% to 40% in the longer-term, which will increase gross-to-net adjustments into the mid-teens by late 2016. We expect continued revenue growth into 2016 as we approach peak penetration in the U.S. market in the second half of 2016.
As for Europe and other ex-U.S. countries, we expect to recognize the first ORKAMBI revenues in Europe in the first half of 2016. These revenues will be mainly generated in Germany, given that pricing and reimbursement approvals in other countries will take some time to finalize.
We do expect French regulatory authority to grant an ATU, or temporary authorization for use, for ORKAMBI in 2015, but we'll not recognize revenues from these sales until we receive formal reimbursement approval in France.
Our third quarter non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $278 million, an increase of $66 million compared to last year. This increase is mainly attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses supporting the launch of ORKAMBI and research and development costs to support the advancement of our CF medicines. The scale of our R&D organization and SG&A infrastructure is appropriate for our business. We expect modest increases in operating expense in 2016, and these will be driven by the progression of our CF medicines in development and geographic expansion to support the international launch of ORKAMBI. But we are rapidly moving towards steady-state. While we expect to continue to invest significantly in R&D, we are committed to managing our operating expenses to ensure significant operating margins moving forward.
Our non-GAAP net loss has narrowed to $32 million compared to prior year non-GAAP net loss of $86 million, and this is primarily driven by the increase in CF product revenues.
From a balance sheet perspective, we maintained a strong position with approximately $1 billion of cash at the end of the quarter.
Now let's turn to the 2015 financial guidance, specifically KALYDECO revenues and the combined R&D and SG&A expenses. By the time of our second quarter 2015 earnings call in July, we anticipated 2015 KALYDECO net revenues to be between $575 million and $590 million. We are now increasing KALYDECO net revenue guidance to be between $605 million and $620 million for the full year of 2015.
For the non-GAAP operating expenses, we now expect our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense for the full year to be in the middle of the range we provided in January of this year of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion.
In summary, we're in a strong financial position today and focused on delivering financial profile that includes sustainable revenue and earnings growth, while continuing to invest to create more medicines and support access to those medicines already approved.
Now over to David."

At Vertex, our strategy is to invest in science to create transformative medicines for serious diseases and specialty markets. This is an enormous challenge, because doing anything for the first time involves considerable risk. But it's also a great opportunity, because we live in a time of accelerating breakthroughs in science that can be applied to solve important problems that were previously thought to the intractable.
There are 3 main points I would like to make about Vertex's research, and I'll make comments on each of them. First, CF represents Vertex's most significant success to date, and is where we expect our research and early development will continue to have the biggest impact in the near-term. Second, cystic fibrosis provides a good template to understand the kind of diseases we expect to pursue in the future. And third, lessons from our work in CF are guiding our early clinical programs in other areas. I'll reference 5 different candidate medicines in pain and oncology that were discovered by Vertex's scientists and that are progressing in early development.
As you know, in CF, we are advancing 2 next-generation correctors, VX-152 and VX-440, out of our labs and into first in-human studies. In vitro data show that in combination with VX-661 and ivacaftor, these compounds resulted in chloride transport that was approximately threefold greater than the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination in these cells. These data give us optimism. In that, hopefully, one day, we will be able to address the vast majority of CF patients with a triple combination therapy and also to continue to enhance the benefit for those we are already treating.
Our research strategy with CF is not limited to our internal programs. We're also looking externally to bring in compounds that complement our CFTR modulators, and this is enabled by our CF research expertise. Our CF research platform allows us to robustly characterize the activity of external compounds and their potential to work in combination with our existing regimens. This approach formed the basis for the collaboration we signed with Parion for ENaC inhibitors. And we showed at NACF the ability of Parion's ENaC inhibitor to enhance the effects of ORKAMBI in vitro.
We are looking far into the future of CF treatment to understand what impact new treatment modalities could have. This week, we announced a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics to use the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing platform to create new medicines.
CRISPR-Cas9 is an important scientific and technical breakthrough that holds significant promise for the future discovery of potentially transformative treatments, and this collaboration will evaluate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 across multiple diseases where targets have been validated through human genetics.
We are excited to begin our initial gene editing research on discovering treatments to address the mutations and genes known to cause and contribute to CF and sickle cell disease.
Thinking about CF more conceptually, the combination of what we learned through our CF research and the increasing flow of information from human genetics forms a template for our future discovery of precision medicines.
First, our CF research program was directed at a target that was validated as an underlying cost based on human genetics. Second, by understanding the natural history of disease and using proprietary in vitro assays, we had a highly focused goal for CFTR modulation. Third, we had early markers of clinical effect that were highly predictive of late stage success. And finally, these features have led to repeated success from the lab to the clinic. There are many lessons here that we can apply, so that we can invest wisely and increase our chances of success in the future. Our investments are being evaluated based on insights from human biology, the therapeutic approach and clinical development path criteria that we learned from our work in CF and can now apply to other diseases.
In the area of pain, we have 2 compounds in early development. VX-150 and VX-241 targets sodium channels with strong rationale for the treatment of pain based on human genetics and well-documented roles in pain sensation. Specifically, the basis of our program is a key insight from human biology that gain or loss of function mutations in key sodium channels can increase or decrease pain sensation.
In cancer, we have 3 compounds in early development; VX-970, VX-803 and VX-984; that target key cellular pathways responsible for DNA repair, a fundamental mechanism underlying the development and growth of cancer. In fact, DNA repair was recognized in 2015 with the Nobel Prize in chemistry, citing 3 academic scientists for their pioneering efforts to map, at a molecular level, how cells repair damaged DNA. The Nobel committee specifically cited the implication of this work for the development of new cancer treatments.
In healthy cells, properly functioning DNA repair mechanisms protect against the development of problematic mutations. In cancer, however, these systems of DNA repair are known to go awry, allowing cancer cells to both accumulate mutations and increase their ability to survive and proliferate. The new Vertex cancer medicines, now in early development, target 2 key nodes in the DNA repair system, kinases known as ATR and DNA PK. Modulating activity of these 2 kinases is predicted to be critical to continue cancer cell survival in the face of DNA damage. In addition, we believe that these new compounds can be targeted to patients based upon the knowledge of the genomic alterations or characteristics in each patient's cancer, allowing a precision medicine approach to help increase benefit by targeting those patients more likely to respond.
With the most advanced compound, VX-970, we and the National Cancer Institute are now conducting a number of early studies in tumor types that are predicted to be responsive to an ATR inhibitor. The first Phase I clinical data for VX-970, we presented at the Triple meeting in Boston in November.
In closing, we are pleased with the significant progress we are making in developing additional CF medicines, especially for the tens of thousands of patients living with CF, who do not have a medicine that targets the underlying cause of their disease. We look forward to telling you more about our research strategy and our emerging clinical programs as they progress.
And with that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

In terms of our comments about the burden on CF centers, this is really just reflecting what we heard from centers actually prior to the launch, and we are seeing it play out during the launch. This is just a larger volume of patients than they have to try and get initiated on KALYDECO when we launched it. And so that administrative burden of helping payers -- helping patients through the payer reimbursement process is a very burdensome one for the centers, and they certainly are relaying that to us. However, as we said in our prepared remarks, through the end of September, we have seen over 3,000 patients initiating on therapies, so the centers are really working through that process. And I don't think we really are seeing it as a seasonal impact. It really is just a function of working through a new launch with payers. In terms of the EU..."

We're certainly taking the same sort of things into account, the seriousness of the disease, the clinical value we've demonstrated through treating the underlying cause of the disease, the investments we've made and continue to want to make in R&D to discover and develop future transformative medicines for CF patients and in other diseases, but we're also going to have to be sensitive to the economic environment in Europe, including the potential budget impact that ORKAMBI could have in what in almost all cases, are single-payer markets.

And just to comment, it's a great question because as we turn profitable, which we do anticipate in the fourth quarter, we're now cash accumulation, and over the years, we have been cash preservation while we reinvest in the business. So we are a different company as we head into the fourth quarter. As we think about the allocation of cash, I start with the receipt of cash is actually the revenue, just to be basic about this, but the receipt of cash is the revenue. As we think about reinvestment on allocation of that capital, it does go towards R&D for our business, the internal R&D. But as we develop our business, we also consider the external investment in R&D, and I think you saw that with the example this week of signing a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, that we're very excited about. You've also seen it earlier this year with us -- in licensing products that complement our approach in CF. So we're already starting to allocate that revenue capital towards internal R&D and also acquire products or expand our scientific footprint. As far as -- and you should anticipate that to continue. As far as thinking about other allocation of capital rather than just to accumulate on the balance sheet, we do think about our capital structure and the shares outstanding, and we need to continue to think about that going forward. But it becomes a prioritization and first, it is about investments in medicines for the future, which provides growth. However, if the capital becomes available, that we would consider addressing our capital structure, we'd also make that choice as well."

And so over the next few years, you can expect to see us bring multiple compounds and, frankly, multiple modalities into the clinic to try to create the best combinations."

So that's about 80% to 90% of all patients. ENaC inhibitors, again, theoretically and we're going to have to demonstrate this in the clinic, should be useful for anybody with any mutation. And in fact, as you know Parion is running an initial Phase II trial. It's an all-comer trial. We're going to run a Phase II trial with ENaC plus ORKAMBI. And based on the data there, we'll be able to determine how to sort of craft these regimens for each patient subset.
