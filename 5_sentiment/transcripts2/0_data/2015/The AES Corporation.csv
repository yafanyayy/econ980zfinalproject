Then Tom will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance and longer-term expectations in detail.
Turning to Slide 4. During 2014 made significant progress on our strategy and continue to position our company for the future. During this year, we broadened financial partners to invest $1.9 billion in our subsidiaries, announced or closed 10 transactions for $1.8 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales, broke new ground on 6 new platform expansion projects, totaling 2,200 megawatts and 1 long-term contracts to build 1,400 megawatts of capacity in California.
We allocated $600 million to reduce parent debt and improve our credit profile, returned $450 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and announced a doubling of our dividend with an intended growth rate of 10%.
Turning to Slide 5. Unfortunately, our financial results for the year were affected by $0.10 of adverse hydrology in Panama and Brazil. Still, we earned an adjusted EPS of $1.30, which was at the lower end of our original guidance range of $1.30 to $1.40 and slightly better than our expectations at the end of our third quarter call in November. We are disappointed with our proportional free cash flow of $891 million, although proportional free cash flow came in at the low-end of our revised guidance, it is 20% lower than our original guidance primarily driven by the higher working capital requirements in Brazil and Chile, as well as increased receivables in Bulgaria. All of which we expect to reverse in 2015.
Now turning to Slide 6, I would like to outline several factors affecting our 2015 outlook. Importantly, we have taken a number of steps to mitigate their impacts. Since our last call, we've seen international macroeconomic factors move against us. Currency and commodity forward have declined significantly. Although, we are largely contracted and the majority of our earnings are U.S. dollar linked, this downward shift in forward curves has affected some of our businesses and consequently, our earnings expectations for 2015 and beyond. We are also seeing continuing poor hydro conditions in Brazil, especially in the state of São Paulo where our hyrdros are located, rather than a return to normal hydrology as we had previously assumed. 
We've been taking actions to lower our sensitivity to hydrology by adopting more optimal hedging strategies in Panama and Brazil. In Panama, we are bringing in a 72 megawatts oil fired barge. In Brazil, we are working on creative solutions to supply additional energy, such as pursuing opportunities to restart long-term operations at our 640 megawatts Ljubljana TCCG plant, which is not operating continually for many years due to lack of fuel. We're also exploring options to export energy from Chile and Argentina to the Brazilian grid. In parallel, we are proactively hedging our FX exposure to Brazil, Columbia and Europe, where since our last call, we have entered into additional hedges to shield 40% of our exposed earnings from further volatility.
In our 2015 guidance, we're also assuming that ongoing negotiations in Bulgaria will have some earnings impact on our Maritza business. The energy Minister of Bulgaria recently issued a communiqué in which she committed to paying Maritza's outstanding receivables of approximately $260 million and announced ongoing discussions to reduce the contract price. Additionally, the government is taking steps to improve the financial position of our off taker NEK, by reducing the volume of expenses energy that NEK is purchasing from other market  participants and compensating NEK through environmental taxes. The Bulgarian government has targeted closing this negotiation and addressing NEK's financial situation in the first half of this year. All the negotiations have not been finalized, we're incorporating modest earnings dilution in our future expectations, which we believe is sufficient to accommodate the outcome of the discussions currently underway.
The combined earnings impact of the macroeconomic factors and hydrology in Brazil, as well as the potential outcome of the PPA negotiations at Maritza, is approximately $0.18. Through proactive steps, including additional hedges, revenue improvement and cost savings, we expect to offset $0.13 of the total and therefore, are reducing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a revised range of $1.25 to $1.35.
Not withstanding the impact on our earnings from these factors, we are also reaffirming our 2015 proportional free cash flow range of $1 billion to $1,035,000,000 [ph], which is 30% higher than our 2014 results. This growth is largely driven by the recovery of working capital in Brazil and Chile, as well as a reduction in accounts receivable in Bulgaria and a contributions from new plants coming online this year, such as the 1,240 megawatt long jump project in Vietnam and the 72 megawatt oil fired barge in Panama.
Turning to Slide 7. I will discuss our continued progress on our strategic objectives, which we laid out in 2011, including reducing complexity, performance excellence, expanding access to capital and leveraging our platforms. First, reducing complexity. Since 2011, we have reduced the number of countries where we operate from 28 down to 18, and raised $3 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales. In 2014 alone, we closed 10 transactions totaling $1.8 billion in equity proceeds to AES. In addition to simplifying our portfolio, we recently exited riskier markets such as Ukraine, Nigeria and Cameroon in a timely manner and at attractive valuations.
As a result of our efforts, 80% of our 2014 earnings and proportional free cash flow was generated in 10 countries in the Americas. Regarding performance excellence, we believe that we are now the low-cost manager of a large portfolio of international energy assets. As you can see on Slide 8, we have reduced our global G&A by about 1/3 or $200 million, achieving the goal we established in 2011, 1 year early. Going forward, we are focusing on additional cost savings initiatives, including savings $100 million in O&M by 2018.
Turning to Slide 9. Through financial partnerships, we are expanding our access to capital and fine tuning our portfolio's global macroeconomic exposures and commodity risks. In most cases, we earned management, development, to promote our upfront fees. Partial sell downs of our assets also deserve the highlight the value of the business in our portfolio. In total, we have raised $2.5 billion in proceeds to AES through financial partnerships. In 2014, we brought in partners at 4 of our businesses, including CDPQ, a long-term institutional investor headquartered in Québec, Canada, which recently invested in I Palko in Indiana. We look forward to working with CDPQ and additional partnering opportunities in the U.S. and Latin America.
Turning to leveraging our platforms in Slide 10. We are exclusively focusing our growth of classroom expansions, including adjacencies such as energy storage and desalinization. Adjacencies are smaller investment opportunities that are replicable across our portfolio and have returns with a much shorter construction period. To that end, we recently made a $25 million investment to acquire Main Street Power, a developer of distributed solar. Although modest in size, this business will provide us with a know-how to implement distributed solar generation in some of our international markets, where power prices are higher and solar resources greater. We will focus on commercial and industrial customers.
We currently have a total of 1,141 megawatts under construction. The most in AES' 34-year history. These projects represent $90 billion in total capital expenditures. The vast majority of which is being funded by a combination of nonrecourse debt and partner equity. More importantly, our required equity for these projects is $1.5 billion, of which we've already funded 70%. In terms of where these projects are located, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, 40% of the capacity under construction is in the U.S. The 1,400 [ph] megawatts of Scotland contracts we recently won are not yet included in these numbers because we have not yet broken ground. If they were, the U.S. would represent 50% of the new capacity. We're earning very attractive risk-adjusted returns on these projects. For competitive reasons, we cannot provide detail on a project by project basis. However, we will provide some general guidelines. 
For international projects, we're seeing IRRs from the midteens to more than 20% with project specific returns bearing reflecting project and country risk premiums. For U.S. projects, IRR's are low double digits, including all of our projects under construction, the average IRR is around 14% and the ROE is greater than 50%. We would expect to earn at least as much from new projects in our development pipeline.
Now turning to Slide 11. I would emphasize that as we have done in the past, we will complete all new projects and share buybacks, and furthermore, we will only invest in the new project if it meets the following criteria: First, it enhances the value of an existing business, such as the ATS CapEx program at IPL in Indiana or the oil fired barge in Panama. Second, it offers compelling risk-adjusted returns while minimizing AES Corp. equity by using project level cash or local leverage capacity. Examples include closing the cycle at our DPP plant in the Dominican Republic and energy storage; and finally, for any large project, we would expect to bring in a partner to maximize our returns and allow us to fine-tune our total exposure in the project.
The bottom line is that our successful execution on the 4 pillars of our strategy that I just discussed have positioned us to deliver average annual cash flow growth of 10% to 15% over the next 4 years, as our construction projects come online. We expect to grow our dividend 10% per year from today's level as cash flow increases. Given all that, we believe that our current share price does not reflect the progress we have made in our company and portfolio, although value from our largely funded construction program. Therefore, we have taken advantage of low share prices by buying back $150 million of our shares since our third quarter call. And today, we have announced that our board has authorized an additional $400 million for share repurchases, the majority of which we expect to utilize in 2015.
Finally, as you can see on Slide 12, our overall capital allocation over the last 3 years has been very shareholder-focused. In fact, we have allocated 78% of our discretionary cash to Parent debt prepayments and returning cash to shareholders. Specifically, we've allocated $1.6 billion to decrease our Parent debt by 20% and improve our financial flexibility. We have also reduced our share count by 10%, buying back 78 million shares at an average price of $12.69 and with the recent doubling of our dividend, we're now paying $0.10 per share per quarter and we expect to grow the dividend 10% annually.
We recognize that 2015 will be a challenging year due to negative macroeconomic factors in international markets and poor hydrology in Brazil. Nonetheless, we will continue to execute on our strategy to create shareholder value by pulling the levers we have outlined today.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom, who will provide greater detail on our 2014 results and 2015 forecast."
35312,282842060,770907,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results, including adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU and our cash flow. Then I'll discuss our 2014 and '15 cap",2023,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results, including adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU and our cash flow. Then I'll discuss our 2014 and '15 capital allocation plans, 2015 guidance and our longer-term expectations.
As Andres has just discussed, we achieved a number of our objectives in 2014, despite the impacts from adverse hydrology and other factors. From an EPS perspective, we were able to offset these issues to operational improvements, accelerate cost savings and our capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases and debt prepayments. Admittedly, our 2014 proportional free cash flow is disappointing due to higher working capital requirements and increased receivables.
Turning to Slide 14, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.41 compared to $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Overall, our businesses contributed $0.08, driven by higher earnings from our U.S., Brazil and SBUs. We also benefited from a 3% reduction in share count, lower Parent interest expense and improved corporate charges, which contributed $0.07. These benefits were offset by a $0.03 impact from tax. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25%, which was higher than the 18% rate we had last year. Detailed drivers of our fourth quarter PPC, performance by SBU are in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 15, in our full year EPS of $1.30 per share compared to 2013, we benefited from $0.07 of better operating performance at our U.S. SBU and our utilities in Brazil, plus a smaller impact from Hydro. $0.03 from several other items, including recognition of higher interest income on receivables in Argentina in 2013, and $0.11 from capital allocation and lower corporate charges. These benefits were offset by $0.06 from outages in the first 9 months and a $0.14 impact from a higher adjusted effective tax rate of 30% versus 21% in '13. We ended up $1.30, which was at the low-end of our original guidance range.
Turning to Slide 16, our results by SBU were in line with the adjusted DTC modeling ranges we provided in November. The main driver that helped us come in at the high-end of our revised EPS range was a 30% tax rate, which was slightly below what we were expecting and equates to a couple of cents of earnings.
Now to Slide 17. For hydrology in Latin America continue to be a headwind in 2014 with a $0.10 impact to our adjusted EPS versus normal conditions. Although, this was a meaningful impact, it was about 25% lower than what we experienced in 2013 due to favorable Hydro conditions in Columbia and our proactive steps in Panama.
Now going to hydrology by market, beginning with Columbia. In 2014, Chivor had favorable inflow conditions relative to the rest of the country, which allowed us to sell excess power into the spot market at attractive prices adding $0.03. Currently, inflows at Chivor are 92% of average and we're expecting a normal year in 2015. In Panama, we had a $0.06 shortfall in '14, most of which was during the first 9 months as inflows improved in the fourth quarter. Inflows are now close to 100% of long-term average and power prices are about $100 per megawatt hour down from well over $200 per megawatt hour from March [ph] of last year. 
Our downside exposure continues to decrease for 2 main reasons. First, government compensation agreement we negotiated last year to offset this exposure; and secondly, lower oil prices helped reduce our earnings volatility, as spot prices during dry conditions are set by oil fire generation. In 2014, we were purchasing the spot market. If oil prices were at today's level, last year, the Hydro impact would've been about $0.03 rather than $0.06 we actually experienced. I'll also note and as Andres mentioned, we brought an oil fire barge to Panama, improving our bottom line.
Finally in Brazil, we had a $0.07 impact from poor hydrology in 2014. Experienced a 10% reduction in generation or GFF. The impact was magnified by the fact that the average spot price was just under BRL 700 per megawatt hour in 2014, significantly greater than the BRL 200 level of our offtake contract.
Currently reservoir levels are about 23%, while we've seen some recent improvement, it's difficult to predict how much they'll recover by the end of the rainy season in April. For now, we're factoring in about a $0.05 impact into our 2015 guidance due to an estimated 15% to 17% reduction in generation for the year. The impact of a shortfall will be less than last year, spot price are now capped at BRL 388 per megawatt hour compared to the cap last year which was BRL 823.
We're not incorporating rationing in our 2015 guidance at this time. We'll provide an update on the next earnings call in May when we have more clarity. Although it's very premature, we estimate a rationing scenario could result in an additional $0.05 impact above the $0.05 we already have incorporated into our guidance.
Now to cash flow beginning on Slide 18. We generated $287 million of proportional free cash in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year amount to $891 million versus $1.27 billion in 2013, although, near the bottom end of our revised guidance, it's roughly $250 million less than our original guidance. We're obviously disappointed with this result. This decline was largely driven by 3 unanticipated factors: First, an increase in a little more than $100 million in receivables at our Maritza Plant in Bulgaria; second, higher receivables at Sul, our utility in Brazil due to higher energy purchases; and finally, a lag in VAT or value-added taxes related to our construction projects in Chile. We expect improvement in these factors this year.
Now to Slide 19 in our capital allocation in 2014. On the left, we generated roughly $1.9 billion of discretionary cash, including $1.2 billion from announced asset sales. We're pleased that despite our shortfall in proportional free cash flow, we generated $523 million in Parent free cash flow above the $500 million midpoint of our expectations.
Turning to the right-hand side of the slide, we allocated 76% of this cash to Parent debt and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Meeting our Parent free cash flow expectation is especially important as it is a foundation of our dividend and dividend growth, as we've demonstrated through the recent doubling of our dividend, we continue to be comfortable that we'll generate about 525 million of Parent free cash flow in '15 and growth of 10% to 15% annually.
Turning to Slide 20 in our capital allocation plan for 2015. With $460 million in announced asset sale proceeds, our total discretionary cash is expected to be about $1.5 billion in 2015. We'll invest about $300 million to fund equity commitments and projects currently under construction, the largest of which is at IPALCO where we have $1.4 billion investment program underway to increase the rate base by 70% from 2013 to 2017.
After taking into account our growth investments as well as expected debt prepayments of $200 million, we're projecting about $600 million of remaining cash available for allocation. We currently have a $400 million authorization for share purchases of which we expect to utilize the majority during 2015. 
Before turning to our guidance, I'd like to take a moment to address our foreign currency and commodity exposures and our hedging practices on Slide 21. We have long-term protections built into our business model to manage our exposure of FX and commodity price changes. For example, 82% of our businesses are either utilities or generation businesses with an average contract term of 7 years. This insulates the majority of our earnings from commodity price volatility. Having said that, some of our businesses do have commodity exposure as they operate in markets where power prices are oil or natural gas driven. We show in our appendix, every 10% move in oil is roughly a $0.025 EPS impact on an open basis, primarily from the Dominican Republic and to a lesser extent, Panama where we have a modest amount of excess power selling in the spot market. 
On the plus side, in Panama, as I just mentioned, lower oil prices reduce our exposure to poor hydrology. In terms of gas, our largest exposure is at our DPO merchant business, where our 3,000 megawatts coal-fired fleet is negatively impacted by declining gas prices. However, although, gas has fallen by 20%, dark spreads and held up at around the $12 range, the impact on our EPS has been less than our disclosed sensitivities, which assumed a constant market heat rate. 
Regarding currencies as you can see on the right-hand side, we largely protected from currency changes given that more than 2/3 of our PPC is effectively U.S.-dollar denominated. The remaining 1/3 is exposed to a handful of foreign currencies mainly the Brazilian Riel, the euro and the Colombian peso. The exposed portion, the risk on a 12-month rolling basis through shorter-term FX hedging programs while currency linked escalation clauses in our shorter-term contracts.
Now I'll walk through our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance on Slide 22. The updated forward curve on commodities and currencies used in sensitivities we provided in our last earnings deck, which suggest a $0.10 negative impact to 2015. However, as a result, of additional FX hedges, fuel and power contracts, we have been able to trend the overall impact from currencies and commodities on our 2015 EPS by $0.04. We're also incorporating a $0.05 impact from Brazil hydrology as I discussed earlier. Finally, we've also factored in a modest dilution of $0.03 from other factors, including PPA negotiations at Maritza. We're offsetting these impacts through the following actions: $0.04 from cost savings initiatives across our portfolio and revenue improvements, including a modest uplift from Mong Duong, with a new account standard that better aligns earnings with cash on our ongoing basis. $0.02 from accelerated capital allocation and $0.03 from various tax opportunities. Net-net, we've offset 13 [ph] of the $0.18 of headwinds and therefore revised our guidance downward by $0.05 to a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share.
Turning to our longer-term adjusted EPS expectations on Slide 23, we continue to expect modest to flat growth in 2016 and 6% to 8% growth in 2017 and '18, more weighted towards 2018, consistent with our prior expectation, but off a lower 2015 base. Our projects under construction will drive our earnings growth while many of the other actions we're implementing in 2015 will continue to benefit us in '16 and beyond, largely offsetting what appears at this time to be a negative impact from currency and commodity forward curves, as well as the impact of potential modifications at the Maritza PPA. 
Shifting cash flow guidance on Slide 24, we are reaffirming our 2015 proportional free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.35 billion. This implies an increase of roughly $275 million over 2014, which is driven by recovery working capital and receivables, along with cash flow from new businesses including Mong Duong, which comes online this year.
In Brazil, we're encouraged by the recent boost by the regulator will accelerate the collection of purchased power costs by the distribution companies. 
On Slide 25, we continue to expect 10% to 15% average annual growth in proportional free cash flow driven by contributions from projects currently under construction, as well as the fact that maintenance CapEx is less than depreciation from new projects. In 2014 and '15, depreciation average is about $350 [ph] million greater than maintenance and environmental CapEx. We expect this differential to widen to $600 [ph] million by 2017, which explains much of where our cash flow is growing at a greater rate than earnings. We believe cash flow is a key value driver with strong double-digit growth in both proportional and Parent free cash flow over the longer term. We'll continue to show the value of our cash flow through disciplined capital allocation that maximizes risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it back to Andres."

We are seeing a lot of that to be honest through PGM premium capacity product. It looks like it's on track, so we expect to get more value for our capacity in that fashion. Now the last thing I'd say, it's a little hard for us, all of our plants, let's say positive on to go cost, we don't have any plants that are cash flow negative, as we see it.

I think as you know, we sold most of our position in utilities K solar and our JV with, we get some assets. We continue to believe that we should have the capability of introducing solar onto our platforms where it makes economic sense, so right now, we're building 20 megawatts of solar in Chile. So 1 market that's particularly interesting is Chile where you have some of the best solar radiation in the world, and you have very low rainfall in the north, so it's an optimal place for solar and also energy prices because their complimented Hydro are quite high. So that combination of factors makes it an attractive market. We have other markets such as the Dominican Republic, El Salvador where again, you have high solar radiation, you have high energy prices, so we feel that this could be a nice addition to our portfolio to address the needs of large customers, especially in commercial and industrial. We also think that this distributed solar is something, which is affecting the industry and we want to have our most current information, understand what's happening, understand developments to be able to react fast. So we think that we have a unique footprint in terms of places where you have the right combinations of natural factors and the market factors and with this know how. We're optimistic that we will make a good business. Now given AES size, and given that we have a modest investments, at this point, it will take some time to draw. And lastly, as you know we are the world leaders in the use of lithium iron batteries. Recently won in the Southern California, Edison bid, we got 100 megawatts of more additional capacity and we're using it really to almost like a peaking plan I would say. So having distributed solar and having the batteries together, puts us in a very good position to react to changes in the marketplace with the growth of renewable. So again, it's part of having a complete product offering, but again, we're starting off modest and with batteries, we tend to make money from it."

Of course, it would be more efficient for us as we received capacity payments and be able to run it more. We have of course, a gas pipeline. It comes through Argentina, so the issue really has been to deliver LNG into Argentina and get equivalent amount of gas in Brazil at Ljubljana, and it really depends on what's the delivered price to the plant so we've been having relatively high prices delivered gas to Uruguaiana, we're working on mechanisms, using the existing infrastructure to get lower-priced gas. But what is also very important as we have been promoting discussions between the governments, so we had an interconnection line from Chile -- from Argentina to Chile, from Tom Velan into Chile, given the situation of increased capacity in northern Chile. We have reversed that transmission line so that we can now export energy from Chile into Argentina and there exists the possibility that we're exploring that we would actually pass energy from Chile to Argentina and from Argentina into Brazil and it would be a win-win for all and we have had considerable government risk activity because we've got the permission for the first step, we'll be looking for in the second step. But I think what's important, broadly is that we're looking at ways to decrease our Hydro exposure and even if rates go back to normal, we don't want to be as susceptible to a job. Admittedly, this is the worst drought in 100 years, but nonetheless, he want to decrease our portfolio sensitivity to it so we're looking at these ideas."

And second, rationalizing the energy that NEK buys because we are the -- among the thermal platform, the fuel EU 16 compliant plants that really enforce their rules, this will put -- make our plant much more important.

Then Tom will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance and longer-term expectations in detail.
Turning to Slide 4. During 2014, we made significant progress on our strategy and continued to position our company for the future. During this year, we brought in financial partners to invest $1.9 billion in our subsidiaries; announced or closed 10 transactions for $1.8 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales; broke new ground on 6 new platform expansion projects, totaling 2,200 megawatts and won long-term contracts to build 1,400 megawatts of capacity in California.  
We allocated $600 million to reduce parent debt and improve our credit profile, returned $450 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and announced a doubling of our dividend, with an intended growth rate of 10%.
Turning to Slide 5. Unfortunately, our financial results for the year were affected by $0.10 of adverse hydrology in Panama and Brazil. Still, we earned an adjusted EPS of $1.30, which was at the lower end of our original guidance range of $1.30 to $1.40, and slightly better than our expectations at the end of our third quarter call in November. We are disappointed with our proportional free cash flow of $891 million. Although proportional free cash flow came in at the low end of our revised guidance, it is 20% lower than our original guidance, primarily driven by the higher working capital requirements in Brazil and Chile as well as increased receivables in Bulgaria. All of which, we expect to reverse in 2015.
Now turning to Slide 6. I would like to outline several factors affecting our 2015 outlook. Importantly, we have taken a number of steps to mitigate their impacts. Since our last call, we've seen international macroeconomic factors move against us. Currency and commodity forwards have declined significantly. Although, we are largely contracted and the majority of our earnings are U.S. dollar-linked, this downward shift in forward curves has affected some of our businesses and, consequently, our earnings expectations for 2015 and beyond. We are also seeing continuing poor hydro conditions in Brazil, especially in the state of São Paulo, where our hyrdros are located, rather than a return to normal hydrology as we had previously assumed. 
We've been taking actions to lower our sensitivity to hydrology by adopting more optimal hedging strategies in Panama and Brazil. In Panama, we are bringing in a 72-megawatt oil-fired barge. In Brazil, we are working on creative solutions to supply additional energy, such as pursuing opportunities to restart long-term operations at our 640-megawatt Uruguaiana CCGT plant, which has not operated continually for many years due to lack of fuel. We're also exploring options to export energy from Chile and Argentina to the Brazilian grid. In parallel, we are proactively hedging our FX exposure in Brazil, Colombia and Europe, where since our last call, we have entered into additional hedges to shield 40% of our exposed earnings from further volatility.
In our 2015 guidance, we're also assuming that ongoing negotiations in Bulgaria will have some earnings impact on our Maritza business. The energy Minister of Bulgaria recently issued a communiqué in which he committed to paying Maritza's outstanding receivables of approximately $260 million and announced ongoing discussions to reduce the contract price. Additionally, the government is taking steps to improve the financial position of our offtaker, NEK, by reducing the volume of expensive energy that NEK is purchasing from other market  participants and compensating NEK through environmental taxes. The Bulgarian government has targeted closing this negotiation and addressing NEK's financial situation in the first half of this year. All the negotiations have not been finalized. We're incorporating modest earnings dilution in our future expectations, which we believe is sufficient to accommodate the outcome of the discussions currently under way.
The combined earnings impact of the macroeconomic factors and hydrology in Brazil as well as the potential outcome of the PPA negotiations at Maritza, is approximately $0.18. Through proactive steps, including additional hedges, revenue improvement and cost savings, we expect to offset $0.13 of the total and, therefore, are reducing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a revised range of $1.25 to $1.35.
Notwithstanding the impact on our earnings from these factors, we are also reaffirming our 2015 proportional free cash flow range of $1,000,000,000 to $1,035,000,000  (sic) [ $1,350,000,000 ], which is 30% higher than our 2014 results. This growth is largely driven by the recovery of working capital in Brazil and Chile as well as a reduction in accounts receivable in Bulgaria and the contributions from new plants coming online this year, such as the 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam and the 72-megawatt oil-fired barge in Panama.
Turning to Slide 7. I will discuss our continued progress on our strategic objectives, which we laid out in 2011, including reducing complexity, performance excellence, expanding access to capital and leveraging our platforms. 
First, reducing complexity. Since 2011, we have reduced the number of countries where we operate, from 28 down to 18, and raised $3 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales. In 2014 alone, we closed 10 transactions, totaling $1.8 billion in equity proceeds to AES. In addition to simplifying our portfolio, we recently exited riskier markets, such as Ukraine, Nigeria and Cameroon in a timely manner and at attractive valuations.
As a result of our efforts, 80% of our 2014 earnings and proportional free cash flow was generated in 10 countries in the Americas. Regarding performance excellence, we believe that we are now the low-cost manager of a large portfolio of international energy assets. 
As you can see on Slide 8, we have reduced our global G&A by about 1/3 or $200 million, achieving the goal we established in 2011, 1 year early. Going forward, we are focusing on additional cost savings initiatives, including saving $100 million in O&M by 2018.
Turning to Slide 9. Through financial partnerships, we are expanding our access to capital and fine tuning our portfolio's global macroeconomic exposures and commodity risks. In most cases, we earn management, development or promote our upfront fees. Partial sell-downs of our assets also served to highlight the value of the business in our portfolio. In total, we have raised $2.5 billion in proceeds to AES through financial partnerships. In 2014, we brought in partners at 4 of our businesses, including CDPQ, a long-term institutional investor headquartered in Québec, Canada, which recently invested in IPALCO in Indiana. We look forward to working with CDPQ on additional partnering opportunities in the U.S. and Latin America.
Turning to leveraging our platforms on Slide 10. We are exclusively focusing our growth on classroom expansions, including adjacencies such as energy storage and desalinization. Adjacencies are smaller investment opportunities that are replicable across our portfolio and have higher returns with a much shorter construction period. To that end, we recently made a $25 million investment to acquire Main Street Power, a developer of distributed solar. Although modest in size, this business will provide us with the know-how to implement distributed solar generation in some of our international markets, where power prices are higher and solar resource is greater. We will focus on commercial and industrial customers.
We currently have a total of 1,141 megawatts (sic) [7,141 megawatts] under construction, the most in AES's 34-year history. These projects represent $9 billion in total capital expenditures, the vast majority of which is being funded by a combination of nonrecourse debt and partner equity. More importantly, our required equity for these projects is $1.5 billion, of which we've already funded 70%. In terms of where these projects are located, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, 40% of the capacity under construction is in the U.S. The 1,400 [ph] megawatts of Southland contracts we recently won are not yet included in these numbers since we have not yet broken ground. If they were, the U.S. would represent 50% of the new capacity. We're earning very attractive risk-adjusted returns on these projects. For competitive reasons, we cannot provide detail on a project-by-project basis. However, we will provide some general guidelines. 
For international projects, we're seeing IRRs from the midteens to more than 20% with project-specific returns bearing [ph] reflecting project and country risk premiums. For U.S. projects, IRRs are in the low double digits. Including all of our projects under construction, the average IRR is around 14% and the ROE is greater than 15%. We would expect to earn at least as much from new projects in our development pipeline.
Now turning to Slide 11. I would emphasize that as we have done in the past, we will complete all new projects with share buybacks and, furthermore, we will only invest in a new project if it meets the following criteria. First, it enhances the value of an existing business, such as the MATS CapEx program at IPL in Indiana or the oil-fired barge in Panama. Second, it offers compelling risk-adjusted returns while minimizing AES Corp. equity by using project-level cash or local leverage capacity. Examples include closing the cycle at our DPP plant in the Dominican Republic and energy storage. And finally, for any large project, we would expect to bring in a partner to maximize our returns and allow us to fine tune our total exposure in the project.
The bottom line is that our successful execution on the 4 pillars of our strategy that I just discussed have positioned us to deliver average annual cash flow growth of 10% to 15% over the next 4 years, as our construction projects come online. We expect to grow our dividend 10% per year from today's level as cash flow increases. Given all that, we believe that our current share price does not reflect the progress we have made in our company and portfolio or the value from our largely funded construction program. Therefore, we have taken advantage of low share prices by buying back $150 million of our shares since our third quarter call. And today, we have announced that our board has authorized an additional $400 million for share repurchases, the majority of which we expect to utilize in 2015.
Finally, as you can see on Slide 12, our overall capital allocation over the last 3 years has been very shareholder-focused. In fact, we have allocated 78% of our discretionary cash to parent debt prepayments and returning cash to shareholders. Specifically, we've allocated $1.6 billion to decrease our parent debt by 20% and improve our financial flexibility. We have also reduced our share count by 10%, buying back 78 million shares at an average price of $12.69. And with the recent doubling of our dividend, we're now paying $0.10 per share per quarter and we expect to grow the dividend 10% annually.
We recognize that 2015 will be a challenging year due to negative macroeconomic factors in international markets and poor hydrology in Brazil. Nonetheless, we will continue to execute on our strategy to create shareholder value by pulling the levers we have outlined today.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom, who will provide greater detail on our 2014 results and 2015 forecast."
35312,282842060,771279,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results, including: adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; and our cash flow. Then I'll discuss our 2014 and '",2026,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results, including: adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; and our cash flow. Then I'll discuss our 2014 and '15 capital allocation plans, 2015 guidance and our longer-term expectations.
As Andres has just discussed, we achieved a number of our objectives in 2014, despite the impacts from adverse hydrology and other factors. From an EPS perspective, we were able to offset these issues through operational improvements, accelerated cost savings and our capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases and debt prepayments. Admittedly, our 2014 proportional free cash flow was disappointing due to higher working capital requirements and increased receivables.
Turning to Slide 14. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.41 compared to $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Overall, our businesses contributed $0.08, driven by higher earnings from our U.S., Brazil and Andes SBUs. We also benefited from a 3% reduction in share count, lower parent interest expense and improved corporate charges, which contributed $0.07. These benefits were offset by a $0.03 impact from tax. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25%, which was higher than the 18% rate we had last year. Detailed drivers of our fourth quarter PTC performance by SBU are in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 15, and our full year EPS of $1.30 per share. Compared to 2013, we benefited from $0.07 of better operating performance at our U.S. SBU and our utilities in Brazil, plus a smaller impact from hydro; $0.03 from several other items, including recognition of higher interest income on receivables in Argentina in 2013; and $0.11 from capital allocation and lower corporate charges. These benefits were offset by $0.06 from outages in the first 9 months and a $0.14 impact from a higher adjusted effective tax rate of 30% versus 21% in '13. We ended up $1.30, which was at the low end of our original guidance range.
Turning to Slide 16. Our results by SBU were in line with the adjusted PTC modeling ranges we provided in November. The main driver that helped us come in at the high end of our revised EPS range was a 30% tax rate, which was slightly below what we were expecting, and equates to a couple cents of earnings.
Now to Slide 17. Poor hydrology in Latin America continued to be a headwind in 2014, with a $0.10 impact to our adjusted EPS versus normal conditions. Although this was a meaningful impact, it was about 25% lower than what we experienced in 2013 due to favorable hydro conditions in Colombia and our proactive steps in Panama.
Now going to hydrology by market, beginning with Colombia. In 2014, Chivor had favorable inflow conditions relative to the rest of the country, which allowed us to sell excess power into the spot market at attractive prices, adding $0.03. Currently, inflows at Chivor are 92% of average. And we're expecting a normal year in 2015. In Panama, we had a $0.06 shortfall in '14, most of which was during the first 9 months, as inflows improved in the fourth quarter. Inflows are now close to 100% of long-term average and power prices are about $100 a megawatt hour, down from well over $200 per megawatt hour from much of last year. 
Our downside exposure continues to decrease for 2 main reasons. First, government compensation agreement we negotiated last year offset this exposure; and secondly, lower oil prices helped to reduce our earnings volatility, as spot prices during dry conditions are set by oil-fired generation. In 2014, we were purchasing in the spot market. If oil prices were at today's level last year, the hydro impact would've been about $0.03 rather than the $0.06 we actually experienced. I'll also note, as Andres mentioned, we've brought an oil-fired barge to Panama, improving our bottom line.
Finally in Brazil, we had a $0.07 impact from poor hydrology in 2014. Tietê experienced a 10% reduction in generation or GSF. The impact was magnified by the fact that the average spot price was just under BRL 700 per megawatt hour in 2014, significantly greater than the BRL 200 level of our offtake contract.
Currently, reservoir levels are about 23%. While we've seen some recent improvement, it's difficult to predict how much they'll recover by the end of the rainy season in April. For now, we're factoring in about a $0.05 impact into our 2015 guidance due to an estimated 15% to 17% reduction in generation for the year. The impact of a shortfall will be less than last year. And spot prices are now capped at BRL 388 per megawatt hour compared to the cap last year which was BRL 823.
We're not incorporating rationing into our 2015 guidance at this time. We'll provide an update on the next earnings call in May when we'll have more clarity. Although it's very premature, we estimate a rationing scenario could result in an additional $0.05 impact, above the $0.05 we already have incorporated into our guidance.
Now to cash flow, beginning on Slide 18. We generated $287 million of proportional free cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year amount to $891 million versus $1.27 billion in 2013. Although, near the bottom end of our revised guidance, it's roughly $250 million less than our original guidance. We're obviously disappointed with this result. This decline was largely driven by 3 unanticipated factors: first, an increase of a little more than $100 million in receivables at our Maritza Plant in Bulgaria; second, higher receivables at Sul, our utility in Brazil, due to higher energy purchases; and finally, a lag in VAT, or value-added taxes, related to our construction projects in Chile. We expect improvement in these factors this year.
Now to Slide 19, and our capital allocation in 2014. Starting on the left, we generated roughly $1.9 billion of discretionary cash, including $1.2 billion from announced asset sales. We're pleased that despite our shortfall in proportional free cash flow, we generated $523 million in parent free cash flow, above the $500 million midpoint of our expectations.
Turning to the right-hand side of the slide, we allocated 76% of this cash to parent debt and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Meeting our parent free cash flow expectation is especially important as it is the foundation of our dividend and dividend growth. As we've demonstrated through the recent doubling of our dividend, we continue to be comfortable that we'll generate about $525 million of parent free cash flow in '15 and growth of 10% to 15% annually.
Turning to Slide 20, and our capital allocation plan for 2015. With $460 million in announced asset sale proceeds, our total discretionary cash is expected to be about $1.5 billion in 2015. We'll invest about $300 million to fund equity commitments in projects currently under construction, the largest of which is at IPALCO, where we have a $1.4 billion investment program under way to increase the rate base by 70% from 2013 to 2017.
After taking into account our growth investments as well as expected debt prepayments of $200 million, we're projecting about $600 million of remaining cash available for allocation. We currently have a $400 million authorization for share purchases, of which we expect to utilize the majority during 2015. 
Before turning to our guidance, I'd like to take a moment to address our foreign currency and commodity exposures and our hedging practices on Slide 21. We have long-term protections built into our business model to manage our exposure to FX and commodity price changes. For example, 82% of our businesses are either utilities or generation businesses with an average contract term of 7 years. This insulates the majority of our earnings from commodity price volatility. Having said that, some of our businesses do have commodity exposure as they operate in markets where power prices are oil- or natural gas-driven. As shown in our appendix, every 10% move in oil is roughly a $0.025 EPS impact on an op basis, primarily from the Dominican Republic and, to a lesser extent, Panama, where we have a modest amount of excess power to sell into the spot market. On the plus side, in Panama, as I just mentioned, lower oil prices reduce our exposure to poor hydrology. 
In terms of gas, our largest exposure is at our DPL merchant business, where our 3,000-megawatt coal-fired fleet is negatively impacted by declining gas prices. However, although, gas has fallen by 20%, dark spreads held up at around the $12 range. The impact on our EPS has been less than our disclosed sensitivities, which assumed a constant market heat rate. 
Regarding currencies, as you can see on the right-hand side, we're largely protected from foreign currency changes given that more than 2/3 of our PTC is effectively U.S.-dollar denominated. The remaining 1/3 is exposed to a handful of foreign currencies, mainly the Brazilian real, the euro and the Colombian peso. For the exposed portion, we mitigate the risk on a 12-month rolling basis through shorter-term FX hedging programs or currency-linked escalation clauses in our shorter-term contracts.
Now I'll walk through our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance on Slide 22. The updated forward curve on commodities and currencies used in sensitivities we provided in our last earnings deck, would suggest a $0.10 negative impact to 2015. However, as a result of additional FX hedges, fuel and power contracts, we have been able to trim the overall impact from currencies and commodities on our 2015 EPS by $0.04. We're also incorporating a $0.05 impact from Brazil hydrology, as I discussed earlier. 
Finally, we've also factored in a modest dilution of $0.03 from other factors, including PPA negotiations at Maritza. We're offsetting these impacts through the following actions: $0.04 from cost savings initiatives across our portfolio and revenue improvements, including a modest uplift from Mong Duong, where a new account standard better aligns earnings with cash on an ongoing basis; $0.02 from accelerated capital allocation; and $0.03 from various tax opportunities. Net-net, we've offset $0.13 of the $0.18 of headwinds, and we therefore revised our guidance downward by $0.05 to a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share.
Turning to our longer-term adjusted EPS expectations on Slide 23. We continue to expect modest to flat growth in 2016, and 6% to 8% growth in 2017 and '18, more weighted towards 2018, consistent with our prior expectation but off a lower 2015 base. Our projects under construction will drive our earnings growth, while many of the other actions we're implementing in 2015 will continue to benefit us in '16 and beyond, largely offsetting what appears at this time to be a negative impact from currency and commodity forward curves as well as the impact of potential modifications of the Maritza PPA. 
Shifting to cash flow guidance on Slide 24. We are reaffirming our 2015 proportional free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.35 billion. This implies an increase of roughly $275 million over 2014, which is driven by recovery working capital and receivables, along with cash flow from new businesses, including Mong Duong, which comes online this year.
In Brazil, we're encouraged that recent moves by the regulator will accelerate the collection of purchased power costs by the distribution companies. 
On Slide 25, we continue to expect 10% to 15% average annual growth in proportional free cash flow driven by contributions from projects currently under construction as well as the fact that maintenance CapEx is less than depreciation from new projects. In 2014 and '15, depreciation averages about $350 million greater than maintenance and environmental CapEx. We expect this differential to widen to $600 million by 2017, which explains much of why our cash flow is growing at a greater rate than earnings. We believe cash flow is a key value driver with strong double-digit growth in both proportional and parent free cash flow over the longer term. We'll continue to show the value of our cash flow through disciplined capital allocation that maximizes risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it back to Andres."

We do think -- kind of stepping back on, a bigger picture, we do think capacity will be worth more and that probably was a significant input into us deciding last summer to retain the generation. We are seeing a lot of that, to be honest, through PJM premium capacity product. It looks like it's on track, so we expect to get more value for our capacity in that fashion. The last thing I'd say, it's a little hard for us. All of our plants are, let's say, positive on a to-go cost. We don't have any plants that are cash flow-negative, as we see it. So it's a little harder for us to make the case that, perhaps, some other plants in Ohio might -- the big majority of our plants.

I think as you know, we sold most of our position in utility-scale solar in our JV with Riverstone. We've kept some assets. We continue to believe that we should have the capability of introducing solar onto our platforms where it makes economic sense. So right now, we're building 20 megawatts of solar in Chile. So 1 market that's particularly interesting is Chile, where you have some of the best solar irradiation in the world, and you have very low rainfall in the north, so it's an optimal place for solar. And also energy prices, because they have limited hydro, are quite high. So that combination of factors makes it an attractive market. We have other markets, such as the Dominican Republic, El Salvador where, again, you have high solar irradiation, you have high energy prices. So we feel that this could be a nice addition to our portfolio to address the needs of large customers, especially commercial and industrial. We also think that this -- distributed solar is something which is affecting the industry, and we want to have our most current information, understand what's happening, understand developments to be able to react fast. So we think that we have a unique footprint in terms of places where you have the right combinations of natural factors and of market factors, and with this know-how, we're optimistic we will make a good business. Now given AES's size and given that we have a modest investment, at this point, it will take some time to grow out. And lastly, as you know, we are the world leaders in the use of lithium-ion batteries. We recently won in the Southern California Edison bid. We got 100 megawatts of more, additional capacity and we're using it really to -- almost like a peaking plant, I would say. So having distributed solar and having the batteries together puts us in a very good position to react to changes in the marketplace with the growth of renewables. So again, it's part of having a complete product offering. But again, we're starting off modest and in lithium-ion [ph] batteries, we intend to make money from it."

Of course, what would be more efficient for us is to receive capacity payments and be able to run it more. We have of course, a gas pipeline, it comes through Argentina. So the issue really has been to deliver LNG into Argentina and get equivalent amount of gas in Brazil at Uruguaiana. And it really depends on what's the delivered price to the plant, so we've been having relatively high prices of delivered gas to Uruguaiana. We're working on mechanisms using the existing infrastructure to get lower-priced gas. But what is also very important is that we have been promoting discussions between the governments. So we had interconnection line from Chile -- from Argentina to Chile, from TermoAndes into Chile. Given the situation of increased capacity in Northern Chile, we have reversed that transmission line so that we can now export energy from Chile into Argentina. And there exists the possibility, and that we're exploring, where we would actually pass energy from Chile to Argentina and from Argentina into Brazil. And it would be a win-win for all, and we have had considerable government receptivity. And since now we've gotten the permission for the first step, we'll be looking to the second step. But I think what's important, broadly, is that we're looking at ways to decrease our hydro exposure. And even if rains come back to normal, we don't want to be as susceptible to a drought. Admittedly, this is the worst drought in 100 years but, nonetheless, we want to decrease our portfolio sensitivity to it so we're looking at these ideas."

Then Tom will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance and longer-term expectations in detail.
Turning to Slide 4. During 2014, we made significant progress on our strategy and continued to position our company for the future. During this year, we brought in financial partners to invest $1.9 billion in our subsidiaries; announced or closed 10 transactions for $1.8 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales; broke new ground on 6 new platform expansion projects, totaling 2,200 megawatts and won long-term contracts to build 1,400 megawatts of capacity in California.  
We allocated $600 million to reduce parent debt and improve our credit profile, returned $450 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and announced a doubling of our dividend, with an intended growth rate of 10%.
Turning to Slide 5. Unfortunately, our financial results for the year were affected by $0.10 of adverse hydrology in Panama and Brazil. Still, we earned an adjusted EPS of $1.30, which was at the lower end of our original guidance range of $1.30 to $1.40, and slightly better than our expectations at the end of our third quarter call in November. We are disappointed with our proportional free cash flow of $891 million. Although proportional free cash flow came in at the low end of our revised guidance, it is 20% lower than our original guidance, primarily driven by the higher working capital requirements in Brazil and Chile as well as increased receivables in Bulgaria. All of which, we expect to reverse in 2015.
Now turning to Slide 6. I would like to outline several factors affecting our 2015 outlook. Importantly, we have taken a number of steps to mitigate their impacts. Since our last call, we've seen international macroeconomic factors move against us. Currency and commodity forwards have declined significantly. Although we are largely contracted and the majority of our earnings are U.S. dollar-linked, this downward shift in forward curves has affected some of our businesses and, consequently, our earnings expectations for 2015 and beyond. We are also seeing continuing poor hydro conditions in Brazil, especially in the state of São Paulo, where our hydros are located, rather than a return to normal hydrology, as we had previously assumed. 
We've been taking actions to lower our sensitivity to hydrology by adopting more optimal hedging strategies in Panama and Brazil. In Panama, we are bringing in a 72-megawatt oil-fired barge. In Brazil, we are working on creative solutions to supply additional energy, such as pursuing opportunities to restart long-term operations at our 640-megawatt Uruguaiana CCGT plant, which has not operated continually for many years due to lack of fuel. We're also exploring options to export energy from Chile and Argentina to the Brazilian grid. In parallel, we are proactively hedging our FX exposure in Brazil, Colombia and Europe, where since our last call, we have entered into additional hedges to shield 40% of our exposed earnings from further volatility.
In our 2015 guidance, we're also assuming that ongoing negotiations in Bulgaria will have some earnings impact on our Maritza business. The Energy Minister of Bulgaria recently issued a communiqué in which he committed to paying Maritza's outstanding receivables of approximately $260 million and announced ongoing discussions to reduce the contract price. Additionally, the government is taking steps to improve the financial position of our offtaker, NEK, by reducing the volume of expensive energy that NEK is purchasing from other market  participants and compensating NEK through environmental taxes. The Bulgarian government has targeted closing this negotiation and addressing NEK's financial situation in the first half of this year. Although negotiations have not been finalized, we're incorporating modest earnings dilution in our future expectations, which we believe is sufficient to accommodate the outcome of the discussions currently under way.
The combined earnings impact of the macroeconomic factors and hydrology in Brazil as well as the potential outcome of the PPA negotiations at Maritza is approximately $0.18. Through proactive steps, including additional hedges, revenue improvement and cost savings, we expect to offset $0.13 of the total and, therefore, are reducing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a revised range of $1.25 to $1.35.
Notwithstanding the impact on our earnings from these factors, we are also reaffirming our 2015 proportional free cash flow range of $1,000,000,000 to $1,035,000,000 (sic) [$1,350,000,000], which is 30% higher than our 2014 results. This growth is largely driven by the recovery of working capital in Brazil and Chile as well as a reduction in accounts receivable in Bulgaria and the contributions from new plants coming online this year, such as the 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam and the 72-megawatt oil-fired barge in Panama.
Turning to Slide 7. I will discuss our continued progress on our strategic objectives, which we laid out in 2011, including reducing complexity, performance excellence, expanding access to capital and leveraging our platforms. 
First, reducing complexity. Since 2011, we have reduced the number of countries where we operate, from 28 down to 18, and raised $3 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales. In 2014 alone, we closed 10 transactions, totaling $1.8 billion in equity proceeds to AES. In addition to simplifying our portfolio, we recently exited riskier markets, such as Ukraine, Nigeria and Cameroon in a timely manner and at attractive valuations.
As a result of our efforts, 80% of our 2014 earnings and proportional free cash flow was generated in 10 countries in the Americas. Regarding performance excellence, we believe that we are now the low-cost manager of a large portfolio of international energy assets. 
As you can see on Slide 8, we have reduced our global G&A by about 1/3 or $200 million, achieving the goal we established in 2011, 1 year early. Going forward, we are focusing on additional cost savings initiatives, including saving $100 million in O&M by 2018.
Turning to Slide 9. Through financial partnerships, we are expanding our access to capital and fine-tuning our portfolio's global macroeconomic exposures and commodity risks. In most cases, we earn management, development, a promote or upfront fees. Partial sell-downs of our assets also served to highlight the value of the business in our portfolio. In total, we have raised $2.5 billion in proceeds to AES through financial partnerships. In 2014, we brought in partners at 4 of our businesses, including CDPQ, a long-term institutional investor headquartered in Québec, Canada, which recently invested in IPALCO in Indiana. We look forward to working with CDPQ on additional partnering opportunities in the U.S. and Latin America.
Turning to leveraging our platforms, on Slide 10. We are exclusively focusing our growth on classroom expansions, including adjacencies such as energy storage and desalinization. Adjacencies are smaller investment opportunities that are replicable across our portfolio and have higher returns, with a much shorter construction period. To that end, we recently made a $25 million investment to acquire Main Street Power, a developer of distributed solar. Although modest in size, this business will provide us with the know-how to implement distributed solar generation in some of our international markets, where power prices are higher and solar resource is greater. We will focus on commercial and industrial customers.
We currently have a total of 1,141 megawatts (sic) [7,141 megawatts] under construction, the most in AES's 34-year history. These projects represent $9 billion in total capital expenditures, the vast majority of which is being funded by a combination of nonrecourse debt and partner equity. More importantly, our required equity for these projects is $1.5 billion, of which we've already funded 70%. In terms of where these projects are located, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, 40% of the capacity under construction is in the U.S. The 1,400 [ph] megawatts of Southland contracts we recently won are not yet included in these numbers since we have not yet broken ground. If they were, the U.S. would represent 50% of the new capacity. We're earning very attractive risk-adjusted returns on these projects. For competitive reasons, we cannot provide details on a project-by-project basis. However, we will provide some general guidelines. 
For international projects, we're seeing IRRs from the midteens to more than 20%, with project-specific returns varying, reflecting project and country risk premiums. For U.S. projects, IRRs are in the low double digits. Including all of our projects under construction, the average IRR is around 14% and the ROE is greater than 15%. We would expect to earn at least as much from new projects in our development pipeline.
Now turning to Slide 11. I would emphasize that as we have done in the past, we will complete all new projects with share buybacks and, furthermore, we will only invest in a new project if it meets the following criteria. First, it enhances the value of an existing business, such as the MATS CapEx program at IPL in Indiana or the oil-fired barge in Panama. Second, it offers compelling risk-adjusted returns while minimizing AES Corp. equity by using project-level cash or local leverage capacity. Examples include closing the cycle at our DPP plant in the Dominican Republic and energy storage. And finally, for any large project, we would expect to bring in a partner to maximize our returns and allow us to fine tune our total exposure in the project.
The bottom line is that our successful execution on the 4 pillars of our strategy that I just discussed have positioned us to deliver average annual cash flow growth of 10% to 15% over the next 4 years, as our construction projects come online. We expect to grow our dividend 10% per year from today's level as cash flow increases. Given all that, we believe that our current share price does not reflect the progress we have made in our company and portfolio or the value from our largely funded construction program. Therefore, we have taken advantage of low share prices by buying back $150 million of our shares since our third quarter call. And today, we have announced that our board has authorized an additional $400 million for share repurchases, the majority of which we expect to utilize in 2015.
Finally, as you can see on Slide 12, our overall capital allocation over the last 3 years has been very shareholder-focused. In fact, we have allocated 78% of our discretionary cash to parent debt prepayments and returning cash to shareholders. Specifically, we've allocated $1.6 billion to decrease our parent debt by 20% and improve our financial flexibility. We have also reduced our share count by 10%, buying back 78 million shares at an average price of $12.69. And with the recent doubling of our dividend, we're now paying $0.10 per share per quarter and we expect to grow the dividend 10% annually.
We recognize that 2015 will be a challenging year due to negative macroeconomic factors in international markets and poor hydrology in Brazil. Nonetheless, we will continue to execute on our strategy to create shareholder value by pulling the levers we have outlined today.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom, who will provide greater detail on our 2014 results and 2015 forecast."
35312,282842060,771553,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results, including: adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; and our cash flow. Then I'll discuss our 2014 and '",2029,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results, including: adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; and our cash flow. Then I'll discuss our 2014 and '15 capital allocation plans, 2015 guidance and our longer-term expectations.
As Andres has just discussed, we achieved a number of our objectives in 2014, despite the impacts from adverse hydrology and other factors. From an EPS perspective, we were able to offset these issues through operational improvements, accelerated cost savings and our capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases and debt prepayments. Admittedly, our 2014 proportional free cash flow was disappointing due to higher working capital requirements and increased receivables.
Turning to Slide 14. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.41 compared to $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Overall, our businesses contributed $0.08, driven by higher earnings from our U.S., Brazil and Andes SBUs. We also benefited from a 3% reduction in share count, lower parent interest expense and improved corporate charges, which contributed $0.07. These benefits were offset by a $0.03 impact from tax. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25%, which was higher than the 18% rate we had last year. Detailed drivers of our fourth quarter PTC performance by SBU are in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 15, and our full year EPS of $1.30 per share. Compared to 2013, we benefited from $0.07 of better operating performance at our U.S. SBU and our utilities in Brazil, plus a smaller impact from hydro; $0.03 from several other items, including recognition of higher interest income on receivables in Argentina in 2013; and $0.11 from capital allocation and lower corporate charges. These benefits were offset by $0.06 from outages in the first 9 months and a $0.14 impact from a higher adjusted effective tax rate of 30% versus 21% in '13. We ended up at $1.30, which was at the low end of our original guidance range.
Turning to Slide 16. Our results by SBU were in line with the adjusted PTC modeling ranges we provided in November. The main driver that helped us come in at the high end of our revised EPS range was a 30% tax rate, which was slightly below what we were expecting, and equates to a couple cents of earnings.
Now to Slide 17. Poor hydrology in Latin America continued to be a headwind in 2014, with a $0.10 impact to our adjusted EPS versus normal conditions. Although this was a meaningful impact, it was about 25% lower than what we experienced in 2013 due to favorable hydro conditions in Colombia and our proactive steps in Panama.
Now going to hydrology by market, beginning with Colombia. In 2014, Chivor had favorable inflow conditions relative to the rest of the country, which allowed us to sell excess power into the spot market at attractive prices, adding $0.03. Currently, inflows at Chivor are 92% of average. And we're expecting a normal year in 2015. In Panama, we had a $0.06 shortfall in '14, most of which was during the first 9 months, as inflows improved in the fourth quarter. Inflows are now close to 100% of long-term average and power prices are about $100 a megawatt hour, down from well over $200 per megawatt hour from much of last year. 
Our downside exposure continues to decrease for 2 main reasons. First, the government compensation agreement we negotiated last year to offset this exposure; and secondly, lower oil prices helped to reduce our earnings volatility, as spot prices during dry conditions are set by oil-fired generation. In 2014, we were purchasing in the spot market. If oil prices were at today's level last year, the hydro impact would've been about $0.03 rather than the $0.06 we actually experienced. I'll also note, as Andres mentioned, we've brought an oil-fired barge to Panama, improving our bottom line.
Finally in Brazil, we had a $0.07 impact from poor hydrology in 2014. Tietê experienced a 10% reduction in generation, or GSF. The impact was magnified by the fact that the average spot price was just under BRL 700 per megawatt hour in 2014, significantly greater than the BRL 200 level of our offtake contract.
Currently, reservoir levels are about 23%. While we've seen some recent improvement, it's difficult to predict how much they'll recover by the end of the rainy season in April. For now, we're factoring in about a $0.05 impact into our 2015 guidance due to an estimated 15% to 17% reduction in generation for the year. The impact of a shortfall will be less than last year as spot prices are now capped at BRL 388 per megawatt hour compared to the cap last year, which was BRL 823.
We're not incorporating rationing into our 2015 guidance at this time. We'll provide an update on our next earnings call in May, when we'll have more clarity. Although it's very premature, we estimate a rationing scenario could result in an additional $0.05 impact, above the $0.05 we already have incorporated into our guidance.
Now to cash flow, beginning on Slide 18. We generated $287 million of proportional free cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year amount to $891 million versus $1.27 billion in 2013. Although near the bottom end of our revised guidance, it's roughly $250 million less than our original guidance. We're obviously disappointed with this result. This decline was largely driven by 3 unanticipated factors: first, an increase of a little more than $100 million in receivables at our Maritza Plant in Bulgaria; second, higher receivables at Sul, our utility in Brazil, due to higher energy purchases; and finally, a lag in VAT, or value-added taxes, related to our construction projects in Chile. We expect improvement in these factors this year.
Now to Slide 19, and our capital allocation in 2014. Starting on the left, we generated roughly $1.9 billion of discretionary cash, including $1.2 billion from announced asset sales. We're pleased that despite our shortfall in proportional free cash flow, we generated $523 million in parent free cash flow, above the $500 million midpoint of our expectations.
Turning to the right-hand side of the slide, we allocated 76% of this cash to parent debt and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Meeting our parent free cash flow expectation is especially important as it is the foundation of our dividend and dividend growth. As we've demonstrated through the recent doubling of our dividend, we continue to be comfortable that we'll generate about $525 million in parent free cash flow in '15 and growth of 10% to 15% annually.
Turning to Slide 20, and our capital allocation plan for 2015. With $460 million in announced asset sale proceeds, our total discretionary cash is expected to be about $1.5 billion in 2015. We'll invest about $300 million to fund equity commitments in projects currently under construction, the largest of which is at IPALCO, where we have a $1.4 billion investment program under way to increase the rate base by 70% from 2013 to 2017.
After taking into account our growth investments as well as expected debt prepayments of $200 million, we're projecting about $600 million of remaining cash available for allocation. We currently have a $400 million authorization for share repurchases, of which we expect to utilize the majority during 2015. 
Before turning to our guidance, I'd like to take a moment to address our foreign currency and commodity exposures and our hedging practices, on Slide 21. We have long-term protections built into our business model to manage our exposure to FX and commodity price changes. For example, 82% of our businesses are either utilities or generation businesses with an average contract term of 7 years. This insulates the majority of our earnings from commodity price volatility. Having said that, some of our businesses do have commodity exposure as they operate in markets where power prices are oil- or natural-gas-driven. As shown in our appendix, every 10% move in oil is roughly a $0.025 EPS impact on an op [ph] basis, primarily from the Dominican Republic and, to a lesser extent, Panama, where we have a modest amount of excess power to sell into the spot market. On the plus side, in Panama, as I just mentioned, lower oil prices reduce our exposure to poor hydrology. 
In terms of gas, our largest exposure is at our DPL merchant business, where our 3,000-megawatt coal-fired fleet is negatively impacted by declining gas prices. However, although, gas has fallen by 20%, dark spreads held up at around the $12 range. The impact on our EPS has been less than our disclosed sensitivities, which assumed a constant market heat rate. 
Regarding currencies, as you can see on the right-hand side, we're largely protected from foreign currency changes, given that more than 2/3 of our PTC is effectively U.S.-dollar denominated. The remaining 1/3 is exposed to a handful of foreign currencies, mainly the Brazilian real, the euro and the Colombian peso. For the exposed portion, we mitigate the risk on a 12-month rolling basis through shorter-term FX hedging programs or currency-linked escalation clauses in our shorter-term contracts.
Now I'll walk through our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance on Slide 22. The updated forward curve on commodities and currencies used in sensitivities we provided in our last earnings deck, would suggest a $0.10 negative impact to 2015. However, as a result of additional FX hedges, fuel and power contracts, we have been able to trim the overall impact from currencies and commodities on our 2015 EPS by $0.04. We're also incorporating a $0.05 impact from Brazil hydrology, as I discussed earlier. 
Finally, we've also factored in a modest dilution of $0.03 from other factors, including PPA negotiations at Maritza. We're offsetting these impacts through the following actions: $0.04 from cost savings initiatives across our portfolio and revenue improvements, including a modest uplift from Mong Duong, where a new accounting standard better aligns earnings with cash on an ongoing basis; $0.02 from accelerated capital allocation; and $0.03 from various tax opportunities. Net-net, we've offset $0.13 of the $0.18 of headwinds, and therefore revised our guidance downward by $0.05 to a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share.
Turning to our longer-term adjusted EPS expectations, on Slide 23. We continue to expect modest to flat growth in 2016, and 6% to 8% growth in 2017 and '18, more weighted towards 2018, consistent with our prior expectation but off a lower 2015 base. Our projects under construction will drive our earnings growth, while many of the other actions we're implementing in 2015 will continue to benefit us in '16 and beyond, largely offsetting what appears at this time to be a negative impact from currency and commodity forward curves as well as the impact of potential modifications of the Maritza PPA. 
Shifting to cash flow guidance on Slide 24. We are reaffirming our 2015 proportional free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.35 billion. This implies an increase of roughly $275 million over 2014, which is driven by recovery of working capital and receivables along with cash flow from new businesses, including Mong Duong, which comes online this year.
In Brazil, we're encouraged that recent moves by the regulator will accelerate the collection of purchased power costs by the distribution companies. 
On Slide 25, we continue to expect 10% to 15% average annual growth in proportional free cash flow driven by contributions from projects currently under construction as well as the fact that maintenance CapEx is less than depreciation from new projects. In 2014 and '15, depreciation averages about $350 million greater than maintenance and environmental CapEx. We expect this differential to widen to $600 million by 2017, which explains much of why our cash flow is growing at a greater rate than earnings. We believe cash flow is a key value driver, with strong double-digit growth in both proportional and parent free cash flow over the longer term. We'll continue to show the value of our cash flow through disciplined capital allocation that maximizes risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it back to Andres."

We did notice that it seemed like PUCO was receptive to the concept of PPAs, but didn't believe that specific example warranted the PPO, or the merits were not significant or sufficiently demonstrated. So we continue to monitor the situation. We do think -- kind of stepping back on, a bigger picture, we do think capacity will be worth more and that probably was a significant input into us deciding last summer to retain the generation. We are seeing a lot of that, to be honest, through PJM premium capacity product. That looks like it's on track, so we expect to get more value for our capacity in that fashion. The last thing I'd say, it's a little harder for us. All of our plants are, let's say, positive on a to-go cost. We don't have any plants that are cash flow-negative, as we see it. So it's a little harder for us to make the case that, perhaps, some other plants in Ohio might -- the majority of our plants.

I think as you know, we sold most of our position in utility-scale solar in our JV with Riverstone. We've kept some assets. We continue to believe that we should have the capability of introducing solar onto our platforms where it makes economic sense. So right now, we're building 20 megawatts of solar in Chile. So one market that's particularly interesting is Chile, where you have some of the best solar irradiation in the world, and you have very low rainfall in the north, so it's an optimal place for solar. And also energy prices, because they have limited hydro, are quite high. So that combination of factors makes it an attractive market. We have other markets, such as the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, where, again, you have high solar irradiation and you have high energy prices. So we feel that this could be a nice addition to our portfolio to address the needs of large customers, especially commercial and industrial. We also think that this is -- distributed solar is something which is affecting the industry, and we want to have our most current information, understand what's happening, understand developments to be able to react faster. So we think that we have a unique footprint in terms of places where you have the right combinations of natural factors and of market factors, and with this know-how, we're optimistic we will make a good business. Now given AES's size and given that we have a modest investment, at this point, it will take some time to grow out. And lastly, as you know, we are the world leaders in the use of lithium-ion batteries. We recently won in the Southern California Edison bid. We got 100 megawatts of more, additional capacity and we're using it really to -- almost like a peaking plant, I would say. So having distributed solar and having the batteries together puts us in a very good position to react to changes in the marketplace with the growth of renewables. So again, it's part of our having a complete product offering. But again, we're starting off modest and like in batteries, we intend to make money from it."

Of course, what would be more efficient for us is to receive capacity payments and be able to run it more. We have, of course, a gas pipeline. It comes through Argentina. So the issue really has been to deliver LNG into Argentina and get an equivalent amount of gas in Brazil at Uruguaiana. And it really depends on what's the delivered price to the plant, so we've been having relatively high prices of delivered gas to Uruguaiana. We're working on mechanisms using the existing infrastructure to get lower-priced gas. But what is also very important is that we have been promoting discussions between the governments. So we had an interconnection line from Chile -- from Argentina to Chile, from TermoAndes into Chile. Given the situation of increased capacity in Northern Chile, we have reversed that transmission line so that we can now export energy from Chile into Argentina. And there exists the possibility, and that we're exploring, where we would actually pass energy from Chile to Argentina and from Argentina into Brazil. And it would be a win-win for all, and we have had considerable government receptivity. It's just that we've gotten the permission for the first step, we'll be looking to the second step. But I think what's important, broadly, is that we're looking at ways to decrease our hydro exposure. And even if rains come back to normal, we don't want to be as susceptible to a drought. Admittedly, this is the worst drought in 100 years but, nonetheless, we want to decrease our portfolio sensitivity to it, so we're looking at these ideas."

Of course, we're in the midst of conversations with the government. For us, the real key point is, one, a prompt payment of the 100% of the outstanding receivables; and the second is really solving the source of the problem, which is the financial situation of NEK, the offtaker. So by really increasing the revenues to NEK, especially on the passing of the C02 taxes, which went to the government. The government allocated a portion of that to NEK. Now they'll go directly to NEK. And second, rationalizing the energy that NEK buys because we are the -- among the thermal plants, one of the few EU 16-compliant plants. So if they really enforced their rules, this will put -- make our plant much more important. And so I think it's -- the exchange, of course, would be that they want a decrease in our energy prices today and for a number of years and, in exchange, we have to look at the overall health of the business. And so we'll be looking at those factors, taking them into consideration. But I think the most important is that we should end up with a project that we don't have to be talking about receivables next year at this time, and that's really our primary interest in this. And the government, quite frankly, doesn't want to be talking about this either. But I think that with the cancellation of the South Stream project of gas from Russia, this plant becomes absolutely vital for Bulgaria. So I feel very confident that we will come to a resolution."

Then Tom will discuss our 2014 results and 2015 guidance and longer-term expectations in detail.
Turning to Slide 4. During 2014, we made significant progress on our strategy and continued to position our company for the future. During this year, we brought in financial partners to invest $1.9 billion in our subsidiaries; announced or closed 10 transactions for $1.8 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales; broke new ground on 6 new platform expansion projects, totaling 2,200 megawatts and won long-term contracts to build 1,400 megawatts of capacity in California. 
We allocated $600 million to reduce parent debt and improve our credit profile, returned $450 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and announced a doubling of our dividend, with an intended growth rate of 10%.
Turning to Slide 5. Unfortunately, our financial results for the year were affected by $0.10 of adverse hydrology in Panama and Brazil. Still, we earned an adjusted EPS of $1.30, which was at the lower end of our original guidance range of $1.30 to $1.40, and slightly better than our expectations at the end of our third quarter call in November. We are disappointed with our proportional free cash flow of $891 million. Although proportional free cash flow came in at the low end of our revised guidance, it is 20% lower than our original guidance, primarily driven by the higher working capital requirements in Brazil and Chile as well as increased receivables in Bulgaria. All of which, we expect to reverse in 2015.
Now turning to Slide 6. I would like to outline several factors affecting our 2015 outlook. Importantly, we have taken a number of steps to mitigate their impacts. Since our last call, we've seen international macroeconomic factors move against us. Currency and commodity forwards have declined significantly. Although we are largely contracted and the majority of our earnings are U.S. dollar-linked, this downward shift in forward curves has affected some of our businesses and, consequently, our earnings expectations for 2015 and beyond. We are also seeing continuing poor hydro conditions in Brazil, especially in the state of São Paulo, where our hydros are located, rather than a return to normal hydrology, as we had previously assumed. 
We've been taking actions to lower our sensitivity to hydrology by adopting more optimal hedging strategies in Panama and Brazil. In Panama, we are bringing in a 72-megawatt oil-fired barge. In Brazil, we are working on creative solutions to supply additional energy, such as pursuing opportunities to restart long-term operations at our 640-megawatt Uruguaiana CCGT plant, which has not operated continually for many years due to lack of fuel. We're also exploring options to export energy from Chile and Argentina to the Brazilian grid. In parallel, we are proactively hedging our FX exposure in Brazil, Colombia and Europe, where since our last call, we have entered into additional hedges to shield 40% of our exposed earnings from further volatility.
In our 2015 guidance, we're also assuming that ongoing negotiations in Bulgaria will have some earnings impact on our Maritza business. The Energy Minister of Bulgaria recently issued a communiqué in which he committed to paying Maritza's outstanding receivables of approximately $260 million and announced ongoing discussions to reduce the contract price. Additionally, the government is taking steps to improve the financial position of our offtaker, NEK, by reducing the volume of expensive energy that NEK is purchasing from other market participants and compensating NEK through environmental taxes. The Bulgarian government has targeted closing this negotiation and addressing NEK's financial situation in the first half of this year. Although negotiations have not been finalized, we're incorporating modest earnings dilution in our future expectations, which we believe is sufficient to accommodate the outcome of the discussions currently under way.
The combined earnings impact of the macroeconomic factors and hydrology in Brazil as well as the potential outcome of the PPA negotiations at Maritza is approximately $0.18. Through proactive steps, including additional hedges, revenue improvement and cost savings, we expect to offset $0.13 of the total and, therefore, are reducing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a revised range of $1.25 to $1.35.
Notwithstanding the impact on our earnings from these factors, we are also reaffirming our 2015 proportional free cash flow range of $1,000,000,000 to $1,035,000,000 (sic) [$1,350,000,000], which is 30% higher than our 2014 results. This growth is largely driven by the recovery of working capital in Brazil and Chile as well as a reduction in accounts receivable in Bulgaria and the contributions from new plants coming online this year, such as the 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam and the 72-megawatt oil-fired barge in Panama.
Turning to Slide 7. I will discuss our continued progress on our strategic objectives, which we laid out in 2011, including reducing complexity, performance excellence, expanding access to capital and leveraging our platforms. 
First, reducing complexity. Since 2011, we have reduced the number of countries where we operate, from 28 down to 18, and raised $3 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales. In 2014 alone, we closed 10 transactions, totaling $1.8 billion in equity proceeds to AES. In addition to simplifying our portfolio, we recently exited riskier markets, such as Ukraine, Nigeria and Cameroon in a timely manner and at attractive valuations.
As a result of our efforts, 80% of our 2014 earnings and proportional free cash flow was generated in 10 countries in the Americas. Regarding performance excellence, we believe that we are now the low-cost manager of a large portfolio of international energy assets. 
As you can see on Slide 8, we have reduced our global G&A by about 1/3 or $200 million, achieving the goal we established in 2011, 1 year early. Going forward, we are focusing on additional cost savings initiatives, including saving $100 million in O&M by 2018.
Turning to Slide 9. Through financial partnerships, we are expanding our access to capital and fine-tuning our portfolio's global macroeconomic exposures and commodity risks. In most cases, we earn management, development, a promote or upfront fees. Partial sell-downs of our assets also served to highlight the value of the business in our portfolio. In total, we have raised $2.5 billion in proceeds to AES through financial partnerships. In 2014, we brought in partners at 4 of our businesses, including CDPQ, a long-term institutional investor headquartered in Québec, Canada, which recently invested in IPALCO in Indiana. We look forward to working with CDPQ on additional partnering opportunities in the U.S. and Latin America.
Turning to leveraging our platforms on Slide 10. We are exclusively focusing our growth on classroom expansions, including adjacencies such as energy storage and desalinization. Adjacencies are smaller investment opportunities that are replicable across our portfolio and have higher returns, with a much shorter construction period. To that end, we recently made a $25 million investment to acquire Main Street Power, a developer of distributed solar. Although modest in size, this business will provide us with the know-how to implement distributed solar generation in some of our international markets, where power prices are higher and solar resource is greater. We will focus on commercial and industrial customers.
We currently have a total of 1,141 megawatts (sic) [7,141 megawatts] under construction, the most in AES's 34-year history. These projects represent $9 billion in total capital expenditures, the vast majority of which is being funded by a combination of nonrecourse debt and partner equity. More importantly, our required equity for these projects is $1.5 billion, of which we've already funded 70%. In terms of where these projects are located, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, 40% of the capacity under construction is in the U.S. The 1,400 [ph] megawatts of Southland contracts we recently won are not yet included in these numbers since we have not yet broken ground. If they were, the U.S. would represent 50% of the new capacity. We're earning very attractive risk-adjusted returns on these projects. For competitive reasons, we cannot provide details on a project-by-project basis. However, we will provide some general guidelines. 
For international projects, we're seeing IRRs from the midteens to more than 20%, with project-specific returns varying, reflecting project and country risk premiums. For U.S. projects, IRRs are in the low double digits. Including all of our projects under construction, the average IRR is around 14% and the ROE is greater than 15%. We would expect to earn at least as much from new projects in our development pipeline.
Now turning to Slide 11. I would emphasize that as we have done in the past, we will complete all new projects with share buybacks and, furthermore, we will only invest in a new project if it meets the following criteria. First, it enhances the value of an existing business, such as the MATS CapEx program at IPL in Indiana or the oil-fired barge in Panama. Second, it offers compelling risk-adjusted returns while minimizing AES Corp. equity by using project-level cash or local leverage capacity. Examples include closing the cycle at our DPP plant in the Dominican Republic and energy storage. And finally, for any large project, we would expect to bring in a partner to maximize our returns and allow us to fine tune our total exposure in the project.
The bottom line is that our successful execution on the 4 pillars of our strategy that I just discussed have positioned us to deliver average annual cash flow growth of 10% to 15% over the next 4 years, as our construction projects come online. We expect to grow our dividend 10% per year from today's level as cash flow increases. Given all that, we believe that our current share price does not reflect the progress we have made in our company and portfolio or the value from our largely funded construction program. Therefore, we have taken advantage of low share prices by buying back $150 million of our shares since our third quarter call. And today, we have announced that our board has authorized an additional $400 million for share repurchases, the majority of which we expect to utilize in 2015.
Finally, as you can see on Slide 12, our overall capital allocation over the last 3 years has been very shareholder-focused. In fact, we have allocated 78% of our discretionary cash to parent debt prepayments and returning cash to shareholders. Specifically, we've allocated $1.6 billion to decrease our parent debt by 20% and improve our financial flexibility. We have also reduced our share count by 10%, buying back 78 million shares at an average price of $12.69. And with the recent doubling of our dividend, we're now paying $0.10 per share per quarter and we expect to grow the dividend 10% annually.
We recognize that 2015 will be a challenging year due to negative macroeconomic factors in international markets and poor hydrology in Brazil. Nonetheless, we will continue to execute on our strategy to create shareholder value by pulling the levers we have outlined today.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom, who will provide greater detail on our 2014 results and 2015 forecast."
35312,282842060,772168,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2015",2015-02-26,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results, including: adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; and our cash flow. Then I'll discuss our 2014 and '",2029,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year results, including: adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; and our cash flow. Then I'll discuss our 2014 and '15 capital allocation plans, 2015 guidance and our longer-term expectations.
As Andres has just discussed, we achieved a number of our objectives in 2014, despite the impacts from adverse hydrology and other factors. From an EPS perspective, we were able to offset these issues through operational improvements, accelerated cost savings and our capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases and debt prepayments. Admittedly, our 2014 proportional free cash flow was disappointing due to higher working capital requirements and increased receivables.
Turning to Slide 14. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.41 compared to $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Overall, our businesses contributed $0.08, driven by higher earnings from our U.S., Brazil and Andes SBUs. We also benefited from a 3% reduction in share count, lower parent interest expense and improved corporate charges, which contributed $0.07. These benefits were offset by a $0.03 impact from tax. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25%, which was higher than the 18% rate we had last year. Detailed drivers of our fourth quarter PTC performance by SBU are in the appendix.
Moving to Slide 15, and our full year EPS of $1.30 per share. Compared to 2013, we benefited from $0.07 of better operating performance at our U.S. SBU and our utilities in Brazil, plus a smaller impact from hydro; $0.03 from several other items, including recognition of higher interest income on receivables in Argentina in 2013; and $0.11 from capital allocation and lower corporate charges. These benefits were offset by $0.06 from outages in the first 9 months and a $0.14 impact from a higher adjusted effective tax rate of 30% versus 21% in '13. We ended up at $1.30, which was at the low end of our original guidance range.
Turning to Slide 16. Our results by SBU were in line with the adjusted PTC modeling ranges we provided in November. The main driver that helped us come in at the high end of our revised EPS range was a 30% tax rate, which was slightly below what we were expecting, and equates to a couple cents of earnings.
Now to Slide 17. Poor hydrology in Latin America continued to be a headwind in 2014, with a $0.10 impact to our adjusted EPS versus normal conditions. Although this was a meaningful impact, it was about 25% lower than what we experienced in 2013 due to favorable hydro conditions in Colombia and our proactive steps in Panama.
Now going to hydrology by market, beginning with Colombia. In 2014, Chivor had favorable inflow conditions relative to the rest of the country, which allowed us to sell excess power into the spot market at attractive prices, adding $0.03. Currently, inflows at Chivor are 92% of average. And we're expecting a normal year in 2015. In Panama, we had a $0.06 shortfall in '14, most of which was during the first 9 months, as inflows improved in the fourth quarter. Inflows are now close to 100% of long-term average and power prices are about $100 a megawatt hour, down from well over $200 per megawatt hour from much of last year. 
Our downside exposure continues to decrease for 2 main reasons. First, the government compensation agreement we negotiated last year to offset this exposure; and secondly, lower oil prices helped to reduce our earnings volatility, as spot prices during dry conditions are set by oil-fired generation. In 2014, we were purchasing in the spot market. If oil prices were at today's level last year, the hydro impact would've been about $0.03 rather than the $0.06 we actually experienced. I'll also note, as Andres mentioned, we've brought an oil-fired barge to Panama, improving our bottom line.
Finally in Brazil, we had a $0.07 impact from poor hydrology in 2014. Tietê experienced a 10% reduction in generation, or GSF. The impact was magnified by the fact that the average spot price was just under BRL 700 per megawatt hour in 2014, significantly greater than the BRL 200 level of our offtake contract.
Currently, reservoir levels are about 23%. While we've seen some recent improvement, it's difficult to predict how much they'll recover by the end of the rainy season in April. For now, we're factoring in about a $0.05 impact into our 2015 guidance due to an estimated 15% to 17% reduction in generation for the year. The impact of a shortfall will be less than last year as spot prices are now capped at BRL 388 per megawatt hour compared to the cap last year which was BRL 823.
We're not incorporating rationing into our 2015 guidance at this time. We'll provide an update on our next earnings call in May, when we'll have more clarity. Although it's very premature, we estimate a rationing scenario could result in an additional $0.05 impact, above the $0.05 we already have incorporated into our guidance.
Now to cash flow, beginning on Slide 18. We generated $287 million of proportional free cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year amount to $891 million versus $1.27 billion in 2013. Although near the bottom end of our revised guidance, it's roughly $250 million less than our original guidance. We're obviously disappointed with this result. This decline was largely driven by 3 unanticipated factors: first, an increase of a little more than $100 million in receivables at our Maritza Plant in Bulgaria; second, higher receivables at Sul, our utility in Brazil, due to higher energy purchases; and finally, a lag in VAT, or value-added taxes, related to our construction projects in Chile. We expect improvement in these factors this year.
Now to Slide 19, and our capital allocation in 2014. Starting on the left, we generated roughly $1.9 billion of discretionary cash, including $1.2 billion from announced asset sales. We're pleased that despite our shortfall in proportional free cash flow, we generated $523 million in parent free cash flow, above the $500 million midpoint of our expectations.
Turning to the right-hand side of the slide, we allocated 76% of this cash to parent debt and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Meeting our parent free cash flow expectation is especially important as it is the foundation of our dividend and dividend growth. As we've demonstrated through the recent doubling of our dividend, we continue to be comfortable that we'll generate about $525 million in parent free cash flow in '15 and growth of 10% to 15% annually.
Turning to Slide 20, and our capital allocation plan for 2015. With $460 million in announced asset sale proceeds, our total discretionary cash is expected to be about $1.5 billion in 2015. We'll invest about $300 million to fund equity commitments in projects currently under construction, the largest of which is at IPALCO, where we have a $1.4 billion investment program under way to increase the rate base by 70% from 2013 to 2017.
After taking into account our growth investments as well as expected debt prepayments of $200 million, we're projecting about $600 million of remaining cash available for allocation. We currently have a $400 million authorization for share repurchases, of which we expect to utilize the majority during 2015. 
Before turning to our guidance, I'd like to take a moment to address our foreign currency and commodity exposures and our hedging practices, on Slide 21. We have long-term protections built into our business model to manage our exposure to FX and commodity price changes. For example, 82% of our businesses are either utilities or generation businesses with an average contract term of 7 years. This insulates the majority of our earnings from commodity price volatility. Having said that, some of our businesses do have commodity exposure as they operate in markets where power prices are oil- or natural-gas-driven. As shown in our appendix, every 10% move in oil is roughly a $0.025 EPS impact on an op [ph] basis, primarily from the Dominican Republic and, to a lesser extent, Panama, where we have a modest amount of excess power to sell into the spot market. On the plus side, in Panama, as I just mentioned, lower oil prices reduce our exposure to poor hydrology. 
In terms of gas, our largest exposure is at our DPL merchant business, where our 3,000-megawatt coal-fired fleet is negatively impacted by declining gas prices. However, although, gas has fallen by 20%, dark spreads held up at around the $12 range. The impact on our EPS has been less than our disclosed sensitivities, which assumed a constant market heat rate. 
Regarding currencies, as you can see on the right-hand side, we're largely protected from foreign currency changes, given that more than 2/3 of our PTC is effectively U.S.-dollar denominated. The remaining 1/3 is exposed to a handful of foreign currencies, mainly the Brazilian real, the euro and the Colombian peso. For the exposed portion, we mitigate the risk on a 12-month rolling basis through shorter-term FX hedging programs or currency-linked escalation clauses in our shorter-term contracts.
Now I'll walk through our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance on Slide 22. The updated forward curve on commodities and currencies used in sensitivities we provided in our last earnings deck, would suggest a $0.10 negative impact to 2015. However, as a result of additional FX hedges, fuel and power contracts, we have been able to trim the overall impact from currencies and commodities on our 2015 EPS by $0.04. We're also incorporating a $0.05 impact from Brazil hydrology, as I discussed earlier. 
Finally, we've also factored in a modest dilution of $0.03 from other factors, including PPA negotiations at Maritza. We're offsetting these impacts through the following actions: $0.04 from cost savings initiatives across our portfolio and revenue improvements, including a modest uplift from Mong Duong, where a new accounting standard better aligns earnings with cash on an ongoing basis; $0.02 from accelerated capital allocation; and $0.03 from various tax opportunities. Net-net, we've offset $0.13 of the $0.18 of headwinds, and therefore revised our guidance downward by $0.05 to a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share.
Turning to our longer-term adjusted EPS expectations, on Slide 23. We continue to expect modest to flat growth in 2016, and 6% to 8% growth in 2017 and '18, more weighted towards 2018, consistent with our prior expectation but off a lower 2015 base. Our projects under construction will drive our earnings growth, while many of the other actions we're implementing in 2015 will continue to benefit us in '16 and beyond, largely offsetting what appears at this time to be a negative impact from currency and commodity forward curves as well as the impact of potential modifications of the Maritza PPA. 
Shifting to cash flow guidance on Slide 24. We are reaffirming our 2015 proportional free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.35 billion. This implies an increase of roughly $275 million over 2014, which is driven by recovery of working capital and receivables along with cash flow from new businesses, including Mong Duong, which comes online this year.
In Brazil, we're encouraged that recent moves by the regulator will accelerate the collection of purchased power costs by the distribution companies. 
On Slide 25, we continue to expect 10% to 15% average annual growth in proportional free cash flow driven by contributions from projects currently under construction as well as the fact that maintenance CapEx is less than depreciation from new projects. In 2014 and '15, depreciation averages about $350 million greater than maintenance and environmental CapEx. We expect this differential to widen to $600 million by 2017, which explains much of why our cash flow is growing at a greater rate than earnings. We believe cash flow is a key value driver, with strong double-digit growth in both proportional and parent free cash flow over the longer term. We'll continue to show the value of our cash flow through disciplined capital allocation that maximizes risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it back to Andres."

I mean, one thing we're sure of is that they're going to move in the future."

We did notice that it seemed like PUCO was receptive to the concept of PPAs, but didn't believe that specific example warranted the PPO, or the merits were not significant or sufficiently demonstrated. So we continue to monitor the situation. We do think -- kind of stepping back on, a bigger picture, we do think capacity will be worth more and that probably was a significant input into us deciding last summer to retain the generation. We are seeing a lot of that, to be honest, through PJM premium capacity product. That looks like it's on track, so we expect to get more value for our capacity in that fashion. The last thing I'd say, it's a little harder for us. All of our plants are, let's say, positive on a to-go cost. We don't have any plants that are cash flow-negative, as we see it. So it's a little harder for us to make the case that, perhaps, some other plants in Ohio might -- the majority of our plants.

I think as you know, we sold most of our position in utility-scale solar in our JV with Riverstone. We've kept some assets. We continue to believe that we should have the capability of introducing solar onto our platforms where it makes economic sense. So right now, we're building 20 megawatts of solar in Chile. So one market that's particularly interesting is Chile, where you have some of the best solar irradiation in the world, and you have very low rainfall in the north, so it's an optimal place for solar. And also energy prices, because they have limited hydro, are quite high. So that combination of factors makes it an attractive market. We have other markets, such as the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, where, again, you have high solar irradiation and you have high energy prices. So we feel that this could be a nice addition to our portfolio to address the needs of large customers, especially commercial and industrial. We also think that this is -- distributed solar is something which is affecting the industry, and we want to have our most current information, understand what's happening, understand developments to be able to react faster. So we think that we have a unique footprint in terms of places where you have the right combinations of natural factors and of market factors, and with this know-how, we're optimistic we will make a good business. Now given AES's size and given that we have a modest investment, at this point, it will take some time to grow out. And lastly, as you know, we are the world leaders in the use of lithium-ion batteries. We recently won in the Southern California Edison bid. We got 100 megawatts of more, additional capacity and we're using it really to -- almost like a peaking plant, I would say. So having distributed solar and having the batteries together puts us in a very good position to react to changes in the marketplace with the growth of renewables. So again, it's part of our having a complete product offering. But again, we're starting off modest and like in batteries, we intend to make money from it."

Of course, what would be more efficient for us is to receive capacity payments and be able to run it more. We have, of course, a gas pipeline. It comes through Argentina. So the issue really has been to deliver LNG into Argentina and get an equivalent amount of gas in Brazil at Uruguaiana. And it really depends on what's the delivered price to the plant, so we've been having relatively high prices of delivered gas to Uruguaiana. We're working on mechanisms using the existing infrastructure to get lower-priced gas. But what is also very important is that we have been promoting discussions between the governments. So we had an interconnection line from Chile -- from Argentina to Chile, from TermoAndes into Chile. Given the situation of increased capacity in Northern Chile, we have reversed that transmission line so that we can now export energy from Chile into Argentina. And there exists the possibility, and that we're exploring, where we would actually pass energy from Chile to Argentina and from Argentina into Brazil. And it would be a win-win for all, and we have had considerable government receptivity. It's just that we've gotten the permission for the first step, we'll be looking to the second step. But I think what's important, broadly, is that we're looking at ways to decrease our hydro exposure. And even if rains come back to normal, we don't want to be as susceptible to a drought. Admittedly, this is the worst drought in 100 years but, nonetheless, we want to decrease our portfolio sensitivity to it, so we're looking at these ideas."

So I still think it's more likely that we won't have rationing than we will have rationing. But it's a higher percentage than it was, say, last year. It might be 40-60 or something like this. We don't know the exact numbers. But they are doing, taking the right steps to ensure liquidity at the Discos, and also to run the thermals, and they are in discussions with us.

Since our previous quarterly call, less than 3 m",1691,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings call. I am pleased to report that with our first quarter results, we are reaffirming our 2016 [ph] guidance for all metrics. Since our previous quarterly call, less than 3 months ago, we have achieved several significant milestones on our strategic objectives and our priorities for 2015. We continued to leverage our platforms. Our $9 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next 4 years. This quarter, we commissioned the largest power plant that AES ever constructed. We also signed agreements for 2 additional asset sales totaling $105 million in equity proceeds and invested $345 million to prepay and refinance debt. This year, we have also repurchased $42 million of our shares and we made substantial progress in addressing short-term issues affecting our businesses in Bulgaria and India. I will discuss some of these achievements in detail, but first I'd like to provide the highlights of our financial results. 
In the first quarter, we generated proportional free cash flow of $265 million, double our results of a year ago due to the recovery of working capital at a couple of significant businesses. We earn $0.25 of adjusted earnings per share, which was a $0.01 increase from our first quarter of 2014. We improved operating performance at our U.S. and Andes strategic business units, although we continued to experience headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil and unfavorable foreign exchange in Latin America and Europe. 
During the quarter, our earnings benefited from our previous capital allocation decisions to pay down debt and buy back our shares. As we have discussed in the past, we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of adverse hydrology in Latin America and this year, that risk is mostly limited to Brazil. We also have a rolling 12-month hedging strategy to help mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Brazilian real, the Colombian peso and the euro. Although these currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, energy demand has remained robust at 3% to 10% on our markets, except in the U.S. where we are experiencing flat demand and in Brazil where demand growth is slightly negative. 
Now I'll discuss our significant accomplishments since our last call, starting with our progress in resolving a couple of business specific issues beginning on Slide 4. In Bulgaria, with the Maritza plant sole customer, the National Electricity Company or NEK had fallen significant behind on its payments, we're now seeing positive momentum. Last month, Maritza an MOU with NEK to receive full amendment of all arrears, which as of March 30 were $236 million. In exchange for a decrease in the capacity price of a long-term PPA. We expect to sign a binding agreement by the third quarter of this year. The 14% capacity price reduction is already reflected in our 2015 guidance as well as our longer-term expectations. This agreement is part of a broad set of initiatives, the government of Bulgaria is taking to help restore NEK's financial position. One of these initiatives is the introduction of energy sector reforms to reduce the volume of energy that NEK purchases from code generators and compensating NEK through existing environmental taxes. Already Maritza's collections during the first 4 months of the year have improved by 40% and our receivable balance has remained flat as of the end of December. 
Turning now to our 1,320-megawatt OPGC 2 project under construction in India on Slide 5. As you may know late last year, the Supreme Court of India overturned the allocation of 214 coal plants including those for OPGC 2. I am pleased to report that the project through a new joint venture between OPGC and the government of, has resecured the rights to the same coal blocks, which can support 2,640 megawatts of new capacity. Construction on OPGC 2 is on schedule with this plant expected to come online in 2018.
Now turning to Slide 6, I'll discuss our construction program and development pipeline in more detail. Our construction program is the most significant driver of our 10% to 15% average annual growth and free cash flow over the next few years. This strong growth is the foundation for our commitment to 10% annual dividend growth, as well as other capital allocation decisions. From 2015 through 2018, we expect to commission 7,131 megawatts of new capacity, which is a high multiple of the roughly 600-megawatt we bought online in the 3 previous years from 2012 to 2014. In fact, already this year, we brought online 1,312 megawatts, which is 87% of the capacity we expect to commission this year. 
Moving onto Slide 7, our remaining 5,118 megawatts under construction are progressing well and remain on time and on budget. As a reminder, the total CapEx for our projects currently under construction is $7 billion, but AES' equity commitment is only $1.3 billion, of which all but $400 million has already been funded. As you can see, roughly 80% of this new capacity is in the Americas. We expect a return on equity from these projects of more than 15%. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'm very happy to report that we have achieved commercial operation on our 1,240 megawatts Mong Duong project in Vietnam, 6 months early. Additionally the project reached 18 million man-hours without a lost time incident. This project provides us with a solid platform from which to grow our presence in Vietnam where we see a number of future platform expansion opportunities. 
Moving to Slide 9, to help mitigate our hydrology risk in Panama, we recently inaugurated a 72 megawatts thermal power barge. The plants output is contracted under a 5-year PPA. We're also looking at similar opportunities in other countries in Latin America to decrease our exposure to fluctuations in hydrology. 
Finally, looking at our growth opportunities beyond the projects currently under construction beginning on Slide 10. We see compelling platform expansion opportunities in a number of growing markets such as Chile, Mexico, Panama and the Philippines. In more mature markets like California and the United Kingdom, we see opportunities to replace older, less efficient or noncomplying capacity. Generally, we expect our future project mix to be heavily weighted towards natural gas, renewables and energy storage as we seek to match the right offering on the future needs of each market. 
As we've said in the past, we will continue to compete all investments in growth projects against share repurchases in order to ensure that we are maximizing risk-adjusted per share returns for our shareholders. Based on the opportunities we see across our portfolio beyond 2018, we believe we can invest $300 million to $400 million of AES equity in attractive growth projects each year, which is consistent with the amount of equity we are currently contributing annually to our growth projects. This level of annual equity commitment is quite moderate, considering the expected growth in our free cash flow and continued recycling of capital from additional asset sales. We also plan to bring in financial partners on all of our larger projects as a means of improving our returns, fine tuning our portfolios risks exposures and having our project vetted by other investors.
Now I'd like to highlight a couple more significant projects in our development pipeline beginning on Slide 11. Our southland power project in California with 1,400 megawatts of gas-fired and energy storage capacity is on track to begin construction in 2017. We expect to select our EPC contractor and file final permitting amendments in the next 6 months. Our development pipeline is not limited to power generation projects as we seek to realize the full value of our existing market platforms through adjacent business lengths such as enhanced LNG services, desalinization and energy storage. 
Turning to Slide 12, for example, in the Dominican Republic, we're working on opportunities to expand our existing LNG infrastructure. We're developing a second gas pipeline, which will transport natural gas from our regasification terminal to other power generators so they can convert up to 1,000 megawatts of diesel and oil fired generation to cheaper, cleaner natural gas. We're also advancing in the development of an upgrade of our LNG import terminal to allow for reship shipment of LNG. The ability to reship LNG will be an extension of our successful gas distribution business in the Dominican Republic. We supply third-party trucks with liquefied natural gas. Both of these attractive projects will require only modest equity investments and we expect to largely fund them with leverage capacity at the local business. 
In terms of desalinization on Slide 13, we currently have 1 200 cubic meter per hour project under construction at our Angamos power plant in Chile. Although this project is largely a modernization of our existing desal facilities at that plant there are a number of potential desal projects in Chile to supply our mining and industrial customers. We see desal is a timely and significant opportunity in Chile and possibly, longer term in Mexico and California given the challenges of water supply in those markets and our many years of experience operating desal plants.
Moving onto Slide 14. We are the world leaders in battery-based energy storage with 86 megawatts of installed capacity. Although it is likely to remain relatively small in the near-term, we see the potential for much larger opportunity over the next 4 or 5 years. We're encouraged by ongoing regulatory support and growing acceptance by power systems and utilities in some of AES' markets. To that end, as you may have seen, we recently announced that we have 50 megawatts under construction including the first energy storage units in the Netherlands and Northern Ireland. These projects under construction are all additions to our existing platforms. We are well positioned to take advantage of this emerging business opportunity given AES' international portfolio and 8 years of successful and profitable experience operating battery-based energy storage.

This quarter, we continued to benefit from our capital allocation decisions and operational improvements despite some macro headwinds. Further, as anticipated, our cash flow improved as a result of lower working capital requirements. We also made substantial progress toward a key financial goal of improving our credit profile by reducing Parent debt, lowering interest expense and extending maturities. Today, I'll review our first quarter results including adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU and for the first time, proportional free cash flow by SBU, which we've also included in our 10-Q. Then I'll cover our 2015 capital allocation plan and our 2015 guidance.
Turning to Slide 16, first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.25 was a $0.01 higher than first quarter 2014. At the high-level, we benefited from the following: $0.03 from capital allocation, which resulted in 13% lower Parent debt and a 3% lower share count relative to last year and a $0.01 net increase from performance of our businesses with improvement in the U.S. and Andes, partially offset by lower contributions from Brazil, Europe and Mexico Central America and the Caribbean or MCAC. On the negative side, we were affected by a $0.02 impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which appreciated 18% against the Brazilian Real, Colombian peso and euro, and a $0.01 impact from a slightly higher tax rate of 33% this year versus 30% in the first quarter of last year.
Now I'll cover our SBU's financial performance in more detail on the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 17. In the U.S., adjusted PTC increased by $31 million driven by better availability at DPL compared to first quarter last year when a couple of DPL generation plants were not available during the polar vortex. Proportional free cash flow increased $74 million, reflecting a lower working capital requirements this year compared to during the extreme cold of last year. In Andes, PTC increased $38 million primarily due to better availability at our plants in Chile, however, proportional free cash flow declined by $6 million due to timing of collections and higher maintenance capital expenditures.
In Brazil, PTC decreased $48 million driven by FX and operating performance. About half the decline is driven by our generation business Tietê. You may recall that last year, Tietê benefited from spot sales and favorable prices due to lower contract levels during the first half of the year. This benefit was more of a timing issue as Tietê at the purchase in the spot market in the second half. This year, Tietê's contract levels are flat in the first and second half, so we expect contributions to be evenly distributed. Additionally, Sul, one of our utilities, had lower results due to lower sales volumes and higher fixed costs. Proportional free cash flow increased $15 million primarily driven by higher collections to pass through energy purchases build during 2014 offset by lower operating performance. 
In MCAC, PTC declined $15 million largely driven by lower margins in the Dominican Republic where revenues are partially indexed to oil prices as well as lower availability. This impact was partially offset by improved hydraulic in Panama. Proportional free cash flow improved by $55 million primarily driven by improved working capital in El Salvador and Puerto Rico. In Europe, adjusted PTC decreased by $30 million, half of which is due to lower contributions from the sales of in Nigeria, and our U.K. wind businesses and the remaining half is largely from unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Proportional free cash flow increased by $21 million driven by higher collections at Maritza, which were 60% higher than the first quarter of 2014. 
And finally in Asia, PTC was essentially flat after taking into account the impact from the sale of 41% of Masinloc in the third quarter of last year, offset by the one-time charge recorded at Masinloc, in the first quarter of '14 related to the market spot price adjustment. Proportional free cash flow decreased $37 million due to the Masinloc sale and higher working capital requirements. 
Turning to Slide 23, in summary, overall, we earned $252 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, an increase of $9 million from last year and we generated $265 million of proportional free cash flow, representing a doubling from $129 million in last year's first quarter. As you may recall, working capital was a drag on our results last year and is reflected in our first quarter results, we're seeing recovery. 
Now to Slide 24 in our Parent capital allocation plan for the year, regarding sources from the left-hand side, the only update from our last call is an increase of $100 million in equity proceeds from asset sales from the sale of the Armenia Mountain wind project in Pennsylvania and the sale of 40% of our interest in the IPP4 plant in Jordan. This brings our total available discretionary cash for 2015 to roughly $1.6 billion [ph].  We continue to expect Parent free cash flow of $525 million this year with 10% to 15% average annual growth through 2018.
Turning to Uses on the right-hand side of the slide, in addition to dividend, we also plan to invest about $350 million on our subsidiaries, 60% of which is IPL and has already been funded. We've invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing of Parent debt to balance asset sales and planned share buybacks. And finally, we repurchased 42 million of shares year-to-date and expect to invest at least 324 million this year, which assumes that we use $300 million of the $400 million repurchased authorized in February. This leaves $200 million of discretionary cash to be allocated this year. 
Turning to our Parent debt profile on Slide 25. Since our last call, we prepaid $315 million of Parent debt, bringing our total Parent debt reduction since the end of 2011 to $1.5 billion or a 25% reduction. In early April, we also refinanced another $500 million in near-term Parent debt maturities. These transactions resulted in a reduction in our near-term maturities to only $180 million over the next 4 years and reduced the average interest rate from 6.3% to 5.6%. We also continue to optimize the capital structure of certain subsidiaries and affiliates such as Guacolda in Chile where $830 million in long-term debt was refinanced in April at about 4.5%, demonstrating the strong credit quality and market access of our businesses. 
Now beginning on Slide 26, I'll discuss our adjusted EPS guidance for this year, which is based on the following assumptions: Currency forward curves as of March 31, which reflect roughly 10% depreciation versus the U.S. dollar compared to year-end curves for the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and the euro. Forward curves as of March 31, which reflect roughly a 5% to 10% decline for oil and gas, and the current outlook for hydro in Latin America, which is in line with our expectations except in Brazil. Through any seasoned that's drawing to a close and reservoir levels are currently at about 35% and expected to be about 37% at the end of May. We believe that the government is unlikely to call for this year given these levels. That said, the systems continue to face a hydro generation shortfall, which has a financial impact on Tietê. We previously have built a $0.05 impact into our guidance based on having to cover 15% to 17% of our contract in the spot market. We now expect the shortfall to be 17% to 19% due to continued high thermal dispatch. We expect this will add another $0.02 to the hydro impact this year. We've also incorporated a modest decline in demand at Sul and Brazil, resulting in an incremental impact of under a $0.01.
Now turning to Slide 27. As we see discussed on our last call, our adjusted EPS guidance is $1.25 to $1.35 per share, which when we provided it in late February was based on currency and commodity curves as of December 31. The impact of updating these firms based on the 7 [ph] subtivities [ph] we've disclosed a [ph] $0.05, however, we've been proactive in hedging our downside, which reduced the FX and commodity impact by $0.03. Further, as I just discussed, we're incorporating an additional $0.03 impact from poor hydrology and demand in Brazil. We've also included a $0.01 benefit from the completion of the Vietnam project slightly ahead of our internal projection. Bottom line is that although, we're facing some headwinds, we're managing the impacts and therefore, reaffirming our EPS guidance range. At the same time, as you can see on Slide 27, we remain confident in our portfolio's ability to generate strong cash flow. We're reaffirming our proportional free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.35 billion, billion which after subsidiary debt paydown provides us with about $525 million in Parent free cash flow. We'll continue to create value by investing in strong and growing cash flow to maximize returns to shareholders.
With that, I'll now pass it back to Andres."

Of course, this would be leverage by bringing in financial partners. Now the exact amount will depend on the projected return of those projects and the value we create by buying back our share, so they will be competing. This is just to give us sort of a range where we see those projects. We also said that compared to what is currently under construction, we see a heavy [ph] year weighting towards natural gas, renewables and energy storage. Now our energy storage business, I think is quite different from, and quite unique actually, that we have been at this for 8 years. We make money at it and we've been successful, and we have a product that integrates several different usage, so we have sort of the complete package, sort of plug-and-play. I think that's one of the reasons we were successful in the Southern California bid last year. So we see this as a growing market. In the U.S., California is taking the lead by requiring utilities to have 1,325 megawatts of energy storage by 2020 and we see this trend going across the country and in different places. So again, we're very well positioned to take advantage of it and we have been successful. We're also opening up new markets and the latest ones, we're already in Chile, we're looking at Northern Ireland and Netherlands. So it's 1, let's say technology, it has 3 different use. On the 1 hand, you can use it for capacity release like we do in Chile, which allows you, you don't have to hold back 5% of thermal generation because you have a battery. You can use it for ancillary services as we use it in PJM with, and you can also use it as a peaking facility, which will be the main use in California. So the different markets, we see it developing, but we're a big company, so to really be a needle-mover, we see it a couple of years out. What we really want to be here is not too far ahead of the curve, but we want to be in sort of somewhat ahead of the curve and that's really our strategy here and we think we're well positioned. So just like in the past when I talked about bringing in partners and said this was an idea, we'll see how this develops before giving any sort of guidance about say, larger numbers of 3 to 5 years out."

If you look at the close to $3 billion that we've raised in our asset sales since 2011, and the places we got out of and the prices we got out of. If you think of Brazil, I think starting in 2006, we started to reduce our position in Eletropaulo and we also spun off the telecom and sold that as well, I think right at the right timing of the market. So I say, if you take a longer-term perspective, I think our performance in Brazil over this period has been good. Now there's no question that it's been affected by economic and political factors, but mostly hydrology, quite frankly. So thinking about our position in Brazil, we have 2,600 megawatts of hydro in Tietê. We also have about $500 million of leverage capacity that we have not used at Tietê, so it provides us with an opportunity. And yes, you know, there are droughts and they are cyclical. I mean this year, we're entering into -- actually have been declared already, a mild to medium El Niñ, o which means they're going back to more sort of normal weather patterns as we've seen in the other countries. So that will pass. Now politically Brazil, I think it's shown on the 1 hand, significant institutional strength given the -- as everybody is aware, the issues around Petrobras and the tax authorities, and the independence of the judiciary. I think they've also named a very strong Minister of Economy, Joaquin Levi, and we've had some, been able in some small meetings with him and seen what his plans are and we feel very encouraged by it. So I think everybody feels that 2015 will be a difficult year in Brazil. The economy's in contraction. Tom mentioned it in his comments that we see a traction especially in Sul, in terms of demand, but having said that, I think that if they take the right measures and move towards a primary surplus, Brazil is a country with tremendous opportunity and you can't sort of come in and come out of large massive capital intensive projects like ours. So you have to have a footprint there, so I think we've reduced it appropriately and we're well positioned to look at opportunities going forward."

First, we knew the markets well then we also had an ongoing dialogue with the regulator because one of the big issues with energy storage is to get regulatory approval because we know the benefits that it has for stabilizing the grid, but it's a question of how you're going to get paid for, sometimes for those services if there's not a sort of active ancillary market. So the first steps, we put it on Chile, we put it on DP&L. We've also, looking at putting it in our California platforms, possibly in the future IPL or other places, but there are 2 steps, 1 is really identifying the use of the energy, of the battery and the second is getting the regulatory approval. So we see opening up markets where we're present like the Netherlands, like Northern Ireland and continue with that successful strategy. Now in terms of how to monetize that beyond our platforms and really would be to their situations where we could actually install the advance in product as we call it, which includes our IP, includes the batteries, includes how to operate it, in the markets where we're present, we could just put it on somebody else's platform. Essentially, for example, say we're selling energy to a utility and they would like to rate bait these assets, then we can do that as well. So that's one way that we could grow more quickly than just say putting it in operating ourselves and we're looking at, we're talking to people. So again, we're very well positioned, we just think that this is a market that has to develop and one of the big challenges again, is to get to appropriate regulatory approvals and also have to demonstrate how it's used. Once you put a unit into a market and people see that it functions very well, then we expect to have an increase in demand so that's how we see going about it. Now if we put it on a platform where we have a partner, for example, say in Chile or at IPL, that partner will participate in that asset that we're putting on and we're really managing from a center of excellence here at corp, but pushing out the implementations into the businesses. So again, the business has worked very well and we think that this is an idea of who's time has come, but we see that their U.S. market is the most immediate one. We see this going, particularly well, for example, on smaller grids islands, and we're located in a lot of islands and smaller grid, from the Philippines to Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Northern Ireland, Dominican Republic, there are a lot of places you can use it or places, for example, like Chile, which due to the nature of the grid look like island, you have certain constraints. So for all those reasons again, we're optimistic, we think we're on the leading-edge and we'll continue to push this product forward in numerous markets."

The big advantage we have is putting them onto our existing businesses and understanding these markets. And I think that we've seen situations, for example, at certain times, a wind in Brazil, others where prices were very expensive, competition was very aggressive, and I think we're very judicious about where to put our money in. Now we've sold part of our joint venture, Silver Ridge to people who have aggressive global plans for utility scale and solar, and we did it in part because it's not in our strategy of using our platforms. We are much more efficient and if you take all in costs, which at the end of the day that's what matters, from development to operating these plants, even financing and rather than doing sort of 1 by 1 project financing, its really doing it under the umbrella of an existing business. So for example, in Chile, which is a very competitive market and they've had about 1,000 megawatts of renewables that are coming on the grid, we're building out 20 megawatts solar. We have permits up to 200, and we'll do it to the degree that we get PPAs. Of course, the issues with solar are that you only have energy 8 to 10 hours a day. So having the backup of an existing facility, gives us a lot more leeway in terms of what we can put together. And also, technologically, we can combine this as we do in Laurel Mountain, where we combine wind with energy storage. It makes a more attractive offering, so really that's our strategy is to put it together. Not to compete just on lower turns for these projects and many of the markets. And our strategy to date in terms of getting lower cost capital has really been the partnerships and bringing on partners, and I think we've been quite effective in that. To date, we have over $2.5 billion that we have raised, which is quite a lot of money, if you consider it in terms of increasing our ability to larger projects, our ability to fine-tune what our exposure is and so we'll continue to use that in renewables as well."

I am pleased to report that with our first quarter results, we're reaffirming our 2016 guidance for all metrics. Since our previous quarterly call, less than 3 months",1691,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings call. I am pleased to report that with our first quarter results, we're reaffirming our 2016 guidance for all metrics. Since our previous quarterly call, less than 3 months ago, we have achieved several significant milestones on our strategic objectives and our priorities for 2015. We continue to leverage our platforms. Our $9 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next 4 years. This quarter, we commissioned the largest power plant that AES has ever constructed. We also signed agreements for 2 additional asset sales totaling $105 million in equity proceeds and invested $345 million to prepay and refinance debt. This year, we have also repurchased $42 million of our shares, and we made substantial progress in addressing short-term issues affecting our businesses in Bulgaria and India. I will discuss some of these achievements in detail, but first I'd like to provide the highlights of our financial results. 
In the first quarter, we generated proportional free cash flow of $265 million, double our results of a year ago due to the recovery of working capital at a couple of significant businesses. We earned $0.25 of adjusted earnings per share, which was a $0.01 increase from our first quarter of 2014. We improved operating performance at our U.S. and Andes strategic business units, although we continued to experience headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil and unfavorable foreign exchange in Latin America and Europe. 
During the quarter, our earnings benefited from our previous capital allocation decisions to pay down debt and buy back our shares. As we have discussed in the past, we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of adverse hydrology in Latin America. And this year, that risk is mostly limited to Brazil. We also have a rolling 12-month hedging strategy to help mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Brazilian real, the Colombian peso and the euro. Although these currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, energy demand has remained robust at 3% to 10% on our markets, except in the U.S, where we are experiencing flat demand; and in Brazil, where demand growth is slightly negative. 
Now I'll discuss our significant accomplishments since our last call, starting with our progress in resolving a couple of business-specific issues beginning on Slide 4. In Bulgaria, with the Maritza plant's sole customer, the National Electricity (sic) [ Electric ] Company, or NEK, has fallen significantly behind on its payments, we're now seeing positive momentum. Last month, Maritza signed an MOU with NEK to receive full payment of all arrears, which as of March 30 were $236 million in exchange for a decrease in the capacity price of a long-term PPA. We expect to sign a binding agreement by the third quarter of this year. The 14% capacity price reduction is already reflected in our 2015 guidance as well as our longer-term expectations. This agreement is part of a broad set of initiatives the government of Bulgaria is taking to help restore NEK's financial position. One of these initiatives is the introduction of energy sector reforms to reduce the volume of energy that NEK purchases from code generators and compensating NEK through existing environmental taxes. Already, Maritza's collections during the first 4 months of the year have improved by 40%, and our receivables balance has remained flat as of the end of December. 
Turning now to our 1,320-megawatt OPGC II project under construction in India on Slide 5. As you may know, late last year, the Supreme Court of India overturned the allocation of 214 coal blocks, including those for OPGC II. I'm pleased to report that the project, through a new joint venture between OPGC and the government of Odisha, has resecured the rights to the same coal blocks, which can support 2,640 megawatts of new capacity. Construction on OPGC II is on schedule with this plant expected to come online in 2018.
Now turning to Slide 6, I'll discuss our construction program and development pipeline in more detail. Our construction program is the most significant driver of our 10% to 15% average annual growth and free cash flow over the next few years. This strong growth is the foundation for our commitment to 10% annual dividend growth as well as other capital allocation decisions. From 2015 through 2018, we expect to commission 7,131 megawatts of new capacity, which is a high multiple of the roughly 600 megawatts we've brought online in the 3 previous years from 2012 through 2014. In fact, already this year, we've brought online 1,312 megawatts, which is 87% of the capacity we expect to commission this year. 
Moving onto Slide 7. Our remaining 5,118 megawatts under construction are progressing well and remain on time and on budget. As a reminder, the total CapEx for our projects currently under construction is $7 billion, but AES' equity commitment is only $1.3 billion, of which all, but $400 million, has already been funded. As you can see, roughly 80% of this new capacity is in the Americas. We expect a return on equity from these projects of more than 15%. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'm very happy to report that we have achieved commercial operation on our 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam 6 months early. Additionally, the project reached 18 million man-hours without a lost time incident. This project provides us with a solid platform from which to grow our presence in Vietnam, where we see a number of future platform expansion opportunities. 
Moving to Slide 9. To help mitigate our hydrology risk in Panama, we recently inaugurated a 72-megawatt thermal power barge. The plant's output is contracted under a 5-year PPA. We're also looking at similar opportunities in other countries in Latin America to decrease our exposure to fluctuations in hydrology. 
Finally, looking at our growth opportunities beyond the projects currently under constructions beginning on Slide 10. We see compelling platform expansion opportunities in a number of growing markets such as Chile, Mexico, Panama and the Philippines. In more mature markets like California and the United Kingdom, we see opportunities to replace older, less efficient or noncomplying capacity. Generally, we expect our future project mix to be heavily weighted towards natural gas, renewables and energy storage as we seek to match the right offering on the future needs of each market. 
As we've said in the past, we will continue to compete all investments in growth projects against share repurchases in order to ensure that we are maximizing risk-adjusted per share returns for our shareholders. Based on the opportunities we see across our portfolio beyond 2018, we believe we can invest $300 million to $400 million of AES equity in attractive growth projects each year, which is consistent with the amount of equity we are currently contributing annually to our growth projects. This level of annual equity commitment is quite moderate, considering the expected growth in our free cash flow and continued recycling of capital from additional asset sales. We also plan to bring in financial partners on all of our larger projects as a means of improving our returns, fine-tuning our portfolios' risks exposures and having our projects vetted by other investors.
Now I'd like to highlight a couple of more significant projects in our development pipeline beginning on Slide 11. Our Southland repowering project in California with 1,400 megawatts of gas-fired and energy storage capacity is on track to begin construction in 2017. We expect to select our EPC contractor and file final permitting amendments in the next 6 months. Our development pipeline is not limited to power generation projects as we seek to realize the full value of our existing market platforms through adjacent business lengths such as enhanced LNG services, desalinization and energy storage. 
Turning to Slide 12, for example, in the Dominican Republic, we're working on opportunities to expand our existing LNG infrastructure. We're developing a second gas pipeline, which will transport natural gas from our regasification terminal to other power generators so they can convert up to 1,000 megawatts of diesel and oil-fired generation to cheaper, cleaner natural gas. We're also advancing in the development of an upgrade of our LNG import terminal to allow for reshipment of LNG. The ability to reship LNG will be an extension of our successful gas distribution business in the Dominican Republic, which supplies third-party trucks with liquefied natural gas. Both of these attractive projects will require only modest equity investments. So we expect to largely fund them with leverage capacity at the local business. 
In terms of desalinization on Slide 13, we currently have 1 200 cubic meter per hour project under construction at our Angamos power plant in Chile. Although this project is largely a modernization of our existing desal facilities at that plant, there are a number of potential desal projects in Chile to supply our mining and industrial customers. We see desal is a timely and significant opportunity in Chile and, possibly, longer term in Mexico and California, given the challenges of water supply in those markets and our many years of experience operating desal plants.
Moving onto Slide 14. We are the world leaders in battery-based energy storage with 86 megawatts of installed capacity. Although it is likely to remain relatively small in the near term, we see the potential for much larger opportunity over the next 4 or 5 years. We're encouraged by ongoing regulatory support and growing acceptance by power systems and utilities in some of AES' markets. To that end, as you may have seen, we recently announced that we have 50 megawatts under construction including the first energy storage units in the Netherlands and Northern Ireland. These projects under construction are all additions to our existing platforms. We are well-positioned to take advantage of this emerging business opportunity given AES' international portfolio and 8 years of successful and profitable experience operating battery-based energy storage.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

This quarter, we continue to benefit from our capital allocation decisions and operational improvements despite some macro headwinds. Further, as anticipated, our cash flow improved as a result of lower working",1505,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, we continue to benefit from our capital allocation decisions and operational improvements despite some macro headwinds. Further, as anticipated, our cash flow improved as a result of lower working capital requirements. We also made substantial progress toward a key financial goal of improving our credit profile by reducing parent debt, lowering interest expense and extending maturities. Today, I'll review our first quarter results including adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; and for the first time, proportional free cash flow by SBU, which we've also included in our 10-Q; then I'll cover our 2015 capital allocation plan and our 2015 guidance.
Turning to Slide 16. First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.25 was $0.01 higher than first quarter 2014. At the high level, we benefited from the following: $0.03 from capital allocation, which resulted in 13% lower parent debt and a 3% lower share count relative to last year; and a $0.01 net increase from performance of our businesses with improvements in the U.S. and Andes, partially offset by lower contributions from Brazil, Europe and Mexico Central America and the Caribbean, or MCAC. On the negative side, we were affected by a $0.02 impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which appreciated 18% against the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and euro; and a $0.01 impact from a slightly higher tax rate of 33% this year versus 30% in the first quarter of last year.
Now I'll cover our SBU's financial performance in more detail on the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 17. In the U.S., adjusted PTC increased by $31 million, driven by better availability at DPL compared to first quarter last year when a couple of DPL generation plants were not available during the polar vortex. Proportional free cash flow increased $74 million, reflecting the lower working capital requirements this year compared to during the extreme cold of last year. In Andes, PTC increased $38 million primarily due to better availability at our plants in Chile. However, proportional free cash flow declined by $6 million due to timing of collections and higher maintenance capital expenditures.
In Brazil, PTC decreased $48 million driven by FX and operating performance. About half the decline is driven by our generation business, Tietê. You may recall that last year, Tietê benefited from spot sales and favorable prices due to lower contract levels during the first half of the year. This benefit was more of a timing issue as Tietê had to purchase in the spot market second half. This year, Tietê's contract levels are flat in the first and second half, so we expect contributions to be evenly distributed. Additionally, Sul, one of our utilities, had lower results due to lower sales volume and higher fixed costs. Proportional free cash flow increased $15 million, primarily driven by higher collections of passthrough energy purchases built during 2014, offset by lower operating performance. 
In MCAC, PTC declined $15 million, largely driven by lower margins in the Dominican Republic, where revenues are partially indexed to oil prices as well as lower availability. This impact was partially offset by improved hydro again in Panama. Proportional free cash flow improved by $55 million, primarily driven by improved working capital in El Salvador and Puerto Rico. In Europe, adjusted PTC decreased by $30 million, half of which is due to lower contributions from the sales of Ebute in Nigeria and our U.K. wind businesses, and the remaining half is largely from unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Proportional free cash flow increased by $21 million, driven by higher collections at Maritza, which were 60% higher than the first quarter of 2014. 
And finally, in Asia, PTC was essentially flat after taking into account the impact from the sale of 41% of Masinloc in the third quarter of last year, offset by the one-time charge recorded at Masinloc in the first quarter of '14 related to the market spot price adjustment. Proportional free cash flow decreased $37 million due to the Masinloc sale and higher working capital requirements. 
Turning to Slide 23. In summary, overall, we earned $252 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, an increase of $9 million from last year. And we generated $265 million of proportional free cash flow, representing a doubling from $129 million in last year's first quarter. As you may recall, working capital was a drag on our results last year and is reflected in our first quarter results. We're seeing recovery. 
Now to Slide 24 in our parent capital allocation plan for the year. Regarding sources from the left-hand side, the only update from our last call is an increase of $100 million in equity proceeds from asset sales, from the sale of the Armenia Mountain wind project in Pennsylvania and the sale of 40% of our interest in the IPP4 plant in Jordan. This brings our total available discretionary cash for 2015 to roughly $1.6 billion.  We continue to expect parent-free cash flow of $525 million this year with 10% to 15% average annual growth through 2018.
Turning to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. In addition to dividend, we also plan to invest about $350 million on our subsidiaries, 60% of which is IPL and has already been funded. We've invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing of parent debt to balance asset sales and planned share buybacks. And finally, we repurchased 42 million of shares year-to-date and expect to invest at least $324 million this year, which assumes that we use $300 million of the $400 million repurchased authorized in February. This leaves $200 million of discretionary cash to be allocated this year. 
Turning to our parent debt profile on Slide 25. Since our last call, we prepaid $315 million of parent debt, bringing our total parent debt reduction since the end of 2011 to $1.5 billion or a 25% reduction. In early April, we also refinanced another $500 million in near-term parent debt maturities. These transactions resulted in a reduction in our near-term maturities to only $180 million over the next 4 years and reduced the average interest rate from 6.3% to 5.6%. We also continue to optimize the capital structure of certain subsidiaries and affiliates such as Guacolda in Chile, where $830 million in long-term debt was refinanced in April at about 4.5%, demonstrating the strong credit quality and market access of our businesses. 
Now beginning on Slide 26, I'll discuss our adjusted EPS guidance for this year, which is based on the following assumptions: currency forward curves as of March 31, which reflect roughly 10% depreciation versus the U.S. dollar compared to year-end curves for the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and the euro; commodity forward curves as of March 31, which reflect roughly a 5% to 10% decline for oil and gas; and the current outlook for hydro in Latin America, which is in line with our expectations, except in Brazil. Rainy season there is drawing to a close, and reservoir levels are currently at about 35% and are expected to be about 37% at the end of May. We believe that the government is unlikely to call for ration this year given these levels. That said, the system continues to face a hydro generation shortfall, which has a financial impact on Tietê. We previously have built a $0.05 impact into our guidance based on having to cover 15% to 17% of our contract in the spot market. We now expect the shortfall to be 17% to 19% due to continued high thermal dispatch. We expect this will add another $0.02 to the hydro impact this year. We've also incorporated a modest decline in demand at Sul in Brazil, resulting in an incremental impact of another $0.01. 
Now turning to Slide 27. As we see discussed on our last call, our adjusted EPS guidance is $1.25 to $1.35 per share, which when we provided it in late February was based on currency and commodity curves as of December 31, the impact of updating these curves based on the 7 sub-activities we've disclosed a $0.05. However, we've been proactive in hedging our downside, which reduced the FX and commodity impact by $0.03. Further, as I just discussed, we're incorporating an additional $0.03 impact from poor hydrology and demand in Brazil. We've also included a $0.01 benefit from the completion of the Vietnam project slightly ahead of our internal projection. Bottom line is that although we're facing some headwinds, we're managing the impacts and, therefore, reaffirming our EPS guidance range. At the same time, as you can see on Slide 27, we remain confident in our portfolio's ability to generate strong cash flow. We're reaffirming our proportional free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.35 billion, which after subsidiary debt paydown provides us with about $525 million in parent free cash flow. We'll continue to create value by investing in a strong and growing cash flow to maximize returns to shareholders.
With that, I'll now pass it back to Andres."

Of course, this would be leveraged by bringing in financial partners. Now the exact amount will depend on the projected return of those projects and the value we create by buying back our share. So they will be competing. This is just to give us sort of a range where we see those projects. We also said that compared to what is currently under construction, we see a heavier weighting towards natural gas, renewables and energy storage. Now our energy storage business, I think, is quite different from, and then quite unique actually, that we have been at this for 8 years. We make money at it and we've been successful, and we have a product that integrates several different usage. So we have sort of the complete package, sort of plug-and-play. I think that's one of the reasons we were successful in the Southern California Edison bid last year. So we see this as a growing market. In the U.S., California is taking the lead by requiring utilities to have 1,325 megawatts of energy storage by 2020, and we see this trend going across the country and in different places. So again, we're very well-positioned to take advantage of it, and we have been successful. We're also opening up new markets. And the latest ones, we're already in Chile, we're looking at Northern Ireland and Netherlands. So it's one -- let's say technology, it has 3 different use. On the one hand, you can use it for capacity release like we do in Chile, which allows you, you don't have to hold back 5% of thermal generation because you have a battery. You can use it for ancillary services as we use it in PJM with tape. And you can also use it as a peaking facility, which will be the main use in California. So the different markets, we see it developing, but we're a big company. So to really be a needle-mover, we see it a couple of years out. What we really want to be here is not too far ahead of the curve, but we want to be in sort of somewhat ahead of the curve. And that's really our strategy here, and we think we're well-positioned. So just like in the past, when I talked about bringing in partners and said this was an idea, we'll see how this develops before giving any sort of guidance about, say, larger numbers of 3 to 5 years out."

I think, first, I think we've been very good sellers and managers of our portfolio if you look at the close to $3 billion that we've raised in our asset sales since 2011 and the places we got out of and the prices we got out of. If you think of Brazil, I think starting in 2006, we've started to reduce our position in Eletropaulo. And we also spun off the telecom and sold that as well, I think, right at the right timing of the market. So actually, if you take a longer-term perspective, I think our performance in Brazil over this period has been good. Now there's no question that it's been affected by economic and political factors, but mostly hydrology, quite frankly. So thinking about our position in Brazil, we have 2,600 megawatts of hydro in Tietê. We also have about $500 million of leverage capacity, which we have not used at Tietê. So it provides us with an opportunity. And yes, as you know, there are droughts and they are cyclical. I mean, this year, we're entering into a mild -- or actually, it's been declared already, a mild to medium El Niño, which means they're going back to more sort of normal weather patterns, as we've seen in the other countries. So that will pass. Now politically, Brazil, I think it's shown on the one hand significant institutional strength given the, as everybody's aware, the issues around Petrobras and the tax authorities and the independence of the judiciary. I think they've also named a very strong Minister of Economy, Joaquim Levy. And we've had some -- been able in some small meetings with him and seen what his plans are, and then we feel very encouraged by it. So I think everybody feels that 2015 will be a difficult year in Brazil. The economy's in contraction. Tom mentioned it in his comments that we see a traction, especially in Sul in terms of demand. But having said that, I think that if they take the right measures and move towards a primary surplus, Brazil is a country with tremendous opportunity. And you can't sort of come in and come out of large massive capital-intensive projects like ours. So you have to have a footprint there. So I think we've reduced it appropriately, and we're well-positioned to look at opportunities going forward."

And this has given us several advantages. First, we knew the markets well. Then we also had an ongoing dialogue with the regulator because one of the big issues with energy storage is to get regulatory approval because we know the benefits that it has for stabilizing the grid, but it's a question of how you're going to get paid for sometimes for those services if there's not a sort of active ancillary market. So the first steps, we've put it on Chile, we've put it in DP&L. We've also -- looking at putting it on our California platforms, possibly in the future IPL or other places. But there are 2 steps. One is really identifying the use of the energy, of the battery, and the second is getting the regulatory approval. So we see opening up markets where we're present, like the Netherlands, like Northern Ireland, and continue with that successful strategy. Now in terms of how to monetize that beyond our platforms, and really would be to their situations where we could actually install the advance in product, as we call it, which includes our IP, includes the batteries, includes how to operate it, in the markets where we're present, we could just put it on somebody else's platform. Essentially, for example, let's say, we're selling energy to a utility and they would like to rate bait these assets, we can do that as well. So that's one way that we could grow more quickly than just say putting it in operating ourselves. And we're looking at -- we're talking to people. So again, we're very well-positioned. We just think that this is a market that has to develop. And one of the big challenges, again, is to get the appropriate regulatory approvals and also have to demonstrate how it's used. Once you put a unit into a market and people see that it functions very well, then we expect to have an increase in demand. So that's how we see going about it. Now if we put it on a platform where we have a partner, for example, say, in Chile or at IPL, that partner will participate in that asset that we're putting on. And we're really managing from a center of excellence here at corp, but pushing out the implementations into the businesses. So again, the business work very well, and we think that this is an idea whose time has come, but we see that their U.S. market's the most immediate one. But we see this going across the world. It works particularly well, for example, on smaller grids, islands. And we're located in a lot of islands and smaller grids, from the Philippines to Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Northern Ireland, Dominican Republic. There are a lot of places you can use it or places, for example, like Chile, which due to the nature of the grid look-like island, you have certain constraints. So for all those reasons, again, we're optimistic, we think we're on the leading edge and we'll continue to push this product forward in numerous markets."

The big advantage we have is putting them onto our existing businesses and understanding these markets. And I think that we've seen situations, for example, at certain times, say, wind in Brazil, others where prices were very expensive, competition was very aggressive, and I think we're very judicious about where to put our money in. Now we've sold part of our joint venture, Silver Ridge, to people who have aggressive global plans for utility scale solar. And we did it in part because it's not on our strategy of using our platforms. We are much more efficient. And if you take all-in costs, which at the end of the day that's what matters, from development to operating these plants, even financing and rather than doing sort of 1x1 project financing, is really doing it under the umbrella of an existing business. So for example, in Chile, which is a very competitive market, and they've had about 1,000 megawatts of renewables that are coming on the grid, we're building out the 20-megawatt solar, we have permits up to 200 and we'll do it to the degree that we get PPAs. Of course, the issues with solar are that you only have energy 8 to 10 hours a day. So having the backup of an existing facility gives us a lot more leeway in terms of what we can put together. And also, technologically, we can combine this as we do in Laurel Mountain, where we combine wind with energy storage that makes a more attractive offering. So really, that's our strategy, is to put it together, not to compete just on lower turns for these projects in many of the markets. And our strategy to date in terms of getting lower cost capital has really been the partnerships and bringing on partners. And I think we've been quite effective in that. To date, we have over $2.5 billion that we have raised, which is quite a lot of money if you consider it in terms of increasing our ability to larger projects, our ability to fine-tune what our exposure is. And so we'll continue to use that in renewables as well."

I am pleased to report that with our first quarter results, we're reaffirming our 2016 guidance for all metrics. Since our previous quarterly call, less than 3 months",1693,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings call. I am pleased to report that with our first quarter results, we're reaffirming our 2016 guidance for all metrics. Since our previous quarterly call, less than 3 months ago, we have achieved several significant milestones on our strategic objectives and our priorities for 2015. We continue to leverage our platforms. Our $9 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next 4 years. This quarter, we commissioned the largest power plant that AES has ever constructed. We also signed agreements for 2 additional asset sales totaling $105 million in equity proceeds and invested $345 million to prepay and refinance debt. This year, we have also repurchased $42 million of our shares, and we made substantial progress in addressing short-term issues affecting our businesses in Bulgaria and India. I will discuss some of these achievements in detail, but first I'd like to provide the highlights of our financial results. 
In the first quarter, we generated proportional free cash flow of $265 million, double our results of a year ago due to the recovery of working capital at a couple of significant businesses. We earned $0.25 of adjusted earnings per share, which was a $0.01 increase from our first quarter of 2014. We improved operating performance at our U.S. and Andes strategic business units, although we continued to experience headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil and unfavorable foreign exchange in Latin America and Europe. 
During the quarter, our earnings benefited from our previous capital allocation decisions to pay down debt and buy back our shares. As we have discussed in the past, we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of adverse hydrology in Latin America. And this year, that risk is mostly limited to Brazil. We also have a rolling 12-month hedging strategy to help mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Brazilian real, the Colombian peso and the euro. Although these currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, energy demand has remained robust at 3% to 10% on our markets, except in the U.S, where we are experiencing flat demand; and in Brazil, where demand growth is slightly negative. 
Now I'll discuss our significant accomplishments since our last call, starting with our progress in resolving a couple of business-specific issues beginning on Slide 4. In Bulgaria, with the Maritza plant's sole customer, the National Electricity (sic) [ Electric ] Company, or NEK, has fallen significantly behind on its payments, we're now seeing positive momentum. Last month, Maritza signed an MOU with NEK to receive full payment of all arrears, which as of March 30 were $236 million in exchange for a decrease in the capacity price of a long-term PPA. We expect to sign a binding agreement by the third quarter of this year. The 14% capacity price reduction is already reflected in our 2015 guidance as well as our longer-term expectations. This agreement is part of a broad set of initiatives the government of Bulgaria is taking to help restore NEK's financial position. One of these initiatives is the introduction of energy sector reforms to reduce the volume of energy that NEK purchases from code generators and compensating NEK through existing environmental taxes. Already, Maritza's collections during the first 4 months of the year have improved by 40%, and our receivables balance has remained flat as of the end of December. 
Turning now to our 1,320-megawatt OPGC II project under construction in India on Slide 5. As you may know, late last year, the Supreme Court of India overturned the allocation of 214 coal blocks, including those for OPGC II. I'm pleased to report that the project, through a new joint venture between OPGC and the government of Odisha, has resecured the rights to the same coal blocks, which can support 2,640 megawatts of new capacity. Construction on OPGC II is on schedule with this plant expected to come online in 2018.
Now turning to Slide 6, I'll discuss our construction program and development pipeline in more detail. Our construction program is the most significant driver of our 10% to 15% average annual growth and free cash flow over the next few years. This strong growth is the foundation for our commitment to 10% annual dividend growth as well as other capital allocation decisions. From 2015 through 2018, we expect to commission 7,131 megawatts of new capacity, which is a high multiple of the roughly 600 megawatts we've brought online in the 3 previous years from 2012 through 2014. In fact, already this year, we've brought online 1,312 megawatts, which is 87% of the capacity we expect to commission this year. 
Moving on to Slide 7. Our remaining 5,118 megawatts under construction are progressing well and remain on time and on budget. As a reminder, the total CapEx for our projects currently under construction is $7 billion, but AES' equity commitment is only $1.3 billion, of which all but $400 million has already been funded. As you can see, roughly 80% of this new capacity is in the Americas. We expect a return on equity from these projects of more than 15%. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'm very happy to report that we have achieved commercial operation on our 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam 6 months early. Additionally, the project reached 18 million man-hours without a lost time incident. This project provides us with a solid platform from which to grow our presence in Vietnam, where we see a number of future platform expansion opportunities. 
Moving to Slide 9. To help mitigate our hydrology risk in Panama, we recently inaugurated a 72-megawatt thermal power barge. The plant's output is contracted under a 5-year PPA. We're also looking at similar opportunities in other countries in Latin America to decrease our exposure to fluctuations in hydrology. 
Finally, looking at our growth opportunities beyond the projects currently under constructions beginning on Slide 10. We see compelling platform expansion opportunities in a number of growing markets such as Chile, Mexico, Panama and the Philippines. In more mature markets like California and the United Kingdom, we see opportunities to replace older, less efficient or noncomplying capacity. Generally, we expect our future project mix to be heavily weighted towards natural gas, renewables and energy storage as we seek to match the right offering on the future needs of each market. 
As we've said in the past, we will continue to compete all investments in growth projects against share repurchases in order to ensure that we are maximizing risk-adjusted per share returns for our shareholders. Based on the opportunities we see across our portfolio beyond 2018, we believe we can invest $300 million to $400 million of AES equity in attractive growth projects each year, which is consistent with the amount of equity we are currently contributing annually to our growth projects. This level of annual equity commitment is quite moderate, considering the expected growth in our free cash flow and continued recycling of capital from additional asset sales. We also plan to bring in financial partners on all of our larger projects as a means of improving our returns, fine-tuning our portfolios' risks exposures and having our projects vetted by other investors.
Now I'd like to highlight a couple of more significant projects in our development pipeline beginning on Slide 11. Our Southland repowering project in California with 1,400 megawatts of gas-fired and energy storage capacity is on track to begin construction in 2017. We expect to select our EPC contractor and file final permitting amendments in the next 6 months. Our development pipeline is not limited to power generation projects as we seek to realize the full value of our existing market platforms through adjacent business lengths such as enhanced LNG services, desalinization and energy storage. 
Turning to Slide 12, for example, in the Dominican Republic, we're working on opportunities to expand our existing LNG infrastructure. We're developing a second gas pipeline, which will transport natural gas from our regasification terminal to other power generators so they can convert up to 1,000 megawatts of diesel and oil-fired generation to cheaper, cleaner natural gas. We're also advancing in the development of an upgrade of our LNG import terminal to allow for reshipment of LNG. The ability to reship LNG will be an extension of our successful gas distribution business in the Dominican Republic, which supplies third-party trucks with liquefied natural gas. Both of these attractive projects will require only modest equity investments. So we expect to largely fund them with leverage capacity at the local business. 
In terms of desalinization on Slide 13, we currently have 1 200 cubic meter per hour project under construction at our Angamos power plant in Chile. Although this project is largely a modernization of our existing desal facilities at that plant, there are a number of potential desal projects in Chile to supply our mining and industrial customers. We see desal is a timely and significant opportunity in Chile and, possibly, longer term in Mexico and California, given the challenges of water supply in those markets and our many years of experience operating desal plants.
Moving on to Slide 14. We are the world leaders in battery-based energy storage with 86 megawatts of installed capacity. Although it is likely to remain relatively small in the near term, we see the potential for much larger opportunity over the next 4 or 5 years. We're encouraged by ongoing regulatory support and growing acceptance by power systems and utilities in some of AES' markets. To that end, as you may have seen, we recently announced that we have 50 megawatts under construction including the first energy storage units in the Netherlands and Northern Ireland. These projects under construction are all additions to our existing platforms. We are well-positioned to take advantage of this emerging business opportunity given AES' international portfolio and 8 years of successful and profitable experience operating battery-based energy storage.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results and full year guidance in more detail."

This quarter, we continued to benefit from our capital allocation decisions and operational improvements despite some macro headwinds. Further, as anticipated, our cash flow improved as a result of lower working",1505,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, we continued to benefit from our capital allocation decisions and operational improvements despite some macro headwinds. Further, as anticipated, our cash flow improved as a result of lower working capital requirements. We also made substantial progress toward a key financial goal of improving our credit profile by reducing parent debt, lowering interest expense and extending maturities. Today, I'll review our first quarter results including adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; and for the first time, proportional free cash flow by SBU, which we've also included in our 10-Q; then I'll cover our 2015 capital allocation plan and our 2015 guidance.
Turning to Slide 16. First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.25 was $0.01 higher than first quarter 2014. At the high level, we benefited from the following: $0.03 from capital allocation, which resulted in 13% lower parent debt and a 3% lower share count relative to last year; and a $0.01 net increase from performance of our businesses with improvements in the U.S. and Andes, partially offset by lower contributions from Brazil, Europe and Mexico Central America and the Caribbean, or MCAC. On the negative side, we were affected by a $0.02 impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which appreciated 18% against the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and euro; and a $0.01 impact from a slightly higher tax rate of 33% this year versus 30% in the first quarter of last year.
Now I'll cover our SBU's financial performance in more detail on the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 17. In the U.S., adjusted PTC increased by $31 million, driven by better availability at DPL compared to first quarter last year when a couple of DPL generation plants were not available during the polar vortex. Proportional free cash flow increased $74 million, reflecting the lower working capital requirements this year compared to during the extreme cold of last year. In Andes, PTC increased $38 million, primarily due to better availability at our plants in Chile. However, proportional free cash flow declined by $6 million due to timing of collections and higher maintenance capital expenditures.
In Brazil, PTC decreased $48 million, driven by FX and operating performance. About half the decline is driven by our generation business, Tietê. You may recall that last year, Tietê benefited from spot sales and favorable prices due to lower contract levels during the first half of the year. This benefit was more of a timing issue, as Tietê had to purchase in the spot market second half. This year, Tietê's contract levels are flat in the first and second half, so we expect contributions to be evenly distributed. Additionally, Sul, one of our utilities, had lower results due to lower sales volume and higher fixed costs. Proportional free cash flow increased $15 million, primarily driven by higher collections of pass-through energy purchases billed during 2014, offset by lower operating performance. 
In MCAC, PTC declined $15 million, largely driven by lower margins in the Dominican Republic, where revenues are partially indexed to oil prices as well as lower availability. This impact was partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama. Proportional free cash flow improved by $55 million, primarily driven by improved working capital in El Salvador and Puerto Rico. In Europe, adjusted PTC decreased by $30 million, half of which is due to lower contributions from the sales of Ebute in Nigeria and our U.K. wind businesses, and the remaining half is largely from unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Proportional free cash flow increased by $21 million, driven by higher collections at Maritza, which were 60% higher than the first quarter of 2014. 
And finally, in Asia, PTC was essentially flat after taking into account the impact from the sale of 41% of Masinloc in the third quarter of last year, offset by the one-time charge recorded at Masinloc in the first quarter of '14 related to the market spot price adjustment. Proportional free cash flow decreased $37 million due to the Masinloc sale and higher working capital requirements. 
Turning to Slide 23. In summary, overall, we earned $252 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, an increase of $9 million from last year. And we generated $265 million of proportional free cash flow, representing a doubling from $129 million in last year's first quarter. As you may recall, working capital was a drag on our results last year and is reflected in our first quarter results. We're seeing recovery. 
Now to Slide 24 in our parent capital allocation plan for the year. Regarding sources from the left-hand side, the only update from our last call is an increase of $100 million in equity proceeds from asset sales from the sale of the Armenia Mountain wind project in Pennsylvania and the sale of 40% of our interest in the IPP4 plant in Jordan. This brings our total available discretionary cash for 2015 to roughly $1.6 billion.  We continue to expect parent-free cash flow of $525 million this year, with 10% to 15% average annual growth through 2018.
Turning to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. In addition to dividend, we also plan to invest about $350 million on our subsidiaries, 60% of which is IPL and has already been funded. We've invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing of parent debt to balance asset sales and planned share buybacks. And finally, we repurchased 42 million of shares year-to-date and expect to invest at least $324 million this year, which assumes that we use $300 million of the $400 million repurchased authorized in February. This leaves $200 million of discretionary cash to be allocated this year. 
Turning to our parent debt profile on Slide 25. Since our last call, we prepaid $315 million of parent debt, bringing our total parent debt reduction since the end of 2011 to $1.5 billion or a 25% reduction. In early April, we also refinanced another $500 million in near-term parent debt maturities. These transactions resulted in a reduction in our near-term maturities to only $180 million over the next 4 years and reduced the average interest rate from 6.3% to 5.6%. We also continue to optimize the capital structure of certain subsidiaries and affiliates such as Guacolda in Chile, where $830 million in long-term debt was refinanced in April at about 4.5%, demonstrating the strong credit quality and market access of our businesses. 
Now beginning on Slide 26, I'll discuss our adjusted EPS guidance for this year, which is based on the following assumptions: currency forward curves as of March 31, which reflect roughly 10% depreciation versus the U.S. dollar compared to year-end curves for the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and the euro; commodity forward curves as of March 31, which reflect roughly a 5% to 10% decline for oil and gas; and the current outlook for hydro in Latin America, which is in line with our expectations, except in Brazil. The rainy season there is drawing to a close, and reservoir levels are currently at about 35% and are expected to be about 37% at the end of May. We believe that the government is unlikely to call for rationing this year given these levels. That said, the system continues to face a hydro generation shortfall, which has a financial impact on Tietê. We previously have built a $0.05 impact into our guidance based on having to cover 15% to 17% of our contract in the spot market. We now expect the shortfall to be 17% to 19% due to continued high thermal dispatch. We expect this will add another $0.02 to the hydro impact this year. We've also incorporated a modest decline in demand at Sul in Brazil, resulting in an incremental impact of another $0.01. 
Now turning to Slide 27. As we see discussed on our last call, our adjusted EPS guidance is $1.25 to $1.35 per share, which when we provided it in late February was based on currency and commodity curves as of December 31, the impact of updating these curves based on the 7 sub-activities we've disclosed a $0.05. However, we've been proactive in hedging our downside, which reduced the FX and commodity impact by $0.03. Further, as I just discussed, we're incorporating an additional $0.03 impact from poor hydrology and demand in Brazil. We've also included a $0.01 benefit from the completion of the Vietnam project slightly ahead of our internal projection. Bottom line is that although we're facing some headwinds, we're managing the impacts and, therefore, reaffirming our EPS guidance range. At the same time, as you can see on Slide 27, we remain confident in our portfolio's ability to generate strong cash flow. We're reaffirming our proportional free cash flow guidance of $1 billion to $1.35 billion, which after subsidiary debt pay-down provides us with about $525 million in parent free cash flow. We'll continue to create value by investing in a strong and growing cash flow to maximize returns to shareholders.
With that, I'll now pass it back to Andres."

Of course, this would be leveraged by bringing in financial partners. Now the exact amount will depend on the projected return of those projects and the value we create by buying back our share. So they will be competing. This is just to give us sort of a range where we see those projects. We also said that compared to what is currently under construction, we see a heavier weighting towards natural gas, renewables and energy storage. Now our energy storage business, I think, is quite different from, and then quite unique actually, that we have been at this for 8 years. We make money at it and we've been successful, and we have a product that integrates several different usage. So we have sort of the complete package, sort of plug-and-play. I think that's one of the reasons we were successful in the Southern California Edison bid last year. So we see this as a growing market. In the U.S., California is taking the lead by requiring utilities to have 1,325 megawatts of energy storage by 2020, and we see this trend going across the country and in different places. So again, we're very well-positioned to take advantage of it, and we have been successful. We're also opening up new markets. And the latest ones, we're already in Chile, we're looking at Northern Ireland and Netherlands. So it's one -- let's say technology, it has 3 different uses. On the one hand, you can use it for capacity release like we do in Chile, which allows you, you don't have to hold back 5% of thermal generation because you have a battery. You can use it for ancillary services as we use it in PJM with tape. And you can also use it as a peaking facility, which will be the main use in California. So their different markets; we see it developing, but we're a big company. So to really be a needle-mover, we see it a couple of years out. What we really want to be here is not too far ahead of the curve, but we want to be in sort of somewhat ahead of the curve. And that's really our strategy here, and we think we're well-positioned. So just like in the past, when I talked about bringing in partners and said this was an idea, we'll see how this develops before giving any sort of guidance about, say, larger numbers of 3 to 5 years out."

I think, first, I think we've been very good sellers and managers of our portfolio if you look at the close to $3 billion that we've raised in our asset sales since 2011 and the places we got out of and the prices we got out of. If you think of Brazil, I think starting in 2006, we've started to reduce our position in Eletropaulo. And we also spun off the telecom and sold that as well, I think, right at the right timing of the market. So actually, if you take a longer-term perspective, I think our performance in Brazil over this period has been good. Now there's no question that it's been affected by economic and political factors, but mostly hydrology, quite frankly. So thinking about our position in Brazil, we have 2,600 megawatts of hydro in Tietê. We also have about $500 million of leverage capacity, which we have not used at Tietê. So it provides us with an opportunity. And yes, as you know, there are droughts and they are cyclical. I mean, this year, we're entering into a mild -- or actually, it's been declared already, a mild to medium El Niño, which means they're going back to more sort of normal weather patterns, as we've seen in the other countries. So that will pass. Now politically, Brazil, I think it's shown on the one hand significant institutional strength given the, as everybody's aware, the issues around Petrobras and the tax authorities and the independence of the judiciary. I think they've also named a very strong Minister of Economy, Joaquim Levy. And we've had some -- been able in some small meetings with him and seen what his plans are, and then we feel very encouraged by it. So I think everybody feels that 2015 will be a difficult year in Brazil. The economy's in contraction. Tom mentioned it in his comments that we see a contraction, especially in Sul in terms of demand. But having said that, I think that if they take the right measures and move towards a primary surplus, Brazil is a country with tremendous opportunity. And you can't sort of come in and come out of large massive capital-intensive projects like ours. So you have to have a footprint there. So I think we've reduced it appropriately, and we're well-positioned to look at opportunities going forward."

And this has given us several advantages. First, we knew the markets well. Then we also had an ongoing dialogue with the regulator because one of the big issues with energy storage is to get regulatory approval because we know the benefits that it has for stabilizing the grid, but it's a question of how you're going to get paid for sometimes for those services if there's not a sort of active ancillary market. So the first steps, we've put it on Chile, we've put it in DP&L. We've also -- looking at putting it on our California platforms, possibly in the future IPL or other places. But there are 2 steps. One is really identifying the use of the energy, of the battery, and the second is getting the regulatory approval. So we see opening up markets where we're present, like the Netherlands, like Northern Ireland, and continue with that successful strategy. Now in terms of how to monetize that beyond our platforms, and really would be to their situations where we could actually install the advance-in product, as we call it, which includes our IP, includes the batteries, includes how to operate it, in the markets where we're present, we could just put it on somebody else's platform. Essentially, for example, let's say, we're selling energy to a utility and they would like to rate bait these assets, we can do that as well. So that's one way that we could grow more quickly than just say putting it in operating ourselves. And we're looking at -- we're talking to people. So again, we're very well-positioned. We just think that this is a market that has to develop. And one of the big challenges, again, is to get the appropriate regulatory approvals and also have to demonstrate how it's used. Once you put a unit into a market and people see that it functions very well, then we expect to have an increase in demand. So that's how we see going about it. Now if we put it on a platform where we have a partner, for example, say, in Chile or at IPL, that partner will participate in that asset that we're putting on. And we're really managing from a center of excellence here at corp, but pushing out the implementations into the businesses. So again, this has worked very well, and we think that this is an idea whose time has come, but we see that their U.S. market's the most immediate one. But we see this going across the world. It works particularly well, for example, on smaller grids, islands. And we're located in a lot of islands and smaller grids, from the Philippines to Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Northern Ireland, Dominican Republic. There are a lot of places you can use it or places, for example, like Chile, which due to the nature of the grid look-like island, you have certain constraints. So for all those reasons, again, we're optimistic, we think we're on the leading edge and we'll continue to push this product forward in numerous markets."

The big advantage we have is putting them onto our existing businesses and understanding these markets. And I think that we've seen situations, for example, at certain times, say, wind in Brazil, others where prices were very expensive, competition was very aggressive, and I think we're very judicious about where to put our money in. Now we've sold part of our joint venture, Silver Ridge, to people who have aggressive global plans for utility scale solar. And we did it in part because it's not on our strategy of using our platforms. We are much more efficient. And if you take all-in costs, which at the end of the day that's what matters, from development to operating these plants, even financing and rather than doing sort of 1x1 project financing, is really doing it under the umbrella of an existing business. So for example, in Chile, which is a very competitive market, and they've had about 1,000 megawatts of renewables that are coming on the grid, we're building out the 20-megawatt solar, we have permits up to 200 and we'll do it to the degree that we get PPAs. Of course, the issues with solar are that you only have energy 8 to 10 hours a day. So having the backup of an existing facility gives us a lot more leeway in terms of what we can put together. And also, technologically, we can combine this as we do in Laurel Mountain, where we combine wind with energy storage that makes a more attractive offering. So really, that's our strategy, is to put it together, not to compete just on low returns for these projects in many of the markets. And our strategy to date in terms of getting lower cost capital has really been the partnerships and bringing on partners. And I think we've been quite effective in that. To date, we have over $2.5 billion that we have raised, which is quite a lot of money if you consider it in terms of increasing our ability to do larger projects, our ability to fine-tune what our exposure is. And so we'll continue to use that in renewables as well."

So in the context of where you are, how you think things are trending, when do you think we get an update on that?"

Today we reported second quarter EPS of $0.25 and proportional free cash flow $62 million, and we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance ranges for all metrics despite facing increased headwinds from foreign currencies. 
Before Tom and I provide more color on our results for the second quarter and first half of the year, allow me to review our progress on the priorities for 2015 that I provided on our earnings call in February. 
First, we're making good progress to reach closure on key pending issues that could impact some of our businesses. At Eletropaulo in Brazil, we have had a reasonable outcome in our 4-year rate case. At Maritza in Bulgaria, important milestones have been reached towards the resolution of our outstanding accounts receivable. 
Second, we are executing on a construction program and leveraging our platforms. In April, we commissioned our 121.2 gigawatts Mong Duong plant in Vietnam 6 months early and under budget. Our remaining $7 billion construction program is advancing on schedule, and we expect to bring 6 gigawatts online by the end of 2018. In July, we also broke ground on 3 new energy storage projects, including our first 2 in Europe. 
Third, we are expanding our access to capital through partnerships at the project and business level. Today I'm very pleased to announce that we are forming a new 50/50 joint venture with Grupo BAL to invest in power and related infrastructure projects in Mexico. 
And finally, regarding capital allocation. We had delivered on our commitment to invest at least $325 million in share repurchases. Today we are announcing that we intend to utilize the approximately $100 million left on our buyback authorization during the remainder of this year. In 2015, between buybacks and dividends, we will return $700 million to shareholders or approximately 8% of our current market cap. I will provide more detail on these achievements in a moment, but now I'd like to briefly discuss our financial results and our expectations for the remainder of the year on Slide 4.
Our year-to-date 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.50 is in line with our results of last year, and our proportional free cash flow of $327 million is well ahead of first half 2014 results. Our earnings and cash flow are typically weighted towards the second half of the year. We expect our second half results to benefit from improved availability due to less plant maintenance, better hydrology in Latin America and higher collections in Bulgaria and the Dominican Republic. Although there's still a lot of work to be done to deliver on stronger cash flow in the second half of the year, we remain confident that we will achieve our financial guidance for 2015.
Now let's discuss some key issues on our businesses in Brazil on Slide 5. As we discussed on prior calls, we have seen a decline in electricity consumption in Brazil, which is the result of the economic recession and higher energy prices. Today economists are projecting a 2% contraction of GDP for 2015. In addition, hydrology is leading to higher electricity prices by requiring the dispatch of more expensive thermal energy. As a result, we are forecasting a 4% year-over-year decrease in volume at our Brazilian utilities in 2015. Nonetheless, we had already factored in the softness in our prior forecast. As a reminder, every 1% change in volume in our Brazilian utilities has a $7 million pretax impact on our bottom line.
Turning now to slide -- hydrology on Slide 6. In Brazil, we have seen rainfall improve more than expected since our last call. In July, rainfall was 156% of the long-term average, and reservoir levels are projected to be 37% by the end of August, materially higher than the 20% level at the beginning of the year. Improvement in hydrology in Brazil is reflected in spot prices, which are now around 120 real per megawatt hour, significantly lower than last year. We now see the risk of rationing electricity in Brazil in 2015 as remote, but we continue to expect a negative earning impact of $0.07 per share from poor hydrology this year.
In Panama, we're observing a return to normal hydrology and spot prices are about $100 per megawatt hour or 1/3 of the prices we saw last year. In Colombia, our 1 gigawatt hydro plant Chivor is experiencing stronger inflows, close to the historical average, while in the rest of the country, inflows are 90% of the long-term average.
Turning to Slide 7. We have received approval for Eletropaulo's 4-year tariff reset. This outcome sets a strong foundation for predictable cash flow and earnings from this business through 2019. Lastly, we have successfully negotiated the restructuring of Brasiliana, where we own various businesses in partnership with BNDES, the state-owned development bank. Through this restructuring, we're separating our generation business, Tietê, from other businesses under the Brasiliana umbrella. This separation will give us more control of operations and capital allocation decisions at Tietê. Once this transaction is completed, we will be in a more favorable position to grow Tietê by tapping into approximately $500 million of debt capacity at this business.
Turning to Slide 8. As you may recall, in April, Maritza signed an MOU with its taker NEK whereby Maritza would receive full payment of all arrears, which as of June 30 were $281 million, in exchange for a reduction in the capacity price of the long-term PPA. Since our last call, we have secured the required approvals from the project lenders and from the Bulgarian regulator. At the same time, the government of Bulgaria has taken concrete steps to improve NEK's financial position. Parliament has approved the energy sector reforms to support NEK through a new 5% tax on generators income as well as allocating all proceeds from the sale of the state's CO2 allowances to NEK. 
Finally, the regulator announced an increase in the tariff of up to 20% for certain classes of industrial users and reduced NEK's commitment to procure more expensive renewable energy. These steps will strengthen NEK's financial position and allow the Bulgarian public sector to raise the necessary financing to pay their outstanding receivables. We expect to sign a binding agreement and collect on all arrears in the second half of the year. Collecting from NEK will be an important contributor to the improvement in our free cash flow in the second half of the year.
Now let's turn to our progress towards our strategic objectives beginning with construction on Slide 9. Our construction program is the most important driver of our 10% to 15% average annual growth in free cash flow over the next few years. This strong growth in cash flow is the foundation for our commitment to a 10% annual dividend increase as well us all other capital allocation decisions. From 2015 through 2018, we expect to commission 7 gigawatts of new capacity in comparison with the roughly 600 megawatts we brought online in the 3 years from 2012 through 2014. Through June, we've already brought online 1.3 gigawatts, which is nearly 90% of the capacity we plan to commission in 2015.
Moving onto Slide 10. Our remaining 5.8 gigawatts under construction are progressing well and remain on time and on budget. As you can see on the slide, roughly 80% of new capacity is in the Americas. As a reminder, total CapEx for our projects currently under construction is $7 billion, but AES commitment is only $1.3 billion, and all but $400 million has already been funded. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of more than 15%.
Turning now to Slide 11. As we discussed on our last call, we achieved commercial operation on our 1.2 gigawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam 6 months early and under budget. The plan is operating at full load rapidly growing demand for electricity and provides us with a solid platform in the country. 
Moving onto Slide 12. We are the world leader in battery-based energy storage with 86 megawatts of installed capacity. We are seeing growing regulatory support and greater acceptance by utilities in our markets. As a result, we recently broke ground on 3 new energy storage projects totaling 40 megawatts in 3 countries. We are consolidating our global leadership and now have a total of 70 megawatts of energy storage under construction that we expect to come online through 2016 and 200 more megawatts in late-stage development. We are very well positioned to continue to take advantage of this emerging business opportunity given AES' portfolio and 8 years of successful and profitable experience operating battery-based energy storage.
Turning to the new joint venture we're forming in Mexico on Slide 13. Today we announced that we signed an MOU with Grupo BAL, a Mexican business conglomerate with a market cap of $11 billion to pursue new power, and natural gas projects. Grupo BAL is one of the largest and most respected business groups in Mexico, and one of Grupo BAL's subsidiary, Grupo is the of our plant in Mexico. As you may know, Mexico is in the process of implementing new energy sector reforms which will allow for greater private sector participation. Over the next 10 years, it is estimated that Mexico will need 25 gigawatts of new or replacement generation. We have owned and operated a successful generation business in Mexico for more than 15 years. And now with Grupo BAL, we are poised to take advantage of the opening of the energy sector.
Turning to Slide 14. Looking at growth opportunities beyond our projects currently under construction, all of which we expect to complete by 2018. Our future project mix is likely to be heavily weighted towards natural gas and renewables while using our platforms to provide energy storage, desalinization and LNG-related services. In particular, in arid and semi-arid region such as Chile, where our plants on the coast are already providing desalinization for their own needs, long-term water contracts can be an attractive business. Using existing infrastructure and permits significantly reduces the cost of providing desalinated water to third-party such as municipal water authorities, mining and industrial customers. Based on all of the opportunities we see across our portfolio, we believe we can invest $300 million to $400 million of AES equity in attractive growth projects each year, which is consistent with the amount of equity we are currently contributing to our growth projects. This amount of equity investment is quite moderate considering the strong growth in our free cash flow. In addition, we can use the debt capacity at our existing businesses such as Brazil, Chile, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic to fund growth projects. Recycling capital has been and will remain an integral part of our strategy. Over the past 4 years, we have raised $3.1 billion in asset sale proceeds and another $2.5 billion in partner equity at the business and project level. These actions have permitted us to reposition our portfolio, pay down our debt, improve risk-adjusted returns and accelerate our growth profile. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize that as we have demonstrated to date, we will continue to complete all new investments against share repurchase is in order to ensure that we are maximizing risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. To that end, as you can see on Slide 15, we are returning $700 million to our shareholders in 2015, which is 8% of our current market cap. We have returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders in September 2011 and reduced parent debt by $1.5 billion or 25% while significant lengthening its average tenor.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter and year-to-date results and full year guidance in more detail."

Our first half results and the reaffirmation of our guidance demonstrate the benefits of our proactive actions to mitigate the impact from currency devaluation and other macro factors that we've experienced over the last several months. Today I'll review our second quarter results, including adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU, proportional free cash flow by SBU, then I'll cover our 2015 guidance and our 2015 capital allocation plan.
Turning to Slide 17. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.25 was $0.03 lower than second quarter 2014. At a high level, we were negatively impacted by the following: $0.04 operating impacts, including timing of plant maintenance in certain businesses as well as lower demand and contracting strategy in Brazil. These were offset by favorable hydrology in Panama and Colombia and new businesses coming online. We had a $0.02 impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which appreciated roughly 20% against the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and the euro. Finally, a $0.02 net impact from other adjustments, primarily the favorable reversal of liabilities in Brazil and Kazakhstan in 2014 offset by the favorable reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo in 2015. On positive side, we benefited $0.04 from a lower tax rate of 30% this year versus 40% in the second quarter last year and a penny from capital allocation of net of asset sales, which resulted in 13% lower parent debt and a 4% lower share count relative to last year.
Now I'll cover our SBU's financial performance in more detail on the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 18. In the U.S. adjusted PTC decreased by $24 million due to planned maintenance in Hawaii and at as well as lower win generation at Buffalo in Texas. proportional free cash was roughly flat, reflecting working capital recovery and lower interest at DPL. 
In Andes, PTC decreased $23 million, primarily due to timing of planned maintenance in Chile and Argentina as well as a weaker Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow declined by $37 million due to lower earnings and a higher tax payment at Chivor in Colombia versus last year. 
In Brazil, PTC decreased $74 million. In addition to the $17 million impact from a depreciation of the Brazilian real, the decline was driven by the approximately $13 million net impact from liability reversals in each period at our distribution businesses, Sul and Eletropaulo. recall last year our generation business Tietê benefited from spot sales at favorable prices due to lower contract levels during the first half of the year. This benefit was more of a timing as Tietê purchasing the stock market in the second half of. This year Tiete's contract levels are flat in the first and second half, so we expect contributions to be evenly distributed. Last but not least, Sul has been affected by lower demand and higher costs. proportional free cash flow decreased $18 million, primarily driven by lower operating income at Tietê that I just discussed. 
In MCAC, PTC increased $11 million, largely driven by improved hydro conditions in Panama where we generated more this year versus buying in the spot market last year. Panama also benefited from of operations of our 72 megawatts thermal power barge.  Free cash flow improved by $12 million, primarily driven by improved operating performance. 
In Europe, adjusted PTC decreased by $32 million mainly due to lower energy prices and the timing of planned maintenance at Kilroot in the U.K. Despite the decline in earnings,  free cash flow was up $3 million, largely by improved working capital at Maritza. 
Finally, in Asia, PTC increased $7 million resulting from the early of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam partially offset by the sale of minority interest in Masinloc in the Philippines in '14. Proportional free cash flow was roughly flat.
Turning to Slide 24. Overall, we earned $251 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $89 million from last year, and we generating $62 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $15 million. 
As you can see on Slide 25, year-to-date adjusted PTC declined $80 million, largely driven by lower demand and contracting strategy in Brazil, a stronger U.S. dollar as well as net impact from the reversal of liabilities in Brazil and Europe. These negative impacts were largely offset by the contributions from new businesses that came online earlier this year and our capital allocation decisions. Our proportional free cash flow increased $151 million to $327 million, primarily due to higher contributions in the U.S. and MCAC, including higher collections at DPL and improved working capital in Puerto Rico. 
Year-to-date adjusted PTC and proportional free cash flow by SBU are in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Now to Slide 26, comparing our first half results to our full year guidance. Our earnings and cash flow tend to do more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. Consistent with our prior expectations, in the second half of 2015, we expect EPS to benefit from improved availability as a result of planned maintenance that was completed earlier in the year in Chile, the Dominican Republic and the U.S, improved hydro conditions in Panama and Colombia, seasonality related to contract generation businesses in the U.S. and Chile as well as IPO, the previously expected benefit from tax opportunities at certain businesses, and finally contributions from Mong Duong in Vietnam, which came online in the first half of the year.
Regarding proportional free cash flow. Improved results in the second half of the year versus the first half are driven in part by higher operating performance in the second half, consistent with our earnings profile. The remaining increase is largely attributable to lower pension and fuel payments at in the U.S, timing of income tax payments and VAT collections higher collection of receivables in the Dominican Republic and collection of receivables in Bulgaria, a portion of which will be used at the business for deleveraging and fuel payments. 
Bottom line is that although we have to execute in our plan, we feel confident in our ability to meet our objectives for the year, and we are reaffirming our guidance on all metrics. Our reaffirmed guidance is based on forward curves as of June 30, reflecting a benefit of a couple of pennies [ph] relative to our prior year guidance, which is based on March 31. curves as of July 31 were effectively back to where we were as of March 31. Our guidance also assumes the current outlook for hydro in Latin America, which is in line with our expectations, and an unchanged full year tax rate of 31% to 33% versus year-to-date 2015 rate of 31%. Assumptions and sensitivities for our guidance are in the appendix of today's deck. 
Now to Slide 27 and our parent capital allocation plan for the year. Sources on the left-hand side reflect total available discretionary cash for 2015 of roughly $1.65 billion, which is $70 million higher than our last call. As a reminder, we previously announced asset sale proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in Jordan as well as the sale of the Armenia Mountain wind farm. Today we're also announcing the sale of our solar assets in Spain, bringing our total asset sale proceeds this year to $573 million. We're also expecting an additional $45 million in return of capital from operating businesses, which along with our parent free cash flow provides us with nearly $600 million available for dividend payments and growth, incremental share repurchases and other potential investments. 
In terms of incremental sources of discretionary cash, as Andres mentioned, we'll continue to evaluate additional asset sale opportunities, which could be $200 million to $300 million annually on average but may be lumpy year-to-year. 
Now to use this on the right-hand slide, we plan to invest about $350 million in our subsidiaries, 60% of which is at IPL and has already been funded. We've invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing parent debt, leaving us with only $180 million in parent debt maturities through 2018. Finally, in addition to dividend, we're investing $420 million in our shares, which is $100 million more than what we committed to on our last call. This brings total cash return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $700 million for the year. We'll continue to be investment opportunities to maximize per share value for shareholders. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andres."

To summarize, we continue to make steady progress on our objectives. Specifically, we're pulling all levers to achieve our financial objectives despite the headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil, lower foreign exchange and commodity prices. As I noted, overall, hydrology in Latin America is improving as a result of the El Niño phenomenon. We have achieved a number of milestones towards resolving Maritza's outstanding receivables after signing an MOU with NEK in April. We expect to collect outstanding receivables in the second half of the year. We have completed the 1.2 gigawatts Mong Duong project in Vietnam 6 months ahead of schedule, and we're making good progress on the remaining 5.8 gigawatts under construction. We're bringing in financial partners to leverage our platform and maximize overall returns by forming a joint venture with Grupo BAL, a strong partner with significant presence in Mexico. And in 2015, we are investing more than $1 billion in returning cash to our shareholders and debt pay downs, in addition to the $350 million we are investing in profitable growth projects. 
In conclusion, in line with the plans we laid out on previous calls, we continue to leverage our platforms and allocate our discretionary cash to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
Now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

So I think that's the key component so we're on track there. I would say hydrology, in July, was quite frankly a little bit ahead of what we expected. And FX is more or less in line with what we expect. I'd say, if anything, the demand in Brazil is softer, perhaps a little bit softer than we expected even though we had those numbers in. So overall, we're kind of on track. I think the main points are that we had some seasonality and some of it, in terms of collections, we tend to collect more in the Dominican Republic. We have the Bulgarian -- those are 2 discrete factors in the second half. And then we had a number of planned maintenance in the first half, which we won't have in the second half.

Right now, Brazil is on the certainly not at the peak of one of these patterns. I will remind people I think 2, 3 years ago, a lot of questions I would get on these calls why wasn't I investing more in Brazil and that we were slow. But we did at the time and we continue to do today is we only invest when we see long-term value. And we really see the value, not quite frankly get caught in the trends. Brazil is having a recession this year. It will probably have a flat 2017 and is expected -- 2016, sorry and expected to pick up in 2017. Brazil is a big market. It's a big country which again has great potential. And I think that as a company in the Americas, we should have a presence in Brazil. Now of course, all of our assets we look at what we consider in our long-term value, what we could sell them for and how they contribute to a balanced portfolio. So overall, what I would say is that I agree that the economic situations looks challenging in Brazil, but realize this is a country with tremendous potential that could come back and we can't come in and out on a short-term basis. And the final thing is, look, we have been very prudent about investments in Brazil. We still have $500 million [ph] of debt capacity at Tietê. So growth in Brazil will come from leveraging the Brazilian businesses. So I hope that answers your question, but I think that the point is there are cyclical patterns. Brazil has a lot of capacity to rebound. And as always, when times where very good in Brazil, we were always looking at what's the value. And I will remind people that we sold a lot in Brazil at the peak. We sold our telecom business there for $1 billion. We also sold 50% of our holdings in Eletropaulo back in '05.

I think, of course, if you look take longer-term view in terms of the past coming to the present, pricing has deteriorated in Argentina. No question about that. On the other hand, I think we've faired very well from a regulatory position because, as you know, until last year, we are exporting energy from Argentina to Chile through our plant. We also have the only coal plant in the country. So we have been selling energy under which in the past was more favorable than it is today. But I'd say in general, we have always been making positive earnings in Argentina. So even though there are less, say, than they were 4, 5 years ago, they continue to be positive. We have been receiving 96% payment on our accounts receivable. Some of these are through bonds. these bonds are dollarized. They pay interest. And for example, the plant where we have a considerable number of these bonds are basically being used to fund that plant. We're going to receive that plant, a proportion of it very soon. It's being commissioned. So I'd say overall in Argentina, despite the challenging economic circumstances, we've done well. The one thing is we haven't been able to pay dividends out of Argentina for the last 2 years. Now looking forward, what do we see? I think the elections in October, the 2 leading candidates, either 1 would be favorable. I think you'll have a gradual return to a more market-based pricing and a listing of exchange controls. So we have a tremendous asset base in Argentina. Of course, we're not putting any new money in it at this stage, but I think we've handled it well. And I firmly believe that within a year or 2, we'll be paying dividends out of Argentina. It is basically considerably developed country and quite wealthy.

And the 300 to 400 is a general range that's a number were at the last couple of years. You go back, I think, 3 years, it was more in the mid-2s. So it's just a general indication."

And we have our existing plans which will be outside this joint venture. However, going forward, it's exclusive on both sides. It will exclusive look at new deals. there's no sort of target that we will invest X amount. It's really that we will look at that these projects together. We both bring strength. We bring the global size, our successful ENC experience, our ability to manage these plants, and they bring the local component and knowledge of the sectors. So Mexico is opening up the energy sector. They are, I think, going to be a considerable number of bids for power plants, not only of but also of private sector clients. And also, with our strategy of using our platforms for adjacencies such as desalinization or energy storage or, for example, LNG services, we can add those on. So this is going forward exclusive 50/50. We both have to agree to make an investment. If 1 partner does not agree with the investment, the other one can make it on its own. So this is I think a very favorable for both sides. It gives us a lot of flexibility and it's really aiming to leverage off hours trends and the good thing is we know each other we been working together for more than a decade."

And the numbers we gave her weighted average for Sul and Eletropaulo. The decline in demand is stronger in Sul than it has been in Eletropaulo. I think we're looking at pretty much flat demand for next year and then growing moderately after that. I mean, long-term growth in Brazil, what you normally expect is about 3% to 4% has been the historical average over the last 10 years. The second is Brasiliana affecting Eletropaulo, which as you know in 2005, we sold down 50% of our holdings, both us and BNDES of Eletropaulo. And we basically took that money and delevered the company. Then in 2011, we spun off the telecom and sold that. So right now, between the 2 is we have had 32%, that is Brasiliana has it, we have 16%, roughly a little bit more than 16%. I don't really think that the Brasiliana structure has been affecting Eletropaulo directly. I think that the distributors have been I think more fairly treated over the past 6 months than they had before, and that's why you see the recovery in the price. I mean, Eletropaulo stocks should be up, I believe, about 70% in dollars this year. And it's not the sectors -- the best-performing within the sector by a considerable margin. I think part of that was a drop also more for strongly because some of the let's say decisions against us. But you got to go decision on our regulatory asset base, the has been raised almost 8%. So these are all favorable things. Now unquestionably, other than the regulator part, which is in the market is recognizing, it's making a certain investments to continue to improve quality of service, and it will depend on the recovery of the Brazilian economy. I believe that the Brazilian government is doing the right thing at this time and taking some very brave decisions, including cutting spending, raising interest rates. And that these will have good long-term effects, but certainly, they're very tough in the short term, but I commend the bravery. I don't know if that answers your question. What we see in Eletropaulo is a tough '16 -- sorry, tough '15, more moderate '16 and a recovery more in '17, '18."

We see the probability of rationing this year is very long. And there are 2 drivers. One, the government is been a very good job of basically running thermals and saving water. And the rains did come in considerably stronger. I mean, quite frankly, as of mid-July, the reservoir levels were at 41%, which is very high. They should be declining at this time of the year. So the likelihood of rationing this year, not to say it's impossible, is very remote. And if rains continue as expected, it's not very likely in '16, again assuming the government continues this policy. In addition to that, you've had a decline in demand. So you put those 2 together and again, it's a much stronger position vis-à-vis having rationing this year and next than it was before.

And the other thing is, of course, capital allocation and it will also depend on hydrology. I mean, if we have continued good hydrology, and specifically, for example, in the case of Chivor, Chivor typically has a very good basin that it's in. So it tends to have less volatile hydrology than the rest of Colombia. So when you have like now El Niño, it's getting the rest of Colombia is dry and actually Chivor is at average. So then actually you got a better prices for the energy you sell that haven't had contracted. And finally, we expect some normalization of the currencies as well. So all these things that can cause this is now I agree '16, if we look at the next 3 years, '16 is the toughest year because '17 and '18, we have a lot more projects coming online.

Today, we reported second quarter EPS of $0.25 and proportional free cash flow $62 million, and we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance ranges for all metrics despite facing increased headwinds from foreign currencies. 
Before Tom and I provide more color on our results for the second quarter and first half of the year, allow me to review our progress on the priorities for 2015 that I provided on our earnings call in February. 
First, we're making good progress to reach closure on key pending issues that could impact some of our businesses. At Eletropaulo in Brazil, we have had a reasonable outcome in our 4-year rate case. At Maritza in Bulgaria, important milestones have been reached towards the resolution of our outstanding accounts receivable. 
Second, we are executing on a construction program and leveraging our platforms. In April, we commissioned our 1.2 gigawatt Mong Duong plant in Vietnam 6 months early and under budget. Our remaining $7 billion construction program is advancing on schedule, and we expect to bring 6 gigawatts online by the end of 2018. In July, we also broke ground on 3 new energy storage projects, including our first 2 in Europe. 
Third, we're expanding our access to capital through partnerships at the project and business level. Today, I'm very pleased to announce that we are forming a new 50/50 joint venture with Grupo BAL to invest in power and related infrastructure projects in Mexico. 
And finally, regarding capital allocation. We had delivered on our commitment to invest at least $325 million in share repurchases. Today, we are announcing that we intend to utilize the approximately $100 million left on our buyback authorization during the remainder of this year. In 2015, between buybacks and dividends, we will return $700 million to shareholders or approximately 8% of our current market cap. 
I will provide more detail on these achievements in a moment, but now, I'd like to briefly discuss our financial results and our expectations for the remainder of the year on Slide 4.
Our year-to-date 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.50 is in line with our results of last year, and our proportional free cash flow of $327 million is well ahead of first half 2014 results. Our earnings and cash flow are typically weighted towards the second half of the year. We expect our second half results to benefit from improved availability due to less plant maintenance, better hydrology in Latin America and higher collections in Bulgaria and the Dominican Republic. Although there's still a lot of work to be done to deliver on stronger cash flow in the second half of the year, we remain confident that we will achieve our financial guidance for 2015.
Now let's discuss some key issues at our businesses in Brazil on Slide 5. As we discussed on prior calls, we have seen a decline in electricity consumption in Brazil, which is the result of the economic recession and higher energy prices. Today economists are projecting a 2% contraction of GDP for 2015. In addition, hydrology is leading to high electricity prices by requiring the dispatch of more expensive thermal energy. As a result, we are forecasting a 4% year-over-year decrease in volume at our Brazilian utilities in 2015. Nonetheless, we had already factored in this softness in our prior forecast. As a reminder, every 1% change in volume in our Brazilian utilities has a $7 million pretax impact on our bottom line.
Turning now to slide -- hydrology on Slide 6. In Brazil, we have seen rainfall improve more than expected since our last call. In July, rainfall was 156% of the long-term average, and reservoir levels are projected to be 37% by the end of August, materially higher than the 20% level at the beginning of the year. Improvement in hydrology in Brazil is reflected in spot prices, which are now around BRL 120 per megawatt hour, significantly lower than last year. We now see the risk of rationing electricity in Brazil in 2015 as remote, but we continue to expect a negative earning impact of $0.07 per share from poor hydrology this year.
In Panama, we're observing a return to normal hydrology and spot prices are about $100 per megawatt hour or 1/3 of the prices we saw last year. In Colombia, our 1 gigawatt hydro plant Chivor is experiencing stronger inflows, close to the historical average, while in the rest of the country, inflows are 90% of the long-term average.
Turning to Slide 7. We have received approval for Eletropaulo's 4-year tariff reset. This outcome sets a strong foundation for predictable cash flow and earnings from this business through 2019. 
Lastly, we have successfully negotiated the restructuring of Brasiliana, where we own various businesses in partnership with BNDES, the state-owned development bank. Through this restructuring, we're separating our generation business, Tietê, from other businesses under the Brasiliana umbrella. This separation will give us more control of operations and capital allocation decisions at Tietê. Once this transaction is completed, we will be in a more favorable position to grow Tietê by tapping into approximately $500 million of debt capacity at this business.
Turning to Slide 8. As you may recall, in April, Maritza signed an MOU with its offtaker, NEK, whereby Maritza would receive full payment of all arrears, which as of June 30, were $281 million, in exchange for a reduction in the capacity price of the long-term PPA. Since our last call, we have secured the required approvals from the project lenders and from the Bulgarian regulator. At the same time, the government of Bulgaria has taken concrete steps to improve NEK's financial position. Parliament has approved the energy sector reforms to support NEK through a new 5% tax on generators  income, as well as allocating all proceeds from the sale of the state's CO2 allowances to NEK. 
Finally, the regulator announced an increase in the tariff of up to 20% for certain classes of industrial users and reduced NEK's commitment to procure more expensive renewable energy. These steps will strengthen NEK's financial position and allow the Bulgarian public sector to raise the necessary financing to pay their outstanding receivables. We expect to sign a binding agreement and collect on all arrears in the second half of the year. Collecting from NEK will be an important contributor to the improvement in our free cash flow in the second half of the year.
Now let's turn to our progress towards our strategic objectives, beginning with construction on Slide 9. Our construction program is the most important driver of our 10% to 15% average annual growth in free cash flow over the next few years. This strong growth in cash flow is the foundation for our commitment to a 10% annual dividend increase, as well as all other capital allocation decisions. From 2015 through 2018, we expect to commission 7 gigawatts of new capacity in comparison with the roughly 600 megawatts we brought online in the 3 years from 2012 through 2014. Through June, we've already brought online 1.3 gigawatts, which is nearly 90% of the capacity we plan to commission in 2015.
Moving onto Slide 10. Our remaining 5.8 gigawatts under construction are progressing well and remain on time and on budget. As you can see on the slide, roughly 80% of new capacity is in the Americas. As a reminder, total CapEx for our projects currently under construction is $7 billion, but AES' echoed commitment is only $1.3 billion, and all but $400 million has already been funded. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of more than 15%.
Turning now to Slide 11. As we discussed on our last call, we achieved commercial operation on our 1.2 gigawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam 6 months early and under budget. The plan is operating at full load and will help meet Vietnam's rapidly growing demand for electricity and provides us with a solid platform in the country. 
Moving on to Slide 12. We are the world leader in battery-based energy storage, with 86 megawatts of installed capacity. We are seeing growing regulatory support and greater acceptance by utilities in our markets. As a result, we recently broke ground on 3 new energy storage projects totaling 40 megawatts in 3 countries. We are consolidating our global leadership and now have a total of 70 megawatts of energy storage under construction that we expect to come online through 2016 and 200 more megawatts in late-stage development. We are very well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this emerging business opportunity given AES' portfolio and 8 years of successful and profitable experience operating battery-based energy storage.
Turning to the new joint venture we're forming in Mexico on Slide 13. Today we announced that we signed an MOU with Grupo BAL, a Mexican business conglomerate with a market cap of $11 billion to pursue new power, desalinization and natural gas projects. Grupo BAL is one of the largest and most respected business groups in Mexico, and one of Grupo BAL's subsidiaries, Grupo Penoles, is the offtaker of our TEP plant in Mexico. As you may know, Mexico is in the process of implementing new energy sector reforms which will allow for greater private sector participation. Over the next 10 years, it is estimated that Mexico will need 25 gigawatts of new or replacement generation. We have owned and operated a successful generation business in Mexico for more than 15 years. And now, with Grupo BAL, we are poised to take advantage of the opening of the energy sector.
Turning to Slide 14. Looking at growth opportunities beyond our projects currently under construction, all of which we expect to complete by 2018, our future project mix is likely to be heavily weighted towards natural gas and renewables while using our platforms to provide energy storage, desalinization and LNG-related services. In particular, in arid and semi-arid regions such as Chile, where our plants on the coast are already providing desalinization for their own needs, long-term water desalinated contracts can be an attractive business. Using existing infrastructure and permits significantly reduces the cost of providing desalinated water to third-parties such as municipal water authorities, mining and industrial customers. Based on all of the opportunities we see across our portfolio, we believe we can invest $300 million to $400 million of AES equity in attractive growth projects each year, which is consistent with the amount of equity we are currently contributing to our growth projects. This amount of equity investment is quite moderate considering the strong growth in our free cash flow. In addition, we can use the debt capacity at our existing businesses such as Brazil, Chile, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic to fund growth projects. 
Recycling capital has been and will remain an integral part of our strategy. Over the past 4 years, we have raised $3.1 billion in asset sale proceeds and another $2.5 billion in partner equity at the business and project level. These actions have permitted us to reposition our portfolio, pay down our debt, improve risk-adjusted returns and accelerate our growth profile. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize that as we have demonstrated to date, we will continue to complete all new investments against share repurchases in order to ensure that we are maximizing risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. To that end, as you can see on Slide 15, we are returning $700 million to our shareholders in 2015, which is 8% of our current market cap. We have returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders since September 2011 and reduced parent debt by $1.5 billion, or 25%, while significantly lengthening its average tenor.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter and year-to-date results and full-year guidance in more detail."

Our first half results and the reaffirmation of our guidance demonstrate the benefits of our proactive actions to mitigate the impact from currency devaluation and other macro factors that we've experienced over",1439,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Our first half results and the reaffirmation of our guidance demonstrate the benefits of our proactive actions to mitigate the impact from currency devaluation and other macro factors that we've experienced over the last several months. Today I'll review our second quarter results, including adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; proportional free cash flow by SBU; then I'll cover our 2015 guidance and our 2015 capital allocation plan.
Turning to Slide 17. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.25 was $0.03 lower than second quarter 2014. At a high level, we were negatively impacted by the following: $0.04 operating impacts, including timing of planned maintenance in certain businesses, as well as lower demand and contracting strategy in Brazil. These were offset by favorable hydrology in Panama and Colombia and new businesses coming online. We had a $0.02 impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which appreciated roughly 20% against the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and the euro. Finally, a $0.02 net impact from other adjustments, primarily the favorable reversal of liabilities in Brazil and Kazakhstan in 2014, offset by the favorable reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo in 2015. On positive side, we benefited $0.04 from a lower tax rate of 30% this year versus 40% in the second quarter last year and $0.01 from capital allocation net of asset sales, which resulted in 13% lower parent debt and a 4% lower share count relative to last year.
Now I'll cover our SBU's financial performance in more detail on the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 18. 
n the U.S., adjusted PTC decreased by $24 million due to planned maintenance in Hawaii and at IPL, as well as lower wind generation at Buffalo Gap in Texas. Proportional free cash was roughly flat, reflecting working capital recovery and lower interest at DPL. 
In Andes, PTC decreased $23 million, primarily due to the timing of planned maintenance in Chile and Argentina, as well as a weaker Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow declined by $37 million due to lower earnings and a higher tax payment at Chivor in Colombia versus last year. 
In Brazil, PTC decreased $74 million. In addition to the $17 million impact from the depreciation of the Brazilian real, the decline was driven by the approximately $13 million net impact from liability reversals in each period at our distribution businesses Sul and Eletropaulo. You may also recall that last year, our generation business, Tietê, benefited from spot sales at favorable prices due to lower contract levels during the first half of the year. This benefit was more of a timing issue as Tietê at the purchase in the spot market in the second half. This year Tiete's contract levels are flat in the first and second half, so we expect contributions to be evenly distributed. Last but not least, Sul has been affected by lower demand and higher costs. Proportional free cash flow decreased $18 million, primarily driven by lower operating income at Tietê that I just discussed. 
In MCAC, PTC increased $11 million, largely driven by improved hydro conditions in Panama where we generated more this year versus buying in the spot market last year. Panama also benefited from the commencement of operations of our 72 megawatt thermal power barge.  Proportional free cash flow improved by $12 million, primarily driven by improved operating performance. 
In Europe, adjusted PTC decreased by $32 million, mainly due to lower energy prices and the timing of planned maintenance at Kilroot in the U.K. Despite the decline in earnings,  proportional free cash flow was up $3 million, largely by improved working capital at Maritza. 
Finally in Asia, PTC increased $7 million, resulting from the early commencement of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam, partially offset by the sale of minority interest in Masinloc in the Philippines in '14. Proportional free cash flow was roughly flat.
Turning to Slide 24. Overall, we earned $251 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $89 million from last year, and we generated $62 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $15 million. 
As you can see on Slide 25, year-to-date adjusted PTC declined $80 million, largely driven by lower demand and contracting strategy in Brazil, a stronger U.S. dollar, as well as the net impact from the reversal of liabilities in Brazil and Europe. These negative impacts were largely offset by the contributions from new businesses that came online earlier this year and our capital allocation decisions. Our proportional free cash flow increased $151 million to $327 million, primarily due to higher contributions from the U.S. and MCAC, including higher collections at DP&L and improved working capital in Puerto Rico. 
Year-to-date, adjusted PTC and proportional free cash flow by SBU are in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Now to Slide 26. Comparing our first half results to our full year guidance, our earnings and cash flow tend to do more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. Consistent with our prior expectations, in the second half of 2015, we expect EPS to benefit from improved availability as a result of planned maintenance that was completed earlier in the year in Chile, the Dominican Republic and the U.S.; improved hydro conditions in Panama and Colombia; seasonality related to contract generation businesses in the U.S. and Chile, as well as IPL; the previously expected benefit from tax opportunities at certain businesses; and finally, contributions from Mong Duong in Vietnam, which came online in the first half of the year.
Regarding proportional free cash flow, improved results in the second half of the year versus the first half are driven in part by higher operating performance in the second half, consistent with our earnings profile. The remaining increase is largely attributable to lower pension and fuel payments at IPL in the U.S.; timing of income tax payments and VAT collections at Gener; higher collection of receivables in the Dominican Republic; and collection of receivables in Bulgaria, a portion of which will be used at the business for deleveraging and fuel payments. 
Bottom line is that although we have to execute on our plan, we feel confident in our ability to meet our objectives for the year, and we are reaffirming our guidance on all metrics. 
Our reaffirmed guidance is based on forward curves as of June 30, reflecting a benefit of a couple of pennies relative to our prior guidance, which is based on March 31. Plain curves as of July 31 were effectively back to where we were as of March 31. 
Our guidance also assumes the current outlook for hydro in Latin America, which is in line with our expectations, in an unchanged full year tax rate of 31% to 33% versus year-to-date 2015 rate of 31%. Assumptions and sensitivities for our guidance are in the appendix of today's deck. 
Now to Slide 27 and our parent capital allocation plan for the year. Sources on the left-hand side reflect total available discretionary cash for 2015 of roughly $1.65 billion, which is $70 million higher than our last call. As a reminder, we previously announced asset sale proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in IPALCO in Jordan as well, as the sale of the Armenia Mountain wind farm. Today, we are also announcing the sale of our solar assets in Spain, bringing our total asset sale proceeds this year to $573 million. We're also expecting an additional $45 million in return of capital from operating businesses, which along with our parent free cash flow, provides us with nearly $600 million available for dividend payments and growth, incremental share repurchases and other potential investments. 
In terms of incremental sources of discretionary cash, as Andres mentioned, we'll continue to evaluate additional asset sale opportunities, which could be $200 million to $300 million annually on average, but may be lumpy year-to-year. 
Now to use this on the right-hand side of the slide, we plan to invest about $350 million in our subsidiaries, 60% of which is at IPL and has already been funded. We've invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing parent debt, leaving us with only $180 million in parent debt maturities through 2018. 
Finally, in addition to dividend, we're investing $420 million in our shares, which is $100 million more than we committed to on our last call. This brings total cash return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $700 million for the year. We'll continue to beat investment opportunities to maximize per share value for shareholders. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andres."

To summarize, we continue to make steady progress on our objectives. Specifically, we're pulling all levers to achieve our financial objectives despite the headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil, lower foreign exchange and commodity prices. 
As I noted, overall, hydrology in Latin America is improving as a result of the El Niño phenomenon. We have achieved a number of milestones towards resolving Maritza's outstanding receivables after signing an MOU with NEK in April. We expect to collect our outstanding receivables in the second half of the year. 
We have completed the 1.2 gigawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam 6 months ahead of schedule, and we're making good progress on the remaining 5.8 gigawatts under construction. 
We're bringing in financial partners to leverage our platform and maximize overall returns by forming a joint venture with Grupo BAL, a strong partner with significant presence in Mexico. And in 2015, we are investing more than $1 billion in returning cash to our shareholders and debt pay downs, in addition to the $350 million we're investing in profitable growth projects. 
In conclusion, in line with the plans we laid out on previous calls, we continue to leverage our platforms and allocate our discretionary cash to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
Now I would like to open up the call for questions."

And FX is more or less in line with what we expect. I'd say, if anything, the demand in Brazil is softer, perhaps a little bit softer than we expected, even though we had those numbers in. So overall, we're kind of on track. I think the main points are that we have some seasonality, and some of it, in terms of collections, we tend to collect more in the Dominican Republic. We have the Bulgaria -- that's -- those are 2 discrete factors in the second half. And then we had a number of planned maintenance in the first half, which we won't have in the second half.

Right now, Brazil is on the, I would say, certainly not at the peak of one of these patterns. I will remind people, I think 2, 3 years ago, a lot of questions I would get on these calls is why wasn't I investing more in Brazil and that we were slow. What we did at the time, and we continue to do today, is we only invest when we see long-term value. When we really see the value. Not quite frankly get caught in the trends. Brazil's having a recession this year. It will probably have a flat 2017 and is expected -- 2016, sorry, and expected to pick up in 2017. Brazil is a big market. It's a country which, again, has great potential. And I think that us, as a company in the Americas, we should have a presence in Brazil. Now of course, all of our assets, we look at what we consider a long-term value, what we could sell them for and how they contribute to a balanced portfolio. So overall, what I would say is that I agree that the economic situations looks challenging in Brazil, but realize, this is a country with tremendous potential that could come back and we can't come in and out on a short-term basis. And the final thing is, look, we have been very prudent about, again, investments in Brazil. We still have $500 million of debt capacity at Tietê. So growth in Brazil will come from leveraging the Brazilian businesses. So I hope that answers your question, but I think that the point is that there are cyclical patterns. Brazil has a lot of capacity to rebound. And as always, when times were very good in Brazil, we were always looking at what's the value. And I will remind people that we sold a lot in Brazil at the peak. We sold our telecom business there for $1 billion. We also sold 50% of our holdings in Eletropaulo back in '05. So we'll continue to make those adjustments as we see fit."

So that was some time ago, and I believe the discussions are now focused on sector reform. As Andres said, it goes into compensation that really gets into concession renewal. I remind you, our concession is well off of Tietê. It's 2028. In the GSF, 17 and 19, that's the number we've had now for a number of months. There is some possibility. We've seen thermal dispatch come down recently from about 19 to, I think, 15.5 gigawatts, which may indicate there could be some greater thermal generation, i.e. a little bit improvement on the GSF, but it's still far too soon to tell.

I'd say, of course, if you look take a longer-term view in terms of the past coming to the present, pricing has deteriorated in Argentina. No question about that. On the other hand, I think we've faired very well from a regulatory position, because as you know, until last year, we are exporting energy from Argentina to Chile through our TermoAndes plant. We also have the only coal plant in the country. So we have been selling energy under -- in TermoAndes under Energia Plus, which in the past was more favorable than it is today. But I'd say in general, we have always been making positive earnings in Argentina. So even though they're less, say, than they were 4, 5 years ago, they continue to be positive. We have been receiving 96% payment on our accounts receivable. Some of these are through [indiscernible] bonds. These bonds are dollarized. They pay interest. And for example, the Guillermo [ph] round plant where we have a considerable number of these bonds, are basically being used to fund that plant. We're going to receive that plant, a proportion of it, very soon. So it's being commissioned. So I'd say overall in Argentina, despite the challenging economic circumstances, we've done well. The one thing is we haven't been able to pay dividends out of Argentina for the last 2 years. Now looking forward, what do we see? I think the elections in October, the 2 leading candidates, either one would be favorable. I think you'll have a gradual return to a more market-based pricing and a listing of the exchange controls. So we have a tremendous asset based in Argentina. Of course, we're not putting any new money in at this stage, but I think we've handled it well. And I firmly believe that within a year or 2, we'll be paying dividends out of Argentina. It is basically a considerably developed country and quite wealthy. So again, I think it's probably on the rebound at this stage."

I think Andres has mentioned a couple other examples. The Dominican Republic. We have some unused debt capacity that's currently being used to fund a facility upgrade. And we look around the business to do that as much as we can. IPL has been growing quite a bit also. That really grows in more of a classic utility style that we maintain a capital structure, 55; debt, 45; equity [indiscernible] more akin to the normal utility.

Well as you know, in 2005, we sold down 50% of our holdings, both us and BNDES of Eletropaulo. And we basically took that money and de-levered the company. Then in 2011, we spun off the telecom Atimus and sold that. So right now, between the 2 of us, we have about 32%, that is Brasiliana, has it. We have 16%, roughly a little bit more than 16%. I don't really think that the Brasiliana structure has been affecting Eletropaulo directly. I think that the distributors have been, I think more fairly treated over the past 6 months than they had before, and that's why you've seen a recovery in the price. I mean, Eletropaulo's stocks should be up, I believe, about 70% in dollars this year. And it's not the sector -- it's the best-performing within the sector by a considerable margin. I think part of that is perhaps was the drop also more strongly because some of the, let's say, decisions against us. But we got a good decision on our regulatory asset base. The WACC has been raised almost 8%. So these are all favorable things. Now unquestionably, other than the regulated part, which as I said, the market is recognizing, it's making certain investments to continue to improve quality of service. And it will depend on the recovery of the Brazilian economy. I believe that the Brazilian government is doing the right thing at this time and taking some very brave decisions, including cutting spending, raising interest rates. And that these will have good long-term effects, but certainly, they're very tough in the short run, but I really commend their bravery. So I don't know if that answers your sort of your question.

So you put those 2 together, and again, it's a much stronger position vis-à-vis having rationing this year and next than it was before. This year, substantially less. In terms of the regulatory asset, I mean, that's a considerable number, but I'll leave it to Tom in terms of how much we would actually book."

And the other thing is, of course, capital allocation, and it will also depend on hydrology. I mean, if we have continued good hydrology, and specifically, for example, in the case of Chivor, Chivor typically has a very good basin that it's in. So it tends to have less volatile hydrology than the rest of Colombia. So when you have, like now, El Niño, it's getting -- the rest of Colombia is dry and, actually, Chivor is at average. And so then actually, you got better prices for the energy you sell that you haven't had contracted. And finally, we expect some normalization of the currencies as well. So all those things that can cause this is. Now I agree, '16, if we look out the next 3 years, '16 is the toughest year, because '17 and '18, we have a lot more projects coming online.

Today, we reported second quarter EPS of $0.25 and proportional free cash flow $62 million, and we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance ranges for all metrics despite facing increased headwinds from foreign currencies. 
Before Tom and I provide more color on our results for the second quarter and first half of the year, allow me to review our progress on the priorities for 2015 that I provided on our earnings call in February. 
First, we're making good progress to reach closure on key pending issues that could impact some of our businesses. At Eletropaulo in Brazil, we have had a reasonable outcome in our 4-year rate case. At Maritza in Bulgaria, important milestones have been reached towards the resolution of our outstanding accounts receivable. 
Second, we are executing on our construction program and leveraging our platforms. In April, we commissioned our 1.2-gigawatt Mong Duong plant in Vietnam 6 months early and under budget. Our remaining $7 billion construction program is advancing on schedule, and we expect to bring 6 gigawatts online by the end of 2018. In July, we also broke ground on 3 new energy storage projects, including our first 2 in Europe. 
Third, we're expanding our access to capital through partnerships at the project and business level. Today, I'm very pleased to announce that we are forming a new 50-50 joint venture with Grupo BAL to invest in power and related infrastructure projects in Mexico. 
And finally, regarding capital allocation. We have delivered on our commitment to invest at least $325 million in share repurchases. Today, we are announcing that we intend to utilize the approximately $100 million left on our buyback authorization during the remainder of this year. In 2015, between buybacks and dividends, we will return $700 million to shareholders or approximately 8% of our current market cap. 
I will provide more detail on these achievements in a moment, but now, I'd like to briefly discuss our financial results and our expectations for the remainder of the year on Slide 4.
Our year-to-date 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.50 is in line with our results of last year, and our proportional free cash flow of $327 million is well ahead of first half 2014 results. Our earnings and cash flow are typically weighted towards the second half of the year. We expect our second half results to benefit from improved availability due to less planned maintenance, better hydrology in Latin America and higher collections in Bulgaria and the Dominican Republic. Although there's still a lot of work to be done to deliver on stronger cash flow in the second half of the year, we remain confident that we will achieve our financial guidance for 2015.
Now let's discuss some key issues at our businesses in Brazil on Slide 5. As we discussed on prior calls, we have seen a decline in electricity consumption in Brazil, which is the result of the economic recession and higher energy prices. Today, economists are projecting a 2% contraction of GDP for 2015. In addition, dry hydrology is leading to high electricity prices by requiring the dispatch of more expensive thermal energy. As a result, we are forecasting a 4% year-over-year decrease in volume at our Brazilian utilities in 2015. Nonetheless, we had already factored in this softness in our prior forecast. As a reminder, every 1% change in volume in our Brazilian utilities has a $7 million pretax impact on our bottom line.
Turning now to slide -- hydrology on Slide 6. In Brazil, we have seen rainfall improve more than expected since our last call. In July, rainfall was 156% of the long-term average, and reservoir levels are projected to be 37% by the end of August, materially higher than the 20% level at the beginning of the year. Improvement in hydrology in Brazil is reflected in spot prices, which are now around BRL 120 per megawatt hour, significantly lower than last year. We now see the risk of rationing electricity in Brazil in 2015 as remote, but we continue to expect a negative earning impact of $0.07 per share from poor hydrology this year.
In Panama, we're observing a return to normal hydrology, and spot prices are about $100 per megawatt hour or 1/3 of the prices we saw last year. In Colombia, our 1-gigawatt hydro plant, Chivor, is experiencing stronger inflows, close to the historical average, while in the rest of the country, inflows are 90% of the long-term average.
Turning to Slide 7. We have received approval for Eletropaulo's 4-year tariff reset. This outcome sets a strong foundation for predictable cash flow and earnings from this business through 2019. 
Lastly, we have successfully negotiated the restructuring of Brasiliana, where we own various businesses in partnership with BNDES, the state-owned development bank. Through this restructuring, we're separating our generation business, Tietê, from other businesses under the Brasiliana umbrella. This separation will give us more control of operations and capital allocation decisions at Tietê. Once this transaction is completed, we will be in a more favorable position to grow Tietê by tapping into approximately $500 million of debt capacity at this business.
Turning to Slide 8. As you may recall, in April, Maritza signed an MOU with its offtaker, NEK, whereby Maritza would receive full payment of all arrears, which as of June 30, were $281 million, in exchange for a reduction in the capacity price of the long-term PPA. Since our last call, we have secured the required approvals from the project lenders and from the Bulgarian regulator. At the same time, the government of Bulgaria has taken concrete steps to improve NEK's financial position. Parliament has approved the energy sector reforms to support NEK through a new 5% tax on generators' income, as well as allocating all proceeds from the sale of the state's CO2 allowances to NEK. 
Finally, the regulator announced an increase in the tariff of up to 20% for certain classes of industrial users and reduced NEK's commitment to procure more expensive renewable energy. These steps will strengthen NEK's financial position and allow the Bulgarian public sector to raise the necessary financing to pay their outstanding receivables. We expect to sign a binding agreement and collect on all arrears in the second half of the year. Collecting from NEK will be an important contributor to the improvement in our free cash flow in the second half of the year.
Now let's turn to our progress towards our strategic objectives, beginning with construction on Slide 9. Our construction program is the most important driver of our 10% to 15% average annual growth in free cash flow over the next few years. This strong growth in cash flow is the foundation for our commitment to a 10% annual dividend increase, as well as all other capital allocation decisions. From 2015 through 2018, we expect to commission 7 gigawatts of new capacity in comparison with the roughly 600 megawatts we brought online in the 3 years from 2012 through 2014. Through June, we've already brought online 1.3 gigawatts, which is nearly 90% of the capacity we plan to commission in 2015.
Moving onto Slide 10. Our remaining 5.8 gigawatts under construction are progressing well and remain on time and on budget. As you can see on the slide, roughly 80% of new capacity is in the Americas. As a reminder, total CapEx for our projects currently under construction is $7 billion, but AES' equity commitment is only $1.3 billion, and all but $400 million has already been funded. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of more than 15%.
Turning now to Slide 11. As we discussed on our last call, we achieved commercial operation on our 1.2-gigawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam 6 months early and under budget. The plant is operating at full load and will help meet Vietnam's rapidly growing demand for electricity and provides us with a solid platform in the country. 
Moving on to Slide 12. We are the world leader in battery-based energy storage, with 86 megawatts of installed capacity. We are seeing growing regulatory support and greater acceptance by utilities in our markets. As a result, we recently broke ground on 3 new energy storage projects totaling 40 megawatts in 3 countries. We are consolidating our global leadership and now have a total of 70 megawatts of energy storage under construction that we expect to come online through 2016 and 200 more megawatts in late-stage development. We are very well positioned to continue to take advantage of this emerging business opportunity given AES' portfolio and 8 years of successful and profitable experience operating battery-based energy storage.
Turning to the new joint venture we're forming in Mexico on Slide 13. Today we announced that we signed an MOU with Grupo BAL, a Mexican business conglomerate with a market cap of $11 billion, to pursue new power, desalinization and natural gas projects. Grupo BAL is one of the largest and most respected business groups in Mexico, and one of Grupo BAL's subsidiaries, Grupo Penoles, is the offtaker of our TEP plant in Mexico. As you may know, Mexico is in the process of implementing new energy sector reforms, which will allow for greater private sector participation. Over the next 10 years, it is estimated that Mexico will need 25 gigawatts of new or replacement generation. We have owned and operated a successful generation business in Mexico for more than 15 years. And now, with Grupo BAL, we are poised to take advantage of the opening of the energy sector.
Turning to Slide 14. Looking at growth opportunities beyond our projects currently under construction, all of which we expect to complete by 2018, our future project mix is likely to be heavily weighted towards natural gas and renewables while using our platforms to provide energy storage, desalinization and LNG-related services. In particular, in arid and semi-arid regions such as Chile, where our plants on the coast are already providing desalinization for their own needs, long-term desalinated water contracts can be an attractive business. Using existing infrastructure and permits significantly reduces the cost of providing desalinated water to third parties such as municipal water authorities, mining and industrial customers. Based on all of the opportunities we see across our portfolio, we believe we can invest $300 million to $400 million of AES equity in attractive growth projects each year, which is consistent with the amount of equity we are currently contributing to our growth projects. This amount of equity investment is quite moderate considering the strong growth in our free cash flow. In addition, we can use the debt capacity at our existing businesses such as Brazil, Chile, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic to fund growth projects. 
Recycling capital has been and will remain an integral part of our strategy. Over the past 4 years, we have raised $3.1 billion in asset sale proceeds and another $2.5 billion in partner equity at the business and project level. These actions have permitted us to reposition our portfolio, pay down our debt, improve risk-adjusted returns and accelerate our growth profile. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize that as we have demonstrated to date, we will continue to complete all new investments against share repurchases in order to ensure that we are maximizing risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. To that end, as you can see on Slide 15, we are returning $700 million to our shareholders in 2015, which is 8% of our current market cap. We have returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders since September 2011 and reduced parent debt by $1.5 billion, or 25%, while significantly lengthening its average tenure.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter and year-to-date results and full-year guidance in more detail."

Our first half results and the reaffirmation of our guidance demonstrate the benefits of our proactive actions to mitigate the impact from currency devaluation and other macro factors that we've experienced over",1440,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Our first half results and the reaffirmation of our guidance demonstrate the benefits of our proactive actions to mitigate the impact from currency devaluation and other macro factors that we've experienced over the last several months. Today I'll review our second quarter results, including adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU; proportional free cash flow by SBU; then I'll cover our 2015 guidance and our 2015 capital allocation plan.
Turning to Slide 17. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.25 was $0.03 lower than second quarter 2014. At a high level, we were negatively impacted by the following: $0.04 operating impacts, including timing of planned maintenance in certain businesses, as well as lower demand and contracting strategy in Brazil. These were offset by favorable hydrology in Panama and Colombia and new businesses coming online. We had a $0.02 impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which appreciated roughly 20% against the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and the euro. Finally, a $0.02 net impact from other adjustments, primarily the favorable reversal of liabilities in Brazil and Kazakhstan in 2014, offset by the favorable reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo in 2015. On positive side, we benefited $0.04 from a lower tax rate of 30% this year versus 40% in the second quarter last year, and $0.01 from capital allocation net of asset sales, which resulted in 13% lower parent debt and a 4% lower share count relative to last year.
Now I'll cover our SBU's financial performance in more detail on the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 18. 
In the U.S., adjusted PTC decreased by $24 million due to planned maintenance in Hawaii and at IPL, as well as lower wind generation at Buffalo Gap in Texas. Proportional free cash flow was roughly flat, reflecting working capital recovery and lower interest at DPL. 
In Andes, PTC decreased $23 million, primarily due to the timing of planned maintenance in Chile and Argentina, as well as a weaker Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow declined by $37 million due to lower earnings and a higher tax payment at Chivor in Colombia versus last year. 
In Brazil, PTC decreased $74 million. In addition to the $17 million impact from the depreciation of the Brazilian real, the decline was driven by the approximately $13 million net impact from liability reversals in each period at our distribution businesses, Sul and Eletropaulo. You may also recall that last year, our generation business, Tietê, benefited from spot sales at favorable prices due to lower contract levels during the first half of the year. This benefit was more of a timing issue, as Tietê had to purchase in the spot market in the second half. This year Tiete's contract levels are flat in the first and second half, so we expect contributions to be evenly distributed. Last but not least, Sul has been affected by lower demand and higher costs. Proportional free cash flow decreased $18 million, primarily driven by lower operating income at Tietê that I just discussed. 
In MCAC, PTC increased $11 million, largely driven by improved hydro conditions in Panama, where we generated more this year versus buying in the spot market last year. Panama also benefited from the commencement of operations of our 72-megawatt thermal power barge.  Proportional free cash flow improved by $12 million, primarily driven by improved operating performance. 
In Europe, adjusted PTC decreased by $32 million, mainly due to lower energy prices and the timing of planned maintenance at Kilroot in the U.K. Despite the decline in earnings, proportional free cash flow was up $3 million, largely by improved working capital at Maritza. 
Finally in Asia, PTC increased $7 million, resulting from the early commencement of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam, partially offset by the sale of minority interest in Masinloc in the Philippines in '14. Proportional free cash flow was roughly flat.
Turning to Slide 24. Overall, we earned $251 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $89 million from last year, and we generated $62 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $15 million. 
As you can see on Slide 25, year-to-date adjusted PTC declined $80 million, largely driven by lower demand and contracting strategy in Brazil, a stronger U.S. dollar, as well as the net impact from the reversal of liabilities in Brazil and Europe. These negative impacts were largely offset by the contributions from new businesses that came online earlier this year and our capital allocation decisions. Our proportional free cash flow increased $151 million to $327 million, primarily due to higher contributions from the U.S. and MCAC, including higher collections at DP&L and improved working capital in Puerto Rico. 
Year-to-date, adjusted PTC and proportional free cash flow by SBU are in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Now to Slide 26. Comparing our first half results to our full year guidance, our earnings and cash flow tend to be more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. Consistent with our prior expectations, in the second half of 2015, we expect EPS to benefit from improved availability as a result of planned maintenance that was completed earlier in the year in Chile, the Dominican Republic and the U.S.; improved hydro conditions in Panama and Colombia; seasonality related to contract generation businesses in the U.S. and Chile, as well as IPL; the previously expected benefit from tax opportunities at certain businesses; and finally, contributions from Mong Duong in Vietnam, which came online in the first half of the year.
Regarding proportional free cash flow, improved results in the second half of the year versus the first half are driven in part by higher operating performance in the second half, consistent with our earnings profile. The remaining increase is largely attributable to lower pension and fuel payments at IPL in the U.S.; timing of income tax payments and VAT collections at Gener; higher collection of receivables in the Dominican Republic; and collection of receivables in Bulgaria, a portion of which will be used at the business for deleveraging and fuel payments. 
Bottom line is that although we have to execute on our plan, we feel confident in our ability to meet our objectives for the year, and we are reaffirming our guidance on all metrics. 
Our reaffirmed guidance is based on forward curves as of June 30, reflecting a benefit of a couple of pennies relative to our prior guidance, which is based on March 31. Applying curves as of July 31, we're effectively back to where we were as of March 31. 
Our guidance also assumes the current outlook for hydro in Latin America, which is in line with our expectations, and an unchanged full year tax rate of 31% to 33% versus year-to-date 2015 rate of 31%. Assumptions and sensitivities for our guidance are in the appendix of today's deck. 
Now to Slide 27 and our parent capital allocation plan for the year. Sources on the left-hand side reflect total available discretionary cash for 2015 of roughly $1.65 billion, which is $70 million higher than our last call. As a reminder, we previously announced asset sale proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in IPALCO in Jordan, as well as the sale of the Armenia Mountain wind farm. Today, we are also announcing the sale of our solar assets in Spain, bringing our total asset sale proceeds this year to $573 million. We're also expecting an additional $45 million in return of capital from operating businesses, which along with our parent free cash flow, provides us with nearly $600 million available for dividend payments and growth, incremental share repurchases and other potential investments. 
In terms of incremental sources of discretionary cash, as Andres mentioned, we'll continue to evaluate additional asset sale opportunities, which could be $200 million to $300 million annually on average, but may be lumpy year-to-year. 
Now to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. We plan to invest about $350 million in our subsidiaries, 60% of which is at IPL and has already been funded. We've invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing parent debt, leaving us with only $180 million in parent debt maturities through 2018. 
Finally, in addition to the dividend, we're investing $420 million in our shares, which is $100 million more than we committed to on our last call. This brings total cash return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $700 million for the year. We'll continue to compete for various investment opportunities to maximize per-share value for shareholders. 
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andres."

To summarize, we continue to make steady progress on our objectives. Specifically, we're pulling all levers to achieve our financial objectives despite the headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil, lower foreign exchange and commodity prices. 
As I noted, overall, hydrology in Latin America is improving as a result of the El Niño phenomenon. We have achieved a number of milestones towards resolving Maritza's outstanding receivables after signing an MOU with NEK in April. We expect to collect our outstanding receivables in the second half of the year. 
We have completed the 1.2-gigawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam 6 months ahead of schedule, and we're making good progress on the remaining 5.8 gigawatts under construction. 
We're bringing in financial partners to leverage our platform and maximize overall returns by forming a joint venture with Grupo BAL, a strong partner with significant presence in Mexico. And in 2015, we are investing more than $1 billion in returning cash to our shareholders and debt pay-downs, in addition to the $350 million we're investing in profitable growth projects. 
In conclusion, in line with the plans we laid out on previous calls, we continue to leverage our platforms and allocate our discretionary cash to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
Now I would like to open up the call for questions."

I mean, we're quite impressed with the commitment of the Bulgarian government to fix the electricity sector and the parliament approving some important reforms. So I think that's the key component, so we're on track there. I would say hydrology, in July, was quite frankly a little bit ahead of what we expected. And FX is more or less in line with what we expect. I'd say, if anything, the demand in Brazil is softer, perhaps a little bit softer than we expected, even though we had those numbers in. So overall, we're kind of on track. I think the main points are that we have some seasonality, and some of it, in terms of collections, we tend to collect more in the Dominican Republic. We have the Bulgaria -- that's -- those are 2 discrete factors in the second half. And then we had a number of planned maintenance in the first half, which we won't have in the second half.

I will remind people, I think 2, 3 years ago, a lot of questions I would get on these calls is why wasn't I investing more in Brazil and that we were slow. What we did at the time, and we continue to do today, is we only invest when we see long-term value. When we really see the value, not quite frankly get caught in the trends. Brazil's having a recession this year. It will probably have a flat 2017 and is expected -- 2016, sorry, and expected to pick up in 2017. Brazil is a big market. It's a country which, again, has great potential. And I think that us, as a company in the Americas, we should have a presence in Brazil. Now of course, all of our assets, we look at what we consider their long-term value, what we could sell them for and how they contribute to a balanced portfolio. So overall, what I would say is that I agree that the economic situations looks challenging in Brazil, but realize, this is a country with tremendous potential that could come back and we can't come in and out on a short-term basis. And the final thing is, look, we have been very prudent about, again, investments in Brazil. We still have $500 million of debt capacity at Tietê. So growth in Brazil will come from leveraging the Brazilian businesses. So I hope that answers your question, but I think that the point is that there are cyclical patterns. Brazil has a lot of capacity to rebound. And as always, when times were very good in Brazil, we were always looking at what's the value. And I will remind people that we sold a lot in Brazil at the peak. We sold our telecom business there for $1 billion. We also sold 50% of our holdings in Eletropaulo back in '05.

The generators will be compensated for that difference, say, between 7% or 8% additional to the cap, for example, this year, by an extension of their contract. So you'd receive a regulatory asset [indiscernible] the concession, you'd receive a regulatory asset equivalent to that amount. So there's nothing set as of yet.

So that was some time ago, and I believe the discussions are now focused on sector reform. As Andres said, it goes into compensation that really gets into concession renewal. I remind you, our concession is well off at Tietê. It's 2028. The GSF of 17% and 19%, that's the number we've had now for a number of months. There is some possibility. We've seen thermal dispatch come down recently from about 19 to, I think, 15.5 gigawatts, which may indicate there could be some greater thermal generation, i.e. a little bit of improvement on the GSF, but it's still far too soon to tell. That's just news over the last couple of weeks."

I'd say, of course, if you look take a longer-term view in terms of the past coming to the present, pricing has deteriorated in Argentina. No question about that. On the other hand, I think we've fared very well from a regulatory position, because as you know, until last year, we were exporting energy from Argentina to Chile through our TermoAndes plant. We also have the only coal plant in the country. So we have been selling energy under -- in TermoAndes under Energia Plus, which in the past was more favorable than it is today. But I'd say in general, we have always been making positive earnings in Argentina. So even though they're less, say, than they were 4 or 5 years ago, they continue to be positive. We have been receiving 96% payment on our accounts receivable. Some of these are through [indiscernible] bonds. These bonds are dollarized. They pay interest. And for example, the Guillermo Brown plant, where we have a considerable number of these bonds, are basically being used to fund that plant. We're going to receive that plant, a proportion of it, very soon. So it's being commissioned. So I'd say overall in Argentina, despite the challenging economic circumstances, we've done well. The one thing is we haven't been able to pay dividends out of Argentina for the last 2 years. Now looking forward, what do we see? I think the elections in October, the 2 leading candidates, either one would be favorable. I think you'll have a gradual return to more market-based pricing and a lifting of the exchange controls. So we have a tremendous asset base in Argentina. Of course, we're not putting any new money in at this stage, but I think we've handled it well. And I firmly believe that within a year or 2, we'll be paying dividends out of Argentina. It is basically a considerably developed country and quite wealthy. So again, I think it's probably on the rebound at this stage."

So that's a great example of a multibillion-dollar construction program and it's [indiscernible] the Gener balance sheet and Gener cash flow growth as much as possible. I think Andres has mentioned a couple other examples. The Dominican Republic. We have some unused debt capacity that's currently being used to fund a facility upgrade. And we look around the business to do that as much as we can. IPL has been growing quite a bit also. That really grows in more of a classic utility style that we maintain a capital structure of 55% debt, 45% equity. So that's more akin to the normal utility. But we do that and we'll continue to look for leverage capacity at the business. Look to see whether a partner for a project or a business can come in to help increase the value of the business and/or bring in more effectively priced capital. And then kind of lastly, if you will, we'll look at -- up to the parent. And the $300 million to $400 million is just a general range. I think that's a number we've been at the last couple of years.

There are, I think, going to be a considerable number of bids for power plants, not only of CFE, but also of private-sector clients. And also, with our strategy of using our platforms for adjacencies such as desalinization or energy storage or, for example, LNG services, we can add those on. So this is -- going forward, will be exclusive, 50-50. We both have to agree to make an investment. If one partner does not agree with the investment, the other one can make it on its own.

And the numbers we gave were weighted average for Sul and Eletropaulo. The decline in demand is stronger in Sul than it has been in Eletropaulo. I think we're looking at pretty much flat demand for next year and then growing moderately after that. I mean, the long-term growth in Brazil, what you normally expect, is about 3% to 4% has been the historical, say, average over the last 10 years. The second is how Brasiliana affecting Eletropaulo. Well as you know, in 2005, we sold down 50% of our holdings, both us and BNDES, of Eletropaulo. And we basically took that money and de-levered the company. Then in 2011, we spun off the telecom Atimus and sold that. So right now, between the 2 of us, we have about 32%, that is Brasiliana has it. We have 16%, roughly a little bit more than 16%. I don't really think that the Brasiliana structure has been affecting Eletropaulo directly. I think that the distributors have been, I think, more fairly treated over the past 6 months than they had before, and that's why you've seen a recovery in the price. I mean, Eletropaulo's stock should be up, I believe, about 70% in dollars this year. And it's not the sector. It's the best performing within the sector by a considerable margin. I think part of that is perhaps it was -- dropped also more strongly because some of the, let's say, decisions against us. But we got a good decision on our regulatory asset base. The WACC has been raised over 8%. So these are all favorable things. Now unquestionably, other than the regulated part, which as I said, the market is recognizing, it's making certain investments to continue to improve quality of service. And it will depend on the recovery of the Brazilian economy. I believe that the Brazilian government is doing the right thing at this time and taking some very brave decisions, including cutting spending, raising interest rates. And that these will have good long-term effects, but certainly, they're very tough in the short run, but I really commend their bravery. So I don't know if that answers your sort of your question. What we see in Eletropaulo is a tough '16 -- sorry, tough '15, more moderate '16 and a recovery more in '17, '18."

Since our last call, the global macroeconomic environment has continued to weaken and we have seen a further drop in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and econo",1346,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Since our last call, the global macroeconomic environment has continued to weaken and we have seen a further drop in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and economic growth in some of our markets. As you may have seen in our press release, these conditions are reducing our earnings outlook. Despite these challenges, we're taking measures to reduce their impact and we'll continue to generate strong and growing free cash flow, which we will use to maximize risk-adjusted shareholder returns. Today, I will discuss the impact of these macroeconomic factors in our outlook, our mitigation plan and our capital allocation strategy. Then, Tom will provide our third quarter results, an update on our 2015 guidance and our capital allocation plans for 2015 and 2016. 
Beginning with the macroeconomic factors I just mentioned, the majority of the decline in our earnings forecast is related currencies and commodities moving against us as well as the deteriorating economic outlook in Brazil. As you may know, some of our businesses, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Europe, have been impacted by the valuations of up to 35% in their local currencies. Furthermore, lower oil and electricity prices have a direct impact at our businesses in the Dominican Republic, DPNL and Kilroot. To mitigate the impact of these factors, we are launching a $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative. This initiative will include overhead reductions, procurement efficiencies and operational improvements. We expect to achieve at least $50 million in savings in 2016, ramping up to $150 million, including modest revenue enhancements in 2018. These bottom-line improvements are on top of the $200 million of overhead cost reductions and the $170 million of productivity enhancements we have initiated since 2012. I will discuss these drivers in more detail in a few minutes. 
Turning to Slide 4 and our expectations for cash flow growth through 2018. Despite being affected by the macroeconomic pressures that I just discussed, our free cash flow remains strong. We're expecting average annual growth in proportional and parent free cash flow of at least 10%. Specifically, in 2016, we expect to generate roughly $1.3 billion of proportional free cash flow, which translates to $1.90 per share. We also expect to generate about $625 million in parent free cash flow in 2016, which is 20% higher than our 2015 guidance. Our focus on improving sustainable cash to the parent through more efficient use of cash at our subsidiaries has helped us reduce the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on our parent free cash flow. As you may recall, parent free cash flow is the basis for our dividend and capital allocation decisions. 
Turning to Slide 5. We believe proportional free cash flow is the most important valuation metric for AES as it represents the cash generated at our businesses that can be distributed to the parent or utilized locally to delever or fund growth. Proportional free cash flow is essentially operating cash flow minus maintenance CapEx adjusted for our ownership. In 2016, we expect to generate $1.3 billion in proportional free cash flow. Of this, approximately 40% or $500 million is expected to be used to pay down nonrecourse debt at our subsidiaries, which generates equity value, and roughly 15% [ph] or $175 million may be retained by our subsidiaries due to timing or other reasons. That leaves us with $625 million of parent free cash flow, which is available for discretionary uses at corp. [ph] 
Turning now to Slide 6. As a reminder, the projected growth in our cash flow is driven by our projects currently under construction, which remain on budget and are expected to come online through 2018. All but $160 million [ph] of our $1.1 billion in equity requirements for these projects has already been funded, and we continue to expect average cash returns of around 15%. 
Turning now to our adjusted EPS guidance beginning on Slide 7. In 2016, the impact from macroeconomic factors is roughly $0.25. The most significant drivers of our revised guidance are: First, the deterioration in the forward curves for commodities and currencies from December 2014 to October 2015 accounts for more than half of the impact or $0.15, in line with the sensitivities we've provided; second, we're seeing another $0.05 from lower demand and higher interest rates in Brazil, primarily at our utility in Río Grande do Sul, which is also experienced catastrophic flooding in October. Previously, we have been expecting demand growth of 2.5% for Brazil, but we have seen a 5% drop in demand in 2015 and expect no recovery in 2016; third, there's an additional $0.04 impact from regulatory changes at El Niño. The regulatory changes affect capacity prices and the United Kingdom and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic. Although hydrology in Latin America has improved, we are still expecting El Niño to have a slight negative impact in our businesses in Brazil in Panama; and finally, we expect to offset $0.05 of these headwinds to our new cost savings initiatives. Taking all these factors into account, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range is $1.05 to $1.15. 
Turning now to Slide 8, which shows our updated outlook for adjusted EPS growth through 2018. Although the net impact on our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is approximately $0.20, our cost savings and other initiatives will reduce the net decrease to about $0.06 per share for 2018, which keeps us within the low end of our previous 2018 expectations. 
Now on to capital allocation beginning on Slide 9. When we laid out our strategy 4 years ago, we identified specific levers to improve total shareholder returns, reduce risk and simplify the portfolio. By completing timely exits from 10 countries and netting $3 billion from our asset sales, our portfolio is in a much stronger position today than it was 4 years ago. Over this period, we have allocated 80% of our $5 billion in discretionary cash to debt paydown and returns to shareholders. This has resulted in a 23% reduction in parent debt and a 14% reduction in share count. In fact, as you can see on Slide 10, since 2012, we have returned 2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $700 million or 9% of our current market cap in 2015. 
Turning to slide 11. Going forward, after debt pay down at our subsidiaries, we expect to have a total of $2.6 billion in discretionary cash available through 2018, which is roughly 1/3 of our current market cap. After shareholder dividends and investments in projects under construction, we will have $1.3 billion available for other discretionary uses. These include targeting 10% annual dividend growth, continuing to delever in order to improve our credit metrics and reduce cash and earnings volatility and opportunistically utilizing our new forward authorization for $400 million in share repurchases. And finally, while we are still seeing a number of attractive growth opportunities, mainly in Brownfield projects across the portfolio, the benchmarks for new investments has been raised. We are focused on completing those projects under construction as well as the South line repowering and energy-related facilities in Panama. We will continue to compete any potential investments against the other capital allocation alternatives just discussed. 
I would also like to point out that the $1.3 billion in discretionary cash outline does not include up to $1 billion in potential asset sale proceeds through 2018. As we allocate capital among these alternatives, we will look to further reduce risk and enhance returns as the continue to fine tune our portfolio. We expect to strengthen our credit profile overtime as we pay down debt, compete our construction projects and grow our cash flow. These actions will improve the stability of our cash flow and earnings. 
The bottom line is our portfolio generates strong and growing free cash flow, which we will use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our third quarter and year-to-date results and full-year 2015 guidance."
35312,313332782,893260,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our third quarter results, including proportional free cash flow by strategic business unit or SBU, adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC by SBU. Then I'll cover our 2015 guidance as",1268,"Thanks, Andres. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our third quarter results, including proportional free cash flow by strategic business unit or SBU, adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC by SBU. Then I'll cover our 2015 guidance as well as our '15 and '16 capital allocation plans. 
Turning to Slide 13. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 is $0.02 higher than the third quarter of 2014. At a high level, we benefited from a reduction in share count of 6% or 43 million shares and lower parent interest expense, as well as higher equity earnings as a result of a restructuring in one of our businesses in Chile, which we discussed on our Q1 call. These positive contributions were partially offset by lower operating results of some of our businesses such as EBL and in the Dominican Republic, which were negative year-over-year, but not material versus our full-year expectations. The roughly 35% devaluation in foreign currencies, particularly the Brazilian real and Colombian peso. 
Turning to Slide 14. Overall, we generated $621 million proportional free cash flow, an increase of $194 million from last year, and we earned $322 [ph] million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $32 million. 
Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail on the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 15. In the U.S., our results were largely impacted by lower contributions from DPL, primarily due to the expected transition in the market prices for our regulated load and lower-margin volumes and prices. Proportional free cash flow was further impacted by lower collections and the timing of working capital at IPL. In the Andes, our results improved, primarily due to the gain on restructuring at Guacolda in Chile and higher energy prices at Chivor in Colombia, partially offset by the devaluation of the Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from increased VAT refunds related to the construction of Cochrane in Chile. 
In Brazil, we benefited from lower spot purchases due to the seasonality in shipping of our contract requirement at Tietê, partially offset by a weaker Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow was negatively impacted by increased working capital as a result of higher recoverable energy purchases at Eletropaulo. 
In MCAC, our results were largely impacted by lower spot sales and ancillary service revenue in the Dominican Republic, partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama. Proportional free cash flow had a very strong increase in the timing of collection of outstanding receivables in the Dominican Republic. 
In Europe, we were negatively impacted mainly due to weaker euro and the timing of planned outages at Maritza in Bulgaria as well as the sale of Ebute in 2014. Proportional free cash flow improved, largely driven by higher collections at Kavarna in Bulgaria. Finally, in Asia. We benefited from improved availability at Masinloc in the Philippines and the commencement of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam. 
Turning now to 2015 guidance on Slide 21. Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the year, we are already at about [ph] 95% of the low end of our proportional free cash flow guidance and are confident that we'll be in the range. One key variable that will put us towards the high end of that range is the receipt of the $330 million in outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria as part of the previously-announced capacity price reduction agreement. Government on utility, NEK; and the holding company, BEH, are in the process of raising capital to pay these receivables. The remaining issue is the extent of government guarantee for purchase financing prior to the issuance of a long-term bond. While we expect to close later this year, payment could slip into early next year. 
Turning to adjusted EPS. As we discussed in our prior calls, we've been facing significant headwinds about [ph] $0.20 from currencies, commodities, hydrology and declining economic conditions in Brazil. We've offset the majority of these impacts through cost savings, hedging and capital allocation. Unfortunately, the same pressures have continued in the third quarter, and we face an additional $0.07 impact. We've also faced a $0.02 impact from outages at DPL in AES Hawaii. We've been working to implement additional opportunities, but now believe it will be difficult to capture. We're therefore lowering our guidance range to $1.18 to $1.25 per share, which is roughly $0.08 lower than the midpoint of our prior guidance of $1.25 to $1.35. 
Now to Slide 22 and our parent capital allocation plan for 2015. Source on the left-hand side reflect total available discretionary cash, roughly $1.5 billion. As a reminder, we previously announced asset sale proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in IPALCO in Jordan as well as the sales of the Armenia Mountain wind farm and our solar assets in Spain. Today, we're also announcing the closing of the sale of our solar assets in Italy for $42 million, bringing our total asset sale proceeds this year to $401 million. We're also expecting additional $27 million return of capital, which with our parent free cash flow, provides us with roughly $550 [ph] million available for dividend payments and growth, incremental share repurchases, debt reduction in potential investments. 
Turning to uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest $140 million in our subsidiaries, which does not include direct investments by CDPQ into IPL. We've invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing of parent debt, leaving us with only $180 million in parent debt maturities through 2018. In addition to the dividend, we've invested 423 million of our shares. This brings total cash return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $700 million for the year. Finally, we expect to have unallocated discretionary cash of about $225 million for the rest of the year. 
Turning now to 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.2 billion of total available discretionary cash for '16. This includes asset sale proceeds of approximately $200 million, the majority of which is coming from 1 transaction we expect to announce shortly. Discretionary cash also includes our parent free cash flow of $625 million, which is approximately 20% higher than the midpoint of this year's expectation. 
Strong cash flow with strong growth in our parent free cash flow demonstrates our increasing focus to upstream sustainable and growing cash from our businesses to further improve returns to our shareholders. In fact, parent free cash flow is the largest contributor to the expected $2.6 billion in discretionary cash available through 2018 that Andres just covered. We're also expecting $70 [ph] million in return of capital from operating businesses. Additional potential asset sale proceeds would further increase our discretionary cash by up to $1 billion through 2018. 
Turning to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. As Andres mentioned, we're investing our projects under construction as well as already announced expansion projects at Southland California and in Panama. After considering these investments in ourselves, our current dividend and debt prepayment, we're left with roughly $400 million of discretionary cash to be allocated. Consistent with our capital allocation framework, we'll invest this cash in dividend growth, further debt reduction to continue to improve our debt profile and increase the stability of equity cash flows and share repurchases. Regarding new growth investments, we'll continue to compete any new projects against share repurchases. All in all, our 2016 parent free cash flow and proportional free cash flow are growing significantly over 2015, and we expect this trend to continue through 2018 and beyond. 
With that now, I'll now turn it back to Andres."

As a reminder, our 6 gigawatts of projects under construction are largely funded and are the driver of at least 10% average annual growth in proportional and parent free cash flow for the next 3 years. Looking forward, we do not believe that our strong and growing cash flows are fully reflected in our valuation. Over the next 3 years, we will generate $2.6 billion in discretionary cash, an amount equal to 1/3 of our current market cap. As our track record demonstrates, we will invest in dividend growth, debt paydown and share repurchases. In fact, in 2015 alone, we have return 700 million or roughly 9% of our current market cap to our shareholders.

We've already done a $200 million initiative, which we started in 2012. And sort of recalling a little bit, we had sent out $100 million program and we managed to get twice that number of savings. So what does this comprise? Well, what we have in front of us for next year is $50 million, and that will be 100% cost reductions, and these are things that we have identified in terms of becoming a more efficient company, streamlining our structure, streamlining processes and really making sure that every single dollar that we're spending is going toward meeting our objectives. So for example, we help to make sure that we're not spending any money on any business development, for example, in deals that we're not going to do over the next couple of years. So I think we have this very well identified for 2016. When we think of 2017, then we start getting into some of the initiatives that we've had in the past that we started and were well underway. We have a chart of accounts now, we're really looking at our procurement efficiencies. We have -- we're starting to really achieve significant efficiencies on our new construction projects. So by standardization and by sort of more global deals, and we really think that we have to get this more into our global procurement as well. There will be continued streamlining of the company as well, and this continues into '18. And I said, the only thing in '18, we see a small number, maybe 10% of this, 15% of this. In terms of revenue enhancement, these are several things that we've identified. But one of them, which we don't have in our forecast and we have very well advanced, is really having a channel partner to sell some of our advanced products. So we think by then, it's a reasonable to think that we'd have some income from this. So we feel very confident about hitting this $150 million, and if you go back to our earnings call, we have always hit our cost savings and revenue enhancement numbers."

Normally in Colombia, it's somewhat better, but with a very strong El Niño, it's a little bit more volatile. So that's the net-net that we think it's a little bit negative from these factors. One thing that hasn't been perhaps highlighted is that we've had really torrential rains in Sul, in Río Grande do Sul. We have the worst rains since 1940. We've had storms that just recently knockout 14 transmission towers and left half of the million customers without power. So that's one of the things, for example, that's affecting our 2015 guidance.

So we will look at anything that we think increases shareholder value. Having said that, in terms of our portfolio, we think we have the global scale that really allows us to reap economies and synergies. So for example, if you look at recent pace, whether it be California or the gas plant in IPL, which had to basically compete with other alternatives, or the gas plant and the regasification terminal in Panama, we're winning bids against the best in the business. And we're able to do that because of this global scale and reach that we have. I think we've also shown that the portfolio, in this case, is offsetting, doing well in one place and it's not doing well in the other. And we think we have a combination of rapidly growing markets in Asia. And Latin America is going through, I think, a downturn in the cycle. But realize that other than Brazil, these markets are growing. Whereas for example, in the U.S., it's a market, where energy demand is not growing. Now having said that, we have further fine-tuning to do. We have to sell down those areas we have particular risk, as that have been affecting us. We're growing in those areas, for example, if you look at where our growth is, 80% is U.S. or its Chile, or even if you include Panama, it's dollar denominated. So we're decreasing our currency and Hydro risk over time. So we will continue to do what we've done in terms of fine-tuning this portfolio, taking advantage of our synergies, making it more efficient, cutting cost, standardizing to become the good operator. But we keep an open mind. I mean, I think that we have -- when, for example, people were discussing yieldcos in the past, we said we'd look at it. We didn't really see it a fit for us and we also felt that, that will commit us to growth in situations where the market may not be correct. So having said that, we'll keep an open mind, but I think we've shown a lot of prudence in terms of going forward. And we continue to look hard at our portfolio and what makes sense as a whole. And we think we're on the right track. I mean, we've been hit with some pretty hard logics and factors. But as we fine tune this portfolio, it will be less susceptible to the overtime."

Keith, I'll just say on proportional free cash flow, maintenance and environmental CapEx is coming down just as a general sense. It was close to $600 million this year.

Keith, I'll just say on proportional free cash flow, maintenance and environmental CapEx is coming down just as a general sense. It was close to $600 million this year. Over the next 2 -- couple of years, it's going to be closer to $500 million. Part of that is just working hard with efficiencies, but also, we did finish an environmental retrofit program in Chile. That's basically finished at the end of '15, so that helps us. And then you contrast that with growing depreciation from new assets. So we see that the differential between maintenance and environmental CapEx versus earnings, it's about $300 million today, and that differential grows about $75 million a year. But then we've always said we do have NOLs that hit EPS, don't hit cash, and then just sometimes, when you bring a new business out, specially a new project, it can be more -- the earnings can be lean in the early years, let's say. But cash, cash continues to be strong. On parent free cash flow, what we -- it is increasing focus of the business. It has been for a couple of years, but we continue to have to find ways to drive, let's say, efficient use of cash through the business. It may come through inventories that will be down, about [ph] 15% year-over-year, or unrestricted cash on the balance sheet will be down about $100 million a year, and it's down about [ph] $300 million from a couple of years ago. So we continue to look for it just efficient way to run the business. I will say that when we talk about parent free cash flow, all that is earnings. It's earnings from this year or it's retained earnings from the prior year, and that's what it -- when we call it parent free cash flow, it has to be earnings, either this year or last year or whatever. So when we do something, we'd like to gentle financing, if it is a reflection of prior retained earnings, then we'll call it parent free cash flow. If it's a reflection of cash beyond retained earnings, then we call it return of capital, and that's what you make a distinction. It's really -- as a shareholder, it's really all money. We make that distinction, which is really accounting driven. But we do think there are continued opportunities. A lot of that is just growing cash in the businesses. It's a function of proportional free cash flow, but then there are also opportunities to get businesses that may be levered over time. We can relever them periodically. Obviously, you don't do that everyday, you do that every few years, and other ways to look upstream cash. It's a big focus. I will just say on the comment of -- we do pay down a fair amount of subsidiary debt, $450 million, $500 million a year of subsidiarity debt. And a lot of that, we get value for, but we get it -- let's say, in lumps, we will get it, because we'll refi something at one point in time it allows to have a chunkier dividend back year. We may get it from the opportunity to build something, where we created equity value at the business and u can build something basically all debt because your equity has already embedded in the business. We're doing that right now in the DR. And then also obviously, the extent that we delivered a business like DPL we're delivering and sold that aggregate value basis, equity is a bigger part of that value."

We have about a 9% parent free cash flow yields and about a 17% proportional free cash flow yield. And I think what's very important, what Tom said about the net debt that we pay dow at the subs, that the vast majority of this is in businesses that are ongoing businesses, whether it be, for example, DPL utility. So the money that we feel we're paying down there, we're creating value. I do agree that if that which, will be going for an out-of-the-money older coal plant, like, would not be necessary creating future equity value. But that's very small of that total number. So the most of it is going in for  ongoing businesses. And realize that because we are in markets that are growing, those plants that we have that we're paying down on nonrecourse debt are likely to even be recontracted at the same higher prices in many cases, because we're in markets that are at growing 10%.

We're working with other folks down in similar positions. But at this point, we're conscious and we're not breaking any value, cash earnings or anything else, and our outlook at this point in time. In Maritza, we continue to be positive about it. As you know, we do have a large receivable now of $330 million. Everyone's on board in terms of banks. The issue, in any case, is owned by a holding company called BEH. BEH does have public debt out there. I believe it trades on a 5%, 5.5%. But they've taken up proposals for some bank groups. There's 2 or 3 large groups. They've -- the primary issue is whether the banks that will a bridge before a public take out, that would basically be a very [indiscernible] with the current BEH outstanding, whether banks wouldn't get a sovereign guarantee for all or part of that [indiscernible] that's the major discussion. Our team's obviously in the middle of this to maybe some other ways to work our way through this. So with that ultimately, this will be resolved. We do think, given its times marching on for 2015, it may be in 2016. That's not a material issue for us at this point, as you said. As you asked, Keith, we'll be in the range for proportional free cash flow if Maritza resolution doesn't happen this year, albeit it will be in the lower end of the range.

I mean, one of the issues we've had in Brazil in Sul is that the interest rates in that particular business, which was hit by the drought and the lag in tariff increases and, therefore, needed more cash in interest rates on loans in Brazil are 18% to 19%. So we will be cautious about that. I mean, realize that 95% plus of our debt is in the functional currency of that business. So that means in businesses like Brazil, you have to go with floating rates to accomplish that, so we don't have the currency mismatch. But to answer your question, we do have those opportunities. Tom and the team have taken advantage of it. In many cases, it's to put that money to work on what we think are very attractive adjacencies, sort of Brownfield type projects.

Since our last call, the global macroeconomic environment has continued to weaken, and we've seen a further drop in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and economic growth in some of our markets. As you may have seen in our press release, these conditions are reducing our earnings outlook. Despite these challenges, we're taking measures to reduce their impact and we'll continue to generate strong and growing free cash flow, which we will use to maximize risk-adjusted shareholder returns. Today, I will discuss the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our outlook, our mitigation plan and our capital allocation strategy. Then, Tom will provide our third quarter results, an update on our 2015 guidance and our capital allocation plans for 2015 and 2016. 
Beginning with the macroeconomic factors I just mentioned, the majority of the decline in our earnings forecast is related currencies and commodities moving against us as well as the deteriorating economic outlook in Brazil. As you may know, some of our businesses, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Europe, have been impacted by the valuations of up to 35% in their local currencies. Furthermore, lower oil and electricity prices have a direct impact at our businesses in the Dominican Republic, DP&L and Kilroot. To mitigate the impact of these factors, we are launching a $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative. This initiative will include overhead reductions, procurement efficiencies and operational improvements. We expect to achieve at least $50 million in savings in 2016, ramping up to $150 million, including modest revenue enhancements in 2018. These bottom line improvements are on top of the $200 million of overhead cost reductions and the $170 million of productivity enhancements we have initiated since 2012. I will discuss these drivers in more detail in a few minutes. 
Turning to Slide 4 and our expectations for cash flow growth through 2018. Despite being affected by the macroeconomic pressures that I just discussed, our free cash flow remains strong. We're expecting average annual growth in proportional and parent free cash flow of at least 10%. Specifically, in 2016, we expect to generate roughly $1.3 billion of proportional free cash flow, which translates to $1.90 per share. We also expect to generate about $625 million in parent free cash flow in 2016, which is 20% higher than our 2015 guidance. Our focus on improving sustainable cash to the parent through more efficient use of cash at our subsidiaries has helped us reduce the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on our parent free cash flow. As you may recall, parent free cash flow is the basis for our dividend and capital allocation decisions. 
Turning to Slide 5. We believe proportional free cash flow is the most important valuation metric for AES as it represents the cash generated at our businesses that can be distributed to the parent or utilized locally to delever or fund growth. Proportional free cash flow is essentially operating cash flow minus maintenance CapEx adjusted for our ownership. In 2016, we expect to generate $1.3 billion in proportional free cash flow. Of this, approximately 40% or $500 million is expected to be used to pay down nonrecourse debt at our subsidiaries, which generates equity value, and roughly 15% or $175 million may be retained by our subsidiaries due to timing or other reasons. That leaves us with $625 million of parent free cash flow, which is available for discretionary uses at corp. 
Turning now to Slide 6. As a reminder, the projected growth in our cash flow is driven by our projects currently under construction, which remain on budget and are expected to come online through 2018. All but $160 million of our $1.1 billion in equity requirements for these projects has already been funded, and we continue to expect average cash returns of around 15%. 
Turning now to our adjusted EPS guidance beginning on Slide 7. In 2016, the impact from macroeconomic factors is roughly $0.25. The most significant drivers of our revised guidance are: first, the deterioration in the forward curves for commodities and currencies from December 2014 to October 2015 accounts for more than half of the impact or $0.15, in line with the sensitivities we provided; second, we're seeing another $0.05 from lower demand and higher interest rates in Brazil, primarily at our utility in Río Grande do Sul, which has also experienced catastrophic flooding in October. Previously, we have been expecting demand growth of 2.5% for Brazil, but we have seen a 5% drop in demand in 2015 and expect no recovery in 2016; third, there's an additional $0.04 impact from regulatory changes at El Niño. The regulatory changes affect capacity prices in the United Kingdom and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic. Although hydrology in Latin America has improved, we are still expecting El Niño to have a slight negative impact on our businesses in Brazil and Panama; and finally, we expect to offset $0.05 of these headwinds to our new cost savings initiatives. Taking all these factors into account, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range is $1.05 to $1.15. 
Turning now to Slide 8, which shows our updated outlook for adjusted EPS growth through 2018. Although the net impact on our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is approximately $0.20, our cost savings and other initiatives will reduce the net decrease to about $0.06 per share by 2018, which keeps us within the low end of our previous 2018 expectations. 
Now on to capital allocation beginning on Slide 9. When we laid out our strategy 4 years ago, we identified specific levers to improve total shareholder returns, reduce risk and simplify the portfolio. By completing timely exits from 10 countries and netting $3 billion from our asset sales, our portfolio is in a much stronger position today than it was 4 years ago. Over this period, we have allocated 80% of our $5 billion in discretionary cash to debt paydown and returns to shareholders. This has resulted in a 23% reduction in parent debt and a 14% reduction in share count. In fact, as you can see on Slide 10, since 2012, we have returned 2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $700 million or 9% of our current market cap in 2015. 
Turning to Slide 11. Going forward, after debt paydown at our subsidiaries, we expect to have a total of $2.6 billion in discretionary cash available through 2018, which is roughly 1/3 of our current market cap. After shareholder dividends and investments in projects under construction, we will have $1.3 billion available for other discretionary uses. These include targeting 10% annual dividend growth, continuing to delever in order to improve our credit metrics and reduce cash and earnings volatility and opportunistically utilizing our new forward authorization for $400 million in share repurchases. And finally, while we're still seeing a number of attractive growth opportunities, mainly in brownfield projects across the portfolio, the benchmarks for new investments has been raised. We are focused on completing those projects under construction as well as the Southland repowering and LNG-related facilities in Panama. We will continue to complete any potential investments against the other capital allocation alternatives I just discussed. 
I would also like to point out that the $1.3 billion in discretionary cash I outlined does not include up to $1 billion in potential asset sale proceeds through 2018. As we allocate capital among these alternatives, we will look to further reduce risk and enhance returns as we continue to fine-tune our portfolio. We expect to strengthen our credit profile over time as we pay down debt, complete our construction projects and grow our cash flow. These actions will improve the stability of our cash flow and earnings. 
The bottom line is our portfolio generates strong and growing free cash flow, which we will use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our third quarter and year-to-date results and full year 2015 guidance."

Today, I'll review our third quarter results, including proportional free cash flow by strategic business unit, or SBU; adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by SBU. Then I'll cover our 2015 guidance as well as our '15 and '16 capital allocation plans. 
Turning to Slide 13. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 was $0.02 higher than third quarter 2014. At a high level, we benefited from a reduction in share count of 6% or 43 million shares and lower parent interest expense as well as higher equity earnings as a result of a restructuring of one of our businesses in Chile, which we discussed on our Q1 call. These positive contributions were partially offset by lower operating results of some of our businesses such as DPL and in the Dominican Republic, which were negative year-over-year, but not material versus our full year expectations, the roughly 35% devaluation in foreign currencies, particularly the Brazilian real and Colombian peso. 
Turning to Slide 14. Overall, we generated $621 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $194 million from last year, and we earned $322 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $32 million. 
Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail on the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 15. In the U.S., our results were largely impacted by lower contributions from DPL, primarily due to the expected transition in the market prices for our regulated load and lower merchant volumes and prices. Proportional free cash flow was further impacted by lower collections and the timing of working capital at IPL. 
In Andes, our results improved, primarily due to the gain on restructuring at Guacolda in Chile and higher energy prices at Chivor in Colombia, partially offset by the devaluation of the Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from increased VAT refunds related to the construction of Cochrane in Chile. 
In Brazil, we benefited from lower spot purchases due to the seasonality in shaping of our contracted requirement at Tietê, partially offset by a weaker Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow was negatively impacted by increased working capital as a result of higher recoverable energy purchases at Eletropaulo. 
In MCAC, our results were largely impacted by lower spot sales and ancillary service revenue in the Dominican Republic, partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama. Proportional free cash flow had a very strong increase in the timing of collection of outstanding receivables in the Dominican Republic. 
In Europe, we were negatively impacted mainly due to weaker euro and the timing of planned outages at Maritza in Bulgaria as well as the sale of Ebute in 2014. Proportional free cash flow improved, largely driven by higher collections at Kavarna in Bulgaria. 
Finally, in Asia. We benefited from improved availability at Masinloc in the Philippines and the commencement of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam. 
Turning now to 2015 guidance on Slide 21. Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the year, we're already at about 95% of the low end of our proportional free cash flow guidance and are confident that we'll be in the range. One key variable that will put us towards the high end of that range is the receipt of the $330 million in outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria as part of the previously announced capacity price reduction agreement. The government-owned utility, NEK, and the holding company, BEH, are in the process of raising capital to pay these receivables. The remaining issue is the extent of government guarantee for purchase financing prior to the issuance of a long-term bond. While we expect to close later this year, payment could slip into early next year. 
Turning to adjusted EPS. As we've discussed in our prior calls, we've been facing significant headwinds of about $0.20 from currencies, commodities, hydrology and declining economic conditions in Brazil. We've offset the majority of these impacts through cost savings, hedging and capital allocation. Unfortunately, same pressures have continued in the third quarter, and we face an additional $0.07 impact. We've also faced a $0.02 impact from outages at DPL and AES Hawaii. We've been working to implement additional opportunities, but now believe it will be difficult to capture. We're therefore lowering our guidance range to $1.18 to $1.25 per share, which is roughly $0.08 lower than the midpoint of our prior guidance of $1.25 to $1.35. 
Now to Slide 22 and our parent capital allocation plan for 2015. Source on the left-hand side reflect total available discretionary cash, roughly $1.5 billion. As a reminder, we previously announced asset sale proceeds from the sale of portion of our interest in IPALCO in Jordan as well as the sales of the Armenia Mountain wind farm and our solar assets in Spain. Today, we're also announcing the closing of the sale of our solar assets in Italy for $42 million, bringing our total asset sale proceeds this year to $401 million. We're also expecting additional $27 million return of capital, which with our parent free cash flow, provides us with roughly $550 million available for dividend payments and growth, incremental share repurchases, debt reduction and potential investments. 
Turning to uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest $140 million in our subsidiaries, which does not include direct investments by CDPQ into IPL. We've invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing of parent debt, leaving us with only $180 million in parent debt maturities through 2018. In addition to the dividend, we've invested 423 million of our shares. This brings total cash return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $700 million for the year. Finally, we expect to have unallocated discretionary cash of about $225 million for the rest of the year. 
Turning now to 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.2 billion of total available discretionary cash for '16. This includes asset sale proceeds of approximately $200 million, the majority of which is coming from 1 transaction we expect to announce shortly. Discretionary cash also includes our parent free cash flow of $625 million, which is approximately 20% higher than the midpoint of this year's expectation. 
Strong cash flow -- the strong growth in our parent free cash flow demonstrates our increasing focus to upstream sustainable and growing cash from our businesses to further improve returns to our shareholders. In fact, parent free cash flow is the largest contributor to the expected $2.6 billion in discretionary cash available through 2018 that Andres just covered. We're also expecting $70 million in return of capital from operating businesses. Additional potential asset sale proceeds could further increase our discretionary cash by up to $1 billion to 2018. 
Turning to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. As Andres mentioned, we're investing our projects under construction as well as already announced expansion projects at Southland California and in Panama. After considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment, we're left with roughly $400 million of discretionary cash to be allocated. Consistent with our capital allocation framework, we'll invest this cash in dividend growth, further debt reduction to continue to improve our debt profile and increase the stability of equity cash flows and share repurchases. Regarding new growth investments, we'll continue to compete any new projects against share repurchases. All in all, our 2016 parent free cash flow and proportional free cash flow are growing significantly over 2015, and we expect this trend to continue through 2018 and beyond. 
With that now I'll now turn it back to Andres."

In summary, we're pulling all levers from cost reductions to capital allocation to respond to the challenges presented by a generally weaker global economy. As a reminder, our 6 gigawatts of projects under construction are largely funded and are the driver of at least 10% average annual growth in proportional and parent free cash flow for the next 3 years. 
Looking forward, we do not believe that our strong and growing cash flow is fully reflected in our valuation. Over the next 3 years, we will generate $2.6 billion in discretionary cash, an amount equal to 1/3 of our current market cap. As our track record demonstrates, we will invest in dividend growth, debt paydown and share repurchases. In fact, in 2015 alone, we have return 700 million or roughly 9% of our current market cap to our shareholders. 
With that, I would now like to open up the call for questions."

We've already done a $200 million initiative, which we started in 2012. And sort of recalling a little bit, we had set out $100 million program, and we managed to get twice that number of savings. So what does this comprise? Well, what we have in front of us for next year is $50 million, and that will be 100% cost reductions. And these are things that we have identified in terms of becoming a more efficient company, streamlining our structure, streamlining processes and really making sure that every single dollar that we're spending is going towards meeting our objectives. So for example, we have to make sure that we're not spending any money on any business development, for example, in deals that we're not going to do over the next couple of years. So I think we have this very well identified for 2016. When we think of 2017, then we start getting into some of the initiatives that we've had in the past that we've started and we're well underway. We have a chart of accounts now. We're really looking at our procurement efficiencies. We have -- we're starting to really achieve significant efficiencies on our new construction projects. So by standardization and by sort of more global deals, and we really think that we have to get this more into our global procurement as well. There will be continued streamlining of the company as well, and this continues into '18. And I said, the only thing in '18, we see a small number, maybe 10% of this, 15% of this. In terms of revenue enhancement, these are several things that we've identified. But one of them, which we don't have in our forecast and we have very well advanced, is really having a channel partner to sell some of our Advancion product. So we think by then, it's reasonable to think that we'd have some income from this. So we feel very confident about hitting this $150 million. And if you go back to our earnings call, we have always hit our cost savings and revenue enhancement numbers."

So that normally, El Niño would be favorable to us, but in the very case of the very strong El Niños, it tends to be a bit drier in Panama than a normal El Niño. And if you look at Southern Brazil, you tend to get more rains in the extreme southeast and somewhat less rains in the Central South. So we're taking those into perspective. Normally in Colombia, it's somewhat better, but with a very strong El Niño, it's a little bit more volatile. So that's the net-net that we think it's a little bit negative from these factors. One thing that hasn't been perhaps highlighted is that we've had really torrential rains in Sul, in Río Grande do Sul. We've had the worst rains since 1940. We've had storms that just recently knockout 14 transmission towers and left half of the million customers without power. And so that's one of the things, for example, that's affecting our 2015 guidance. So it's basically, these factors -- it's a little bit Brazil, it's a little bit Panama, and we're not expecting -- because it's a strong El Niño to have the full offset in the case of Chivor in Colombia."

And we're able to do that because of this global scale and reach that we have. I think we've also shown that the portfolio, in this case, is offsetting, doing well in one place, it's not doing well in the other. And we think we have a combination of rapidly growing markets in Asia. And Latin America is going through, I'd say, a downturn in the cycle. But realize that other than Brazil, these markets are growing. Whereas for example, in the U.S., it's a market where energy demand is not growing. Now having said that, we have further fine-tuning to do. We have to sell down those areas we have particular risks that have been affecting us. We're growing in those areas. For example, if you look at where our growth is, 80% is U.S. or its Chile, or even if you include Panama, it's dollar denominated. So we're decreasing our currency and hydro risk over time. So we will continue to do what we've done in terms of fine-tuning this portfolio, taking advantage of our synergies, making it more efficient, cutting costs, standardizing to become the good operator. But we keep an open mind. I mean, I think that we have -- when, for example, people were discussing yieldcos in the past, we said we'd look at it. We didn't see a really a fit for us, and we also felt that, that would commit us to growth in situations where the markets may not be good. So having said that, we'll keep an open mind, but I think we've shown a lot of prudence in terms of going forward. And we continue to look hard at our portfolio, what makes sense as a whole. And we think we're on the right track. I mean, we've been hit with some pretty hard exogenous factors. But as we fine-tune this portfolio, it will be less susceptible to them over time."

Keith, I'll just say on proportional free cash flow, maintenance and environmental CapEx is coming down just as a -- the general sense, it was close to $600 million this year. Over the next 2 -- couple of years, it's can be closer to $500 million. Pa",597,"Yes. Keith, I'll just say on proportional free cash flow, maintenance and environmental CapEx is coming down just as a -- the general sense, it was close to $600 million this year. Over the next 2 -- couple of years, it's can be closer to $500 million. Part of that's just working hard with efficiencies, but also, we did finish an enviro retrofit program at Chile that's basically finished at the end of '15, so that helps us. And then you contrast that with growing depreciation from new assets. So we saw the differential between maintenance and environmental CapEx versus earnings. It's about $300 million today. And that differential grows about $75 million a year. But then we've always said we do have NOLs that hit EPS, don't hit cash, and then just sometimes, when you bring a new business out, especially a new project, it can be more -- the earnings can be lean at the early years, let's say. But cash, cash continues to be strong. On parent free cash flow, what we -- it is increasing focus of the business. It has been for a couple of years, but we continue to find ways to drive, let's say, efficient use of cash through the business. It may come through inventories that'll be down about 15% year-over-year. Our unrestricted cash on the balance sheet will be down about $100 million a year, and it's down about $300 million from a couple of years ago. So we continue to look for just efficient ways to run the business. I will say that when we talk about parent free cash flow, all that is earnings. It's either earnings from this year or it's retained earnings from the prior year, and that's what it -- when we call it parent free cash flow, it has to be earnings, either this year or last year's or whatever. So when we do something -- like the genco financing, if it's a reflection of prior retained earnings, then we'll call it parent free cash flow. If it's a reflection of cash beyond retained earnings, then we call it return of capital. And that's why we make that distinction. It's really -- as a shareholder, it's really all money. We make that distinction, which is really accounting driven. But we do think there are continued opportunities. A lot of that is just growing cash in the businesses. It's a function of proportional free cash flow, but then there are also opportunities to get businesses that may be levered over time. We can relever them periodically. Obviously, you don't do that every year, you do that every few years. And other ways to look to upstream cash, it's a big focus. I will just say on the comment of -- we do pay down a fair amount of subsidiary debt, $450 million, $500 million a year subsidiarity debt. And a lot of that, we get value for, but we get it -- let's say, in lumps. We will get it because we'll refi something at one point in time. It allows to have a chunkier dividend that year. We may get it from the opportunity to build something where we created equity value with a business and you can build something basically all debt because your equity yield's already embedded in the business. We're doing that right now in the DR. And then also, obviously, to the extent that we delever a business, like DPL, we're delivering. And so that -- on an aggregate value basis, equity's a bigger part of ag value."

We have about a 9% parent free cash flow yield and about a 17% proportional free cash flow yield. And I think what's very important, what Tom said about the net debt that we pay dow at the subs, that the vast majority of this is in businesses that are ongoing businesses, whether it be, for example, DPL utility. So the money we feel we're paying down there, we're creating value. I do agree that if that which would be going for an out-of-the-money older coal plant, like -- but would not be necessarily creating future equity value, but that's very small of that total number. So the most of it is going in for going -- ongoing businesses. And realize that because we are in markets that are growing, those plants that we have that we're paying down nonrecourse debt are likely to even be recontracted at the same higher prices in many cases, because we're in markets that are at growing 10%. So this is a very different dynamic, say, than in the states, where we basically have flat demand."

There are discussions going on down in Brazil about compensation to the generators for the meaningful reduction in output GSF beyond their, let's say, their nameplate. This year, it's going to be about, let's say, 83% to 85% of GSF. The discussions are ongoing. I think there are some offsets or some exchanges that have to be made to get some of that. And we're cautious, I'd say, about whether that'll be really value to us. So we're not baking any of that into our numbers. I think it's the important thing. We're obviously -- team's working hard. They're working with other folks down there in similar positions. But at this point, we're conscious and we're not baking any value, cash earnings or anything else into our outlook at this point in time. In Maritza, we continue to be positive about it. As you know, we do have a large receivable now of $330 million. Everyone's on board in terms of the banks. The issue, any case, is owned by a holding company called BEH. BEH does have public debt out there. I believe it trades on a 5%, 5.5%. But they've taken up proposals for some bank groups. There's 2 or 3 large groups. They've -- the primary issue is whether the banks that would do a bridge before a public take out, it would basically be a very best here with the current BEH outstanding, whether banks wouldn't get a sovereign guarantee for all or part of that. That's the major discussion. Our team's obviously in the middle of this to maybe some other ways to work our way through it. So we think, ultimately, this will be resolved. We do think, given its times marching on here for 2015, it may be in 2016. That's not a material issue for us at this point, as you said. As you asked, Keith, we'll be in the range for proportional free cash flow if Maritza resolution doesn't happen this year, albeit it will be in the lower end of the range. But then, we would expect it to happen next year, and obviously, we'll have a very large number for next year. The discount that would accrue, which is about $2 million or $3 million amount, does not kick in until we get paid."

I would say that it really is going to depend on the development in those markets and what rates we can relever these businesses.

So we will be cautious about that. I mean, realize that 95% plus of our subsidiary debt is in the functional currency of that business. So that means in places like Brazil, you have to go on floating rates to accomplish that. So we don't have a currency mismatch. But to answer your question, we do have those opportunities. Tom and the team have taken advantage of it. In many cases, it's to put that money to work on what we think are very attractive adjacencies, sort of brownfield type projects.

Right now we're really focused on completing our projects and those that we mentioned at Southland and Panama, a little desal in Chile and some energy storage projects, which we think have a great potential, not only for the project themselves, but also to help us with sort of third-party channel sales of our technology. There -- I'd say Mexico is a market that looks attractive given the partner that we have. But we're going to be very disciplined. We're going to be very disciplined going forward, because obviously, we have to react to the change in circumstances. And we think that we have a lot of embedded growth in what we've already done. So we don't want to be in a situation where we're spending on things that therefore we can't finance or we have a better opportunity to use that money somewhere else. Now having said that, if you -- we give guidance out to 2018, but obviously, 2019 is going to be even stronger. And then in 2020, you have Southland coming on. So we also want to have the opportunity for more of these brownfield additions in the sort of '19, '20 space. But we're not going to be spending a lot of money chasing them at this stage. But if there are opportunities that we can keep at a low cost at the back burner, we will be looking at those."

There's still a lot of opportunities in Brazil, especially they do have structural reforms. So I think, everybody, if you look sort of a medium to longer term outlook for Brazil in the energy sector, it will be far more positive than the outlook today, because you're really looking at. And I think what's important to realize about Brazil is not just commodities that is affecting them, it's really been internal politics and internal decisions. So their ability to recover is much greater. So that's it. We don't expect great recovery in Brazil in '16 and maybe even '17, but thereafter, the sort of fundamentals of the market look pretty sound."

So we have initiated -- we have service centers, already lower-cost locations where we operate, so we're going to lever off those in order to continue to have more G&A transactional process or back office that will be done in those lower-cost locations. The other one is standardization and replication of AES leading practices of our CapEx programs. That is actually to improve our ability for our 35 gigawatts fleet. And that is also including heat rate and lower our outage efforts that we have in our fleet. And the last pocket is really streamline our organization as we'll rebalance the portfolio.

Since our last call, the global macroeconomic environment has continued to weaken, and we've seen a further drop in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and economic growth in some of our markets. As you may have seen in our press release, these conditions are reducing our earnings outlook. Despite these challenges, we're taking measures to reduce their impact and we'll continue to generate strong and growing free cash flow, which we will use to maximize risk-adjusted shareholder returns. Today, I will discuss the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our outlook, our mitigation plan and our capital allocation strategy. Then, Tom will provide our third quarter results, an update on our 2015 guidance and our capital allocation plans for 2015 and 2016. 
Beginning with the macroeconomic factors I just mentioned, the majority of the decline in our earnings forecast is related currencies and commodities moving against us as well as the deteriorating economic outlook in Brazil. As you may know, some of our businesses, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Europe, have been impacted by devaluations of up to 35% in their local currencies. Furthermore, lower oil and electricity prices have a direct impact at our businesses in the Dominican Republic, DP&L and Kilroot. To mitigate the impact of these factors, we are launching a $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative. This initiative will include overhead reductions, procurement efficiencies and operational improvements. We expect to achieve at least $50 million in savings in 2016, ramping up to $150 million, including modest revenue enhancements in 2018. These bottom line improvements are on top of the $200 million of overhead cost reductions and the $170 million of productivity enhancements we have initiated since 2012. I will discuss these drivers in more detail in a few minutes. 
Turning to Slide 4 and our expectations for cash flow growth through 2018. Despite being affected by the macroeconomic pressures that I just discussed, our free cash flow remains strong. We're expecting average annual growth in proportional and parent free cash flow of at least 10%. Specifically, in 2016, we expect to generate roughly $1.3 billion of proportional free cash flow, which translates to $1.90 per share. We also expect to generate about $625 million in parent free cash flow in 2016, which is 20% higher than our 2015 guidance. Our focus on improving sustainable cash to the parent through more efficient use of cash at our subsidiaries has helped us reduce the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on our parent free cash flow. As you may recall, parent free cash flow is the basis for our dividend and capital allocation decisions. 
Turning to Slide 5. We believe proportional free cash flow is the most important valuation metric for AES as it represents the cash generated at our businesses that can be distributed to the parent or utilized locally to delever or fund growth. Proportional free cash flow is essentially operating cash flow minus maintenance CapEx adjusted for our ownership. In 2016, we expect to generate $1.3 billion in proportional free cash flow. Of this, approximately 40% or $500 million is expected to be used to pay down nonrecourse debt at our subsidiaries, which generates equity value, and roughly 15% or $175 million may be retained by our subsidiaries due to timing or other reasons. That leaves us with $625 million of parent free cash flow, which is available for discretionary uses at corp. 
Turning now to Slide 6. As a reminder, the projected growth in our cash flow is driven by our projects currently under construction, which remain on budget and are expected to come online through 2018. All but $160 million of our $1.1 billion in equity requirements for these projects has already been funded, and we continue to expect average cash returns of around 15%. 
Turning now to our adjusted EPS guidance beginning on Slide 7. In 2016, the impact from macroeconomic factors is roughly $0.25. The most significant drivers of our revised guidance are: first, the deterioration in the forward curves for commodities and currencies from December 2014 to October 2015 accounts for more than half of the impact or $0.15, in line with the sensitivities we provided; second, we're seeing another $0.05 from lower demand and higher interest rates in Brazil, primarily at our utility in Río Grande do Sul, which has also experienced catastrophic flooding in October. Previously, we have been expecting demand growth of 2.5% for Brazil, but we have seen a 5% drop in demand in 2015 and expect no recovery in 2016; third, there's an additional $0.04 impact from regulatory changes at El Niño. The regulatory changes affect capacity prices in the United Kingdom and ancillary services in the Dominican Republic. Although hydrology in Latin America has improved, we are still expecting El Niño to have a slight negative impact on our businesses in Brazil and Panama; and finally, we expect to offset $0.05 of these headwinds to our new cost savings initiatives. Taking all these factors into account, our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range is $1.05 to $1.15. 
Turning now to Slide 8, which shows our updated outlook for adjusted EPS growth through 2018. Although the net impact on our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is approximately $0.20, our cost savings and other initiatives will reduce the net decrease to about $0.06 per share by 2018, which keeps us within the low end of our previous 2018 expectations. 
Now on to capital allocation beginning on Slide 9. When we laid out our strategy 4 years ago, we identified specific levers to improve total shareholder returns, reduce risk and simplify the portfolio. By completing timely exits from 10 countries and netting $3 billion from our asset sales, our portfolio is in a much stronger position today than it was 4 years ago. Over this period, we have allocated 80% of our $5 billion in discretionary cash to debt paydown and returns to shareholders. This has resulted in a 23% reduction in parent debt and a 14% reduction in share count. In fact, as you can see on Slide 10, since 2012, we have returned 2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $700 million or 9% of our current market cap in 2015. 
Turning to Slide 11. Going forward, after debt paydown at our subsidiaries, we expect to have a total of $2.6 billion in discretionary cash available through 2018, which is roughly 1/3 of our current market cap. After shareholder dividends and investments in projects under construction, we will have $1.3 billion available for other discretionary uses. These include targeting 10% annual dividend growth, continuing to delever in order to improve our credit metrics and reduce cash and earnings volatility and opportunistically utilizing our new forward authorization for $400 million in share repurchases. And finally, while we're still seeing a number of attractive growth opportunities, mainly in brownfield projects across the portfolio, the benchmarks for new investments has been raised. We are focused on completing those projects under construction as well as the Southland repowering and LNG-related facilities in Panama. We will continue to compete any potential investments against the other capital allocation alternatives I just discussed. 
I would also like to point out that the $1.3 billion in discretionary cash I outlined does not include up to $1 billion in potential asset sale proceeds through 2018. As we allocate capital among these alternatives, we will look to further reduce risk and enhance returns as we continue to fine-tune our portfolio. We expect to strengthen our credit profile over time as we pay down debt, complete our construction projects and grow our cash flow. These actions will improve the stability of our cash flow and earnings. 
The bottom line is our portfolio generates strong and growing free cash flow, which we will use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our third quarter and year-to-date results and full year 2015 guidance."

Today, I'll review our third quarter results, including proportional free cash flow by strategic business unit, or SBU; adjusted EPS; adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by SBU. Then I'll cover our 2015 guidance as well as our '15 and '16 capital allocation plans. 
Turning to Slide 13. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 was $0.02 higher than third quarter 2014. At a high level, we benefited from a reduction in share count of 6% or 43 million shares and lower parent interest expense as well as higher equity earnings as a result of a restructuring of one of our businesses in Chile, which we discussed on our Q1 call. These positive contributions were partially offset by lower operating results at some of our businesses such as DPL and in the Dominican Republic, which were negative year-over-year, but not material versus our full year expectations, the roughly 35% devaluation in foreign currencies, particularly the Brazilian real and Colombian peso. 
Turning to Slide 14. Overall, we generated $621 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $194 million from last year, and we earned $322 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $32 million. 
Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail on the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 15. In the U.S., our results were largely impacted by lower contributions from DPL, primarily due to the expected transition in the market prices for our regulated load and lower merchant volumes and prices. Proportional free cash flow was further impacted by lower collections and the timing of working capital at IPL. 
In Andes, our results improved, primarily due to the gain on restructuring at Guacolda in Chile and higher energy prices at Chivor in Colombia, partially offset by the devaluation of the Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from increased VAT refunds related to the construction of Cochrane in Chile. 
In Brazil, we benefited from lower spot purchases due to the seasonality in shaping of our contracted requirement at Tietê, partially offset by a weaker Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow was negatively impacted by increased working capital as a result of higher recoverable energy purchases at Eletropaulo. 
In MCAC, our results were largely impacted by lower spot sales and ancillary service revenue in the Dominican Republic, partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama. Proportional free cash flow had a very strong increase in the timing of collection of outstanding receivables in the Dominican Republic. 
In Europe, we were negatively impacted mainly due to weaker euro and the timing of planned outages at Maritza in Bulgaria as well as the sale of Ebute in 2014. Proportional free cash flow improved, largely driven by higher collections at Kavarna in Bulgaria. 
Finally, in Asia. We benefited from improved availability at Masinloc in the Philippines and the commencement of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam. 
Turning now to 2015 guidance on Slide 21. Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the year, we're already at about 95% of the low end of our proportional free cash flow guidance and are confident that we'll be in the range. One key variable that will put us towards the high end of that range is the receipt of the $330 million in outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria as part of the previously announced capacity price reduction agreement. The government-owned utility, NEK, and the holding company, BEH, are in the process of raising capital to pay these receivables. The remaining issue is the extent of government guarantee for bridge financing prior to the issuance of a long-term bond. While we expect to close later this year, payment could slip into early next year. 
Turning to adjusted EPS. As we've discussed in our prior calls, we've been facing significant headwinds of about $0.20 from currencies, commodities, hydrology and declining economic conditions in Brazil. We've offset the majority of these impacts through cost savings, hedging and capital allocation. Unfortunately, same pressures have continued in the third quarter, and we face an additional $0.07 impact. We've also faced a $0.02 impact from outages at DPL and AES Hawaii. We've been working to implement additional opportunities, but now believe it will be difficult to capture. We're therefore lowering our guidance range to $1.18 to $1.25 per share, which is roughly $0.08 lower than the midpoint of our prior guidance of $1.25 to $1.35. 
Now to Slide 22 and our parent capital allocation plan for 2015. Source on the left-hand side reflect total available discretionary cash, roughly $1.5 billion. As a reminder, we previously announced asset sale proceeds from the sale of portion of our interest in IPALCO in Jordan as well as the sales of the Armenia Mountain wind farm and our solar assets in Spain. Today, we're also announcing the closing of the sale of our solar assets in Italy for $42 million, bringing our total asset sale proceeds this year to $401 million. We're also expecting additional $27 million in return of capital, which with our parent free cash flow, provides us with roughly $550 million available for dividend payments and growth, incremental share repurchases, debt reduction and potential investments. 
Turning to uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest $140 million in our subsidiaries, which does not include direct investments by CDPQ into IPL. We've invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing of parent debt, leaving us with only $180 million in parent debt maturities through 2018. In addition to the dividend, we've invested $423 million in our shares. This brings total cash return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $700 million for the year. Finally, we expect to have unallocated discretionary cash of about $225 million for the rest of the year. 
Turning now to 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 23. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.2 billion of total available discretionary cash for '16. This includes asset sale proceeds of approximately $200 million, the majority of which is coming from 1 transaction we expect to announce shortly. Discretionary cash also includes our parent free cash flow of $625 million, which is approximately 20% higher than the midpoint of this year's expectation. 
Strong cash flow -- the strong growth in our parent free cash flow demonstrates our increasing focus to upstream sustainable and growing cash from our businesses to further improve returns to our shareholders. In fact, parent free cash flow is the largest contributor to the expected $2.6 billion in discretionary cash available through 2018 that Andres just covered. We're also expecting $70 million in return of capital from operating businesses. Additional potential asset sale proceeds could further increase our discretionary cash by up to $1 billion through 2018. 
Turning to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. As Andres mentioned, we're investing our projects under construction as well as already announced expansion projects at Southland in California and in Panama. After considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment, we're left with roughly $400 million of discretionary cash to be allocated. Consistent with our capital allocation framework, we'll invest this cash in dividend growth, further debt reduction to continue to improve our debt profile and increase the stability of equity cash flows and share repurchases. Regarding new growth investments, we'll continue to compete any new projects against share repurchases. All in all, our 2016 parent free cash flow and proportional free cash flow are growing significantly over 2015, and we expect this trend to continue through 2018 and beyond. 
With that now I'll now turn it back to Andres."

In summary, we're pulling all levers from cost reductions to capital allocation to respond to the challenges presented by a generally weaker global economy. As a reminder, our 6 gigawatts of projects under construction are largely funded and are the driver of at least 10% average annual growth in proportional and parent free cash flow for the next 3 years. 
Looking forward, we do not believe that our strong and growing cash flow is fully reflected in our valuation. Over the next 3 years, we will generate $2.6 billion in discretionary cash, an amount equal to 1/3 of our current market cap. As our track record demonstrates, we will invest in dividend growth, debt paydown and share repurchases. In fact, in 2015 alone, we have return $700 million or roughly 9% of our current market cap to our shareholders. 
With that, I would now like to open up the call for questions."

We've already done a $200 million initiative, which we started in 2012. And sort of recalling a little bit, we had set out $100 million program, and we managed to get twice that number of savings. So what does this comprise? Well, what we have in front of us for next year is $50 million, and that will be 100% cost reductions. And these are things that we have identified in terms of becoming a more efficient company, streamlining our structure, streamlining processes and really making sure that every single dollar that we are spending is going towards meeting our objectives. So for example, we have to make sure that we're not spending any money on any business development, for example, in deals that we're not going to do over the next couple of years. So I think we have this very well identified for 2016. When we think of 2017, then we start getting into some of the initiatives that we've had in the past that we've started and we're well underway. We have a chart of accounts now. We're really looking at our procurement efficiencies. We have -- we're starting to really achieve significant efficiencies on our new construction projects. So by standardization and by sort of more global deals, and we really think that we have to get this more into our global procurement as well. There will be continued streamlining of the company as well, and this continues into '18. And I said, the only thing in '18, we see a small number, maybe 10% of this, 15% of this, in terms of revenue enhancements, these are several things that we've identified. But one of them, which we don't have in our forecast and we have very well advanced, is really having a channel partner to sell some of our Advancion product. So we think by then, it's reasonable to think that we'd have some income from this. So we feel very confident about hitting this $150 million. And if you go back to our earnings call, we have always hit our cost savings and revenue enhancement numbers."

So that normally, El Niño would be favorable to us, but in the very case of the very strong El Niños, it tends to be a bit drier in Panama than a normal El Niño. And if you look at Southern Brazil, you tend to get more rains in the extreme southeast and somewhat less rains in the Central South. So we're taking those into perspective. Normally in Colombia, it's somewhat better, but with a very strong El Niño, it's a little bit more volatile. So that's the net-net that we think it's a little bit negative from these factors. One thing that hasn't been perhaps highlighted is that we've had really torrential rains in Sul, in Río Grande do Sul. We've had the worst rains since 1940. We've had storms that just recently knockout 14 transmission towers and left half of the million customers without power. And so that's one of the things, for example, that's affecting our 2015 guidance. So it's basically, these factors -- it's a little bit Brazil, it's a little bit Panama, and we're not expecting -- because it's a strong El Niño to have the full offset in the case of Chivor in Colombia."

So we will look at anything that we think increases shareholder value. Having said that, in terms of our portfolio, we think we have the global scale that really allows us to reap economies and synergies. So for example, if you look at recent bids, whether it be California or the gas plant in IPL, which had to basically compete with other alternatives, or the gas plant and the regasification terminal in Panama, we're winning bids against the best in the business. And we're able to do that because of this global scale and reach that we have. I think we've also shown that the portfolio, in this case, is offsetting, doing well in one place, it's not doing well in the other. And we think we have a combination of rapidly growing markets in Asia. And Latin America is going through, I'd say, a downturn in the cycle. But realize that other than Brazil, these markets are growing. Whereas for example, in the U.S., it's a market where energy demand is not growing. Now having said that, we have further fine-tuning to do. We have to sell down those areas we have particular risks that have been affecting us. We're growing in those areas. For example, if you look at where our growth is, 80% is U.S. or its Chile, or even if you include Panama, it's dollar denominated. So we're decreasing our currency and hydro risk over time. So we will continue to do what we've done in terms of fine-tuning this portfolio, taking advantage of our synergies, making it more efficient, cutting costs, standardizing to become the good operator. But we keep an open mind. I mean, I think that we have -- when, for example, people were discussing yieldcos in the past, we said we'd look at it. We didn't see a really a fit for us, and we also felt that, that would commit us to growth in situations where the markets may not be good. So having said that, we'll keep an open mind, but I think we've shown a lot of prudence in terms of going forwards. And we continue to look hard at our portfolio, what makes sense as a whole. And we think we're on the right track. I mean, we've been hit with some pretty hard exogenous factors. But as we fine tune this portfolio, it will be less susceptible to them over time."

Keith, I'll just say on proportional free cash flow, maintenance and environmental CapEx is coming down just as a -- the general sense, it was close to $600 million this year. Over the next 2 -- couple of years, it's can be closer to $500 million. Pa",596,"Yes. Keith, I'll just say on proportional free cash flow, maintenance and environmental CapEx is coming down just as a -- the general sense, it was close to $600 million this year. Over the next 2 -- couple of years, it's can be closer to $500 million. Part of that's just working hard with efficiencies, but also, we did finish an enviro retrofit program at Chile that's basically finished at the end of '15, so that helps us. And then you contrast that with growing depreciation from new assets. So the differential between maintenance and environmental CapEx versus earnings, it's about $300 million today, and that differential grows about $75 million a year. But then we've always said we do have NOLs that hit EPS, don't hit cash, and then just sometimes, when you bring a new business on, especially a new project, it can be more -- the earnings can be lean at the early years, let's say. But cash, cash continues to be strong. 
On parent free cash flow, what we -- it is increasing focus of the business. It has been for a couple of years, but we continue to find ways to drive, let's say, efficient use of cash through the business. It may come through inventories that'll be down about 15% year-over-year. Our unrestricted cash on the balance sheet will be down about $100 million a year, and it's down about $300 million from a couple of years ago. So we continue to look for just efficient ways to run the business. I will say that when we talk about parent free cash flow, all that is earnings. It's either earnings from this year or it's retained earnings from the prior year, and that's what -- when we call it parent free cash flow, it has to be earnings, either this year or last year's or whatever. So when we do something -- like the genco financing, if it's a reflection of prior retained earnings, then we'll call it parent free cash flow. If it's a reflection of cash beyond retained earnings, then we call it return of capital. And that's why we make that distinction. It's really -- as a shareholder, it's really all money. We make that distinction, which is really accounting driven. But we do think there are continued opportunities. A lot of that is just growing cash in the businesses. It's a function of proportional free cash flow, but then there are also opportunities to get businesses that may be levered over time. We can relever them periodically. Obviously, you don't do that every year, you do that every few years. And other ways to look to upstream cash, that's a big focus. I will just say on the comment of -- we do pay down a fair amount of subsidiary debt, $450 million, $500 million a year of subsidiarity debt. And a lot of that, we get value for, but we get it -- let's say, in lumps. We will get it because we'll refi something at one point in time and allow us to have a chunkier dividend that year. We may get it from the opportunity to build something where we created equity value with a business and you can build something basically all debt because your equity yield's already embedded in the business. We're doing that right now in the DR. And then also, obviously, to the extent that we delever a business, like DPL, we're delivering. And so that -- on an aggregate value basis, equity's a bigger part of ag value."

We have about a 9% parent free cash flow yield and about a 17% proportional free cash flow yield. And I think what's very important, what Tom said about the net debt that we pay down at the subs, that the vast majority of this is in businesses that are ongoing businesses, whether it be, for example, DPL utility. So the money we feel we're paying down there, we're creating value. I do agree that if that which would be going for an out-of-the-money older coal plant, like -- but would not be necessarily creating future equity value, but that's very small of that total number. So the most of it is going in for going -- ongoing businesses. And realize that because we are in markets that are growing, those plants that we have that we're paying down nonrecourse debt are likely to even be recontracted at the same higher prices in many cases, because we're in markets that are at growing 10%.

There are discussions going on down in Brazil about compensation to the generators for the meaningful reduction in output GSF beyond their, let's say, their nameplate. This year, it's going to be about, let's say, 83% to 85% of GSF. Those discussions are ongoing. I think there are some offsets or some exchanges that have to be made to get some of that. And we're cautious, I'd say, about whether that'll be really value to us. So we're not baking any of that into our numbers. I think it's the important thing. We're obviously -- team's working hard. They're working with other folks down there in similar positions. But at this point, we're cautious and we're not baking any value, cash earnings or anything else into our outlook at this point in time. 
In Maritza, we continue to be positive about it. As you know, we do have a large receivable now of $330 million. Everyone's on board in terms of the banks. The issue, NEK, is owned by a holding company called BEH. BEH does have public debt out there. I believe it trades on a 5%, 5.5%. But they've gone out for proposals from some bank groups. There's 2 or 3 large groups. They've -- the primary issue is whether the banks that would do a bridge before a public take out, it would basically be a pari passu with the current BEH outstanding, whether the banks would get a sovereign guarantee for all or part of that and that's the major discussion. Our team's obviously in the middle of this, there may be some other ways to work our way through it. So we think, ultimately, this will be resolved. We do think, given it's -- time's marching on here for 2015, it may be in 2016. That's not a material issue for us at this point, as you said -- as you asked, Keith, we'll be in the range for proportional free cash flow if Maritza resolution doesn't happen this year, albeit it will be in the lower end of the range. But then, we would expect it to happen next year, and obviously, we'll have a very large number for next year. The discount that would accrue, which is about $2 million or $3 million a month, does not kick in until we get paid."

I mean, we've talked a lot about Tietê over time, how to relever Tietê. I would say that it really is going to depend on the development in those markets and what rates we can relever these businesses. I mean, one of the issues we've had in Brazil at Sul is that the interest rates on that particular business, which was hit by the drought and the lag in tariff increases, and therefore, needed more cash is that interest rates on loans in Brazil are 18% to 19%. So we will be cautious about that. I mean, realize that 95% plus of our subsidiary debt is in the functional currency of that business. So that means in places like Brazil, you have to go with floating rates to accomplish that. So we don't have a currency mismatch. 
But to answer your question, we do have those opportunities. Tom and the team have taken advantage of it. In many cases, it's to put that money to work on what we think are very attractive adjacencies, sort of brownfield type projects.

I think we will continue to do what we've been doing. We'll continue to strengthen our credit over time. We have allocated some paydown of debt in 2016 as we did in 2015 as we've done before. And that will continue to make us more stable in terms of earnings and cash flow at the parent. So that's the focus that we have.

So we have initiated, we have service centers, already lower-cost locations where we operate, so we're going to lever off those in order to continue to have more G&A transactional process or back office that will be done in those lower-cost locations. The other one is standardization and replication of AES leading practices of our CapEx programs. That is actually to improve our ability for our 35 gigawatts fleet. And that is also including heat rate and lower our outage efforts that we have in our fleet. And the last pocket is really streamline our organization as we rebalance the portfolio. As we sell down some of our business or we sell some of our assets, we also are looking for what are the new operation that are coming in for our construction. And we are streamlining our organization in order to be more centralized and more focused and more efficient based on the portfolio that we have."
