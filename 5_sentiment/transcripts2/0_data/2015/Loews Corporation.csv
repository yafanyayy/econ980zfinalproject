I trust that you all had a chance to look at our press release, which was distributed earlier this morning. David Edelson, our CFO, will provide details in our earnings later on in the call. 
I want to start by discussing today's dividend related announcements from Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial, and then touch briefly on each of our subsidiaries and the parent company. The record decline in oil prices have severely impacted offshore drilling contractors, and we expect this negative impact to continue. Diamond's customers, the national and international oil companies, as well as the independent E&P companies have been scaling back their exploration and development budgets in light of the recent price plunge in their own cash flow shortfalls. Combined with the influx of new offshore drilling units that continue to enter the market, the oil price decline has led to a supply/demand imbalance that has driven down day rates, shortened contract terms and idled rigs.
In view of the decidedly negative conditions in the offshore drilling industry, the Diamond Offshore board has decided not to pay a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. As Diamond's majority shareholder, we support the board's decision to retain cash so that if opportunities to purchase rigs at attractive prices present themselves, the company is ready to act. Given the company's existing existing liquidity, it's $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility, it's modest leverage and it's strong credit ratings, we are optimistic that Diamond will be able to capitalize on the current turmoil in the offshore drilling market.
For those of you who tuned into our last call, you'll remember that with respect to Diamond, I said, trouble is opportunity. The trouble is certainly here and Diamond is prepared for the opportunity. 
At CNA, the company's balance sheet has never been stronger, ending the year with statutory capital of over $11 billion and GAAP shareholders' equity of almost $13 billion.
In its most recent writeup on CNA, Standard & Poor's stated that CNA has AAA level capital. As a result of its good earnings and robust capital position, CNA today declared a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA paid a $1 per share special dividend. The Divergent completely independent of paths of CNA's and Diamond's special dividends highlight the benefit to Loews of maintaining a diverse portfolio of subsidiaries.
The performance of Loews' stock during 2014 was negatively affected by the declines in stock prices of Boardwalk and Diamond. We took the opportunity during 2014 to buyback almost 4% of our outstanding shares, spending approximately $620 million in the process. While we're certainly not [indiscernible] in the decline in our share price, we believe that, over the long term, buying our stock at attractive levels will prove to have been the right decision.
Similarly, we believe that our purchase during the fourth quarter of 1.9 million shares of Diamond Offshore common stock will benefit our shareholders over the long term as well.
Loews ended the year with $5 billion in cash and investments, one of our perineal priorities is to maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet which gives us the flexibility to move quickly when opportunity knocks without having to rely on external financing sources. 
Now let's take a look at highlights from our subsidiaries. Then I'll turn the call over to David, who will walk you through our quarterly and annual results in greater detail.
Let's start with Diamond. Loews has been in the offshore drilling business for more than 25 years. In that time, we have learned one thing with absolute certainty: Offshore drilling is a cyclical business and Diamond is managed accordingly. 9 years ago when others were paying top dollar for new drilling rigs, Diamond began returning capital to shareholders by paying special dividends. Since January of '06, Diamond has paid over $41 per share in regular and special dividends, returning more than $5.7 billion to shareholders over that time.
We believe that the current market downturn is yet another cycle playing out in the offshore drilling and that the industry will eventually recover, it's just a matter of time. While no one knows with any certainty when the market will come back, I'm confident that Diamond will withstand this cyclical downturn as it has others. Diamond has the strongest balance sheets in the business, ample liquidity, moderate leverage and a patient majority shareholder that understands the cyclical nature of the offshore drilling industry.
Turning to CNA. CNA had a strong quarter and year. It's underlying combined ratio improved for the year due to a better business mix as the company continued to focus on industry segments where it has deep expertise such as technology, financial services and manufacturing. Additionally, CNA benefited from premium rate increases although such increases slowed somewhat in 2014. For the coming year, CNA will be operating in a market where rate increases are likely to be relatively modest and investment income will be constrained by the interest rate environment. CNA will not stretch for growth, choosing instead to forego growth in return for a more profitable core book of business.
Moving on to Boardwalk. About a year ago, Boardwalk made the difficult decision to reduce its quarterly cash distribution. Fast forward a year and it turned out to be exactly the right decision for the company and for long-term shareholders. Boardwalk has been able to utilize internally generated funds and to take advantage of growth opportunities avoiding dilution. In fact, almost all of its distributable cash flow has gone towards growth projects or distribution payments. New opportunities for growth continued to materialize in 2014 as Boardwalk secured an impressive $1.5 billion in organic projects to be built over the next 3 to 4 years. While these projects come online -- when these projects come online, they are expected to generate double-digit, unlevered return for years to come.
And last but not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels has been focused on building its brand and broadening its customer base by adding properties in gateway cities and resort destinations as well as by renovating existing properties. The financial performance has shown strong improvement, in part as a result of our capital investment over the past several years. We're enhancing our disclosure regarding Loews Hotels this quarter. David will walk you through the company's adjusted EBITDA during his remarks.
We're excited that Kirk [indiscernible] has agreed to lead Loews Hotels for the next phase of its growth. He will join Loews Hotels in March. Kirk has tremendous experience in the hospitality industry, having most recently been President of the Americas for InterContinental Hotels Group, where he had responsibility for 3,700 hotels. Paul [indiscernible] who has served as Loews Hotels' CEO for the past 3 years has done a fantastic job at growing the plan and improving operations. Paul will become Vice Chairman of Loews Hotel once Kirk joins in March. And coincidentally, Mark's first day as CEO will also be the first day that the Loews Chicago Hotel will be open for business. Make your reservations now.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to David."

For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continui",1372,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continuing operations was $962 million or $2.52 per share as compared to $1.1 billion or $2.95 per share in 2013.
Our reduction in parent company investment income drove the quarter-over-quarter decline. For the full year, the main drivers were lower earnings contributions from CNA, Diamond and Boardwalk.
CNA contributed $186 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2014, essentially flat with last year's fourth quarter. One-time items affected the quarterly results in both years, as CNA pension settlement charge reduced Loews Q4 2014 income by $49 million, while a charge related to retroactively insurance accounting for the Loews portfolio transfer transaction reduced our Q4 2013 income by $111 million.
CNA's net investment income in Q4 2014 was down versus the prior year, driven primarily by limited partnership investments. Offsetting positives included higher net favorable prior year development, together with improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses. In Q4 2014, CNA posted slight realized investment losses versus modest gains in the prior year quarter. 
For full year 2014, CNA contributed $770 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized gains, down from $817 million in 2013. Reduced net investment income and lower net favorable prior year development drove the year-over-year decline. Partially offsetting these declines were improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophes. One-time items also affected the 2 years. 
In 2014, a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of CNA's annuity and pension deposit business reduced CNA's earnings distribution to Loews by $31 million. And in 2013, as just mentioned, the charge related to the loss portfolio transfer, reduced our income by $111 million. CNA posted a higher level of realized investment gains in 2014 than in 2013.
Diamond Offshore contributed $47 million to Loews' income from continuing operations during Q4 2014, up from $44 million last year. Diamond's pretax income was actually down versus prior year. A slight increase in the EBITDA was more than offset by higher depreciation and interest expense. Further, in last year's fourth quarter, Diamond's net income was impacted by a high effective tax rate, driven by a provision for an uncertain tax position. This reduced Diamond's after-tax contribution to Loews last year by $27 million.
For full year 2014, Diamond contributed $183 million to Loews' net income, down from $257 million in 2013. The company's third quarter 2014 rig impairment charge drove the decline, together with lower rig operating income, higher depreciation and interest expense and higher G&A expenses. Partially offsetting the decline in pretax income was a 4-point reduction in the company's tax rate caused by various factors, including the Q4 2013 tax provision previously mentioned and in the third quarter of 2014, the benefit to Diamond from settling uncertain tax positions related to several foreign jurisdictions.
Diamond took delivery of 3 drillships and 2 semisubmersibles in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the company expects to take delivery of the Ocean BlackLion, it's fourth new drillship, and the Ocean GreatWhite, it's newbuild, harsh environment semisubmersible. Both of these units are already contracted.
Between its balance sheet liquidity and it's $1.5 billion bank revolver, Diamond has ample liquidity for its current capital projects. Additionally, haulting this special dividend will enable Diamond to retain, on an annualized basis, over $400 million of cash to bolster its available liquidity.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $11 million to Loews' net income during Q4 2014, up from $4 million last year. After adjusting for a goodwill impairment charge in last year's fourth quarter, however, Boardwalk's contribution declined from $20 million last year to this year's $11 million. Boardwalk's fourth quarter 2014 results were negatively impacted contributed by lower storage and parking loan revenue as well as by higher operating expenses.
For full year 2014, Boardwalk contributed $18 million to Loews' net income versus $78 million for 2013. The major one-time items impacting this year-over-year comparison in 2013 were the just mentioned goodwill impairment charge and a partially offsetting gain on the sale of operating gas. The write-off during 2014 of the previously capitalized cost associated with the Bluegrass project reduced Loews' net income by $55 million. Excluding these 3 one-time items, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income declined from $85 million in 2013 to $73 million in 2014.
Loews Hotels generated net income of $3 million during Q4 2014 versus a net loss of $5 million last year. For the full year, Loews Hotels posted net income of $11 million, up meaningfully from a $3 million net loss in 2013. This quarter, we are providing additional information about Loews Hotels, which can be found in the company overview document posted on our IR website. 
In particular, I wanted to highlight our disclosure of adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as the sum of the EBITDA from our wholly-owned properties and our pro-rata share of the EBITDA generated by our joint venture properties. Management company results are also included. Excluded are nonrecurring items such as transaction costs. The company overview also includes a table that reconciles Loews Hotels reported pretax income to its adjusted EBITDA for the past 3 years. We would be happy to walk you through it off-line. And to anticipate a question, we will not be disclosing EBITDA on a property-by-property basis.
For full year 2014, Loews Hotels generated adjusted EBITDA of $123 million, up from $66 million in 2013. The main drivers of the increase were the addition of new hotels, the reopening in January 2014 of the Loews Regency and higher profitability at numerous properties, including our joint venture hotels located at the Universal Orlando Resort. 
I would hasten to add that in 2014, several hotels were in the portfolio for only part of the year, including the 1,800-room Cabana Bay Beach Resort, the Loews Minneapolis Hotel and the Loews Chicago O'Hare Hotel. During the 3-year period from 2012 to 2014, Loews Corp.'s net cash contribution to Loews Hotels was $182 million.
In October, we completed the sale of HighMount E&P. The NOL generated by the sale should enable those to realize federal tax benefits of approximately $500 million in 2014 in future periods. 
Turning to the parent company. After-tax investment income during the fourth quarter declined from $54 million to $17 million in 2014, driven by reduced performance from equities and limited partnerships. For the full year, after-tax investment income was down from $93 million in 2013 to $63 million in 2014, as favorable year-over-year results in gold-related equities were offset by a decline in year-over-year results for limited partnerships and other equities.
At year end, cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion as compared to $5.2 billion at the end of September and $4.7 billion at the end of 2013. We received $135 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: $60 million from CNA; $62 million from Diamond; and $13 million from Boardwalk. During all of 2014, we received $782 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $736 million in 2013.
As Jim mentioned, today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend. Loews will receive $485 million upon its payment. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2014, CNA paid a dividend of $1 per share. Separately, Diamond announced today that it's not declaring a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. Loews receives special dividends totaling $210 million from Diamond during 2014.
As for returning capital to shareholders, during the fourth quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $207 million buying back 5 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $61 million during the quarter buying 1.9 million of Diamond stock, taking our ownership to over 52%.
For all of 2014, we spent $622 million repurchasing 14.6 million shares of Loews common stock or nearly 4% of our shares outstanding. Over the past 5 years, we have bought back almost 13% of our shares. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

For Diamond, the offshore drilling industry is in the throws of a challenging cyclical downturn. We've seen this movie before and we are encouraging Diamond to use this downturn to seize opportunities to strengthen and expand its business. The U.S. energy markets are experiencing tremendous changes, which have affected Boardwalk. U.S. natural gas and liquids production is forecast to continue growing meaningfully over the coming years. We expect the accompanying growth in demand for transportation and storage will present attractive opportunities for Boardwalk to expand the utilization of its existing network while also extending the networks reach.
CNA enters 2015 laser-focused on improving its underlying performance. The company's underlying combined ratio continues to decline but there remains room for improvement as CNA works towards the goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter. We will be keeping a close eye on underwriting profitability especially at CNA Commercial. 
And finally, Loews Hotels is welcoming a new CEO and continuing its focus on growth and profitability. As always, we stand ready to help Loews Hotels fund its growth plan.
Overall, there is tremendous change happening across our portfolio of businesses. This coming year will continue to be challenging for some of our subsidiaries, and we're focusing on turning those challenges into opportunities that will benefit our shareholders well into the future. As always, Loews is focused on managing capital to achieve the best long-term return for our shareholders, whether it's through share repurchases, investing in one of our subsidiaries or adding another business to our portfolio. We have found that disciplined capital management coupled with a diverse portfolio of business is an exceptional way to create value over time.

I think day rates can continue to go down for a while. Certainly, oil companies are not anxious about drilling now combined with the fact that there continue to be new rigs that are entering the fleet, rigs that have been ordered 2, 2.5 and 3 years ago. So there is more supply coming on from the market in an environment where oil companies are stepping back. That says to me that day rates can continue to move down. But oil at $40, $50 or, in my opinion, $60 a barrel is not what I would call a steady state price for oil. I think it has to be -- my guess is it has to be somewhere between $70 and $90 per barrel and my guess is that, as they say, in the fullness of time, once we get to, when and if we get to those prices and some stability returns to the oil market, I think that utilization will start to increase. Like I said, I don't know the timing but I certainly believe that it will happen. The other thing that the oil industry overall has going forward is depletion. The world today produces about 95 million barrels a day of oil. And the estimates are that growth in demand is about 1 million barrels per day every year. So that means that next year instead of demand being 95 million barrels, demand will be 96 million barrels a day. But that doesn't mean that the industry has to find an additional 1 million barrels a day. What it means, in fact, is the industry probably has to find 6 million barrels a day. Because in the course of the year, if no exploration is done, productive capacity worldwide will drop from 95 million to 90 million. So the industry needs to find the 5 million just to make up for what was depleted and then 5 million find an additional 1 million barrels of capacity. My sense is that at the price that we have for oil today, we are not replacing all the oil that is depleting. And so my guess is over the next few years, if prices stay down here, we will start to see declines in productive capability."

And the reason for it is because of the extraordinary capital discipline that has been in place for the past 5 or 10 years in the industry. The industry generates lots of excess capital. And what we see from a lot of companies in the industry is that with the combination of share repurchases and dividends, companies are returning their -- the entire amount of capital that they've earned in the past year. And in fact, some companies are returning more than they're earning. So in the old days, we used to have exaggerated cycles in this industry because companies retained so much capital. But now that, that capital is being recycled through share repurchases and dividends, I just don't see the capacity pressure that drives down prices like we've seen in prior cycles. So prices now, we're still getting probably 2% to 4% price increases. That's generally good enough to cover inflation, which as the Federal Government tells us, is about 1.5%. CNA is also busily reunderwriting its commercial book of business. So I'm hopeful that even in this price environment, over time, CNA can continue to bring down its combined ratio as we strive to become a top quartile commercial lines underwriter."

If, for some reason, one or both might need some financing, we would seriously consider it. But those 2 companies, going forward, are going to be our exposure to energy. And in particular, with respect to Boardwalk, it tends not to move on the base -- it's business isn't -- based upon the price of commodity that it's transporting. But unlike Boardwalk, Diamond Offshore, as we all well know, can move dramatically based on the price of oil. So to the extent that the oil market is going to recover, I strongly believe that we will benefit from that through improvement in Diamond's business and hopefully, its stock price."

And we read in the newspapers lots of people who -- lots of people and organizations that are loading their guns, looking to make investments in the energy market. Beyond that, I don't see anything that's as obvious. And I think part of the problem goes back to interest rates. Interest rates are extraordinarily low. With 10-year notes trading below 2% and long bonds trading at 2.5%, there's no doubt in my mind that the -- what the Federal Reserve has done through its quantitative easing is created a squeeze in the long end of the market. There are plenty of investors that need long-dated securities for pension funds and other types of products that they offer. And they just can't get enough of those securities. The Fed owns probably $4 trillion, $3.5 trillion or $4 trillion of long-dated securities. Those are securities that are out of the market. So as a result, there is a squeeze as people clamor for securities that just are not available. So I believe that intermediate to long rates are at manipulated low rates. And the problem with that is that the 10- and 30-year treasury act as benchmarks for all manner of investments in the financial markets and the real estate markets and the capital spending market. So those that are making the decision on either stocks, capital spending or real estate are using a benchmark that, in my opinion, is below its free-market rate. And that is going to cause -- that causes many, many assets to be overpriced compared to where we would think the fair value of those assets is."

Because in fact, I can't tell you right now what is the market day rate for, say, a new fifth or sixth generation drillship. There haven't been any fixtures recently. My guess is it's between $300,000 and $400,000 a day, but it's really difficult to say. What I would say is that in that environment of oil prices that are: Number 1, $30 higher than they are today; and number 2, where the volatility has -- or much of the volatility has left the oil market. In that environment, I could see that day rates would be higher than they are today. These assets cost about $600 million to build. And in order for someone to buy -- to order a new one, they have to get a return on their investment that makes it worthwhile for them to take that risk. So my guess is that for someone to order a new rig, they would need to anticipate that they could earn, say, $100 million -- at least $100 million on that investment. $100 million is about $250,000 to $300,000 a day that has to be earned. You pile on top of that the daily operating costs of approximately $200,000. And what you see is that before anybody is going to go out and order a new rig, they have to be pretty sure that they're going to be able to earn between $450,000 and $500,000 a day on that asset. And my expectation is that we are not going to be seeing significant new construction for a long time until we do get to that place where pricing is at, what I would call, replacement price levels."

So I'm not worried about that. And likewise, when we think about, as I said before, when we think about consumption growing, we have to remember that it's not just 1 million barrels a day of new capacity that you have to add. It's more like 5 million, 6 million or 7 million barrels a day of capacity that you have to add. So the marketplace, once it reaches an equilibrium, will -- the market price for oil will set to a level that makes it such that enough oil can be found in order to supply the world with what's being demanded. And like I said, my guess is that that's somewhere between $75 and $90 a barrel. And my guess is that at that those levels, offshore drilling will be very attractive for oil companies."

I trust that you all had a chance to look at our press release, which was distributed earlier this morning. David Edelson, our CFO, will provide details in our earnings later on in the call. 
I want to start by discussing today's dividend related announcements from Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial, and then touch briefly on each of our subsidiaries and the parent company. The record decline in oil prices have severely impacted offshore drilling contractors, and we expect this negative impact to continue. Diamond's customers, the national and international oil companies, as well as the independent E&P companies have been scaling back their exploration and development budgets in light of the recent price plunge in their own cash flow shortfalls. Combined with the influx of new offshore drilling units that continue to enter the market, the oil price decline has led to a supply/demand imbalance that has driven down day rates, shortened contract terms and idled rigs.
In view of the decidedly negative conditions in the offshore drilling industry, the Diamond Offshore board has decided not to pay a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. As Diamond's majority shareholder, we support the board's decision to retain cash so that if opportunities to purchase rigs at attractive prices present themselves, the company is ready to act. Given the company's existing existing liquidity, it's $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility, it's modest leverage and it's strong credit ratings, we are optimistic that Diamond will be able to capitalize on the current turmoil in the offshore drilling market.
For those of you who tuned into our last call, you'll remember that with respect to Diamond, I said, trouble is opportunity. The trouble is certainly here and Diamond is prepared for the opportunity. 
At CNA, the company's balance sheet has never been stronger, ending the year with statutory capital of over $11 billion and GAAP shareholders' equity of almost $13 billion.
In its most recent writeup on CNA, Standard & Poor's stated that CNA has AAA level capital. As a result of its good earnings and robust capital position, CNA today declared a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA paid a $1 per share special dividend. The Divergent completely independent of paths of CNA's and Diamond's special dividends highlight the benefit to Loews of maintaining a diverse portfolio of subsidiaries.
The performance of Loews' stock during 2014 was negatively affected by the declines in stock prices of Boardwalk and Diamond. We took the opportunity during 2014 to buyback almost 4% of our outstanding shares, spending approximately $620 million in the process. While we're certainly not [indiscernible] in the decline in our share price, we believe that, over the long term, buying our stock at attractive levels will prove to have been the right decision.
Similarly, we believe that our purchase during the fourth quarter of 1.9 million shares of Diamond Offshore common stock will benefit our shareholders over the long term as well.
Loews ended the year with $5 billion in cash and investments, one of our perineal priorities is to maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet which gives us the flexibility to move quickly when opportunity knocks without having to rely on external financing sources. 
Now let's take a look at highlights from our subsidiaries. Then I'll turn the call over to David, who will walk you through our quarterly and annual results in greater detail.
Let's start with Diamond. Loews has been in the offshore drilling business for more than 25 years. In that time, we have learned one thing with absolute certainty: Offshore drilling is a cyclical business and Diamond is managed accordingly. 9 years ago when others were paying top dollar for new drilling rigs, Diamond began returning capital to shareholders by paying special dividends. Since January of '06, Diamond has paid over $41 per share in regular and special dividends, returning more than $5.7 billion to shareholders over that time.
We believe that the current market downturn is yet another cycle playing out in the offshore drilling and that the industry will eventually recover, it's just a matter of time. While no one knows with any certainty when the market will come back, I'm confident that Diamond will withstand this cyclical downturn as it has others. Diamond has the strongest balance sheets in the business, ample liquidity, moderate leverage and a patient majority shareholder that understands the cyclical nature of the offshore drilling industry.
Turning to CNA. CNA had a strong quarter and year. It's underlying combined ratio improved for the year due to a better business mix as the company continued to focus on industry segments where it has deep expertise such as technology, financial services and manufacturing. Additionally, CNA benefited from premium rate increases although such increases slowed somewhat in 2014. For the coming year, CNA will be operating in a market where rate increases are likely to be relatively modest and investment income will be constrained by the interest rate environment. CNA will not stretch for growth, choosing instead to forego growth in return for a more profitable core book of business.
Moving on to Boardwalk. About a year ago, Boardwalk made the difficult decision to reduce its quarterly cash distribution. Fast forward a year and it turned out to be exactly the right decision for the company and for long-term shareholders. Boardwalk has been able to utilize internally generated funds and to take advantage of growth opportunities avoiding dilution. In fact, almost all of its distributable cash flow has gone towards growth projects or distribution payments. New opportunities for growth continued to materialize in 2014 as Boardwalk secured an impressive $1.5 billion in organic projects to be built over the next 3 to 4 years. While these projects come online -- when these projects come online, they are expected to generate double-digit, unlevered return for years to come.
And last but not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels has been focused on building its brand and broadening its customer base by adding properties in gateway cities and resort destinations as well as by renovating existing properties. The financial performance has shown strong improvement, in part as a result of our capital investment over the past several years. We're enhancing our disclosure regarding Loews Hotels this quarter. David will walk you through the company's adjusted EBITDA during his remarks.
We're excited that Kirk [indiscernible] has agreed to lead Loews Hotels for the next phase of its growth. He will join Loews Hotels in March. Kirk has tremendous experience in the hospitality industry, having most recently been President of the Americas for InterContinental Hotels Group, where he had responsibility for 3,700 hotels. Paul [indiscernible] who has served as Loews Hotels' CEO for the past 3 years has done a fantastic job at growing the plan and improving operations. Paul will become Vice Chairman of Loews Hotel once Kirk joins in March. And coincidentally, Mark's first day as CEO will also be the first day that the Loews Chicago Hotel will be open for business. Make your reservations now.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to David."

For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continui",1372,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continuing operations was $962 million or $2.52 per share as compared to $1.1 billion or $2.95 per share in 2013.
Our reduction in parent company investment income drove the quarter-over-quarter decline. For the full year, the main drivers were lower earnings contributions from CNA, Diamond and Boardwalk.
CNA contributed $186 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2014, essentially flat with last year's fourth quarter. One-time items affected the quarterly results in both years, as CNA pension settlement charge reduced Loews Q4 2014 income by $49 million, while a charge related to retroactively insurance accounting for the Loews portfolio transfer transaction reduced our Q4 2013 income by $111 million.
CNA's net investment income in Q4 2014 was down versus the prior year, driven primarily by limited partnership investments. Offsetting positives included higher net favorable prior year development, together with improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses. In Q4 2014, CNA posted slight realized investment losses versus modest gains in the prior year quarter. 
For full year 2014, CNA contributed $770 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized gains, down from $817 million in 2013. Reduced net investment income and lower net favorable prior year development drove the year-over-year decline. Partially offsetting these declines were improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophes. One-time items also affected the 2 years. 
In 2014, a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of CNA's annuity and pension deposit business reduced CNA's earnings distribution to Loews by $31 million. And in 2013, as just mentioned, the charge related to the loss portfolio transfer, reduced our income by $111 million. CNA posted a higher level of realized investment gains in 2014 than in 2013.
Diamond Offshore contributed $47 million to Loews' income from continuing operations during Q4 2014, up from $44 million last year. Diamond's pretax income was actually down versus prior year. A slight increase in the EBITDA was more than offset by higher depreciation and interest expense. Further, in last year's fourth quarter, Diamond's net income was impacted by a high effective tax rate, driven by a provision for an uncertain tax position. This reduced Diamond's after-tax contribution to Loews last year by $27 million.
For full year 2014, Diamond contributed $183 million to Loews' net income, down from $257 million in 2013. The company's third quarter 2014 rig impairment charge drove the decline, together with lower rig operating income, higher depreciation and interest expense and higher G&A expenses. Partially offsetting the decline in pretax income was a 4-point reduction in the company's tax rate caused by various factors, including the Q4 2013 tax provision previously mentioned and in the third quarter of 2014, the benefit to Diamond from settling uncertain tax positions related to several foreign jurisdictions.
Diamond took delivery of 3 drillships and 2 semisubmersibles in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the company expects to take delivery of the Ocean BlackLion, it's fourth new drillship, and the Ocean GreatWhite, it's newbuild, harsh environment semisubmersible. Both of these units are already contracted.
Between its balance sheet liquidity and it's $1.5 billion bank revolver, Diamond has ample liquidity for its current capital projects. Additionally, haulting this special dividend will enable Diamond to retain, on an annualized basis, over $400 million of cash to bolster its available liquidity.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $11 million to Loews' net income during Q4 2014, up from $4 million last year. After adjusting for a goodwill impairment charge in last year's fourth quarter, however, Boardwalk's contribution declined from $20 million last year to this year's $11 million. Boardwalk's fourth quarter 2014 results were negatively impacted contributed by lower storage and parking loan revenue as well as by higher operating expenses.
For full year 2014, Boardwalk contributed $18 million to Loews' net income versus $78 million for 2013. The major one-time items impacting this year-over-year comparison in 2013 were the just mentioned goodwill impairment charge and a partially offsetting gain on the sale of operating gas. The write-off during 2014 of the previously capitalized cost associated with the Bluegrass project reduced Loews' net income by $55 million. Excluding these 3 one-time items, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income declined from $85 million in 2013 to $73 million in 2014.
Loews Hotels generated net income of $3 million during Q4 2014 versus a net loss of $5 million last year. For the full year, Loews Hotels posted net income of $11 million, up meaningfully from a $3 million net loss in 2013. This quarter, we are providing additional information about Loews Hotels, which can be found in the company overview document posted on our IR website. 
In particular, I wanted to highlight our disclosure of adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as the sum of the EBITDA from our wholly-owned properties and our pro-rata share of the EBITDA generated by our joint venture properties. Management company results are also included. Excluded are nonrecurring items such as transaction costs. The company overview also includes a table that reconciles Loews Hotels reported pretax income to its adjusted EBITDA for the past 3 years. We would be happy to walk you through it off-line. And to anticipate a question, we will not be disclosing EBITDA on a property-by-property basis.
For full year 2014, Loews Hotels generated adjusted EBITDA of $123 million, up from $66 million in 2013. The main drivers of the increase were the addition of new hotels, the reopening in January 2014 of the Loews Regency and higher profitability at numerous properties, including our joint venture hotels located at the Universal Orlando Resort. 
I would hasten to add that in 2014, several hotels were in the portfolio for only part of the year, including the 1,800-room Cabana Bay Beach Resort, the Loews Minneapolis Hotel and the Loews Chicago O'Hare Hotel. During the 3-year period from 2012 to 2014, Loews Corp.'s net cash contribution to Loews Hotels was $182 million.
In October, we completed the sale of HighMount E&P. The NOL generated by the sale should enable those to realize federal tax benefits of approximately $500 million in 2014 in future periods. 
Turning to the parent company. After-tax investment income during the fourth quarter declined from $54 million to $17 million in 2014, driven by reduced performance from equities and limited partnerships. For the full year, after-tax investment income was down from $93 million in 2013 to $63 million in 2014, as favorable year-over-year results in gold-related equities were offset by a decline in year-over-year results for limited partnerships and other equities.
At year end, cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion as compared to $5.2 billion at the end of September and $4.7 billion at the end of 2013. We received $135 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: $60 million from CNA; $62 million from Diamond; and $13 million from Boardwalk. During all of 2014, we received $782 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $736 million in 2013.
As Jim mentioned, today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend. Loews will receive $485 million upon its payment. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2014, CNA paid a dividend of $1 per share. Separately, Diamond announced today that it's not declaring a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. Loews receives special dividends totaling $210 million from Diamond during 2014.
As for returning capital to shareholders, during the fourth quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $207 million buying back 5 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $61 million during the quarter buying 1.9 million of Diamond stock, taking our ownership to over 52%.
For all of 2014, we spent $622 million repurchasing 14.6 million shares of Loews common stock or nearly 4% of our shares outstanding. Over the past 5 years, we have bought back almost 13% of our shares. 
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

For Diamond, the offshore drilling industry is in the throws of a challenging cyclical downturn. We've seen this movie before and we are encouraging Diamond to use this downturn to seize opportunities to strengthen and expand its business. The U.S. energy markets are experiencing tremendous changes, which have affected Boardwalk. U.S. natural gas and liquids production is forecast to continue growing meaningfully over the coming years. We expect the accompanying growth in demand for transportation and storage will present attractive opportunities for Boardwalk to expand the utilization of its existing network while also extending the networks reach.
CNA enters 2015 laser-focused on improving its underlying performance. The company's underlying combined ratio continues to decline but there remains room for improvement as CNA works towards the goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter. We will be keeping a close eye on underwriting profitability especially at CNA Commercial. 
And finally, Loews Hotels is welcoming a new CEO and continuing its focus on growth and profitability. As always, we stand ready to help Loews Hotels fund its growth plan.
Overall, there is tremendous change happening across our portfolio of businesses. This coming year will continue to be challenging for some of our subsidiaries, and we're focusing on turning those challenges into opportunities that will benefit our shareholders well into the future. As always, Loews is focused on managing capital to achieve the best long-term return for our shareholders, whether it's through share repurchases, investing in one of our subsidiaries or adding another business to our portfolio. We have found that disciplined capital management coupled with a diverse portfolio of business is an exceptional way to create value over time.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mary."

I think day rates can continue to go down for a while. Certainly, oil companies are not anxious about drilling now combined with the fact that there continue to be new rigs that are entering the fleet, rigs that have been ordered 2, 2.5 and 3 years ago. So there is more supply coming on from the market in an environment where oil companies are stepping back. That says to me that day rates can continue to move down. But oil at $40, $50 or, in my opinion, $60 a barrel is not what I would call a steady state price for oil. I think it has to be -- my guess is it has to be somewhere between $70 and $90 per barrel and my guess is that, as they say, in the fullness of time, once we get to, when and if we get to those prices and some stability returns to the oil market, I think that utilization will start to increase. Like I said, I don't know the timing but I certainly believe that it will happen. The other thing that the oil industry overall has going forward is depletion. The world today produces about 95 million barrels a day of oil. And the estimates are that growth in demand is about 1 million barrels per day every year. So that means that next year instead of demand being 95 million barrels, demand will be 96 million barrels a day. But that doesn't mean that the industry has to find an additional 1 million barrels a day. What it means, in fact, is the industry probably has to find 6 million barrels a day. Because in the course of the year, if no exploration is done, productive capacity worldwide will drop from 95 million to 90 million. So the industry needs to find the 5 million just to make up for what was depleted and then 5 million find an additional 1 million barrels of capacity. My sense is that at the price that we have for oil today, we are not replacing all the oil that is depleting. And so my guess is over the next few years, if prices stay down here, we will start to see declines in productive capability."

And the reason for it is because of the extraordinary capital discipline that has been in place for the past 5 or 10 years in the industry. The industry generates lots of excess capital. And what we see from a lot of companies in the industry is that with the combination of share repurchases and dividends, companies are returning their -- the entire amount of capital that they've earned in the past year. And in fact, some companies are returning more than they're earning. So in the old days, we used to have exaggerated cycles in this industry because companies retained so much capital. But now that, that capital is being recycled through share repurchases and dividends, I just don't see the capacity pressure that drives down prices like we've seen in prior cycles. So prices now, we're still getting probably 2% to 4% price increases. That's generally good enough to cover inflation, which as the Federal Government tells us, is about 1.5%. CNA is also busily reunderwriting its commercial book of business. So I'm hopeful that even in this price environment, over time, CNA can continue to bring down its combined ratio as we strive to become a top quartile commercial lines underwriter."

And we read in the newspapers lots of people who -- lots of people and organizations that are loading their guns, looking to make investments in the energy market. Beyond that, I don't see anything that's as obvious. And I think part of the problem goes back to interest rates. Interest rates are extraordinarily low. With 10-year notes trading below 2% and long bonds trading at 2.5%, there's no doubt in my mind that the -- what the Federal Reserve has done through its quantitative easing is created a squeeze in the long end of the market. There are plenty of investors that need long-dated securities for pension funds and other types of products that they offer. And they just can't get enough of those securities. The Fed owns probably $4 trillion, $3.5 trillion or $4 trillion of long-dated securities. Those are securities that are out of the market. So as a result, there is a squeeze as people clamor for securities that just are not available. So I believe that intermediate to long rates are at manipulated low rates. And the problem with that is that the 10- and 30-year treasury act as benchmarks for all manner of investments in the financial markets and the real estate markets and the capital spending market. So those that are making the decision on either stocks, capital spending or real estate are using a benchmark that, in my opinion, is below its free-market rate. And that is going to cause -- that causes many, many assets to be overpriced compared to where we would think the fair value of those assets is."

Because in fact, I can't tell you right now what is the market day rate for, say, a new fifth or sixth generation drillship. There haven't been any fixtures recently. My guess is it's between $300,000 and $400,000 a day, but it's really difficult to say. What I would say is that in that environment of oil prices that are: Number 1, $30 higher than they are today; and number 2, where the volatility has -- or much of the volatility has left the oil market. In that environment, I could see that day rates would be higher than they are today. These assets cost about $600 million to build. And in order for someone to buy -- to order a new one, they have to get a return on their investment that makes it worthwhile for them to take that risk. So my guess is that for someone to order a new rig, they would need to anticipate that they could earn, say, $100 million -- at least $100 million on that investment. $100 million is about $250,000 to $300,000 a day that has to be earned. You pile on top of that the daily operating costs of approximately $200,000. And what you see is that before anybody is going to go out and order a new rig, they have to be pretty sure that they're going to be able to earn between $450,000 and $500,000 a day on that asset. And my expectation is that we are not going to be seeing significant new construction for a long time until we do get to that place where pricing is at, what I would call, replacement price levels."

So I'm not worried about that. And likewise, when we think about, as I said before, when we think about consumption growing, we have to remember that it's not just 1 million barrels a day of new capacity that you have to add. It's more like 5 million, 6 million or 7 million barrels a day of capacity that you have to add. So the marketplace, once it reaches an equilibrium, will -- the market price for oil will set to a level that makes it such that enough oil can be found in order to supply the world with what's being demanded. And like I said, my guess is that that's somewhere between $75 and $90 a barrel. And my guess is that at that those levels, offshore drilling will be very attractive for oil companies."

I trust that you all had a chance to look at our press release, which was distributed earlier this morning. David Edelson, our CFO, will provide details on our earnings later on in the call.
I want to start by discussing today's dividend-related announcements from Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial, and then touch briefly on each of our subsidiaries and the parent company. The rapid decline in oil prices have severely impacted offshore drilling contractors, and we expect this negative impact to continue. Diamond's customers, the national and international oil companies as well as the independent E&P companies, have been scaling back their exploration and development budgets in light of the recent price plunge and their own cash flow shortfalls. Combined with the influx of new offshore drilling units that continue to enter the market, the oil price decline has led to a supply-demand imbalance that has driven down day rates, shortened contract terms and idled rigs.
In view of the decidedly negative conditions in the offshore drilling industry, the Diamond Offshore board has decided not to pay a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. As Diamond's majority shareholder, we support the board's decision to retain cash. So that if opportunities to purchase rigs at attractive prices present themselves, the company is ready to act. Given the company's existing liquidity, its $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility, its modest leverage and its strong credit ratings, we are optimistic that Diamond will be able to capitalize on the current turmoil in the offshore drilling market.
For those of you who tuned into our call -- our last call, you'll remember that with respect to Diamond, I said, trouble is opportunity. The trouble is certainly here, and Diamond is prepared for the opportunity.
At CNA, the company's balance sheet has never been stronger, ending the year with statutory capital of over $11 billion and GAAP shareholders' equity of almost $13 billion.
In its most recent writeup on CNA, Standard & Poor's stated that CNA has AAA level capital. As a result of its good earnings and robust capital position, CNA today declared a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA paid a $1 per share special dividend. The divergent completely independent paths of CNA's and Diamond's special dividends highlight the benefit to Loews of maintaining a diverse portfolio of subsidiaries.
The performance of Loews' stock during 2014 was negatively affected by the declines in the stock prices of Boardwalk and Diamond. We took the opportunity during 2014 to buy back almost 4% of our outstanding shares, spending approximately $620 million in the process. While we're certainly not thrilled with the decline in our share price, we believe that, over the long term, buying our stock at attractive levels will prove to have been the right decision.
Similarly, we believe that our purchase during the fourth quarter of 1.9 million shares of Diamond Offshore common stock will benefit our shareholders over the long term as well.
Loews ended the year with $5 billion in cash and investments, one of our perennial priorities is to maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet, which gives us the flexibility to move quickly when opportunity knocks, without having to rely on external financing sources.
Now let's take a look at highlights from our subsidiaries. Then I'll turn the call over to David, who will walk you through our quarterly and annual results in greater detail.
Let's start with Diamond. Loews has been in the offshore drilling business for more than 25 years. In that time, we have learned one thing with absolute certainty: offshore drilling is a cyclical business, and Diamond is managed accordingly. 9 years ago when others were paying top dollar for new drilling rigs, Diamond began returning capital to shareholders by paying special dividends. Since January of '06, Diamond has paid over $41 per share in regular and special dividends, returning more than $5.7 billion to shareholders over that time.
We believe that the current market downturn is yet another cycle playing out in offshore drilling and that the industry will eventually recover. It's just a matter of time. While no one knows with any certainty when the market will come back, I'm confident that Diamond will withstand this cyclical downturn as it has others. Diamond has the strongest balance sheet in the business, ample liquidity, moderate leverage and a patient majority shareholder that understands the cyclical nature of the offshore drilling industry.
Turning to CNA. CNA had a strong quarter and year. Its underlying combined ratio improved for the year due to a better business mix as the company continued to focus on industry segments where it has deep expertise, such as technology, financial services and manufacturing. Additionally, CNA benefited from premium rate increases, although such increases slowed somewhat in 2014. For the coming year, CNA will be operating in a market where rate increases are likely to be relatively modest and investment income will be constrained by the interest rate environment. CNA will not stretch for growth, choosing instead to forego growth in return for a more profitable core book of business.
Moving on to Boardwalk. About a year ago, Boardwalk made the difficult decision to reduce its quarterly cash distribution. Fast forward a year and it turned out to be exactly the right decision for the company and for long-term shareholders. Boardwalk has been able to utilize internally generated funds and to take advantage of growth opportunities, avoiding dilution. In fact, almost all of its distributable cash flow has gone towards growth projects or distribution payments. New opportunities for growth continued to materialize in 2014, as Boardwalk secured an impressive $1.5 billion in organic projects to be built over the next 3 to 4 years. While these projects -- when these projects come online, they are expected to generate double-digit, unlevered return for years to come.
And last but not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels has been focused on building its brand and broadening its customer base by adding properties in gateway cities and resort destinations as well as by renovating existing properties. The financial performance is showing strong improvement, in part as a result of our capital investment over the past several years. We are enhancing our disclosure regarding Loews Hotels this quarter. David will walk you through the company's adjusted EBITDA during his remarks.
We're excited that Kirk Kinsell has agreed to lead Loews Hotels for the next phase of its growth. He will join Loews Hotels in March. Kirk has tremendous experience in the hospitality industry, having most recently been President of the Americas for InterContinental Hotels Group, where he had responsibility for 3,700 hotels.
Paul Whetsell, who has served as Loews Hotels' CEO for the past 3 years, has done a fantastic job at growing the brand and improving operations. Paul will become Vice Chairman of Loews Hotel once Kirk joins in March.
And coincidentally, Mark's (sic) [Kirk] first day as CEO will also be the first day that the Loews Chicago Hotel will be open for business. Make your reservations now.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to David."

For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continui",1381,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continuing operations was $962 million or $2.52 per share as compared to $1.1 billion or $2.95 per share in 2013.
Our reduction in parent company investment income drove the quarter-over-quarter decline. For the full year, the main drivers were lower earnings contributions from CNA, Diamond and Boardwalk.
CNA contributed $186 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2014, essentially flat with last year's fourth quarter. Onetime items affected the quarterly results in both years, as CNA pension settlement charge reduced Loews' Q4 2014 income by $49 million, while a charge related to retroactive insurance accounting for the Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction reduced our Q4 2013 income by $111 million.
CNA's net investment income in Q4 2014 was down versus the prior year, driven primarily by limited partnership investments. Offsetting positives included higher net favorable prior year development, together with improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses. In Q4 2014, CNA posted slight realized investment losses versus modest gains in the prior year quarter.
For full year 2014, CNA contributed $770 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized gains, down from $817 million in 2013. Reduced net investment income and lower net favorable prior year development drove the year-over-year decline. Partially offsetting these declines were improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophes. Onetime items also affected the 2 years.
In 2014, a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of CNA's annuity and pension deposit business reduced CNA's earnings contribution to Loews by $31 million. And in 2013, as just mentioned, the charge related to the Loss Portfolio Transfer, reduced our income by $111 million. CNA posted a higher level of realized investment gains in 2014 than in 2013.
Diamond Offshore contributed $47 million to Loews' income from continuing operations during Q4 2014, up from $44 million last year. Diamond's pretax income was actually down versus prior year. A slight increase in EBITDA was more than offset by higher depreciation and interest expense. Further, in last year's fourth quarter, Diamond's net income was impacted by a high effective tax rate, driven by a provision for an uncertain tax position. This reduced Diamond's after tax contribution to Loews last year by $27 million.
For full year 2014, Diamond contributed $183 million to Loews' net income, down from $257 million in 2013. The company's third quarter 2014 rig impairment charge drove the decline, together with lower rig operating income, higher depreciation and interest expense and higher G&A expenses. Partially offsetting the decline in pretax income was a 4 point reduction in the company's tax rate caused by various factors, including a Q4 2013 tax provision previously mentioned; and in the third quarter of 2014, the benefit to Diamond from settling uncertain tax positions related to several foreign jurisdictions.
Diamond took delivery of 3 drillships and 2 semisubmersibles in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the company expects to take delivery of the Ocean BlackLion, its fourth new drillship; and the Ocean GreatWhite, its new-build, harsh environment semisubmersible. Both of these units are already contracted.
Between its balance sheet liquidity and its $1.5 billion bank revolver, Diamond has ample liquidity for its current capital projects. Additionally, halting the special dividend will enable Diamond to retain, on an annualized basis, over $400 million of cash to bolster its available liquidity.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $11 million to Loews' net income during Q4 2014, up from $4 million last year. After adjusting for a goodwill impairment charge in last year's fourth quarter, however, Boardwalk's contribution declined from $20 million last year to this year's $11 million. Boardwalk's fourth quarter 2014 results were negatively impacted by lower storage and park and loan revenue as well as by higher operating expenses.
For full year 2014, Boardwalk contributed $18 million to Loews' net income versus $78 million for 2013. The major onetime items impacting this year-over-year comparison in 2013 were the just mentioned goodwill impairment charge and a partially offsetting gain on the sale of operating gas. The write-off during 2014 of the previously capitalized costs associated with the Bluegrass project reduced Loews' net income by $55 million. Excluding these 3 onetime items, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income declined from $85 million in 2013 to $73 million in 2014.
Loews Hotels generated net income of $3 million during Q4 2014 versus a net loss of $5 million last year. For the full year, Loews Hotels posted net income of $11 million, up meaningfully from a $3 million net loss in 2013. This quarter, we are providing additional information about Loews Hotels, which can be found in the company overview document posted on our IR website.
In particular, I wanted to highlight our disclosure of adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as the sum of the EBITDA from our wholly owned properties and our pro rata share of the EBITDA generated by our joint venture properties. Management company results are also included. Excluded are nonrecurring items such as transaction costs. The company overview also includes a table that reconciles Loews Hotels reported pretax income to its adjusted EBITDA for the past 3 years. We would be happy to walk you through it offline. And to anticipate a question, we will not be disclosing EBITDA on a property-by-property basis.
For full year 2014, Loews Hotels generated adjusted EBITDA of $123 million, up from $66 million in 2013. The main drivers of the increase were the addition of new hotels, the reopening in January 2014 of the Loews Regency and higher profitability at numerous properties, including our joint venture hotels located at the Universal Orlando Resort.
I would hasten to add that in 2014, several hotels were in the portfolio for only part of the year, including the 1,800-room Cabana Bay Beach Resort, the Loews Minneapolis Hotel and the Loews Chicago O'Hare Hotel. During the 3-year period from 2012 to 2014, Loews Corp.'s net cash contribution to Loews Hotels was $182 million.
In October, we completed the sale of HighMount E&P. The NOL generated by the sale should enable Loews to realize federal tax benefit of approximately $500 million in 2014 in future periods. 
Turning to the parent company. After tax investment income during the fourth quarter declined from $54 million to $17 million in 2014, driven by reduced performance from equities and limited partnerships. For the full year, after tax investment income was down from $93 million in 2013 to $63 million in 2014, as favorable year-over-year results in gold-related equities were offset by a decline in year-over-year results for limited partnerships and other equities.
At year end, cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion as compared to $5.2 billion at the end of September and $4.7 billion at the end of 2013. We received $135 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: $60 million from CNA, $62 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. During all of 2014, we received $782 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $736 million in 2013.
As Jim mentioned, today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend. Loews will receive $485 million upon its payment. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2014, CNA paid a special dividend of $1 per share. Separately, Diamond announced today that it is not declaring a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. Loews received special dividends totaling $210 million from Diamond during 2014.
As for returning capital to our shareholders, during the fourth quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $207 million buying back 5 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $61 million during the quarter buying 1.9 million shares of Diamond stock, taking our ownership to over 52%.
For all of 2014, we spent $622 million repurchasing 14.6 million shares of Loews common stock or nearly 4% of our shares outstanding. Over the past 5 years, we have bought back almost 13% of our shares.
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

For Diamond, the offshore drilling industry is in the throes of a challenging cyclical downturn. We've seen this movie before, and we are encouraging Diamond to use this downturn to seize opportunities to strengthen and expand its business. The U.S. energy markets are experiencing tremendous changes, which have affected Boardwalk. U.S. natural gas and liquids production is forecast to continue growing meaningfully over the coming years. We expect the accompanying growth and demand for transportation and storage will present attractive opportunities for Boardwalk to expand the utilization of its existing network while also extending the network's reach.
CNA enters 2015 laser-focused on improving its underwriting performance. The company's underlying combined ratio continues to decline, but there remains room for improvement as CNA works towards the goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter. We will be keeping a close eye on underwriting profitability especially at CNA Commercial. 
And finally, Loews Hotels is welcoming a new CEO and continuing its focus on growth and profitability. As always, we stand ready to help Loews Hotels fund its growth plan.
Overall, there is tremendous change happening across our portfolio of businesses. This coming year will continue to be challenging for some of our subsidiaries, and we are focusing on turning those challenges into opportunities that will benefit our shareholders well into the future. As always, Loews is focused on managing capital to achieve the best long-term return for our shareholders, whether it's through share repurchases, investing in one of our subsidiaries or adding another business to our portfolio. We have found that disciplined capital management, coupled with a diverse portfolio of businesses, is an exceptional way to create value over time.

Like I said, I think the industry is still declining. I think day rates can continue to go down for a while. Certainly, oil companies are not anxious about drilling now, combined with the fact that there continue to be new rigs that are entering the fleet, rigs that have been ordered 2, 2.5 and 3 years ago. So there is more supply coming on to the market in an environment where oil companies are stepping back. That says to me that day rates can continue to move down. But oil at $40, $50 or, in my opinion, $60 a barrel is not what I would call a steady-state price for oil. I think it has to be -- my guess is it has to be somewhere between $70 and $90 per barrel. And my guess is that, as they say, in the fullness of time, once we get to -- when and if we get to those prices and some stability returns to the oil market, I think that utilization will start to increase. Like I said, I don't know the timing, but I certainly believe that it will happen. The other thing that the oil industry overall has going forward is depletion. The world today produces about 95 million barrels a day of oil. And the estimates are that growth in demand is about 1 million barrels per day every year. So that means that next year instead of demand being 95 million barrels, demand will be 96 million barrels a day. But that doesn't mean that the industry has to find an additional 1 million barrels a day. What it means, in fact, is the industry probably has to find 6 million barrels a day. Because in the course of the year, if no exploration is done, productive capacity worldwide will drop from 95 million to 90 million. So the industry needs to find the 5 million just to make up for what was depleted and then find an additional 1 million barrels of capacity. My sense is that at the price that we have for oil today, we are not replacing all the oil that is depleting. And so my guess is over the next few years, if prices stay down here, we will start to see declines in productive capability."

And the reason for it is because of the extraordinary capital discipline that has been in place for the past 5 or 10 years in the industry. The industry generates lots of excess capital. And what we see from a lot of companies in the industry is that with the combination of share repurchases and dividends, companies are returning their -- the entire amount of capital that they've earned in the past year. And in fact, some companies are returning more than they're earning. So in the old days, we used to have exaggerated cycles in this industry because companies retained so much capital. But now that, that capital is being recycled through share repurchases and dividends, I just don't see the capacity pressure that drives down prices like we've seen in prior cycles. So prices now, we're still getting probably 2% to 4% price increases. That's generally good enough to cover inflation, which the federal government tells us, is about 1.5%. CNA is also busily re-underwriting its commercial book of business. So I'm hopeful that even in this price environment, over time, CNA can continue to bring down its combined ratio as we strive to become a top quartile commercial lines underwriter."

And we read in the newspapers lots of people who -- lots of people and organizations that are loading their gun, looking to make investments in the energy market. Beyond that, I don't see anything that's as obvious. And I think part of the problem goes back to interest rates. Interest rates are extraordinarily low. With 10-year notes trading below 2% and long bonds trading at 2.5%, there's no doubt in my mind that the -- what the Federal Reserve has done through its quantitative easing is created a squeeze in the long end of the market. There are plenty of investors that need long-dated securities for pension funds and other types of products that they offer. And they just can't get enough of those securities. The Fed owns probably $4 trillion, $3.5 trillion or $4 trillion of long-dated securities. Those are securities that are out of the market. So as a result, there is a squeeze as people clamor for securities that just are not available. So I believe that intermediate to long rates are at manipulated low rates. And the problem with that is that the 10- and 30-year treasury act as benchmarks for all manner of investments in the financial markets and the real estate markets and the capital spending market. So those that are making the decision on either stocks, capital spending or real estate are using a benchmark that, in my opinion, is below its free-market rate. And that's going to cause -- that causes many, many assets to be overpriced compared to where we would think the fair market value of those assets is."

Because in fact, I can't tell you right now what is the market day rate for, say, a new fifth- or sixth-generation drillship. There haven't been any fixtures recently. My guess is it's between $300,000 and $400,000 a day, but it's really difficult to say. What I would say is that in an environment of oil prices that are, number one, $30 higher than they are today; and number two, where the volatility has -- or much of the volatility has left the oil market, in that environment, I could see that day rates would be higher than they are today. These assets cost about $600 million to build. And in order for someone to buy -- to order a new one, they have to get a return on their investment that makes it worthwhile for them to take that risk. So my guess is that for someone to order a new rig, they would need to anticipate that they could earn, say, $100 million -- at least $100 million on that investment. $100 million is about $250,000 to $300,000 a day that has to be earned. You pile on top of that the daily operating costs of approximately $200,000. And what you see is that before anybody is going to go out and order a new rig, they have to be pretty sure that they're going to be able to earn between $450,000 and $500,000 a day on that asset. And my expectation is that we are not going to be seeing significant new construction for a long time until we do get to that place where pricing is at, what I would call, replacement price levels."

So I'm not worried about that. And likewise, when we think about -- as I said before, when we think about consumption growing, we have to remember that it's not just 1 million barrels a day of new capacity that you have to add. It's more like 5 million, 6 million or 7 million barrels a day of new capacity that you have to add. So the marketplace, once it reaches an equilibrium, will -- the market price for oil will set to a level that makes it such that enough oil can be found in order to supply the world with what's being demanded. And like I said, my guess is that, that's somewhere between $75 and $90 a barrel. And my guess is that at those levels, offshore drilling will be very attractive for oil companies."

I trust that you all had a chance to look at our press release, which was distributed earlier this morning. David Edelson, our CFO, will provide details on our earnings later on in the call.
I want to start by discussing today's dividend-related announcements from Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial, and then touch briefly on each of our subsidiaries and the parent company. The rapid decline in oil prices has severely impacted offshore drilling contractors, and we expect this negative impact to continue. Diamond's customers, the national and international oil companies as well as the independent E&P companies, have been scaling back their exploration and development budgets in light of the recent price plunge and their own cash flow shortfalls. Combined with the influx of new offshore drilling units that continue to enter the market, the oil price decline has led to a supply-demand imbalance that has driven down day rates, shortened contract terms and idled rigs.
In view of the decidedly negative conditions in the offshore drilling industry, the Diamond Offshore board has decided not to pay a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. As Diamond's majority shareholder, we support the board's decision to retain cash so that if opportunities to purchase rigs at attractive prices present themselves, the company is ready to act. Given the company's existing liquidity, its $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility, its modest leverage and its strong credit ratings, we are optimistic that Diamond will be able to capitalize on the current turmoil in the offshore drilling market.
For those of you who tuned into our call -- our last call, you'll remember that with respect to Diamond, I said, ""Trouble is opportunity."" The trouble is certainly here, and Diamond is prepared for the opportunity.
At CNA, the company's balance sheet has never been stronger, ending the year with statutory capital of over $11 billion and GAAP shareholders' equity of almost $13 billion.
In its most recent writeup on CNA, Standard & Poor's stated that CNA has AAA level capital. As a result of its good earnings and robust capital position, CNA today declared a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA paid a $1 per share special dividend. The divergent, completely independent paths of CNA's and Diamond's special dividends highlight the benefit to Loews of maintaining a diverse portfolio of subsidiaries.
The performance of Loews' stock during 2014 was negatively affected by the declines in the stock prices of Boardwalk and Diamond. We took the opportunity during 2014 to buy back almost 4% of our outstanding shares, spending approximately $620 million in the process. While we're certainly not thrilled with the decline in our share price, we believe that, over the long term, buying our stock at attractive levels will prove to have been the right decision.
Similarly, we believe that our purchase during the fourth quarter of 1.9 million shares of Diamond Offshore common stock will benefit our shareholders over the long term as well.
Loews ended the year with $5 billion in cash and investments. One of our perennial priorities is to maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet, which gives us the flexibility to move quickly when opportunity knocks without having to rely on external financing sources.
Now let's take a look at highlights from our subsidiaries. Then, I'll turn the call over to David, who will walk you through our quarterly and annual results in greater detail.
Let's start with Diamond. Loews has been in the offshore drilling business for more than 25 years. In that time, we have learned one thing with absolute certainty: offshore drilling is a cyclical business, and Diamond is managed accordingly. 9 years ago when others were paying top dollar for new drilling rigs, Diamond began returning capital to shareholders by paying special dividends. Since January of '06, Diamond has paid over $41 per share in regular and special dividends, returning more than $5.7 billion to shareholders over that time.
We believe that the current market downturn is yet another cycle playing out in offshore drilling and that the industry will eventually recover. It's just a matter of time. While no one knows with any certainty when the market will come back, I'm confident that Diamond will withstand this cyclical downturn as it has others. Diamond has the strongest balance sheet in the business, ample liquidity, moderate leverage and a patient majority shareholder that understands the cyclical nature of the offshore drilling industry.
Turning to CNA. CNA had a strong quarter and year. Its underlying combined ratio improved for the year due to a better business mix as the company continued to focus on industry segments where it has deep expertise, such as technology, financial services and manufacturing. Additionally, CNA benefited from premium rate increases, although such increases slowed somewhat in 2014. For the coming year, CNA will be operating in a market where rate increases are likely to be relatively modest and investment income will be constrained by the interest rate environment. CNA will not stretch for growth, choosing instead to forego growth in return for a more profitable core book of business.
Moving on to Boardwalk. About a year ago, Boardwalk made the difficult decision to reduce its quarterly cash distribution. Fast forward a year and it turned out to be exactly the right decision for the company and for long-term shareholders. Boardwalk has been able to utilize internally generated funds and to take advantage of growth opportunities, avoiding dilution. In fact, almost all of its distributable cash flow has gone towards growth projects or distribution payments. New opportunities for growth continued to materialize in 2014, as Boardwalk secured an impressive $1.5 billion in organic projects to be built over the next 3 to 4 years. While these projects -- when these projects come online, they are expected to generate double-digit, unlevered return for years to come.
And last but not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels has been focused on building its brand and broadening its customer base by adding properties in gateway cities and resort destinations as well as by renovating existing properties. The financial performance is showing strong improvement, in part as a result of our capital investment over the past several years. We are enhancing our disclosure regarding Loews Hotels this quarter. David will walk you through the company's adjusted EBITDA during his remarks.
We're excited that Kirk Kinsell has agreed to lead Loews Hotels for the next phase of its growth. He will join Loews Hotels in March. Kirk has tremendous experience in the hospitality industry, having most recently been President of the Americas for InterContinental Hotels Group, where he had responsibility for 3,700 hotels.
Paul Whetsell, who has served as Loews Hotels' CEO for the past 3 years, has done a fantastic job at growing the brand and improving operations. Paul will become Vice Chairman of Loews Hotels once Kirk joins in March.
And coincidentally, Mark's (sic) [Kirk] first day as CEO will also be the first day that the Loews Chicago Hotel will be open for business. Make your reservations now.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to David."

For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continui",1377,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continuing operations was $962 million or $2.52 per share as compared to $1.1 billion or $2.95 per share in 2013.
Our reduction in parent company investment income drove the quarter-over-quarter decline. For the full year, the main drivers were lower earnings contributions from CNA, Diamond and Boardwalk.
CNA contributed $186 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2014, essentially flat with last year's fourth quarter. Onetime items affected the quarterly results in both years. A CNA pension settlement charge reduced Loews' Q4 2014 income by $49 million, while a charge related to retroactive reinsurance accounting for the Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction reduced our Q4 2013 income by $111 million.
CNA's net investment income in Q4 2014 was down versus the prior year, driven primarily by limited partnership investments. Offsetting positives included higher net favorable prior year development, together with improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses. In Q4 2014, CNA posted slight realized investment losses versus modest gains in the prior year quarter.
For full year 2014, CNA contributed $770 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized gains, down from $817 million in 2013. Reduced net investment income and lower net favorable prior year development drove the year-over-year decline. Partially offsetting these declines were improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophes. Onetime items also affected the 2 years.
In 2014, a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of CNA's annuity and pension deposit business reduced CNA's earnings contribution to Loews by $31 million. And in 2013, as just mentioned, the charge related to the Loss Portfolio Transfer, reduced our income by $111 million. CNA posted a higher level of realized investment gains in 2014 than in 2013.
Diamond Offshore contributed $47 million to Loews' income from continuing operations during Q4 2014, up from $44 million last year. Diamond's pretax income was actually down versus prior year. A slight increase in EBITDA was more than offset by higher depreciation and interest expense. Further, in last year's fourth quarter, Diamond's net income was impacted by a high effective tax rate, driven by a provision for an uncertain tax position. This reduced Diamond's after-tax contribution to Loews last year by $27 million.
For full year 2014, Diamond contributed $183 million to Loews' net income, down from $257 million in 2013. The company's third quarter 2014 rig impairment charge drove the decline, together with lower rig operating income, higher depreciation and interest expense and higher G&A expenses. Partially offsetting the decline in pretax income was a 4-point reduction in the company's tax rate caused by various factors, including the Q4 2013 tax provision previously mentioned; and in the third quarter of 2014, the benefit to Diamond from settling uncertain tax positions related to several foreign jurisdictions.
Diamond took delivery of 3 drillships and 2 semisubmersibles in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the company expects to take delivery of the Ocean BlackLion, its fourth new drillship; and the Ocean GreatWhite, its newbuild, harsh environment semisubmersible. Both of these units are already contracted.
Between its balance sheet liquidity and its $1.5 billion bank revolver, Diamond has ample liquidity for its current capital projects. Additionally, halting the special dividend will enable Diamond to retain, on an annualized basis, over $400 million of cash to bolster its available liquidity.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $11 million to Loews' net income during Q4 2014, up from $4 million last year. After adjusting for a goodwill impairment charge in last year's fourth quarter, however, Boardwalk's contribution declined from $20 million last year to this year's $11 million. Boardwalk's fourth quarter 2014 results were negatively impacted by lower storage and park and loan revenue as well as by higher operating expenses.
For full year 2014, Boardwalk contributed $18 million to Loews' net income versus $78 million for 2013. The major onetime items impacting this year-over-year comparison in 2013 were the just mentioned goodwill impairment charge and a partially offsetting gain on the sale of operating gas. The write-off during 2014 of the previously capitalized costs associated with the Bluegrass project reduced Loews' net income by $55 million. Excluding these 3 onetime items, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income declined from $85 million in 2013 to $73 million in 2014.
Loews Hotels generated net income of $3 million during Q4 2014 versus a net loss of $5 million last year. For the full year, Loews Hotels posted net income of $11 million, up meaningfully from a $3 million net loss in 2013. This quarter, we are providing additional information about Loews Hotels, which can be found in the company overview document posted on our IR website.
In particular, I wanted to highlight our disclosure of adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as the sum of the EBITDA from our wholly-owned properties and our pro rata share of the EBITDA generated by our joint venture properties. Management company results are also included. Excluded are nonrecurring items such as transaction costs. The company overview also includes a table that reconciles Loews Hotels reported pretax income to its adjusted EBITDA for the past 3 years. We would be happy to walk you through it offline. And to anticipate a question, we will not be disclosing EBITDA on a property-by-property basis.
For full year 2014, Loews Hotels generated adjusted EBITDA of $123 million, up from $66 million in 2013. The main drivers of the increase were the addition of new hotels, the reopening in January 2014 of the Loews Regency and higher profitability at numerous properties, including our joint venture hotels located at the Universal Orlando Resort.
I would hasten to add that in 2014, several hotels were in the portfolio for only part of the year, including the 1,800-room Cabana Bay Beach Resort, the Loews Minneapolis Hotel and the Loews Chicago O'Hare Hotel. During the 3-year period from 2012 through 2014, Loews Corp.'s net cash contribution to Loews Hotels was $182 million.
In October, we completed the sale of HighMount E&P. The NOL generated by the sale should enable Loews to realize federal tax benefits of approximately $500 million in 2014 and future periods. 
Turning to the parent company. After-tax investment income during the fourth quarter declined from $54 million to $17 million in 2014, driven by reduced performance from equities and limited partnerships. For the full year, after tax investment income was down from $93 million in 2013 to $63 million in 2014, as favorable year-over-year results in gold-related equities were offset by a decline in year-over-year results for limited partnerships and other equities.
At year end, cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion as compared to $5.2 billion at the end of September and $4.7 billion at the end of 2013. We received $135 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: $60 million from CNA, $62 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. During all of 2014, we received $782 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $736 million in 2013.
As Jim mentioned, today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend. Loews will receive $485 million upon its payment. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2014, CNA paid a special dividend of $1 per share. Separately, Diamond announced today that it is not declaring a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. Loews received special dividends totaling $210 million from Diamond during 2014.
As for returning capital to our shareholders, during the fourth quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $207 million buying back 5 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $61 million during the quarter buying 1.9 million shares of Diamond stock, taking our ownership to over 52%.
For all of 2014, we spent $622 million repurchasing 14.6 million shares of Loews common stock or nearly 4% of our shares outstanding. Over the past 5 years, we have bought back almost 13% of our shares.
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

For Diamond, the offshore drilling industry is in the throes of a challenging cyclical downturn. We've seen this movie before, and we are encouraging Diamond to use this downturn to seize opportunities to strengthen and expand its business. The U.S. energy markets are experiencing tremendous changes, which have affected Boardwalk. U.S. natural gas and liquids production is forecast to continue growing meaningfully over the coming years. We expect the accompanying growth and demand for transportation and storage will present attractive opportunities for Boardwalk to expand the utilization of its existing network while also extending the network's reach.
CNA enters 2015 laser-focused on improving its underwriting performance. The company's underlying combined ratio continues to decline, but there remains room for improvement as CNA works towards the goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter. We will be keeping a close eye on underwriting profitability especially at CNA Commercial. 
And finally, Loews Hotels is welcoming a new CEO and continuing its focus on growth and profitability. As always, we stand ready to help Loews Hotels fund its growth plan.
Overall, there is tremendous change happening across our portfolio of businesses. This coming year will continue to be challenging for some of our subsidiaries, and we are focusing on turning those challenges into opportunities that will benefit our shareholders well into the future. As always, Loews is focused on managing capital to achieve the best long-term return for our shareholders, whether it's through share repurchases, investing in one of our subsidiaries or adding another business to our portfolio. We have found that disciplined capital management, coupled with a diverse portfolio of businesses, is an exceptional way to create value over time.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mary."

Like I said, I think the industry is still declining. I think day rates can continue to go down for a while.

Like I said, I think the industry is still declining. I think day rates can continue to go down for a while. Certainly, oil companies are not anxious about drilling now, combined with the fact that there continue to be new rigs that are entering the fleet, rigs that had been ordered 2, 2.5 and 3 years ago. So there is more supply coming on to the market in an environment where oil companies are stepping back. That says to me that day rates can continue to move down. But oil at $40, $50 or, in my opinion, $60 a barrel is not what I would call a steady-state price for oil. I think it has to be -- my guess is it has to be somewhere between $70 and $90 per barrel. And my guess is that, as they say, in the fullness of time, once we get to -- when and if we get to those prices and some stability returns to the oil market, I think that utilization will start to increase. Like I said, I don't know the timing, but I certainly believe that it will happen. The other thing that the oil industry overall has going for it is depletion. The world today produces about 95 million barrels a day of oil. And the estimates are that growth in demand is about 1 million barrels per day every year. So that means that next year instead of demand being 95 million barrels, demand will be 96 million barrels a day. But that doesn't mean that the industry has to find an additional 1 million barrels a day. What it means, in fact, is the industry probably has to find 6 million barrels a day. Because in the course of the year, if no exploration is done, productive capacity worldwide will drop from 95 million to 90 million. So the industry needs to find the 5 million just to make up for what was depleted and then find an additional 1 million barrels of capacity. My sense is that at the price that we have for oil today, we are not replacing all the oil that is depleting. And so my guess is over the next few years, if prices stay down here, we will start to see declines in productive capability."

And the reason for it is because of the extraordinary capital discipline that has been in place for the past 5 or 10 years in the industry. The industry generates lots of excess capital. And what we see from a lot of companies in the industry is that with the combination of share repurchases and dividends, companies are returning their -- the entire amount of capital that they've earned in the past year. And in fact, some companies are returning more than they're earning. So in the old days, we used to have exaggerated cycles in this industry because companies retained so much capital. But now that, that capital is being recycled through share repurchases and dividends, I just don't see the capacity pressure that drives down prices like we've seen in prior cycles. So prices now, we're still getting probably 2% to 4% price increases. That's generally good enough to cover inflation, which the federal government tells us, is about 1.5%. CNA is also busily re-underwriting its commercial book of business. So I'm hopeful that even in this price environment, over time, CNA can continue to bring down its combined ratio as we strive to become a top quartile commercial lines underwriter."

And in particular, with respect to Boardwalk, it tends not to move on the base -- its business isn't affected based upon the price of the commodity that it's transporting. But unlike Boardwalk, Diamond Offshore, as we all well know, can move dramatically based on the price of oil. So to the extent that the oil market is going to recover, I strongly believe that we will benefit from that through improvements in Diamond's business and hopefully its stock price."

And we read in the newspapers lots of people who -- lots of people and organizations that are loading their gun, looking to make investments in the energy market. Beyond that, I don't see anything that's as obvious. And I think part of the problem goes back to interest rates. Interest rates are extraordinarily low. With 10-year notes trading below 2% and long bonds trading at 2.5%, there's no doubt in my mind that the -- what the Federal Reserve has done through its quantitative easing is created a squeeze in the long end of the market. There are plenty of investors that need long-dated securities for pension funds and other types of products that they offer. And they just can't get enough of those securities. The Fed owns probably $4 trillion, $3.5 trillion or $4 trillion of long-dated securities. Those are securities that are out of the market. So as a result, there is a squeeze as people clamor for securities that just are not available. So I believe that intermediate to long rates are at manipulated low rates. And the problem with that is that the 10- and 30-year treasury act as benchmarks for all manner of investments in the financial markets and the real estate markets and the capital spending market. So those that are making the decision on either stocks, capital spending or real estate are using a benchmark that, in my opinion, is below its free-market rate. And that's going to cause -- that causes many, many assets to be overpriced compared to where we would think the fair market value of those assets is."

Because in fact, I can't tell you right now what is the market day rate for, say, a new fifth- or sixth-generation drillship. There haven't been any fixtures recently. My guess is it's between $300,000 and $400,000 a day, but it's really difficult to say. What I would say is that in an environment of oil prices that are, number one, $30 higher than they are today; and number two, where the volatility has -- or much of the volatility has left the oil market, in that environment, I could see that day rates would be higher than they are today. These assets cost about $600 million to build. And in order for someone to buy -- to order a new one, they have to get a return on their investment that makes it worthwhile for them to take that risk. So my guess is that for someone to order a new rig, they would need to anticipate that they could earn, say, $100 million -- at least $100 million on that investment. $100 million is about $250,000 to $300,000 a day that has to be earned. You pile on top of that the daily operating costs of approximately $200,000. And what you see is that before anybody is going to go out and order a new rig, they have to be pretty sure that they're going to be able to earn between $450,000 and $500,000 a day on that asset. And my expectation is that we are not going to be seeing significant new construction for a long time until we do get to that place where pricing is at, what I would call, replacement price levels."

So I'm not worried about that. And likewise, when we think about -- as I said before, when we think about consumption growing, we have to remember that it's not just 1 million barrels a day of new capacity that you have to add. It's more like 5 million, 6 million or 7 million barrels a day of new capacity that you have to add. So the marketplace, once it reaches an equilibrium, will -- the market price for oil will set to a level that makes it such that enough oil can be found in order to supply the world with what's being demanded. And like I said, my guess is that, that's somewhere between $75 and $90 a barrel. And my guess is that, at those levels, offshore drilling will be very attractive for oil companies."

I trust that you all had a chance to look at our press release, which was distributed earlier this morning. David Edelson, our CFO, will provide details on our earnings later on in the call.
I want to start by discussing today's dividend-related announcements from Diamond Offshore and CNA Financial, and then touch briefly on each of our subsidiaries and the parent company. The rapid decline in oil prices has severely impacted offshore drilling contractors, and we expect this negative impact to continue. Diamond's customers, the national and international oil companies as well as the independent E&P companies, have been scaling back their exploration and development budgets in light of the recent price plunge and their own cash flow shortfalls. Combined with the influx of new offshore drilling units that continue to enter the market, the oil price decline has led to a supply-demand imbalance that has driven down day rates, shortened contract terms and idled rigs.
In view of the decidedly negative conditions in the offshore drilling industry, the Diamond Offshore board has decided not to pay a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. As Diamond's majority shareholder, we support the board's decision to retain cash so that if opportunities to purchase rigs at attractive prices present themselves, the company is ready to act. Given the company's existing liquidity, its $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit facility, its modest leverage and its strong credit ratings, we are optimistic that Diamond will be able to capitalize on the current turmoil in the offshore drilling market.
For those of you who tuned into our call -- our last call, you'll remember that with respect to Diamond, I said trouble is opportunity. The trouble is certainly here, and Diamond is prepared for the opportunity.
At CNA, the company's balance sheet has never been stronger, ending the year with statutory capital of over $11 billion and GAAP shareholders' equity of almost $13 billion.
In its most recent writeup on CNA, Standard & Poor's stated that CNA has AAA level capital. As a result of its good earnings and robust capital position, CNA today declared a $2 per share special dividend, which is in addition to its regular $0.25 quarterly dividend. As a point of reference, last year, CNA paid a $1 per share special dividend. The divergent, completely independent paths of CNA's and Diamond's special dividends highlight the benefit to Loews of maintaining a diverse portfolio of subsidiaries.
The performance of Loews' stock during 2014 was negatively affected by the declines in the stock prices of Boardwalk and Diamond. We took the opportunity during 2014 to buy back almost 4% of our outstanding shares, spending approximately $620 million in the process. While we're certainly not thrilled with the decline in our share price, we believe that, over the long term, buying our stock at attractive levels will prove to have been the right decision.
Similarly, we believe that our purchase during the fourth quarter of 1.9 million shares of Diamond Offshore common stock will benefit our shareholders over the long term as well.
Loews ended the year with $5 billion in cash and investments. One of our perennial priorities is to maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet, which gives us the flexibility to move quickly when opportunity knocks without having to rely on external financing sources.
Now let's take a look at highlights from our subsidiaries. Then I'll turn the call over to David, who will walk you through our quarterly and annual results in greater detail.
Let's start with Diamond. Loews has been in the offshore drilling business for more than 25 years. In that time, we have learned one thing with absolute certainty: offshore drilling is a cyclical business, and Diamond is managed accordingly. 9 years ago when others were paying top dollar for new drilling rigs, Diamond began returning capital to shareholders by paying special dividends. Since January of '06, Diamond has paid over $41 per share in regular and special dividends, returning more than $5.7 billion to shareholders over that time.
We believe that the current market downturn is yet another cycle playing out in offshore drilling and that the industry will eventually recover. It's just a matter of time. While no one knows with any certainty when the market will come back, I'm confident that Diamond will withstand this cyclical downturn as it has others. Diamond has the strongest balance sheet in the business, ample liquidity, moderate leverage and a patient majority shareholder that understands the cyclical nature of the offshore drilling industry.
Turning to CNA. CNA had a strong quarter and year. Its underlying combined ratio improved for the year due to a better business mix as the company continued to focus on industry segments where it has deep expertise, such as technology, financial services and manufacturing. Additionally, CNA benefited from premium rate increases, although such increases slowed somewhat in 2014. For the coming year, CNA will be operating in a market where rate increases are likely to be relatively modest and investment income will be constrained by the interest rate environment. CNA will not stretch for growth, choosing instead to forego growth in return for a more profitable core book of business.
Moving on to Boardwalk. About a year ago, Boardwalk made the difficult decision to reduce its quarterly cash distribution. Fast forward a year and it turned out to be exactly the right decision for the company and for long-term shareholders. Boardwalk has been able to utilize internally generated funds and to take advantage of growth opportunities, avoiding dilution. In fact, almost all of its distributable cash flow has gone towards growth projects or distribution payments. New opportunities for growth continued to materialize in 2014, as Boardwalk secured an impressive $1.5 billion in organic projects to be built over the next 3 to 4 years. While these projects -- when these projects come online, they are expected to generate double-digit, unlevered return for years to come.
And last but not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels has been focused on building its brand and broadening its customer base by adding properties in gateway cities and resort destinations as well as by renovating existing properties. The financial performance is showing strong improvement, in part as a result of our capital investment over the past several years. We are enhancing our disclosure regarding Loews Hotels this quarter. David will walk you through the company's adjusted EBITDA during his remarks.
We're excited that Kirk Kinsell has agreed to lead Loews Hotels for the next phase of its growth. He will join Loews Hotels in March. Kirk has tremendous experience in the hospitality industry, having most recently been President of the Americas for InterContinental Hotels Group, where he had responsibility for 3,700 hotels.
Paul Whetsell, who has served as Loews Hotels' CEO for the past 3 years, has done a fantastic job at growing the brand and improving operations. Paul will become Vice Chairman of Loews Hotels once Kirk joins in March.
And coincidentally, Mark's (sic) [Kirk] first day as CEO will also be the first day that the Loews Chicago Hotel will be open for business. Make your reservations now.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to David."

For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continui",1382,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2014, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $215 million or $0.57 per share compared to $248 million or $0.64 per share last year. For full year 2014, income from continuing operations was $962 million or $2.52 per share as compared to $1.1 billion or $2.95 per share in 2013.
Our reduction in parent company investment income drove the quarter-over-quarter decline. For the full year, the main drivers were lower earnings contributions from CNA, Diamond and Boardwalk.
CNA contributed $186 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2014, essentially flat with last year's fourth quarter. Onetime items affected the quarterly results in both years. A CNA pension settlement charge reduced Loews' Q4 2014 income by $49 million, while a charge related to retroactive reinsurance accounting for the Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction reduced our Q4 2013 income by $111 million.
CNA's net investment income in Q4 2014 was down versus the prior year, driven primarily by limited partnership investments. Offsetting positives included higher net favorable prior year development, together with improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses. In Q4 2014, CNA posted slight realized investment losses versus modest gains in the prior year quarter.
For full year 2014, CNA contributed $770 million to Loews' income from continuing operations before realized gains, down from $817 million in 2013. Reduced net investment income and lower net favorable prior year development drove the year-over-year decline. Partially offsetting these declines were improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophes. Onetime items also affected the 2 years.
In 2014, a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of CNA's annuity and pension deposit business reduced CNA's earnings contribution to Loews by $31 million. And in 2013, as just mentioned, the charge related to the Loss Portfolio Transfer, reduced our income by $111 million. CNA posted a higher level of realized investment gains in 2014 than in 2013.
Diamond Offshore contributed $47 million to Loews' income from continuing operations during Q4 2014, up from $44 million last year. Diamond's pretax income was actually down versus prior year. A slight increase in EBITDA was more than offset by higher depreciation and interest expense. Further, in last year's fourth quarter, Diamond's net income was impacted by a high effective tax rate, driven by a provision for an uncertain tax position. This reduced Diamond's after tax contribution to Loews last year by $27 million.
For full year 2014, Diamond contributed $183 million to Loews' net income, down from $257 million in 2013. The company's third quarter 2014 rig impairment charge drove the decline, together with lower rig operating income, higher depreciation and interest expense and higher G&A expenses. Partially offsetting the decline in pretax income was a 4 point reduction in the company's tax rate caused by various factors, including a Q4 2013 tax provision previously mentioned; and in the third quarter of 2014, the benefit to Diamond from settling uncertain tax positions related to several foreign jurisdictions.
Diamond took delivery of 3 drillships and 2 semisubmersibles in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the company expects to take delivery of the Ocean BlackLion, its fourth new drillship; and the Ocean GreatWhite, its new build, harsh environment semisubmersible. Both of these units are already contracted.
Between its balance sheet liquidity and its $1.5 billion bank revolver, Diamond has ample liquidity for its current capital projects. Additionally, halting the special dividend will enable Diamond to retain, on an annualized basis, over $400 million of cash to bolster its available liquidity.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $11 million to Loews' net income during Q4 2014, up from $4 million last year. After adjusting for a goodwill impairment charge in last year's fourth quarter, however, Boardwalk's contribution declined from $20 million last year to this year's $11 million. Boardwalk's fourth quarter 2014 results were negatively impacted by lower storage and park and loan revenue as well as by higher operating expenses.
For full year 2014, Boardwalk contributed $18 million to Loews' net income versus $78 million for 2013. The major onetime items impacting this year-over-year comparison in 2013 were the just mentioned goodwill impairment charge and a partially offsetting gain on the sale of operating gas. The write-off during 2014 of the previously capitalized costs associated with the Bluegrass project reduced Loews' net income by $55 million. Excluding these 3 onetime items, Boardwalk's contribution to our net income declined from $85 million in 2013 to $73 million in 2014.
Loews Hotels generated net income of $3 million during Q4 2014 versus a net loss of $5 million last year. For the full year, Loews Hotels posted net income of $11 million, up meaningfully from a $3 million net loss in 2013. This quarter, we are providing additional information about Loews Hotels, which can be found in the company overview document posted on our IR website.
In particular, I wanted to highlight our disclosure of adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as the sum of the EBITDA from our wholly owned properties and our pro rata share of the EBITDA generated by our joint venture properties. Management company results are also included. Excluded are nonrecurring items such as transaction costs. The company overview also includes a table that reconciles Loews Hotels reported pretax income to its adjusted EBITDA for the past 3 years. We would be happy to walk you through it offline. And to anticipate a question, we will not be disclosing EBITDA on a property-by-property basis.
For full year 2014, Loews Hotels generated adjusted EBITDA of $123 million, up from $66 million in 2013. The main drivers of the increase were the addition of new hotels, the reopening in January 2014 of the Loews Regency and higher profitability at numerous properties, including our joint venture hotels located at the Universal Orlando Resort.
I would hasten to add that in 2014, several hotels were in the portfolio for only part of the year, including the 1,800-room Cabana Bay Beach Resort, the Loews Minneapolis Hotel and the Loews Chicago O'Hare Hotel. During the 3-year period from 2012 to 2014, Loews Corp.'s net cash contribution to Loews Hotels was $182 million.
In October, we completed the sale of HighMount E&P. The NOL generated by the sale should enable Loews to realize federal tax benefits of approximately $500 million in 2014 and future periods. 
Turning to the parent company. After tax investment income during the fourth quarter declined from $54 million to $17 million in 2014, driven by reduced performance from equities and limited partnerships. For the full year, after tax investment income was down from $93 million in 2013 to $63 million in 2014, as favorable year-over-year results in gold-related equities were offset by a decline in year-over-year results for limited partnerships and other equities.
At year end, cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion as compared to $5.2 billion at the end of September and $4.7 billion at the end of 2013. We received $135 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: $60 million from CNA, $62 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. During all of 2014, we received $782 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, up from $736 million in 2013.
As Jim mentioned, today, CNA declared a $2 per share special dividend. Loews will receive $485 million upon its payment. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2014, CNA paid a special dividend of $1 per share. Separately, Diamond announced today that it is not declaring a special dividend this quarter and for the foreseeable future. Loews received special dividends totaling $210 million from Diamond during 2014.
As for returning capital to our shareholders, during the fourth quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $207 million buying back 5 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $61 million during the quarter buying 1.9 million shares of Diamond stock, taking our ownership to over 52%.
For all of 2014, we spent $622 million repurchasing 14.6 million shares of Loews common stock or nearly 4% of our shares outstanding. Over the past 5 years, we have bought back almost 13% of our shares.
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

For Diamond, the offshore drilling industry is in the throes of a challenging cyclical downturn. We've seen this movie before, and we are encouraging Diamond to use this downturn to seize opportunities to strengthen and expand its business. The U.S. energy markets are experiencing tremendous changes, which have affected Boardwalk. U.S. natural gas and liquids production is forecast to continue growing meaningfully over the coming years. We expect the accompanying growth and demand for transportation and storage will present attractive opportunities for Boardwalk to expand the utilization of its existing network while also extending the network's reach.
CNA enters 2015 laser-focused on improving its underwriting performance. The company's underlying combined ratio continues to decline, but there remains room for improvement as CNA works towards the goal of becoming a top quartile underwriter. We will be keeping a close eye on underwriting profitability especially at CNA Commercial. 
And finally, Loews Hotels is welcoming a new CEO and continuing its focus on growth and profitability. As always, we stand ready to help Loews Hotels fund its growth plan.
Overall, there is tremendous change happening across our portfolio of businesses. This coming year will continue to be challenging for some of our subsidiaries, and we are focusing on turning those challenges into opportunities that will benefit our shareholders well into the future. As always, Loews is focused on managing capital to achieve the best long-term return for our shareholders, whether it's through share repurchases, investing in one of our subsidiaries or adding another business to our portfolio. We have found that disciplined capital management, coupled with a diverse portfolio of businesses, is an exceptional way to create value over time.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mary."

Like I said, I think the industry is still declining. I think day rates can continue to go down for a while.

Like I said, I think the industry is still declining. I think day rates can continue to go down for a while. Certainly, oil companies are not anxious about drilling now, combined with the fact that there continue to be new rigs that are entering the fleet, rigs that had been ordered 2, 2.5 and 3 years ago. So there is more supply coming on to the market in an environment where oil companies are stepping back. That says to me that day rates can continue to move down. But oil at $40, $50 or, in my opinion, $60 a barrel is not what I would call a steady-state price for oil. I think it has to be -- my guess is it has to be somewhere between $70 and $90 per barrel. And my guess is that, as they say, in the fullness of time, once we get to -- when and if we get to those prices and some stability returns to the oil market, I think that utilization will start to increase. Like I said, I don't know the timing, but I certainly believe that it will happen. The other thing that the oil industry overall has going for it is depletion. The world today produces about 95 million barrels a day of oil. And the estimates are that growth in demand is about 1 million barrels per day every year. So that means that next year instead of demand being 95 million barrels, demand will be 96 million barrels a day. But that doesn't mean that the industry has to find an additional 1 million barrels a day. What it means, in fact, is the industry probably has to find 6 million barrels a day. Because in the course of the year, if no exploration is done, productive capacity worldwide will drop from 95 million to 90 million. So the industry needs to find the 5 million just to make up for what was depleted and then find an additional 1 million barrels of capacity. My sense is that at the price that we have for oil today, we are not replacing all the oil that is depleting. And so my guess is over the next few years, if prices stay down here, we will start to see declines in productive capability."

And the reason for it is because of the extraordinary capital discipline that has been in place for the past 5 or 10 years in the industry. The industry generates lots of excess capital. And what we see from a lot of companies in the industry is that with the combination of share repurchases and dividends, companies are returning their -- the entire amount of capital that they've earned in the past year. And in fact, some companies are returning more than they're earning. So in the old days, we used to have exaggerated cycles in this industry because companies retained so much capital. But now that, that capital is being recycled through share repurchases and dividends, I just don't see the capacity pressure that drives down prices like we've seen in prior cycles. So prices now, we're still getting probably 2% to 4% price increases. That's generally good enough to cover inflation, which the federal government tells us, is about 1.5%. CNA is also busily re-underwriting its commercial book of business. So I'm hopeful that even in this price environment, over time, CNA can continue to bring down its combined ratio as we strive to become a top quartile commercial lines underwriter."

But those 2 companies, going forward, are going to be our exposure to energy. And in particular, with respect to Boardwalk, it tends not to move on the base -- its business isn't affected based upon the price of the commodity that it's transporting. But unlike Boardwalk, Diamond Offshore, as we all well know, can move dramatically based on the price of oil. So to the extent that the oil market is going to recover, I strongly believe that we will benefit from that through improvements in Diamond's business and hopefully its stock price."

And we read in the newspapers lots of people who -- lots of people and organizations that are loading their gun, looking to make investments in the energy market. Beyond that, I don't see anything that's as obvious. And I think part of the problem goes back to interest rates. Interest rates are extraordinarily low. With 10-year notes trading below 2% and long bonds trading at 2.5%, there's no doubt in my mind that the -- what the Federal Reserve has done through its quantitative easing is created a squeeze in the long end of the market. There are plenty of investors that need long-dated securities for pension funds and other types of products that they offer. And they just can't get enough of those securities. The Fed owns probably $4 trillion, $3.5 trillion or $4 trillion of long-dated securities. Those are securities that are out of the market. So as a result, there is a squeeze as people clamor for securities that just are not available. So I believe that intermediate to long rates are at manipulated low rates. And the problem with that is that the 10- and 30-year treasury act as benchmarks for all manner of investments in the financial markets and the real estate markets and the capital spending market. So those that are making the decision on either stocks, capital spending or real estate are using a benchmark that, in my opinion, is below its free-market rate. And that's going to cause -- that causes many, many assets to be overpriced compared to where we would think the fair market value of those assets is."

Because in fact, I can't tell you right now what is the market day rate for, say, a new fifth- or sixth-generation drillship. There haven't been any fixtures recently. My guess is it's between $300,000 and $400,000 a day, but it's really difficult to say. What I would say is that in an environment of oil prices that are, number one, $30 higher than they are today; and number two, where the volatility has -- or much of the volatility has left the oil market, in that environment, I could see that day rates would be higher than they are today. These assets cost about $600 million to build. And in order for someone to buy -- to order a new one, they have to get a return on their investment that makes it worthwhile for them to take that risk. So my guess is that for someone to order a new rig, they would need to anticipate that they could earn, say, $100 million -- at least $100 million on that investment. $100 million is about $250,000 to $300,000 a day that has to be earned. You pile on top of that the daily operating costs of approximately $200,000. And what you see is that before anybody is going to go out and order a new rig, they have to be pretty sure that they're going to be able to earn between $450,000 and $500,000 a day on that asset. And my expectation is that we are not going to be seeing significant new construction for a long time until we do get to that place where pricing is at, what I would call, replacement price levels."

So I'm not worried about that. And likewise, when we think about -- as I said before, when we think about consumption growing, we have to remember that it's not just 1 million barrels a day of new capacity that you have to add. It's more like 5 million, 6 million or 7 million barrels a day of new capacity that you have to add. So the marketplace, once it reaches an equilibrium, will -- the market price for oil will set to a level that makes it such that enough oil can be found in order to supply the world with what's being demanded. And like I said, my guess is that, that's somewhere between $75 and $90 a barrel. And my guess is that, at those levels, offshore drilling will be very attractive for oil companies."

Loews reported income from continuing operations for the first quarter of $109 million compared to $265 million in the first quarter of 2014. The quarter's results were significantly impacted by an impairment charge at Diamond Offshore of $158 million after tax related to the carrying value of 8 of its older drilling rigs. David Edelson, our CFO, will provide more details on the charge and key earnings drivers later in the call. 
I want to start today by looking at Loews' $5.5 billion portfolio of cash and investments. Obviously, this is a lot of cash, but that's nothing out of the ordinary for Loews. Over the years, maintaining a sizable liquidity position has given us the freedom to deploy our capital opportunistically in order to create value for our shareholders over the long term. We've done this by using our cash to invest in our subsidiaries, to add new businesses and to repurchase our shares. Let's briefly examine each of these levers.
Two subsidiaries we have provided funding for over the year -- over the last few years have been Boardwalk and Loews Hotels. At Boardwalk, an attractive capital markets funding has not been available or inflexibility funds of financing are required, Loews stepped and provided bridge financing. We work closely with Boardwalk's management team to hone the financial -- financing plans, and our cash position enables us to utilize parent company capital in projects with attractive risk-adjusted returns for both Loews and Boardwalk.
At Loews Hotels, over the past 6 months, the parent company has invested approximately $300 million to finance hotel acquisitions. Some of these investments have been in the form of equity bridge financing, which we anticipate will be returned as Loews Hotels brings in outside equity partners. We like this model, and we intend to use it going forward to acquire additional hotels.
In addition to enabling us to invest in our subsidiaries, a high level of liquidity allows us to move quickly and decisively when considering an acquisition at the holding company level. We're actively seeking to diversify our portfolio of businesses, but we don't want to rush into a deal simply because we have the funds available. Current valuations for companies and assets don't lend themselves to the kind of equity returns we want. We're looking for the right deal at the right price, either a company with good cash-on-cash returns and strong secular growth trends or distressed undervalued assets at an advantageous entry point in the cycle.
And finally, let's not forget about share repurchases, which remains an important wave of Loews creates value for shareholders. On our call last November, I discussed in detail the various metrics we use when considering share repurchases decision, including the sum of the parts calculation. Over the last year, Loews spent almost $700 million of its cash buying back almost 16 million shares. As we've said before, money doesn't burn a hole in our pockets. While we acknowledge that cash can be a drag on Loews' short-term returns, we feel that having the flexibility to be opportunistic and not rely on financing markets has served our shareholders very well over the long term.
Now let's look at some highlights from our subsidiaries. Let's start with Diamond Offshore. Loews has been in the offshore drilling business for more than 25 years. In that time, we've learned one thing with absolute certainty: Offshore drilling is a cyclical business, and therefore, Diamond is managed accordingly.
Nine years ago, when others were paying top dollar for new drilling rigs, Diamond began returning capital to shareholders by paying special dividends. Since January of '06, Diamond has paid over $41 per share in regular and special dividends, returning more than $5.7 billion to shareholders over that time. 
At the current cyclical debt -- as this current cyclical downturn accelerated, however, Diamond decided not to pay a special dividend. In stead, the company elected to retain cash in order to maintain Diamond's financial strength and to position the company to be ready to act if we got acquisition opportunities presented themselves.
While Diamond has been able to secure a long-term contracts for its newest deepwater rigs, prospects have been far more challenging for its mid water fleet. Diamond expects newer rigs to continue to compete aggressively against lower spec units. As a result of the increased competition and dramatically reduced rig chartering opportunities for mid-water rigs, this quarter, Diamond decided to cold stack or scrap 8 of those rigs that have no foreseeable employment prospects.
We have no doubt that Diamond will stand the cyclical downturn, and we hope and expect that the company will emerge having found opportunities to acquire good assets at attractive prices. But as of today, we're not aware of any distressed assets available for sale at prices even close to a price we'd be willing to pay. Hopefully, that situation will change in the next several quarters. And when it does, Diamond will be ready.
Now let's turn to CNA. The company had a good quarter, producing an 18% year-over-year jump in net operating income. The results were helped by lower catastrophe losses and strong investment income from limited partnerships. More importantly, management continues to focus on margin improvement in its core PNC business. While there's more work to be done, we're pleased with CNA's steady progress. For the coming year, CNA will be operating in a market where rate increases are likely to be relatively modest and investment income will be constrained by the low interest rate environment.
CNA will remain focused on improving its underwriting capabilities in its Commercial segment, maintaining its leadership position in its Specialty segment and prudently managing its long-term care book of business.
At Boardwalk, over the last 15 months, the company has secured an extraordinary $1.6 billion in organic capital projects. These projects are backed by long-term agreements that are expected to generate double-digit unlevered returns once completed in the next 2 to 4 years. Since the projects will not come online immediately, Boardwalk raised $116 million in equity to help fund its capital expenditures this year and to manage its leverage. Maintaining its credit quality will be a key focus for Boardwalk during the build-out phase of these projects.
Last but not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. The hits just keep on coming for our hotel company. Since the beginning of the year, the company opened the Loews Chicago Hotel and has completed the acquisition of the 155-room Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco, which has been proudly renamed the Loews Regency San Francisco. New additions to the hotel company continued to be well-received, especially our newest hotel in Orlando, the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, which has been going gangbusters since it opened a year ago in March. If you haven't visited one of our hotels in Orlando, you should.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."

Loews reported income from continuing operations of $109 million or $0.29 per share for this year's first quarter, down from $265 million or $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2014. 
Diamond Offshore reported sharply lower earnings this year, only partially offset by earnings improvements at CNA and Boardwalk. As I will discuss more fully, unusual items affected earnings comparisons at both Diamond Offshore and Boardwalk. 
Loews' net income, which reflects the impact of a $206 million loss from discontinued operations in last year's first quarter, was up year-over-year. As a reminder, last year's loss from discontinued operations related primarily to the sale by CNA Financial of its life insurance subsidiary.
CNA contributed $202 million to Loews' income from continuing operations in this year's first quarter as compared to $176 million in the first quarter of 2014. These amounts exclude after-tax realized gains of $8 million this year versus $24 million last year. The increase in CNA's net operating income was attributable to 2 main factors.
Number one, higher net investment income driven by limited partnership investments. And two, higher P&C underwriting income driven by lower catastrophe losses and improved noncat accident year results.
During the first quarter, CNA paid a $2 per share special dividend and a $0.25 per share regular quarterly dividend. At quarter-end, after the payment by CNA of over $600 million of shareholder dividends, the company's capital and liquidity positions remain rocksolid.
Diamond Offshore contributed a loss of $126 million to our first quarter net income, down from an earnings contribution of $69 million last year. Diamond's first quarter results included after-tax impairment charge of $319 million, of which $158 million flow through our net income. The charge resulted from Diamond's decision to impair 8 of its lower spec rates, 7 mid-water semi-submersibles and an older drillship. Diamond announced that it plans to scrap 3 of the 7 mid-water units being impaired.
Additionally, Diamond booked a restructuring charge in this year's first quarter that reduced Loews' net income by $2.3 million. Absent the impairment and restructuring charges, Diamond's contribution to our net income declined from $69 million last year to $34 million this year. Lower rig utilization negatively affected rig operating income. In addition, depreciation expense was up from last year because of new rigs having been placed into service.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $25 million to Loews' net income during Q1 2015, up from a loss of $18 million last year. The loss last year included a $55 million after-tax charge related to the write-off of all capitalized costs associated with the former Bluegrass project. Absent this charge, Boardwalk's contribution to our earnings decreased primarily due to lower EBITDA and higher depreciation. The EBITDA decline stemmed from lower revenue from transportation, parking loan and storage, attributable in large part to warmer winter weather this year versus last in Boardwalk's market areas.
During the first quarter and into early April, Boardwalk sold 7 million common units under its equity distribution program. Net proceeds to Boardwalk were $116 million, including the general partner contribution. Boardwalk sold equity to manage its capital ratios during a period when it is spending capital on projects that are not yet in service and does not producing EBITDA.
In keeping with its focus on capital management, we anticipate that Boardwalk will draw down its $300 million subordinated debt facility from Loews later this year. Loews Hotels generated net income of $5 million during the first quarter, up from $3 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA, which you can find in the earnings snapshot posted on our website, was $35 million during the first quarter versus $24 million in the prior year.
The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by Loews Hotels property at Universal Orlando, including the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, as well as improved performance at various other properties. As Jim mentioned, during the first 4 months of 2015, we invested over $300 million in Loews Hotels to finance the all equity acquisitions of the Loews Chicago and Loews Regency San Francisco hotels. Over time, Loews Hotels will likely put leverage on these properties and may, if appropriate, bring in equity partners.
Turning to the parent company. After tax investment income declined from $34 million in 2014 to $19 million in 2015, driven by reduced performance from equities, partially offset by higher returns from the parent company limited partnership portfolio.
At quarter-end, cash and investments totaled $5.5 billion as compared to $5.1 billion at the end of December. Over $4 billion of our cash and investments were in treasury bills and notes and other short-term instruments, which given the current interest rate environment, earned us very little, but provide strong liquidity.
We received $567 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which broke down as follows: $545 million in regular and special dividends from CNA; $9 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. As for returning capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $71 million buying back 1.8 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $24 million during the quarter buying just over 900,000 shares of Diamond stock, taking our ownership to 53.1%.
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

As I said 6 months ago, trouble is opportunity when it comes to the offshore drilling market. The market is certainly challenged, but Diamond is positioned to withstand this downturn, and hopefully, sees opportunities as they arise. CNA is improving its underwriting performance and maintaining a stellar balance sheet.
Diamond is repositioning its operations to align with the evolution of the U.S. natural gas marketplace. And Loews Hotels is adding to its presence in key markets of exciting potential. We continue our commitment to pursuing a value-oriented investment strategy and to creating a diverse portfolio of solid businesses.
As always, Loews is focused on managing capital to achieve the best long-term return for our shareholders. We found that discipline, capital management, coupled with a diverse portfolio of businesses, is an exceptional way to create value over time.

Let me just talk about where I think the market is right now. I think that after all these years of low interest rates and quantitative easing, what we have is markets, both fixed income and equity markets, that are priced for perfection. In stocks are almost at new highs. NASDAQ reached new highs last week. The S&P is within a shot of it. Today, as we speak, the market multiple is, I don't know, 16, 17, 18x earnings. When you look at companies that are auctioned in the private equity world, what I would say is that 10 is the new 6. And what that means is in the old days, when companies would trade at an EBITDA multiple of 6x, today, that number is 10x. I guess, interest rates are low, but still, it seems to me that even though you can finance at lower rates, there just isn't enough room for return for the equity holder at the these kinds of valuations. So my guess is that for the time being, businesses look like they're priced too high for costs. Now one other thing that I always remember is that the world is cyclical. And it's easy to lose sight of that because we're now in firmly in year 6 of an up cycle for equity prices. But at some point in time, something will happen. People will lose all the confidence that they have, and my guess is that opportunities will present itself. Like I said for offshore drilling, it could be a while. And offshore drilling, in the next several quarters, in the market for businesses, it could be in the next several years. But I'd rather be patient and get a good business at an attractive price rather than lose patience and buy a business at too high a price."

When you drill for offshore in shale, it can be as little as 2 months between the time that you make the investment decision until the time that you start production.

So with prices at $59 a barrel, you're able to pretty effectively hedge your first several years of production, which makes all the difference in terms of the economics of your well. So there's -- remember, so with onshore shale production, it's 2 months from the time you decide to drill until the time you're producing. For offshore drilling, it's 2 to 5 years from the time you decide to drill until the time that you can be producing. So the offshore guys are much, much less concerned about the spot price for oil and much more concerned about what the trend is going to be. They don't know nearly as well how much oil they're going to be able to produce from that well that they may drill in the next year. And they've got to do all manner of completion. So they don't know exactly when the oil is going to be produced. So it's much more difficult for them to hedge their production than it is for the onshore shale people."

I hope that you've all had a chance to look at our press release, which was distributed earlier this morning. 
Loews reported income from continuing operations for the first quarter of $109 million compared to $265 million in the first quarter of 2014. The quarter's results were significantly impacted by an impairment charge at Diamond Offshore of $158 million after tax related to the carrying value of 8 of its older drilling rigs. David Edelson, our CFO, will provide more details on the charge and key earnings drivers later in the call. 
I want to start today by looking at Loews' $5.5 billion portfolio of cash and investments. Obviously, this is a lot of cash, but that's nothing out of the ordinary for Loews. Over the years, maintaining a sizable liquidity position has given us the freedom to deploy our capital opportunistically in order to create value for our shareholders over the long term. We've done this by using our cash to invest in our subsidiaries, to add new businesses and to repurchase our shares. Let's briefly examine each of these levers.
Two subsidiaries we have provided funding for over the year -- over the last few years have been Boardwalk and Loews Hotels. At Boardwalk, an attractive capital markets funding has not been available or inflexible funds of financing are required, Loews has stepped in and provided bridge financing. We work closely with Boardwalk's management team to hone the financial -- financing plans, and our cash position enables us to utilize parent company capital in projects with attractive risk-adjusted returns for both Loews and Boardwalk.
At Loews Hotels, over the past 6 months, the parent company has invested approximately $300 million to finance hotel acquisitions. Some of these investments have been in the form of equity bridge financing, which we anticipate will be returned as Loews Hotels brings in outside equity partners. We like this model, and we intend to use it going forward to acquire additional hotels.
In addition to enabling us to invest in our subsidiaries, a high level of liquidity allows us to move quickly and decisively when considering an acquisition at the holding company level. We're actively seeking to diversify our portfolio of businesses, but we don't want to rush into a deal simply because we have the funds available. Current valuations for companies and assets don't lend themselves to the kind of equity returns we want. We're looking for the right deal at the right price, either a company with good cash-on-cash returns and strong secular growth trends or distressed undervalued assets at an advantageous entry point in the cycle.
And finally, let's not forget about share repurchases, which remain an important way that Loews creates value for shareholders. 
On our call last November, I discussed in detail the various metrics we use when considering share repurchases decision, including the sum of the parts calculation. Over the last year, Loews spent almost $700 million of its cash, buying back almost 16 million shares. As we've said before, money doesn't burn a hole in our pockets. While we acknowledge that cash can be a drag on Loews' short-term returns, we feel that having the flexibility to be opportunistic and not rely on financing markets has served our shareholders very well over the long term.
Now let's look at some highlights from our subsidiaries. Let's start with Diamond Offshore. Loews has been in the offshore drilling business for more than 25 years. In that time, we've learned one thing with absolute certainty: Offshore drilling is a cyclical business, and therefore, Diamond is managed accordingly.
Nine years ago, when others were paying top dollar for new drilling rigs, Diamond began returning capital to shareholders by paying special dividends. Since January of '06, Diamond has paid over $41 per share in regular and special dividends, returning more than $5.7 billion to shareholders over that time. 
At the current cyclical debt -- as this current cyclical downturn accelerated, however, Diamond decided not to pay a special dividend. Instead, the company elected to retain cash in order to maintain Diamond's financial strength and to position the company to be ready to act if rig acquisition opportunities presented themselves.
While Diamond has been able to secure a long-term contract for its newest deepwater rigs, prospects have been far more challenging for its mid-water fleet. Diamond expects newer rigs to continue to compete aggressively against lower spec units. As a result of the increased competition and dramatically reduced rig chartering opportunities for mid-water rigs this quarter, Diamond decided to cold stack or scrap 8 of those rigs that have no foreseeable employment prospects.
We have no doubt that Diamond will withstand the cyclical downturn, and we hope and expect that the company will emerge having found opportunities to acquire good assets at attractive prices. But as of today, we're not aware of any distressed assets available for sale at prices even close to a price we'd be willing to pay. Hopefully, that situation will change in the next several quarters. And when it does, Diamond will be ready.
Now let's turn to CNA. The company had a good quarter, producing an 18% year-over-year jump in net operating income. The results were helped by lower catastrophe losses and strong investment income from limited partnerships. More importantly, management continues to focus on margin improvement in its core P&C business. While there's more work to be done, we're pleased with CNA's steady progress. 
For the coming year, CNA will be operating in a market where rate increases are likely to be relatively modest and investment income will be constrained by the low interest rate environment.  CNA will remain focused on improving its underwriting capabilities in its Commercial segment, maintaining its leadership position in its Specialty segment and prudently managing its long-term care book of business.
At Boardwalk, over the last 15 months, the company has secured an extraordinary $1.6 billion in organic capital projects. These projects are backed by long-term agreements that are expected to generate double-digit unlevered returns once completed in the next 2 to 4 years. Since the projects will not come online immediately, Boardwalk raised $116 million in equity to help fund its capital expenditures this year and to manage its leverage. Maintaining its credit quality will be a key focus for Boardwalk during the build-out phase of these projects.
Last but not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. The hits just keep on coming for our hotel company. Since the beginning of the year, the company opened the Loews Chicago Hotel and has completed the acquisition of the 155-room Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco, which has been proudly renamed the Loews Regency San Francisco. New additions to the hotel company continued to be well-received, especially our newest hotel in Orlando, the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, which has been going gangbusters since it opened a year ago in March. If you haven't visited one of our hotels in Orlando, you should.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."

Loews reported income from continuing operations of $109 million or $0.29 per share for this year's first quarter, down from $265 million or $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2014. 
Diamond Offshore reported sharply lower earnings this year, only partially offset by earnings improvements at CNA and Boardwalk. As I will discuss more fully, unusual items affected earnings comparisons at both Diamond Offshore and Boardwalk. 
Loews' net income, which reflects the impact of a $206 million loss from discontinued operations in last year's first quarter, was up year-over-year. As a reminder, last year's loss from discontinued operations related primarily to the sale by CNA Financial of its life insurance subsidiary.
CNA contributed $202 million to Loews' income from continuing operations in this year's first quarter as compared to $176 million in the first quarter of 2014. These amounts exclude after tax realized gains of $8 million this year versus $24 million last year. 
The increase in CNA's net operating income was attributable to 2 main factors: number one, higher net investment income, driven by limited partnership investments; and two, higher P&C underwriting income, driven by lower catastrophe losses and improved noncat accident year results.
During the first quarter, CNA paid a $2 per share special dividend and a $0.25 per share regular quarterly dividend. At quarter end, after the payment by CNA of over $600 million of shareholder dividends, the company's capital and liquidity positions remain rock-solid.
Diamond Offshore contributed a loss of $126 million to our first quarter net income, down from an earnings contribution of $69 million last year. Diamond's first quarter results include an after tax impairment charge of $319 million, of which $158 million flow through our net income. The charge resulted from Diamond's decision to impair 8 of its lower spec rates, 7 mid-water semi-submersibles and an older drillship. Diamond announced that it plans to scrap 3 of the 7 mid-water units being impaired.
Additionally, Diamond booked a restructuring charge in this year's first quarter that reduced Loews' net income by $2.3 million. Absent the impairment and restructuring charges, Diamond's contribution to our net income declined from $69 million last year to $34 million this year. Lower rig utilization negatively affected rig operating income. In addition, depreciation expense was up from last year because of new rigs having been placed into service.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $25 million to Loews' net income during Q1 2015, up from a loss of $18 million last year. The loss last year included a $55 million after tax charge related to the write-off of all capitalized costs associated with the former Bluegrass project. Absent this charge, Boardwalk's contribution to our earnings decreased, primarily due to lower EBITDA and higher depreciation. The EBITDA decline stemmed from lower revenue from transportation, parking loan and storage, attributable in large part to warmer winter weather this year versus last in Boardwalk's market areas.
During the first quarter and into early April, Boardwalk sold 7 million common units under its equity distribution program. Net proceeds to Boardwalk were $116 million, including the General Partner contribution. Boardwalk sold equity to manage its capital ratios during a period when it is spending capital on projects that are not yet in service and does not producing EBITDA. In keeping with its focus on capital management, we anticipate that Boardwalk will draw down its $300 million subordinated debt facility from Loews later this year. 
Loews Hotels generated net income of $5 million during the first quarter, up from $3 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA, which you can find in the earnings snapshot posted on our website, was $35 million during the first quarter versus $24 million in the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by Loews Hotels property at Universal Orlando, including the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, as well as improved performance at various other properties. 
As Jim mentioned, during the first 4 months of 2015, we invested over $300 million in Loews Hotels to finance the all-equity acquisitions of the Loews Chicago and Loews Regency San Francisco hotels. Over time, Loews Hotels will likely put leverage on these properties and may, if appropriate, bring in equity partners.
Turning to the parent company. After tax investment income declined from $34 million in 2014 to $19 million in 2015, driven by reduced performance from equities, partially offset by higher returns from the parent company limited partnership portfolio.
At quarter end, cash and investments totaled $5.5 billion as compared to $5.1 billion at the end of December. Over $4 billion of our cash and investments were in treasury bills and notes and other short-term instruments, which, given the current interest rate environment, earned us very little, but provide strong liquidity.
We received $567 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which broke down as follows: $545 million in regular and special dividends from CNA; $9 million from Diamond; and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
As for returning capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $71 million, buying back 1.8 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $24 million during the quarter, buying just over 900,000 shares of Diamond stock, taking our ownership to 53.1%.
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

CNA is improving its underwriting performance and maintaining a stellar balance sheet. Diamond is repositioning its operations to align with the evolution of the U.S. natural gas marketplace. And Loews Hotels is adding to its presence in key markets with exciting potential.

There are people who either have rigs charted, so they're not feeling any pressure. There are people who may have lost charters or who have rigs that are unchartered now that are feeling a lot of pressure. But interest rates are low and at least for the next few months, they're able to get by. People that have rigs that are scheduled to come out of the shipyard, many of them have delayed the arrival of those ships. But there's no doubt in my mind that as the charter market remains a vast desert for these fifth and sixth generation rigs, that the carrying cost of the rigs, which is both the interest that they have to -- that owners have to pay on their debt and additionally, the stacking cost for these rigs, which can be as much as $2 million to $3 million a month, that will start to weigh on the owners. And at that point, in the next 2, 3 or 4 quarters, I think we could see that some fifth and sixth generation rig assets become available for sale."

Let me just talk about where I think the market is right now. I think that after all these years of low interest rates and quantitative easing, what we have is markets, both fixed income and equity markets, that are priced for perfection. In -- stocks are almost at new highs. NASDAQ reached new high last week. The S&P is within a shot of it. Today, as we speak, the market multiple is, I don't know, 16, 17, 18x earnings. When you look at companies that are auctioned in the private equity world, what I would say is that 10 is the new 6. And what that means is in the old days, when companies would trade at an EBITDA multiple of 6x, today, that number is 10x. And yes, interest rates are low, but still, it seems to me that even though you can finance at lower rates, there just isn't enough room for return for the equity holder at these kinds of valuations. So my guess is that for the time being, businesses look like they're priced too high for us. Now one other thing that I always remember is that the world is cyclical. And it's easy to lose sight of that because we're now in -- firmly in year 6 of an upcycle for equity prices. But at some point in time, something will happen. People will lose all the confidence that they have, and my guess is that opportunities will present itself. Like I said for offshore drilling, it could be a while. And offshore drilling, in the next several quarters, in the market for businesses, it could be in the next several years. But I'd rather be patient and get a good business at an attractive price rather than lose patience and buy a business at too high a price."

When you drill for oil in shale, it can be as little as 2 months between the time that you make the investment decision until the time that you start production. And so it's relatively -- and you also have a very good sense of exactly how much oil you're going to be able to produce from that shale well. So with prices at $59 a barrel, you're able to pretty effectively hedge your first several years of production, which makes all the difference in terms of the economics of your well. So there's -- remember, so with onshore shale production, it's 2 months from the time you decide to drill until the time you're producing. For offshore drilling, it's 2 to 5 years from the time you decide to drill until the time that you can be producing. So the offshore guys are much, much less concerned about the spot price for oil and much more concerned about what the trend is going to be. They don't know nearly as well how much oil they're going to be able to produce from that well that they may drill in the next year. And they've got to do all manner of completion. So they don't know exactly when the oil is going to be produced. So it's much more difficult for them to hedge their production than it is for the onshore shale people."

I hope that you've all had a chance to look at our press release, which was distributed earlier this morning. 
Loews reported income from continuing operations for the first quarter of $109 million compared to $265 million in the first quarter of 2014. The quarter's results were significantly impacted by an impairment charge at Diamond Offshore of $158 million after tax related to the carrying value of 8 of its older drilling rigs. David Edelson, our CFO, will provide more details on the charge and key earnings drivers later in the call. 
I want to start today by looking at Loews' $5.5 billion portfolio of cash and investments. Obviously, this is a lot of cash, but that's nothing out of the ordinary for Loews. Over the years, maintaining a sizable liquidity position has given us the freedom to deploy our capital opportunistically in order to create value for our shareholders over the long term. We've done this by using our cash to invest in our subsidiaries, to add new businesses and to repurchase our shares. Let's briefly examine each of these levers.
Two subsidiaries we have provided funding for over the year -- over the last few years have been Boardwalk and Loews Hotels. At Boardwalk, when attractive capital markets funding has not been available or when flexible forms of financing are required, Loews has stepped in and provided bridge financing. We work closely with Boardwalk's management team to hone their financial -- financing plans, and our cash position enables us to utilize parent company capital in projects with attractive risk-adjusted returns for both Loews and Boardwalk.
At Loews Hotels, over the past 6 months, the parent company has invested approximately $300 million to finance hotel acquisitions. Some of these investments have been in the form of equity bridge financing, which we anticipate will be returned as Loews Hotels brings in outside equity partners. We like this model, and we intend to use it going forward to acquire additional hotels.
In addition to enabling us to invest in our subsidiaries, a high level of liquidity allows us to move quickly and decisively when considering an acquisition at the holding company level. We're actively seeking to diversify our portfolio of businesses, but we don't want to rush into a deal simply because we have the funds available. Current valuations for companies and assets don't lend themselves to the kind of equity returns we want. We're looking for the right deal at the right price, either a company with good cash-on-cash returns and strong secular growth trends or distressed undervalued assets at an advantageous entry point in the cycle.
And finally, let's not forget about share repurchases, which remain an important way that Loews creates value for shareholders. 
On our call last November, I discussed in detail the various metrics we use when considering share repurchases decision, including the sum of the parts calculation. Over the last year, Loews spent almost $700 million of its cash, buying back almost 16 million shares. As we've said before, money doesn't burn a hole in our pockets. While we acknowledge that cash can be a drag on Loews' short-term returns, we feel that having the flexibility to be opportunistic and not rely on financing markets has served our shareholders very well over the long term.
Now let's look at some highlights from our subsidiaries. Let's start with Diamond Offshore. Loews has been in the offshore drilling business for more than 25 years. In that time, we've learned one thing with absolute certainty: Offshore drilling is a cyclical business, and therefore, Diamond is managed accordingly.
Nine years ago, when others were paying top dollar for new drilling rigs, Diamond began returning capital to shareholders by paying special dividends. Since January of '06, Diamond has paid over $41 per share in regular and special dividends, returning more than $5.7 billion to shareholders over that time. 
At the current cyclical debt -- as this current cyclical downturn accelerated, however, Diamond decided not to pay a special dividend. Instead, the company elected to retain cash in order to maintain Diamond's financial strength and to position the company to be ready to act if rig acquisition opportunities presented themselves.
While Diamond has been able to secure long-term contracts for its newest deepwater rigs, prospects have been far more challenging for its mid-water fleet. Diamond expects newer rigs to continue to compete aggressively against lower spec units. As a result of the increased competition and dramatically reduced rig chartering opportunities for mid-water rigs this quarter, Diamond decided to cold stack or scrap 8 of those rigs that have no foreseeable employment prospects.
We have no doubt that Diamond will withstand the cyclical downturn, and we hope and expect that the company will emerge having found opportunities to acquire good assets at attractive prices. But as of today, we're not aware of any distressed assets available for sale at prices even close to a price we'd be willing to pay. Hopefully, that situation will change in the next several quarters. And when it does, Diamond will be ready.
Now let's turn to CNA. The company had a good quarter, producing an 18% year-over-year jump in net operating income. The results were helped by lower catastrophe losses and strong investment income from limited partnerships. More importantly, management continues to focus on margin improvement in its core P&C business. While there's more work to be done, we're pleased with CNA's steady progress. 
For the coming year, CNA will be operating in a market where rate increases are likely to be relatively modest and investment income will be constrained by the low interest rate environment.  CNA will remain focused on improving its underwriting capabilities in its Commercial segment, maintaining its leadership position in its Specialty segment and prudently managing its long-term care book of business.
At Boardwalk, over the last 15 months, the company has secured an extraordinary $1.6 billion in organic capital projects. These projects are backed by long-term agreements that are expected to generate double-digit unlevered returns once completed in the next 2 to 4 years. Since the projects will not come online immediately, Boardwalk raised $116 million in equity to help fund its capital expenditures this year and to manage its leverage. Maintaining its credit quality will be a key focus for Boardwalk during the build-out phase of these projects.
Last but not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. The hits just keep on coming for our hotel company. Since the beginning of the year, the company opened the Loews Chicago Hotel and has completed the acquisition of the 155-room Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco, which has been proudly renamed the Loews Regency San Francisco. New additions to the hotel company continue to be well-received, especially our newest hotel in Orlando, the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, which has been going gangbusters since it opened a year ago in March. If you haven't visited one of our hotels in Orlando, you should.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."

Loews' net income, which reflects the impact of a $206 million loss from discontinued operations in last year's first quarter, was up year-over-year. As a reminder, last year's loss from discontinued operations related primarily to the sale by CNA Financial of its life insurance subsidiary.
CNA contributed $202 million to Loews' income from continuing operations in this year's first quarter as compared to $176 million in the first quarter of 2014. These amounts exclude after tax realized gains of $8 million this year versus $24 million last year. 
The increase in CNA's net operating income was attributable to 2 main factors: number one, higher net investment income, driven by limited partnership investments; and two, higher P&C underwriting income, driven by lower catastrophe losses and improved noncat accident year results.
During the first quarter, CNA paid a $2 per share special dividend and a $0.25 per share regular quarterly dividend. At quarter end, after the payment by CNA of over $600 million of shareholder dividends, the company's capital and liquidity positions remained rock-solid.
Diamond Offshore contributed a loss of $126 million to our first quarter net income, down from an earnings contribution of $69 million last year. Diamond's first quarter results include an after tax impairment charge of $319 million, of which $158 million flowed through our net income. The charge resulted from Diamond's decision to impair 8 of its lower spec rigs, 7 mid-water semi-submersibles and an older drillship. Diamond announced that it plans to scrap 3 of the 7 mid-water units being impaired.
Additionally, Diamond booked a restructuring charge in this year's first quarter that reduced Loews' net income by $2.3 million. Absent the impairment and restructuring charges, Diamond's contribution to our net income declined from $69 million last year to $34 million this year. Lower rig utilization negatively affected rig operating income. In addition, depreciation expense was up from last year because of new rigs having been placed into service.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $25 million to Loews' net income during Q1 2015, up from a loss of $18 million last year. The loss last year included a $55 million after tax charge related to the write-off of all capitalized costs associated with the former Bluegrass project. Absent this charge, Boardwalk's contribution to our earnings decreased, primarily due to lower EBITDA and higher depreciation. The EBITDA decline stemmed from lower revenue from transportation, park-and-loan and storage, attributable in large part to warmer winter weather this year versus last in Boardwalk's market areas.
During the first quarter and into early April, Boardwalk sold 7 million common units under its equity distribution program. Net proceeds to Boardwalk were $116 million, including the General Partner contribution. Boardwalk sold equity to manage its capital ratios during a period when it is spending capital on projects that are not yet in service and, thus, not producing EBITDA. In keeping with its focus on capital management, we anticipate that Boardwalk will draw down its $300 million subordinated debt facility from Loews later this year. 
Loews Hotels generated net income of $5 million during the first quarter, up from $3 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA, which you can find in the earnings snapshot posted on our website, was $35 million during the first quarter versus $24 million in the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by Loews Hotels properties at Universal Orlando, including the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, as well as improved performance at various other properties. 
As Jim mentioned, during the first 4 months of 2015, we invested over $300 million in Loews Hotels to finance the all-equity acquisitions of the Loews Chicago and Loews Regency San Francisco hotels. Over time, Loews Hotels will likely put leverage on these properties and may, if appropriate, bring in equity partners.
Turning to the parent company. After tax investment income declined from $34 million in 2014 to $19 million in 2015, driven by reduced performance from equities, partially offset by higher returns from the parent company limited partnership portfolio.
At quarter end, cash and investments totaled $5.5 billion as compared to $5.1 billion at the end of December. Over $4 billion of our cash and investments were in treasury bills and notes and other short-term instruments, which, given the current interest rate environment, earn us very little, but provide strong liquidity.
We received $567 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which broke down as follows: $545 million in regular and special dividends from CNA; $9 million from Diamond; and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
As for returning capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $71 million, buying back 1.8 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $24 million during the quarter, buying just over 900,000 shares of Diamond stock, taking our ownership to 53.1%.
I will now hand the call back to Jim."

As I said 6 months ago, trouble is opportunity when it comes to the offshore drilling market. The market is certainly challenged, but Diamond is positioned to withstand this downturn, and hopefully, seize the opportunities as they arise. CNA is improving its underwriting performance and maintaining a stellar balance sheet. Diamond is repositioning its operations to align with the evolution of the U.S. natural gas marketplace. And Loews Hotels is adding to its presence in key markets with exciting potential. 
We continue our commitment to pursuing a value-oriented investment strategy and to creating a diverse portfolio of solid businesses. As always, Loews is focused on managing capital to achieve the best long-term return for our shareholders. We found that discipline capital management, coupled with a diverse portfolio of businesses, is an exceptional way to create value over time.

Let me just talk about where I think the market is right now. I think that after all these years of low interest rates and quantitative easing, what we have is markets, both fixed income and equity markets, that are priced for perfection. In -- stocks are almost at new highs. The NASDAQ reached new highs last week. The S&P is within a shot of it. Today, as we speak, the market multiple is, I don't know, 16, 17, 18x earnings. When you look at companies that are auctioned in the private equity world, what I would say is that 10 is the new 6. And what that means is in the old days, when companies would trade at an EBITDA multiple of 6x, today, that number is 10x. And yes, interest rates are low, but still, it seems to me that even though you can finance at low rates, there just isn't enough room for return for the equity holder at these kinds of valuations. So my guess is that for the time being, businesses look like they're priced too high for us. Now one other thing that I always remember is that the world is cyclical. And it's easy to lose sight of that because we're now in -- firmly in year 6 of an upcycle for equity prices. But at some point in time, something will happen. People will lose all the confidence that they have, and my guess is that opportunities will present itself. Like I said for offshore drilling, it could be a while. In offshore drilling, if [ph] the next several quarters in the market for businesses, it could be in the next several years. But I'd rather be patient and get a good business at an attractive price rather than lose patience and buy a business at too high a price."

And so it's relatively -- and you also have a very good sense of exactly how much oil you're going to be able to produce from that shale well. So with prices at $59 a barrel, you're able to pretty effectively hedge your first several years of production, which makes all the difference in terms of the economics of your well. So there's -- remember, so with onshore shale production, it's 2 months from the time you decide to drill until the time you're producing. For offshore drilling, it's 2 to 5 years from the time you decide to drill until the time that you can be producing. So the offshore guys are much, much less concerned about the spot price for oil and much more concerned about what the trend is going to be. They don't know nearly as well how much oil they're going to be able to produce from that well that they may drill in the next year. And they've got to do all manner of completion.

What you have have noticed without the help of our lease, however, and what I want to acknowledge up front, is the significant decline in the share prices of Diamond Offshore and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners. Since last quarter's remarks, Diamond share price has declined by nearly 35% and Boardwalk by about 20%. While we're certainly not happy with these declines as shareholders and there's capital allocators, our job is to look ahead and assess future opportunities for Diamond and Boardwalk.
Yes, the equity markets are currently punishing their stocks and those of their peers. But as we look to the future, we're positive about Diamond and its customers need to pursue offshore drilling program. And we believe the changing gas flows in the U.S., combined with the Renaissance of U.S. manufacturing and a transition from coal-to-gas Power Generation, bode well for Boardwalk. Both Diamond and Boardwalk are focusing on taking strategic actions in order to better position themselves for future growth and both companies certainly have the financial strength to undertake these actions.
I suspect you're wondering if Loews intends to buy Boardwalk and Boardwalk shares at these depressed prices. As those of you who have been listening to our calls for any amount of time know with regard to share purchases, we'll let our actions speak for themselves, and we will do so again today.
What I can tell you is that since April 1, we have repurchased 9.1 million shares of Loews' common stock for $360 million and that year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for $432 million. While we don't publicly announce our share repurchase plans, we have talked about how we think about buybacks. And that thinking hasn't changed. We've always believed that repurchasing our shares at prices below intrinsic value enhances the long-term value of Loews' common stock. And from the put your money where your mouth is department, our recent action certainly show that we believe our shares are good value.
Now let's take a look at each of our businesses. CNA's earnings comparisons during the second quarter was affected by a number of one-time items, which David will explain shortly. Operationally, however, CNA continues to make progress in improving its underwriting results. Year-to-date through the second quarter, the company's loss ratio, excluding catastrophe losses and prior year development, was 61.7%, compared to 62.8% for the full year 2014 and 63.8% for the full year 2013, a 2 percentage point improvement over 2 years.
A key driver of CNA's improved underwriting performance is its focus on deepening its industry specific technical expertise. CNA's started growth efforts in specific consumer focused segments, such as technology, professional services and financial institution, allows CNA to more accurately assess and price risk. Additionally, CNA continues to manage risk and volatility across the company and maintains a very strong capital position. Although there's more work to be done, we believe CNA has made great strides and is positioned well for better and more consistent underwriting profitability.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Despite this headwind, the company had a good quarter, primarily due to the expense controls that were put in place last year. Even as the competitive environment for the offshore drilling industry continues to be adversely affected by the trifecta have the steep drop in oil and prices, a reduction in E&P budget and a wave of new rig deliveries, Diamond's marketing efforts have paid off. The company recently signed an agreement with Woodside Petroleum for its newly rebuilt Ocean Apex to drill in Australia. This is an 18-month contract beginning in the first half of 2016 at a rate of $285,000 per day.
Additionally, Diamond has taken delivery of the Ocean BlackLion, the last of its new drillship. The Ocean BlackLion will be mobilized through the Gulf of Mexico and should begin working for half before the end of this year. Diamond's ultra-deepwater harsh environment semisubmersible, the Ocean Great White, is scheduled to join the fleet in 2016 and has an initial 3-year contract with BP in South Australia.
As a reminder, all 4 of Diamond's 6 generation drillships and the Ocean Great White are contracted into 2019 themes and 2020. We have no doubt that Diamond will withstand this tough cyclical downturn. We hope and expect that the company will find opportunities to take advantage of these market conditions to profitably grow its fleet.
Moving on to Boardwalk. The U.S. shale revolution has been a transformative force in Boardwalk's business. The increased shale production has disrupted natural gas flows and created recontracting challenges for Boardwalk and for the rest of the industry. More recently, however, the shale revolution has opened the doors to a number of organic growth opportunities. In fact, Boardwalk has been able to secure an impressive $1.6 billion in organic growth project since 2014.
Over the past few years, the growth of low-cost gas production in the U.S. has unleashed an abundant supply of natural gas liquids, precipitating a rapid extension of petrochemical manufacturing along the Gulf Coast. And Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, our natural gas transportation and storage company, is benefiting from this industrial expansion. The increased demand from Louisiana's industrial corridor has also been a boom for Boardwalk's Gulf South Natural Gas Pipeline, a natural gas that Gulf South transports to Louisiana's petrochemical plant not only powers them, but also serves as a building block for the products they produce.
With the company's recent agreement to service new ethane cracker and with the addition of the Evangeline pipeline late last year, Boardwalk continues to focus on growing its natural gas liquids and dry gas service offerings to capitalize on burgeoning petrochemical demand in Louisiana. And last, but certainly not the least, let's turn to Loews Hotel.
Loews Hotels posted another good quarter. Over the past few years, our hotel company has successfully focused on profitable growth and operational excellence. From 2012 through 2015, Loews Hotels added 8 hotels across the country. These additions to the hotel network have contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. The company currently has one hotel under construction, the Loews Safar Falls Resort. It's this hotel in Orlando, which is scheduled to open in 2016. When it opens, the 1,000-room hotel will result in our having 5,200 room in Orlando. Not to tempt the fates, but our hotel investment in Orlando over the past 15 years rank very high in the pantheon of outstanding worldwide hotel investment.
Before I turn the call over to David, I want to add that we have great confidence in the long-term prospects for each of our businesses. We recognize that diversification may mean that not all of our subsidiaries will be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, we have found that disciplined capital management, coupled with a diverse portfolio of businesses, is an exceptional way to create value over time. And now over to David."

For this year's second quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $170 million or $0.46 per share, down from $303 million or $0.79 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Lower earnings at CNA Financial",989,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. For this year's second quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $170 million or $0.46 per share, down from $303 million or $0.79 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Lower earnings at CNA Financial drove the decline, as well as reduced earnings from the parent company's Investment Portfolio.
As I will discuss more fully, unusual items affected the year-over-year earnings comparison at CNA. Our second quarter net income was up from last year. The second quarter of 2014 included after-tax losses from discontinued operation of $187 million attributable to our disposition of HighMount Exploration & Production.
CNA Financial contributed $124 million to Loews' income from continuing operation in this year's second quarter, as compared to $235 million in the second quarter of 2014. The year-over-year comparison wasn't nearly as negative as it first appears. 2 unusual items accentuated the year-over-year decline. Last year, CNA's earnings contribution to Loews included a $50 million non-recurring benefit from a postretirement medical plan curtailment. This year, CNA's earnings contribution was reduced by $49 million attributable to a retroactive reinsurance charge related to the Loss Portfolio Transfer entered into by CNA and national indemnity in 2010.
As a reminder, the Loss Portfolio Transfer provides CNA with $4 billion in reinsurance coverage for legacy, asbestos and environmental pollution liability. This quarter's charge resulted in a deferred retroactive reinsurance gain, which will be recognized back into CNA's earnings in future periods as losses are paid by national indemnity under the Loss Portfolio Transfer.
These 2 unusual items comprise a $99 million year-over-year negative swing in CNA's contribution to Loews' net income. Other factors contributing to the earnings decline from CNA were lower income from the company's Life & Group segment, as well as from limited partnership investments. Offsetting positives included favorable net prior year development this quarter versus adverse development last year and better current accident year underwriting results, which Jim previously mentioned.
Diamond Offshore contributed $45 million to income from continuing operations, up slightly when compared to its contribution of $42 million for the same period last year. Diamond's results reflect the cold stacking or sale of 16 rigs since the second quarter of 2014, offset in part by newbuild drillships and other high-spec assets going to work. Contract drilling revenues were down 5%, but Diamond's expense control initiatives enabled it to reduce contract drilling expenses by 13%.
Interest expense and depreciation were up versus prior year, however, because of the delivery of the newbuild assets. Bottom line, Diamond itself delivered second quarter 2015 net income essentially flat with prior year. As a reminder, we have increased our percentage ownership of Diamond from 51% to 53% since last year, which explains the higher net income contribution despite flat net income at Diamond.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $12 million to income from continuing operations in the second quarter as compared to $17 million last year. While Boardwalk's operating revenues were up slightly, this increase was more than offset by higher cost, including depreciation and interest expense. Boardwalk's transportation revenues were up because growth projects more than offset contract explorations. In addition, transportation revenues benefited from the ongoing Gulf South rate case and the receipt by Boardwalk of insurance proceeds related to a business interruption claim.
Consistent with the first quarter, parking loan and storage revenues were down year-over-year. The timing of maintenance activities drove the increased in operation and maintenance expenses. Also, the prior year quarter included a one-time benefit from a legal settlement.
To date, Boardwalk has not drawn down on its $300 million subordinated loan agreement with Loews. We anticipate the company will draw the full $300 million by the end of 2015. 
Loews Hotels contributed $8 million to our second quarter income from continuing operations, up from $5 million last year. You will note a large jump in revenues from last year's second quarter. Loews Hotels have added 5 wholly owned properties to the chain since second quarter 2014, which together with growth at existing wholly owned hotels, accounts for the sizable revenue increase. Of course, the company's operating expenses, interest expense and depreciation are also up for the same reason. The year-over-year growth in pretax and net income is attributable mainly to the joint venture hotels in Orlando, which continued to perform extremely well.
Adjusted EBITDA, which you can find in the earnings snapshot posted on our website, was $55 million during the second quarter versus $32 million in the prior year. The 5 new wholly owned properties, as well as Cabana Bay in Orlando, accounted for the preponderance of the increase.
Turning to the parent company. After tax investment income declined from $30 million in 2014 to $7 million in 2015, driven by reduced performance from equities and limited partnership investments. At quarter end, cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion as compared to $5.5 billion at the end of March. 
During the quarter, parent company cash was used to repurchase shares of Loews' common stock and invest in Loews Hotels, which closed on the purchase of its San Francisco property and a 50% joint venture interest in its Orlando property. We received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which broke down as follows: $61 million from CNA; $9 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. 
During the first 6 months of the year, we received a total of $650 million in dividends from our subsidiaries compared to $512 million during the first half of 2014. As for returning capital to our shareholders, during the second quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $233 million buying back 5.8 million shares of our common stock. Subsequent to June 30, we have repurchased an additional 3.3 million shares for $127 million.
In total, since January 1, 2015, we have spent $432 million repurchasing almost 3% of our common stock. I will now hand the call back to Mary."

That in order to find a barrel of oil today, it's probably across the minimum of $70 a barrel to get that marginal barrel of oil that's needed. My guess is 5 years from now, it will be a bit higher than that. And I think what has to happen is the world has -- the world oil producers have to supply the 1 million barrels of growth, plus approximately 5 million barrels to the place the depletion from the world's productive capacity. So that 6 million barrels a day have to be found every year for the next 5 years or about 30 million barrels of new production. In order for the world to be able to produce that, even with a ran coming back on to the market in the not-too-distant future, I think it will take significantly higher oil prices. And 5 years from now, as it certainly reasonable to think that the price will be $70, $75, or $80 a barrel. That doesn't account for another wildcard, which is political instability. A lot of oil comes from the Middle East.

I hope you've had a chance to look at our press release, which was distributed earlier this morning. David Edelson, our CFO, will provide details on our second quarter earnings later in this call.
What you will have noticed without the help of our release, however, and what I want to acknowledge upfront is the significant decline in the share prices of Diamond Offshore and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners. Since last quarter's remarks, Diamond's share price has declined by nearly 35%, and Boardwalk's by about 20%. While we're certainly not happy with these declines as shareholders and as capital allocators, our job is to look ahead and assess future opportunities for Diamond and Boardwalk. Yes, the equity markets are currently punishing their stocks and those of their peers, but as we look to the future, we're positive about Diamond and its customer's need to pursue offshore drilling programs. And we believe the changing gas flows in the U.S., combined with the renaissance of U.S. manufacturing and the transition from coal- to gas-powered generation, bode well for Boardwalk. Both Diamond and Boardwalk are focusing on taking strategic actions in order to better position themselves for future growth, and both companies certainly have the financial strength to undertake these actions.
I suspect you're wondering if Loews intends to buy Diamond and Boardwalk shares at these depressed prices. As those of you who have been listening to our calls for any amount of time know, with regard to share purchases, we let our actions speak for themselves, and we will do so again today. What I can tell you is that, since April 1, we have repurchased 9.1 million shares of Loews common stock for $360 million and that, year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for $432 million. While we don't publicly announce our share repurchase plans, we have talked about how we think about buybacks, and that thinking hasn't changed. We've always believed that repurchasing our shares at prices below intrinsic value enhances the long-term value of Loews' common stock. And from the ""put your money where your mouth is"" department, our recent actions certainly show that we believe our shares are a good value.
Now let's take a look at each of our businesses.
CNA's earnings comparisons during the second quarter was affected by a number of onetime items, which David will explain shortly. Operationally, however, CNA continues to make progress in improving its underwriting results. Year-to-date through the second quarter, the company's loss ratio, excluding catastrophe losses and prior year development, was 61.7% compared to 62.8% for the full year 2014; and 63.8% for the full year 2013, a 2 percentage point improvement over 2 years.
A key driver of CNA's improved underwriting performance is its focus on deepening its industry-specific technical expertise. CNA's targeted growth efforts in specific consumer-focused segments such as technology, professional services and financial institutions allows CNA to more accurately assess and price risk. Additionally, CNA continues to manage risk and volatility across the company and maintains a very strong capital position. Although there's more work to be done, we believe CNA has made great strides and is positioned well for better and more consistent underwriting profitability.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Despite stiff headwinds, the company had a good quarter, primarily due to the expense controls that were put in place last year. Even as the competitive environment for the offshore drilling industry continues to be adversely affected by the trifecta of a steep drop in oil prices, a reduction in E&P budgets and a wave of new rig deliveries, Diamond's marketing efforts have paid off. The company recently signed an agreement with Woodside Petroleum for its newly rebuilt Ocean Apex to drill in Australia. This is an 18-month contract beginning in the first half of 2016 at a rate of $285,000 per day. Additionally, Diamond has taken delivery of the Ocean BlackLion, the last of its new drillships. The Ocean BlackLion will be mobilized for the Gulf of Mexico and should be working -- begin working for Hess before the end of this year. Diamond's ultra-deepwater harsh environment semisubmersible, the Ocean GreatWhite, is scheduled to join the fleet in 2016 and has an initial 3-year contract with BP in South Australia. As a reminder, all 4 of Diamond's sixth-generation drillships and the Ocean GreatWhite are contracted into 2019 and 2020. We have no doubt that Diamond will withstand this tough cyclical downturn. We hope and expect that the company will find opportunities to take advantage of these market conditions to profitably grow its fleet.
Moving on to Boardwalk. The U.S. shale revolution has been a transformative force in Boardwalk's business. Increased shale production has disrupted natural gas flows and created recontracting challenges for Boardwalk and for the rest of the industry. More recently, however, the shale revolution has opened the door to a number of organic growth opportunities. In fact, Boardwalk has been able to secure an impressive $1.6 billion in organic growth projects since 2014.
Over the past few years, the growth of low-cost gas production in the U.S. has unleashed an abundant supply of natural gas liquids, precipitating a rapid expansion of petrochemical manufacturing along the Gulf Coast. And Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, our natural gas liquids transportation and storage company, is benefiting from this industrial expansion. The increased demand from Louisiana's industrial corridor has also been a boom for Boardwalk's Gulf South natural gas pipeline. The natural gas that Gulf South transports to Louisiana's petrochemical plants not only powers them but also serves as a building block for the products they produce. With the company's recent agreement to service Sasol's new ethane cracker and with the addition of the Evangeline pipeline late last year, Boardwalk continues to focus on growing its natural gas liquids and dry gas service offerings to capitalize on burgeoning petrochemical demand in Louisiana.
And last but certainly not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels posted another good quarter. Over the past few years, our hotel company has successfully focused on profitable growth and operational excellence. From 2012 through 2015, Loews Hotels added 8 hotels across the country. These additions to the hotel network have contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. The company currently has one hotel under construction, the Loews Sapphire Falls resort, its fifth hotel in Orlando which is scheduled to open in 2016. When it opens, the 1,000-room hotel will result in our having 5,200 rooms in Orlando. Not to tempt the fates, but our hotel investments in Orlando over the past 15 years rank very high in the pantheon of outstanding worldwide hotel investments.
Before I turn the call over to David, I want to add that we have great confidence in the long-term prospects for each of our businesses. We recognize that diversification may mean that not all of our subsidiaries will be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, we have found that disciplined capital management, coupled with a diverse portfolio of businesses, is an exceptional way to create value over time.
And now over to you, David."
285930,305674996,846622,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2015",2015-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim. And good morning.For this year's second quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $170 million or $0.46 per share, down from $303 million or $0.79 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Lower earnings at CNA Financia",991,"Thank you, Jim. And good morning.
For this year's second quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $170 million or $0.46 per share, down from $303 million or $0.79 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Lower earnings at CNA Financial drove the decline, as well as reduced earnings from the parent company's investment portfolio. As I will discuss more fully, unusual items affected the year-over-year earnings comparison at CNA.
Our second quarter net income was up from last year. The second quarter of 2014 included after-tax losses from discontinued operations of $187 million attributable to our disposition of HighMount Exploration & Production.
CNA Financial contributed $124 million to Loews' income from continuing operation in this year's second quarter, as compared to $235 million in the second quarter of 2014. The year-over-year comparison wasn't nearly as negative as it first appears. 2 unusual items accentuated the year-over-year decline. Last year, CNA's earnings contribution to Loews included a $50 million nonrecurring benefit from a postretirement medical plan curtailment. This year, CNA's earnings contribution was reduced by $49 million attributable to a retroactive reinsurance charge related to the loss portfolio transfer entered into by CNA and National Indemnity in 2010. As a reminder, the loss portfolio transfer provides CNA with $4 billion in reinsurance coverage for legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities. This quarter's charge resulted in a deferred retroactive reinsurance gain, which will be recognized back into CNA's earnings in future periods as losses are paid by National Indemnity under the loss portfolio transfer.
These 2 unusual items comprise a $99 million year-over-year negative swing in CNA's contribution to Loews' net income.
Other factors contributing to the earnings decline from CNA were lower income from the company's Life & Group segment, as well as from limited partnership investments. Offsetting positives included favorable net prior year development this quarter versus adverse development last year and better current-accident-year underwriting results, which Jim previously mentioned.
Diamond Offshore contributed $45 million to income from continuing operations, up slightly when compared to its contribution of $42 million for the same period last year. Diamond's results reflect the cold stacking or sale of 16 rigs since the second quarter of 2014, offset in part by newbuild drillships and other high-spec assets going to work. Contract drilling revenues were down 5%, but Diamond's expense-control initiatives enabled it to reduce contract drilling expenses by 13%. Interest expense and depreciation were up versus prior year, however, because of the delivery of the newbuild assets.
Bottomline, Diamond itself delivered second quarter 2015 net income essentially flat with prior year. As a reminder, we have increased our percentage ownership of Diamond from 51% to 53% since last year, which explains the higher net income contribution despite flat net income at Diamond.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $12 million to income from continuing operations in the second quarter, as of -- compared to $17 million last year. While Boardwalk's operating revenues were up slightly, this increase was more than offset by higher costs, including depreciation and interest expense. Boardwalk's transportation revenues were up because growth projects more than offset contract expirations. In addition, transportation revenues benefited from the ongoing Gulf South rate case and the receipt by Boardwalk of insurance proceeds related to a business interruption claim. Consistent with the first quarter, park-and-loan and storage revenues were down year-over-year.
The timing of maintenance activities drove the increase in operation and maintenance expenses. Also, the prior year quarter included a onetime benefit from a legal settlement.
To date, Boardwalk has not drawn down on its $300 million subordinated loan agreement with Loews. We anticipate the company will draw the full $300 million by the end of 2015.
Loews Hotels contributed $8 million to our second quarter income from continuing operations, up from $5 million last year. You will note a large jump in revenues from last year's second quarter. Loews Hotels have added 5 wholly owned properties to the chain since second quarter 2014, which together with growth at existing wholly owned hotels accounts for the sizable revenue increase. Of course, the company's operating expenses interest expense and depreciation are also up for the same reason.
The year-over-year growth in pretax and net income is attributable mainly to the joint venture hotels in Orlando, which continued to perform extremely well. Adjusted EBITDA, which you can find in the earnings snapshot posted on our website, was $55 million during the second quarter versus $32 million in the prior year. The 5 new wholly owned properties, as well as Cabana Bay in Orlando, accounted for the preponderance of the increase.
Turning to the parent company.
After-tax investment income declined from $30 million in 2014 to $7 million in 2015, driven by reduced performance from equities and limited partnership investments. At quarter end, cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion as a -- as of -- as compared to $5.5 billion at the end of March. During the quarter, parent company cash was used to repurchase shares of Loews common stock; and invest in Loews Hotels, which closed on the purchase of its San Francisco property and a 50% joint venture interest in its Atlanta property.
We received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which broke down as follows: $61 million from CNA; $9 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. During the first 6 months of the year, we received a total of $650 million in dividends from our subsidiaries compared to $512 million during the first half of 2014. As for returning capital to our shareholders, during the second quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $233 million buying back 5.8 million shares of our common stock. Subsequent to June 30, we have repurchased an additional 3.3 million shares for $127 million. In total, since January 1, 2015, we have spent $432 million repurchasing almost 3% of our common stock.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

My guess is, 5 years from now, it will be a bit higher than that. And I think what has to happen is the world has -- the world oil producers have to supply the 1 million barrels of growth, plus approximately 5 million barrels to replace the depletion from the world's productive capacity. So that 6 million barrels a day have to be found every year for the next 5 years, or about 30 million barrels of new production. In order for the world to be able to produce that, even with a rand coming back on to the market in the not-too-distant future, I think it will take significantly higher oil prices. And it's, 5 years from now, I think it's certainly reasonable to think that the price will be $70, $75 or $80 a barrel. That doesn't account for another wildcard, which is political instability. A lot of oil comes from the Middle East.

What you will have noticed without the help of our release, however, and what I want to acknowledge upfront is the significant decline in the share prices of Diamond Offshore and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners. Since last quarter's remarks, Diamond's share price has declined by nearly 35%, and Boardwalk's by about 20%. While we're certainly not happy with these declines as shareholders and as capital allocators, our job is to look ahead and assess future opportunities for Diamond and Boardwalk. Yes, the equity markets are currently punishing their stocks and those of their peers, but as we look to the future, we're positive about Diamond and its customer's need to pursue offshore drilling programs. And we believe the changing gas flows in the U.S., combined with the renaissance of U.S. manufacturing and the transition from coal- to gas-powered generation, bode well for Boardwalk. Both Diamond and Boardwalk are focusing on taking strategic actions in order to better position themselves for future growth, and both companies certainly have the financial strength to undertake these actions.
I suspect you're wondering if Loews intends to buy Diamond and Boardwalk shares at these depressed prices. As those of you who have been listening to our calls for any amount of time know, with regard to share purchases, we let our actions speak for themselves, and we will do so again today. What I can tell you is that, since April 1, we have repurchased 9.1 million shares of Loews common stock for $360 million and that, year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for $432 million. While we don't publicly announce our share repurchase plans, we have talked about how we think about buybacks, and that thinking hasn't changed. We've always believed that repurchasing our shares at prices below intrinsic value enhances the long-term value of Loews' common stock. And from the ""put your money where your mouth is"" department, our recent actions certainly show that we believe our shares are a good value.
Now let's take a look at each of our businesses.
CNA's earnings comparisons during the second quarter was affected by a number of onetime items, which David will explain shortly. Operationally, however, CNA continues to make progress in improving its underwriting results. Year-to-date through the second quarter, the company's loss ratio, excluding catastrophe losses and prior year development, was 61.7% compared to 62.8% for the full year 2014; and 63.8% for the full year 2013, a 2 percentage point improvement over 2 years.
A key driver of CNA's improved underwriting performance is its focus on deepening its industry-specific technical expertise. CNA's targeted growth efforts in specific consumer-focused segments such as technology, professional services and financial institutions allows CNA to more accurately assess and price risk. Additionally, CNA continues to manage risk and volatility across the company and maintains a very strong capital position. Although there's more work to be done, we believe CNA has made great strides and is positioned well for better and more consistent underwriting profitability.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Despite stiff headwinds, the company had a good quarter, primarily due to the expense controls that were put in place last year. Even as the competitive environment for the offshore drilling industry continues to be adversely affected by the trifecta of a steep drop in oil prices, a reduction in E&P budgets and a wave of new rig deliveries, Diamond's marketing efforts have paid off. The company recently signed an agreement with Woodside Petroleum for its newly rebuilt Ocean Apex to drill in Australia. This is an 18-month contract beginning in the first half of 2016 at a rate of $285,000 per day. Additionally, Diamond has taken delivery of the Ocean BlackLion, the last of its new drillships. The Ocean BlackLion will be mobilized for the Gulf of Mexico and should be working -- begin working for Hess before the end of this year. Diamond's ultra-deepwater harsh environment semisubmersible, the Ocean GreatWhite, is scheduled to join the fleet in 2016 and has an initial 3-year contract with BP in South Australia. As a reminder, all 4 of Diamond's sixth-generation drillships and the Ocean GreatWhite are contracted into 2019 and 2020. We have no doubt that Diamond will withstand this tough cyclical downturn. We hope and expect that the company will find opportunities to take advantage of these market conditions to profitably grow its fleet.
Moving on to Boardwalk. The U.S. shale revolution has been a transformative force in Boardwalk's business. Increased shale production has disrupted natural gas flows and created recontracting challenges for Boardwalk and for the rest of the industry. More recently, however, the shale revolution has opened the door to a number of organic growth opportunities. In fact, Boardwalk has been able to secure an impressive $1.6 billion in organic growth projects since 2014.
Over the past few years, the growth of low-cost gas production in the U.S. has unleashed an abundant supply of natural gas liquids, precipitating a rapid expansion of petrochemical manufacturing along the Gulf Coast. And Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, our natural gas liquids transportation and storage company, is benefiting from this industrial expansion. The increased demand from Louisiana's industrial corridor has also been a boom for Boardwalk's Gulf South natural gas pipeline. The natural gas that Gulf South transports to Louisiana's petrochemical plants not only powers them but also serves as a building block for the products they produce. With the company's recent agreement to service Sasol's new ethane cracker and with the addition of the Evangeline pipeline late last year, Boardwalk continues to focus on growing its natural gas liquids and dry gas service offerings to capitalize on burgeoning petrochemical demand in Louisiana.
And last but certainly not least, let's turn to Loews Hotels. Loews Hotels posted another good quarter. Over the past few years, our hotel company has successfully focused on profitable growth and operational excellence. From 2012 through 2015, Loews Hotels added 8 hotels across the country. These additions to the hotel network have contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. The company currently has one hotel under construction, the Loews Sapphire Falls resort, its fifth hotel in Orlando which is scheduled to open in 2016. When it opens, the 1,000-room hotel will result in our having 5,200 rooms in Orlando. Not to tempt the fates, but our hotel investments in Orlando over the past 15 years rank very high in the pantheon of outstanding worldwide hotel investments.
Before I turn the call over to David, I want to add that we have great confidence in the long-term prospects for each of our businesses. We recognize that diversification may mean that not all of our subsidiaries will be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, we have found that disciplined capital management, coupled with a diverse portfolio of businesses, is an exceptional way to create value over time.
And now over to you, David."

And good morning.For this year's second quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $170 million or $0.46 per share, down from $303 million or $0.79 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Lower earnings at CNA Financia",991,"Thank you, Jim. And good morning.
For this year's second quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $170 million or $0.46 per share, down from $303 million or $0.79 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Lower earnings at CNA Financial drove the decline, as well as reduced earnings from the parent company's investment portfolio. As I will discuss more fully, unusual items affected the year-over-year earnings comparison at CNA.
Our second quarter net income was up from last year. The second quarter of 2014 included after-tax losses from discontinued operations of $187 million attributable to our disposition of HighMount Exploration & Production.
CNA Financial contributed $124 million to Loews' income from continuing operation in this year's second quarter, as compared to $235 million in the second quarter of 2014. The year-over-year comparison wasn't nearly as negative as it first appears. 2 unusual items accentuated the year-over-year decline. Last year, CNA's earnings contribution to Loews included a $50 million nonrecurring benefit from a postretirement medical plan curtailment. This year, CNA's earnings contribution was reduced by $49 million attributable to a retroactive reinsurance charge related to the loss portfolio transfer entered into by CNA and National Indemnity in 2010. As a reminder, the loss portfolio transfer provides CNA with $4 billion in reinsurance coverage for legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities. This quarter's charge resulted in a deferred retroactive reinsurance gain, which will be recognized back into CNA's earnings in future periods as losses are paid by National Indemnity under the loss portfolio transfer.
These 2 unusual items comprise a $99 million year-over-year negative swing in CNA's contribution to Loews' net income.
Other factors contributing to the earnings decline from CNA were lower income from the company's Life & Group segment, as well as from limited partnership investments. Offsetting positives included favorable net prior year development this quarter versus adverse development last year and better current-accident-year underwriting results, which Jim previously mentioned.
Diamond Offshore contributed $45 million to income from continuing operations, up slightly when compared to its contribution of $42 million for the same period last year. Diamond's results reflect the cold stacking or sale of 16 rigs since the second quarter of 2014, offset in part by newbuild drillships and other high-spec assets going to work. Contract drilling revenues were down 5%, but Diamond's expense-control initiatives enabled it to reduce contract drilling expenses by 13%. Interest expense and depreciation were up versus prior year, however, because of the delivery of the newbuild assets.
Bottomline, Diamond itself delivered second quarter 2015 net income essentially flat with prior year. As a reminder, we have increased our percentage ownership of Diamond from 51% to 53% since last year, which explains the higher net income contribution despite flat net income at Diamond.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $12 million to income from continuing operations in the second quarter, as of -- compared to $17 million last year. While Boardwalk's operating revenues were up slightly, this increase was more than offset by higher costs, including depreciation and interest expense. Boardwalk's transportation revenues were up because growth projects more than offset contract expirations. In addition, transportation revenues benefited from the ongoing Gulf South rate case and the receipt by Boardwalk of insurance proceeds related to a business interruption claim. Consistent with the first quarter, park-and-loan and storage revenues were down year-over-year.
The timing of maintenance activities drove the increase in operation and maintenance expenses. Also, the prior year quarter included a onetime benefit from a legal settlement.
To date, Boardwalk has not drawn down on its $300 million subordinated loan agreement with Loews. We anticipate the company will draw the full $300 million by the end of 2015.
Loews Hotels contributed $8 million to our second quarter income from continuing operations, up from $5 million last year. You will note a large jump in revenues from last year's second quarter. Loews Hotels have added 5 wholly owned properties to the chain since second quarter 2014, which together with growth at existing wholly owned hotels accounts for the sizable revenue increase. Of course, the company's operating expenses interest expense and depreciation are also up for the same reason.
The year-over-year growth in pretax and net income is attributable mainly to the joint venture hotels in Orlando, which continued to perform extremely well. Adjusted EBITDA, which you can find in the earnings snapshot posted on our website, was $55 million during the second quarter versus $32 million in the prior year. The 5 new wholly owned properties, as well as Cabana Bay in Orlando, accounted for the preponderance of the increase.
Turning to the parent company.
After-tax investment income declined from $30 million in 2014 to $7 million in 2015, driven by reduced performance from equities and limited partnership investments. At quarter end, cash and investments totaled $5.1 billion as a -- as of -- as compared to $5.5 billion at the end of March. During the quarter, parent company cash was used to repurchase shares of Loews common stock; and invest in Loews Hotels, which closed on the purchase of its San Francisco property and a 50% joint venture interest in its Atlanta property.
We received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter, which broke down as follows: $61 million from CNA; $9 million from Diamond and $13 million from Boardwalk. During the first 6 months of the year, we received a total of $650 million in dividends from our subsidiaries compared to $512 million during the first half of 2014. As for returning capital to our shareholders, during the second quarter, we paid $23 million in cash dividends and spent $233 million buying back 5.8 million shares of our common stock. Subsequent to June 30, we have repurchased an additional 3.3 million shares for $127 million. In total, since January 1, 2015, we have spent $432 million repurchasing almost 3% of our common stock.
I will now hand the call back to Mary."

My guess is, 5 years from now, it will be a bit higher than that. And I think what has to happen is the world has -- the world oil producers have to supply the 1 million barrels of growth, plus approximately 5 million barrels to replace the depletion from the world's productive capacity. So that 6 million barrels a day have to be found every year for the next 5 years, or about 30 million barrels of new production. In order for the world to be able to produce that, even with Iran coming back on to the market in the not-too-distant future, I think it will take significantly higher oil prices. And in 5 years from now, I think it's certainly reasonable to think that the price will be $70, $75 or $80 a barrel. That doesn't account for another wildcard, which is political instability. A lot of oil comes from the Middle East. And we haven't -- while we have political instability in the Middle East, in certain places, we don't currently have that having a significant effect on oil production, but in the future, as we all know, anything can happen."

It's -- for me, it's a great amateur sport, but I would say my guess is there's a pretty good chance that they're going to get the proverbial ball over the goal line this year and allow for the exportation of oil from the United States. From my perspective, it certainly makes a lot of sense. Right now, we have a system that favors the refiners by making available to them oil at very cheap prices because it can't be exported. And instead, the refiners are exporting 3 to 4 million barrels a day of refined products, so all we're doing with our current system is subsidizing refineries and penalizing oil producers."

Since I'm not in the habit of ignoring the elephant in the room, I want to start today's discussion by focusing on the stock prices of Loews and our subsidiary. You certainly don't need me to tell you that the stock market performed terribly in the third quarter. Unfortunately, the stocks of our subsidiaries performed even worse. The S&P 500 was down about 7% in the third quarter. The Diamond was down more than 30% will. Boardwalk was down 19% and CNA was down 9%.
Loews' share price, whilst of course affected by these declines and performed on par with the S&P 500 for the quarter. In general, we believe that the stock market is undervaluing our shares, and those of our subsidiaries. Despite being frustrated, rather than complain, we look at this as an opportunity to great value for Loews shareholders by buying back our stock. And we did. Our lemonades from lemons attitude will not come as a shock for those of you who know us. We were happy to buyback 8.7 million shares of Loews stock in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've spent over $750 million buying back more than 19.6 million shares.
You might be asking yourself, why did the purchase more of our subsidiaries shares directly? It's simple. As I mentioned, we believe that all of our subsidiaries' shares are currently, undervalued in the market, when we purchased Loews shares, we were simultaneously buying all of our subsidiaries shares at a conglomerate discount, so we focused our lion's share of our buybacks on Loews stock to get what amounts to a doublt discount.
Let me spend a few moments on what might be driving the decline in our subsidiary shares. For our energy subsidiaries, the drop in their share prices is a function of the headwinds facing their respective markets. The Diamond share price has moved in line with its peer groups. The entire offshore drilling industry had a miserable year on the stock market and the mystery is ongoing. Unfortunately, the current fundamentals of the offshore drilling industry are rowdy as well. Offshore drilling rig day rates have been driven down due to a trifecta of challenging market conditions, namely 1, a steep drop in oil prices, 2, the reduction in oil companies exploration and production budgets and 3, a wave of new rig deliveries that began about 6 years ago. These conditions have called drilling contracts to be shortened, or renegotiated resulting in rigs being idled. Additionally, oil companies have the further canceled new drilling projects even with day rates currently at less than half of their peak levels oftentimes there are still no takers for the rate. These circumstances have created a difficult backdrop for the offshore drilling industry, to say the least. Not to in all of this and despite the doom and gloom, Diamond did perform well this quarter reporting strong earnings from the new drillship with very little downtime good cost management.
Since the start of this downcycle, I've been asked is offshore drilling coming back? My answer is an unequivocal yes. By some estimates, offshore oil productions supplies up to 30% of the world's oil. This is a significant percentage that cannot be replaced by convention onshore drilling or shale production. I believe that the lack of drilling now will so for an oil price recovery later when prices rise, which they will, Diamond's customers will return to exploring for new sources of production and while Diamond is mostly being affected by the cyclical downturn in the offshore drilling market with its conservative capitalization, it's strong liquidity position and the added bonus that all of the 6 generation rigs are contracted. I'm confident that the company will be able to weather the cycle and emerge well positioned for the rebound.
Turning to Boardwalk. Their stock was down but somewhat less  than the Al Arian index, which is a composite of energy infrastructure master limited partnerships. The index took a 25% nosedive in the third quarter as investors became concerned about ML distribution growth rates or as I'd like to call it the MLP treadmill. This is the very same treadmill that Boardwalk stepped off of about a year ago allowing its management team to focus on positioning the company for long-term growth and profitability. This longer horizon strategy has allowed Boardwalk to take advantage of the changing supply and demand dynamics in the natural gas market by connecting its network of natural gas pipelines and storage assets to new end-use markets without the dilutive effects a significant share issuance up low prices. Boardwalk's focus has bin on developing organic growth projects backed by long-term contracts. These projects promise to be great investment and are expected to provide Boardwalk with an unlevered double-digit rate of return on assets completed over the next 2 to 4 years. Even though the industry is in transition and the stock price is low we are bullish about Boardwalk's long-term prospects.
Finally, let's take a look at CNA. The company's stock is down a bit more than the 6% decline of its peer group. CNA had a solid third quarter, and to my mind, there does not seem to be a correlation between stock price and performance here. CNA's strategy continues to be to deliver improved underwriting margin and its commercial business is the strongest it's been in years while positive developments in the core PMC business were offset somewhat by reduced performance in the limited partnership portfolio, the underlying business is very strong.
Before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to reiterate why we remain positive on the long-term prospects of each of our subsidiaries. CNA is stronger than it's ever been. Its specialty business has always been a top performer and is the envy of the insurance industry while its commercial business has shown tremendous improvement and there's still room for more. 
As for Diamond Offshore, to say that it's operating in a very tough environment is an understatement. However, we've seen this movie before, and we know how it ends. That's why Diamond has maintained a strong balance sheet and worked hard to secure long-term contracts for its new build base there's no doubt that the company will weather the storm, and hopefully, grow in the process. 
Boardwalk has been able to capitalize on the changing supply and demand dynamics of the natural gas industry. The company is developing significant organic growth projects with outstanding rates of return that will be coming online in the next several years. 
And finally, Loews Hotels & Resorts have successfully focused on profitable growth and operational excellence. From 2012 through 2015 the hotel chain added 8 hotels across the country. These additions have contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. It's a trend that we hope to see continue.
At Loews, our actions are guided by our responsibility to our shareholders and our focus on creating long-term value. The strategies employed and steps taken by each of our subsidiaries have the same motivations and goals. So while our stock, and those of our subsidiaries maybe out of favor among some, you won't find us complaining. Rather you're more likely to find us repurchasing Loews stock and creating value for all of our shareholders.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to David."

In this year's third quarter, Lowe's reported income from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.50 per share, up slightly from $179 million or $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2014. The favorable ye",1100,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In this year's third quarter, Lowe's reported income from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.50 per share, up slightly from $179 million or $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2014. The favorable year-over-year variance stems from higher quarterly net income at Diamond and Boardwalk as well as higher net operating income at CNA. Offsetting these positive factors were realized investment losses at CNA versus realized gains in the prior year. 
On a net income basis, this year's third quarter was down from last year as last year's third quarter contained a gain from discontinued operations to reduce the previously recognized impairment charge from the sale of HighMount. For the 9 months ended September 30, income from continuing operations was $461 million or $1.25 per share down from $747 million or $1.94 per share in the prior year. Diamond and CNA drove the decrease, along with lower parent company investment income. 
Diamond booked rig impairments in both years with significantly larger impairments in 2015 than in 2014. Additionally, Diamond's rig operating income declined in 2015 because of reduced rig utilization, especially for the mid-water fleet, along with higher depreciation and interest expense. 
Numerous offsetting items impacted CNA's year-over-year year-to-date comparison, including lower LP income in 2015, a retroactive reinsurance charge in 2015, but not in 2014, higher favorable net prior year developments in 2015 than in 2014 and several other items. The net of all of these was a year-over-year income decline.
Year-to-date net income was up 20%. Last year's results included a $364 million after tax loss from discontinued operations, attributable to the HighMount disposition and CNA's sale of its slight business.
We ended this past quarter with book value per share of $52.52, total shareholders' equity of $18.7 billion and parent company cash investment of $4.8 billion against debt of $1.7 billion.
Let me now delve more deeply into our quarterly earnings. CNA contributed $190 million to our third quarter income before realized investor results up from $164 million last year. Note that last year's third quarter included a $31 million hit to CNA's earnings contribution associated with the sale of flight business. CNA benefited in Q3 from improved year underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year development. The company's combined ratio before catastrophes and development in its core PMC business improved almost 1 point to 95.5%. Favorable prior year development lowered the calendar year combined ratio to 85.7, a 10.4 point improvement from last year's third quarter. It's encouraging to see CNA continuing its year-over-year improvement in underwriting margin. On a year-to-date basis, CNA posted a 94.3 calendar year combined ratio, excluding development in catastrophe losses, the ratio was slightly higher at 95.9%. Again, both of these represented real improvements in the prior year. The strong increase in CNA's P&C underwriting profit in Q3 was partially offset by a loss on limited partnership investments, which CNA maintains in its portfolio to provide equity like returns with less volatility. This loss reduced CNA's proper contribution to Lowe's by $54 million versus a positive contribution of $17 million last year, a $71 million after tax year-to-year swing.
Further reducing CNA's contribution to Q3 net income were realized investment losses of $29 million after tax compared to $24 million of after-tax gains in Q3 2014. These losses were largely other-than-temporary impairment taken to give CNA the flexibility to sell certain securities. 
Diamond's contribution to income from continuing operations was $47 million up from $25 million for the same period last year. Two unusual items obscure the year-over-year comparison. In last year's third quarter, Diamond impaired the carrying value of fixed rates, which reduced its earnings contribution by $55 million. In this year's third quarter, we wrote off $20 million of goodwill on Lowe's books associated with Diamond. Excluding these 2 unusual charges, earnings decreased modestly. Contract revenues fell 18% as the revenue increases from older Deepwater and Deepwater rigs failed to offset the loss revenue from mid-water and jack up rigs. The company's rigorous expense management program brought contract drilling expenses down almost as much as the decline in contract drilling revenues but depreciation and interest expense were up year-over-year, reflecting the delivery of the last 2 new build drillships. Diamond's management is working hard to manage expenses and optimize the operating performance of its fleet during this difficult period in the offshore drilling market.
Boardwalk Pipeline contributions to income from continue operations was $18 million in Q3 2015 as opposed $8 million in Q3 2014. Boardwalk's net operating revenues were up with growth projects, the evangeline pipeline and the gulf south rig base all contributing. This uptick in revenues outpaced expense increases, including higher depreciation and interest expense. Additionally, at the Loews level, we benefited in the third quarter from a $6 million after tax franchise tax refund related to Boardwalk. Lowe's and Boardwalk have a subordinated loan agreement in place under which Boardwalk can borrow up to $300 million at any time until the end of December. Boardwalk has not yet drawn under the agreement. We have agreed to extend the agreement to make the proceeds available to Boardwalk through year-end 2016. 
Loews Hotels contribution income from continuing operations was $2 million during the third quarter up from a minimal contribution last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $30 million down slightly from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA during Q3 was hurt by results in our wholly-owned hotels, particularly in our New York and properties, notably the 4 joint venture hotels of the Universal Orlando result continued to perform strongly as did numerous other properties. 
The parent company portfolio posed an after-tax loss of $22 million in the third quarter, driven by losses incurred on equities and limited partnership investment, including gold-related investments. As a reminder, cash and equivalents make up about 70% of this $4.8 billion portfolio. We received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter: $61 million from CNA; $9 million from Diamond; and $13 million from Boardwalk. During the first   9 months of the year we received $733 million in dividends from our subsidiaries up from $647 million for the same period in 2014. 
During 2015 we have repurchased 19.6 million shares of Lowe's common stock, over 5% of our beginning of the year shares outstanding. We repurchased 7.6 million shares in the first half, 8.7 million shares during the third quarter and 3.3 million shares thus far in Q4. In total we have spent $753 million on share repurchase this year. 
And with that, I will now hand the call back to Mary."

So CNA is the big gorilla in the room. CNA, as you correctly say, represents 2/3 of the value of Loews and also generates probably -- this past year generated 80% or 85% of our cash flow",446,"So let me take a stab at it and tell me if I answered your question. So CNA is the big gorilla in the room. CNA, as you correctly say, represents 2/3 of the value of Loews and also generates probably -- this past year generated 80% or 85% of our cash flow. Behind that are Boardwalk and Diamond Offshore. I would say that both are recuperating. Diamond Offshore, as you know, cut its dividend so it could get off of the MLP treadmill, cut that distribution in January and has been able to finance its growth with primarily internally generated funds and as I said, in my remarks has very good growth prospects going forward. We're looking forward to that big of organic growth coming online. There's still more organic growth that we're hoping to put on the books. So even though Boardwalk doesn't -- isn't paying out significant dividends, it is building its business and its network and we're really very pleased with that. At Diamond Offshore, it is the strongest company in its industry. It has investment-grade ratings. It's got cash available to it to invest, and it's just waiting for the opportune time to invest in more rig assets. Diamond Offshore, as you will recall between '06 and '14 paid out  $41 a share of dividend. So to Loews Corporation, that represented almost $3 billion and there was a time when instead of Diamond stock being $20 a share, it was 7x higher so it represented very significant value to Loews. Now I'm not predicting that Diamond is going to go back to $140 any time soon but I do think that in the fullness of time and once this oil cycle has played itself out and oil prices are back to what I would consider to be equilibrium prices that Diamond Offshore shares can improve as well. And then finally, I'd say that with respect to  Loews Hotels, it doesn't have a lot of earnings but it does have a lot of value. The hotels in our portfolio, many of them are the envy of a lot of people in the hotel business and the goal at Loews hotels is to continue building the value of the company. As I said it may be difficult for you to see in the form of net income. We do show adjusted EBITDA as measure to help give you some ability to give value to the business but I'd simply end by saying that as I said before I love all my children. I love all our businesses and, I think, each   one of them is doing well within the context of their industry."

Since I'm not in the habit of ignoring the elephant in the room, I want to start today's discussion by focusing on the stock prices of Loews and our subsidiaries. You certainly don't need me to tell you that the stock market performed terribly in the third quarter. Unfortunately, the stocks of our subsidiaries performed even worse. The S&P 500 was down about 7% in the third quarter. The Diamond was down more than 30% will. Boardwalk was down 19% and CNA was down 9%.
Loews' share price, whilst of course affected by these declines and performed on par with the S&P 500 for the quarter. In general, we believe that the stock market is undervaluing our shares, and those of our subsidiaries. Despite being frustrated, rather than complain, we look at this as an opportunity to great value for Loews shareholders by buying back our stock. And we did. Our lemonade from lemons attitude will not come as a shock to those of you who know us. We were happy to buyback 8.7 million shares of Loews stock in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've spent over $750 million buying back more than 19.6 million shares.
You might be asking yourself, why didn't we purchase more of our subsidiaries shares directly? It's simple. As I mentioned, we believe that all of our subsidiaries' shares are currently, undervalued in the market, when we purchased Loews shares, we were simultaneously buying all of our subsidiaries shares at a conglomerate discount, so we focused the lion's share of our buybacks on Loews stock to get what amounts to a double discount.
Let me spend a few moments on what might be driving the decline in our subsidiary shares. For our energy subsidiaries, the drop in their share prices is a function of the headwinds facing their respective markets. Diamond share price has moved in line with its peer groups. The entire offshore drilling industry had a miserable year on the stock market and the misery is ongoing. Unfortunately, the current fundamentals of the offshore drilling industry are lousy as well. Offshore drilling rig dayrates have been driven down due to a trifecta of challenging market conditions, namely 1, a steep drop in oil prices, 2, the reduction in oil companies exploration and production budgets and 3, a wave of new rig deliveries that began about 6 years ago. These conditions have caused drilling contracts to be shortened, canceled or renegotiated resulting in rigs being idled. Additionally, oil companies have deferred or canceled new drilling projects even with dayrates currently at less than half of their peak levels oftentimes, there are still no takers for the rig. These circumstances have created a difficult backdrop for the offshore drilling industry, to say the least. Not to be lost in all of this and despite the doom and gloom, Diamond did perform well this quarter reporting strong earnings from their new drillship with very little downtime good cost management.
Since the start of this downcycle, I've been asked is offshore drilling coming back? My answer is an unequivocal yes. By some estimates, offshore oil production supplies up to 30% of the world's oil. This is a significant percentage that cannot be replaced by conventional onshore drilling or shale production. I believe that the lack of drilling now will sow the seeds for an oil price recovery later when prices rise, which they will, Diamond's customers will return to exploring for new sources of production and while Diamond is mostly being affected by the cyclical downturn in the offshore drilling market with its conservative capitalization, strong liquidity position and the added bonus that all of it  6 generation rigs are contracted. I'm confident that the company will be able to weather this cycle and emerge well positioned for the rebound.
Turning to Boardwalk. Their stock was down but somewhat less than the Alerian index, which is a composite of energy infrastructure master limited partnerships. The index took a 25% nosedive in the third quarter as investors became concerned about ML distribution growth rates or as I'd like to call it the MLP treadmill. This is the very same treadmill that Boardwalk stepped off of about a year ago allowing its management team to focus on positioning the company for long-term growth and profitability. This longer horizon strategy has allowed Boardwalk to take advantage of the changing supply and demand dynamics in the natural gas market by connecting its network of natural gas pipeline and storage assets to new end-use markets without the dilutive effects of significant share issuance at low prices. Boardwalk's focus has been on developing organic growth projects backed by long-term contracts. These projects promise to be great investments and are expected to provide Boardwalk with an unlevered double-digit rate of return on assets as they're completed over the next 2 to 4 years. Even though the industry is in transition and the stock price is low we are bullish about Boardwalk's long-term prospects.
Finally, let's take a look at CNA. The company's stock is down a bit more than the 6% decline of its peer group. CNA had a solid third quarter, and to my mind, there does not seem to be a correlation between stock price and performance here. CNA's strategy continues to be to deliver improved underwriting margins and its commercial business is the strongest it's been in years while positive developments in the core PMC business were offset somewhat by reduced performance in the limited partnership portfolio, the underlying business is very strong.
Before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to reiterate why we remain positive on the long-term prospects of each of our subsidiaries. CNA is stronger than it's ever been. Its specialty business has always been a top performer and is the envy of the insurance industry while its commercial business has shown tremendous improvement and there's still room for more. 
As for Diamond Offshore, to say that it's operating in a very tough environment is an understatement. However, we've seen this movie before, and we know how it ends. That's why Diamond has maintained a strong balance sheet and worked hard to secure long-term contracts for its new build rigs, there's no doubt that the company will weather the storm, and hopefully, grow in the process. 
Boardwalk has been able to capitalize on the changing supply and demand dynamics of the natural gas industry. The company is developing significant organic growth projects with outstanding rates of return that will be coming online in the next several years. 
And finally, Loews Hotels & Resorts has successfully focused on profitable growth and operational excellence. From 2012 through 2015 the hotel chain added 8 hotels across the country. These additions have contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. It's a trend that we hope to see continue.
At Loews, our actions are guided by our responsibility to our shareholders and our focus on creating long-term value. The strategies employed and steps taken by each of our subsidiaries have the same motivations and goals. So while our stock, and those of our subsidiaries maybe out of favor among some, you won't find us complaining. Rather you're more likely to find us repurchasing Loews stock and creating value for all of our shareholders.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to David."
285930,313907272,889280,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2015",2015-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In this year's third quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.50 per share, up slightly from $179 million or $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2014. The favorable yea",1102,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In this year's third quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.50 per share, up slightly from $179 million or $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2014. The favorable year-over-year variance stem from higher quarterly net income at Diamond and Boardwalk as well as higher net operating income at CNA. Offsetting these positive factors were realized investment losses at CNA versus realized gains in the prior year. 
On a net income basis, this year's third quarter was down from last year as last year's third quarter contained a gain from discontinued operations to reduce the previously recognized impairment charge from the sale of HighMount. For the 9 months ended September 30, income from continuing operations was $461 million or $1.25 per share down from $747 million or $1.94 per share in the prior year. Diamond and CNA drove the decrease, along with lower parent company investment income. 
Diamond booked rig impairments in both years with significantly larger impairments in 2015 than in 2014. Additionally, Diamond's rig operating income declined in 2015 because of reduced rig utilization, especially for the mid-water fleet, along with higher depreciation and interest expense. 
Numerous offsetting items impacted CNA's year-over-year -- year-to-date comparison, including lower LP income in 2015, a retroactive reinsurance charge in 2015, but not in 2014, higher favorable net prior year developments in 2015 than in 2014 and several other items. The net of all of these was a year-over-year income decline.
Year-to-date net income was up 20%. Last year's results included a $364 million after tax loss from discontinued operations, attributable to the HighMount disposition and CNA's sale of its life business.
We ended this past quarter with book value per share of $52.52, total shareholders' equity of $18.7 billion and parent company cash investments of $4.8 billion against debt of $1.7 billion.
Let me now delve more deeply into our quarterly earnings. CNA contributed $190 million to our third quarter income before realized investment results up from $164 million last year. Note that last year's third quarter included a $31 million hit to CNA's earnings contribution associated with the sale of its life business. CNA benefited in Q3 from improved accident year underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year development. The company's combined ratio before catastrophes and development in its core PMC business improved almost 1 point to 95.5%. Favorable prior year development lowered the calendar year combined ratio to 85.7%, a 10.4% point improvement from last year's third quarter. It's encouraging to see CNA continuing its year-over-year improvement in underwriting margin. On a year-to-date basis, CNA posted a 94.3% calendar year combined ratio, excluding development in catastrophe losses, the ratio was slightly higher at 95.9%. Again, both of these represented real improvement from the prior year. The strong increase in CNA's P&C underwriting profit in Q3 was partially offset by a loss on limited partnership investments, which CNA maintains in its portfolio to provide equity-like returns with less volatility. This loss reduced CNA's profit contribution to Loews by $54 million versus a positive contribution of $17 million last year, a $71 million after tax year-to-year swing.
Further reducing CNA's contribution to Q3 net income were realized investment losses of $29 million after tax compared to $24 million of after-tax gains in Q3 2014. These losses were largely other-than-temporary impairment taken to give CNA the flexibility to sell certain securities. 
Diamond's contribution to income from continuing operations was $47 million up from $25 million for the same period last year. Two unusual items obscure the year-over-year comparison. In last year's third quarter, Diamond impaired the carrying value of 6 rigs, which reduced its earnings contribution by $55 million. In this year's third quarter, we wrote off $20 million of goodwill on Loews' books associated with Diamond. Excluding these 2 unusual charges, earnings decreased modestly. Contract drilling revenues fell 18% as the revenue increases from ultra-deepwater and deepwater rigs failed to offset the loss revenue from mid-water and jack-up rigs. The company's rigorous expense management program brought contract drilling expenses down almost as much as the decline in contract drilling revenues but depreciation and interest expense were up year-over-year, reflecting the delivery of the last 2 new build drillships. Diamond's management is working hard to manage expenses and optimize the operating performance of its fleet during this difficult period in the offshore drilling market.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to income from continuing operations was $18 million in Q3 2015 as opposed $8 million in Q3 2014. Boardwalk's net operating revenues were up with growth projects, the Evangeline pipeline and the Gulf South rate days all contributing. This uptick in revenues outpaced expense increases, including higher depreciation and interest expense. Additionally, at the Loews level, we benefited in the third quarter from a $6 million after tax franchise tax refund related to Boardwalk. Loews and Boardwalk have a subordinated loan agreement in place under which Boardwalk can borrow up to $300 million at any time until the end of December. Boardwalk has not yet drawn under the agreement. We have agreed to extend the agreement to make the proceeds available to Boardwalk through year-end 2016. 
Loews Hotels contribution income from continuing operations was $2 million during the third quarter up from a minimal contribution last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $30 million down slightly from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA during Q3 was hurt by results in our wholly-owned hotels, particularly in our New York and Coronado properties, notably the 4 joint venture hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort continued to perform strongly as did numerous other properties. 
The parent company portfolio posed an after-tax loss of $22 million in the third quarter, driven by losses incurred on equities and limited partnership investments, including gold-related investments. As a reminder, cash and equivalents make up about 70% of this $4.8 billion portfolio. We received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter: $61 million from CNA; $9 million from Diamond; and $13 million from Boardwalk. During the first 9 months of the year we received $733 million in dividends from our subsidiaries up from $647 million for the same period in 2014. 
During 2015 we have repurchased 19.6 million shares of Loews common stock, over 5% of our beginning of the year shares outstanding. We repurchased 7.6 million shares in the first half, 8.7 million shares during the third quarter and 3.3 million shares thus far in Q4. In total we have spent $753 million on share repurchase this year. 
And with that, I will now hand the call back to Mary."

So let me take a stab at it and tell me if I answered your question. So CNA is the big gorilla in the room.

So let me take a stab at it and tell me if I answered your question. So CNA is the big gorilla in the room. CNA, as you correctly say, represents 2/3 of the value of Loews and also generates probably -- this past year, generated 80% or 85% of our cash flow. Behind that are Boardwalk and Diamond Offshore. I would say that both are recuperating. Diamond Offshore, as you know, cut its dividend so that it could get off of the MLP treadmill, cut that distribution in January and has been able to finance its growth with primarily internally generated funds and as I said, in my remarks has very good growth prospects going forward. We're looking forward to that $1.05 billion of organic growth coming online. There's still more organic growth that they're hoping to put on the books. So even though Boardwalk doesn't -- isn't paying out significant dividends, it is building its business and its network and we're really very pleased with that. At Diamond Offshore, it is the strongest company in its industry. It has investment grade ratings. It's got cash available to it to invest, and it's just waiting for the opportune time to invest in more rig assets. Diamond Offshore, as you will recall between '06 and '14 paid out $41 a share of dividend. So to Loews Corporation, that represented almost $3 billion and there was a time when instead of Diamond stock being $20 a share, it was 7x higher, so it represented very significant value to Loews. Now I'm not predicting that Diamond is going to go back to $140 any time soon but I do think that in the fullness of time and once this oil cycle has played itself out and oil prices are back to what I would consider to be equilibrium prices that Diamond Offshore shares can improve as well. And then finally, I'd say that with respect to Loews Hotels, it doesn't have a lot of earnings but it does have a lot of value. The hotels in our portfolio, many of them are the envy of a lot of people in the hotel business and the goal at Loews Hotels is to continue building the value of the company. As I said it may be difficult for you to see in the form of net income. We do show adjusted EBITDA as a measure to help give you some ability to give value to the business but I'd simply end by saying that as I've said before, I love all my children. I love all our businesses and, I think, each one of them is doing well within the context of their industry."

Since I'm not in the habit of ignoring the elephant in the room, I want to start today's discussion by focusing on the stock prices of Loews and our subsidiaries. You certainly don't need me to tell you that the stock market performed terribly in the third quarter. Unfortunately, the stocks of our subsidiaries performed even worse. The S&P 500 was down about 7% in the third quarter. The Diamond was down more than 30% will. Boardwalk was down 19% and CNA was down 9%.
Loews' share price was of course affected by these declines and performed on par with the S&P 500 for the quarter. In general, we believe that the stock market is undervaluing our shares, and those of our subsidiaries. 
Despite being frustrated, rather than complain, we look at this as an opportunity to great value for Loews shareholders by buying back our stock. And we did. Our lemonade from lemons attitude will not come as a shock to those of you who know us. We were happy to buy back 8.7 million shares of Loews stock in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date, we've spent over $750 million buying back more than 19.6 million shares.
You might be asking yourself, why didn't we purchase more of our subsidiaries shares directly? It's simple. As I mentioned, we believe that all of our subsidiaries' shares are currently, undervalued in the market, when we purchased Loews shares, we were simultaneously buying all of our subsidiaries shares at a conglomerate discount, so we focused the lion's share of our buybacks on Loews stock to get what amounts to a double discount.
Let me spend a few moments on what might be driving the decline in our subsidiary shares. For our energy subsidiaries, the drop in their share prices is a function of the headwinds facing their respective markets. 
Diamond's share price has moved in line with its peer groups. The entire offshore drilling industry had a miserable year on the stock market and the misery is ongoing. 
Unfortunately, the current fundamentals of the offshore drilling industry are lousy as well. Offshore drilling rig day rates have been driven down, due to a trifecta of challenging market conditions, namely One, a steep drop in oil prices; Two, the reduction in oil companies exploration and production budgets; and Three, a wave of new rig deliveries that began about 6 years ago. 
These conditions have caused drilling contracts to be shortened, canceled or renegotiated resulting in rigs being idled. Additionally, oil companies have deferred or canceled new drilling projects even with day rates currently at less than half of their peak levels oftentimes, there are still no takers for the rig. 
These circumstances have created a difficult backdrop for the offshore drilling industry, to say the least. Not to be lost in all of this and despite the doom and gloom, Diamond did perform well this quarter, reporting strong earnings from their new drillships with very little downtime good cost management.
Since the start of this down cycle, I've been asked is offshore drilling coming back? My answer is an unequivocal yes. By some estimates, offshore oil production supplies up to 30% of the world's oil. This is a significant percentage that cannot be replaced by conventional onshore drilling or shale production. I believe that the lack of drilling now will sow the seeds for an oil price recovery later. 
When prices rise, which they will, Diamond's customers will return to exploring for new sources of production and while Diamond is mostly being affected by the cyclical downturn in the offshore drilling market, with its conservative capitalization, strong liquidity position and the added bonus that all of its 6 generation rigs are contracted. I'm confident that the company will be able to weather this cycle and emerge well positioned for the rebound.
Turning to Boardwalk. Their stock was down but somewhat less than the Alerian index, which is a composite of energy infrastructure master limited partnerships. The index took a 25% nosedive in the third quarter as investors became concerned about ML distribution growth rates or as I'd like to call it the MLP treadmill. This is the very same treadmill that Boardwalk stepped off of about a year ago allowing its management team to focus on positioning the company for long-term growth and profitability. 
This longer horizon strategy has allowed Boardwalk to take advantage of a changing supply and demand dynamics in the natural gas market by connecting its network of natural gas pipeline and storage assets to new end-use markets, without the dilutive effects of significant share issuance at low prices. 
Boardwalk's focus has been on developing organic growth projects backed by long-term contracts. These projects promise to be great investments and are expected to provide Boardwalk with an unlevered double-digit rate of return on assets as they're completed over the next 2 to 4 years. 
Even though the industry is in transition and the stock price is low we are bullish about Boardwalk's long-term prospects.
Finally, let's take a look at CNA. The company's stock is down a bit more than the 6% decline of its peer group. CNA had a solid third quarter, and to my mind, there does not seem to be a correlation between stock price and performance here. CNA's strategy continues to be to deliver improved underwriting margins and its commercial business is the strongest it's been in years, while positive developments in the core P&C business were offset somewhat by reduced performance in the limited partnership portfolio, the underlying business is very strong.
Before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to reiterate why we remain positive on the long-term prospects of each of our subsidiaries. CNA is stronger than it's ever been. Its specialty business has always been a top performer and is the envy of the insurance industry while its commercial business has shown tremendous improvement and there's still room for more. 
As for Diamond Offshore, to say that it's operating in a very tough environment is an understatement. However, we've seen this movie before, and we know how it ends. That's why Diamond has maintained a strong balance sheet and worked hard to secure long-term contracts for its new build rigs, there is no doubt that the company will weather the storm, and hopefully, grow in the process. 
Boardwalk has been able to capitalize on the changing supply and demand dynamics of the natural gas industry. The company is developing significant organic growth projects with outstanding rates of return that will be coming online in the next several years. 
And finally, Loews Hotels & Resorts has successfully focused on profitable growth and operational excellence. From 2012 through 2015 the hotel chain added 8 hotels across the country. These additions have contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. It's a trend that we hope to see continue.
At Loews, our actions are guided by our responsibility to our shareholders and our focus on creating long-term value. The strategies employed and steps taken by each of our subsidiaries have the same motivations and goals. So while our stock, and those of our subsidiaries may be out of favor among some, you won't find us complaining. Rather you're more likely to find us repurchasing Loews stock and creating value for all of our shareholders.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to David."
285930,313907272,889347,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2015",2015-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In this year's third quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.50 per share, up slightly from $179 million or $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2014. The favorable yea",1102,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In this year's third quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.50 per share, up slightly from $179 million or $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2014. The favorable year-over-year variance stems from higher quarterly net income at Diamond and Boardwalk as well as higher net operating income at CNA. Offsetting these positive factors were realized investment losses at CNA versus realized gains in the prior year. 
On a net income basis, this year's third quarter was down from last year as last year's third quarter contained a gain from discontinued operations to reduce the previously recognized impairment charge from the sale of HighMount. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, income from continuing operations was $461 million or $1.25 per share, down from $747 million or $1.94 per share in the prior year. Diamond and CNA drove the decrease, along with lower parent company investment income. 
Diamond booked rig impairments in both years with significantly larger impairments in 2015 than in 2014. Additionally, Diamond's rig operating income declined in 2015 because of reduced rig utilization, especially for the mid-water fleet, along with higher depreciation and interest expense. 
Numerous offsetting items impacted CNA's year-over-year -- year-to-date comparison, including lower LP income in 2015, a retroactive reinsurance charge in 2015, but not in 2014, higher favorable net prior year development in 2015 than in 2014 and several other items. The net of all of these was a year-over-year income decline.
Year-to-date net income was up 20%. Last year's results included a $364 million after tax loss from discontinued operations, attributable to the HighMount disposition and CNA's sale of its life business.
We ended this past quarter with book value per share of $52.52, total shareholders' equity of $18.7 billion and parent company cash investments of $4.8 billion against debt of $1.7 billion.
Let me now delve more deeply into our quarterly earnings. CNA contributed $190 million to our third quarter income before realized investment results, up from $164 million last year. Note that last year's third quarter included a $31 million hit to CNA's earnings contribution associated with the sale of its Life business. CNA benefited in Q3 from improved accident year underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year development. The company's combined ratio before catastrophes and development, in its core P&C business improved almost 1 point to 95.5%. 
Favorable prior year development lowered the calendar year combined ratio to 85.7%, a 10.4% point improvement from last year's third quarter. It's encouraging to see CNA continuing its year-over-year improvement in underwriting margin. 
On a year-to-date basis, CNA posted a 94.3% calendar year combined ratio, excluding development and catastrophe losses, the ratio was slightly higher at 95.9%. Again, both of these represented real improvement from the prior year. The strong increase in CNA's P&C underwriting profit in Q3 was partially offset by a loss on limited partnership investments, which CNA maintains in its portfolio to provide equity-like returns with less volatility. 
This loss reduced CNA's profit contribution to Loews by $54 million versus a positive contribution of $17 million last year, a $71 million after tax year-to-year swing.
Further reducing CNA's contribution to Q3 net income were realized investment losses of $29 million after tax compared to $24 million of after-tax gains in Q3 2014. These losses were largely other-than-temporary impairment taken to give CNA the flexibility to sell certain securities. 
Diamond's contribution to income from continuing operations was $47 million up from $25 million for the same period last year. Two unusual items obscure the year-over-year comparison. In last year's third quarter, Diamond impaired the carrying value of 6 rigs, which reduced its earnings contribution by $55 million. In this year's third quarter, we wrote off $20 million of goodwill on Loews' books associated with Diamond. Excluding these 2 unusual charges, earnings decreased modestly. 
Contract drilling revenues fell 18% as the revenue increases from ultra-deepwater and deepwater rigs failed to offset the lost revenue from mid-water and jack-up rigs. The company's rigorous expense management program brought contract drilling expenses down almost as much as the decline in contract drilling revenues. But depreciation and interest expense were up year-over-year, reflecting the delivery of the last 2 new build drillships. 
Diamond's management is working hard to manage expenses and optimize the operating performance of its fleet during this difficult period in the offshore drilling market.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to income from continuing operations was $18 million in Q3 2015 as opposed $8 million in Q3 2014. Boardwalk's net operating revenues were up with growth projects, the Evangeline pipeline and the Gulf South rate case all contributing. 
This uptick in revenues outpaced expense increases, including higher depreciation and interest expense. Additionally, at the Loews level, we benefited in the third quarter from a $6 million after tax franchise tax refund related to Boardwalk. Loews and Boardwalk have a subordinated loan agreement in place under which Boardwalk can borrow up to $300 million at any time until the end of December. Boardwalk has not yet drawn under the agreement. We have agreed to extend the agreement to make the proceeds available to Boardwalk through year-end 2016. 
Loews Hotels contribution to income from continuing operations was $2 million during the third quarter up from a minimal contribution last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $30 million down slightly from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA during Q3 was hurt by results in our wholly-owned hotels, particularly in our New York and Coronado properties, notably the 4 joint venture hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort continued to perform strongly as did numerous other properties. 
The parent company portfolio posed an after-tax loss of $22 million in the third quarter, driven by losses incurred on equities and limited partnership investments, including gold-related investments. As a reminder, cash and equivalents make up about 70% of this $4.8 billion portfolio. 
We received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter: $61 million from CNA; $9 million from Diamond; and $13 million from Boardwalk. During the first 9 months of the year we received $733 million in dividends from our subsidiaries up from $647 million for the same period in 2014. 
During 2015 we have repurchased 19.6 million shares of Loews common stock, over 5% of our beginning of year shares outstanding. We repurchased 7.6 million shares in the first half, 8.7 million shares during the third quarter and 3.3 million shares thus far in Q4. In total we have spent $753 million on share repurchase this year. 
And with that, I will now hand the call back to Mary."

So let me take a stab at it and tell me if I answered your question. So CNA is the big gorilla in the room.

So let me take a stab at it and tell me if I answered your question. So CNA is the big gorilla in the room. CNA, as you correctly say, represents 2/3 of the value of Loews and also generates probably -- this past year, generated 80% or 85% of our cash flow. Behind that are Boardwalk and Diamond Offshore. I would say that both are recuperating. Diamond Offshore, as you know, cut its dividend so that it could get off of the MLP treadmill; cut that distribution in January and has been able to finance its growth with primarily internally generated funds, and as I said, in my remarks has very good growth prospects going forward. We're looking forward to that $1.05 billion of organic growth coming online. There's still more organic growth that they're hoping to put on the books. So even though Boardwalk doesn't -- isn't paying out significant dividends, it is building its business and its network and we're really very pleased with that. At Diamond Offshore, it is the strongest company in its industry. It has investment grade ratings. It's got cash available to it to invest, and it's just waiting for the opportune time to invest in more rig assets. Diamond Offshore, as you well recall between '06 and '14 paid out $41 a share of dividend. So to Loews Corporation, that represented almost $3 billion and there was a time when instead of Diamond stock being $20 a share, it was 7x higher, so it represented very significant value to Loews. Now I'm not predicting that Diamond is going to go back to $140 anytime soon but I do think that in the fullness of time and once this oil cycle has played itself out and oil prices are back to what I would consider to be equilibrium prices, that Diamond Offshore shares can improve as well. And then finally, I'd say that with respect to Loews Hotels, it doesn't have a lot of earnings but it does have a lot of value. The hotels in our portfolio, many of them are the envy of a lot of people in the hotel business and the goal at Loews Hotels is to continue building the value of the company. As I said it may be difficult for you to see in the form of net income. We do show adjusted EBITDA as a measure to help give you some ability to give value to the business. But I'd simply end by saying that as I've said before, I love all my children. I love all our businesses and, I think, each one of them is doing well within the context of their industry."

Since I'm not in the habit of ignoring the elephant in the room, I want to start today's discussion by focusing on the stock prices of Loews and our subsidiaries. You certainly don't need me to tell you that the stock market performed terribly in the third quarter. Unfortunately, the stocks of our subsidiaries performed even worse. The S&P 500 was down about 7% in the third quarter. The Diamond was down more than 30% will. Boardwalk was down 19% and CNA was down 9%.
Loews' share price was of course affected by these declines and performed on par with the S&P 500 for the quarter. In general, we believe that the stock market is undervaluing our shares, and those of our subsidiaries. 
Despite being frustrated, rather than complain, we look at this as an opportunity to great value for Loews shareholders by buying back our stock. And we did. Our lemonade from lemons attitude will not come as a shock to those of you who know us. We were happy to buy back 8.7 million shares of Loews stock in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date, we've spent over $750 million buying back more than 19.6 million shares.
You might be asking yourself, why didn't we purchase more of our subsidiaries shares directly? It's simple. As I mentioned, we believe that all of our subsidiaries' shares are currently, undervalued in the market, when we purchased Loews shares, we were simultaneously buying all of our subsidiaries shares at a conglomerate discount, so we focused the lion's share of our buybacks on Loews stock to get what amounts to a double discount.
Let me spend a few moments on what might be driving the decline in our subsidiary shares. For our energy subsidiaries, the drop in their share prices is a function of the headwinds facing their respective markets. 
Diamond's share price has moved in line with its peer groups. The entire offshore drilling industry had a miserable year on the stock market and the misery is ongoing. 
Unfortunately, the current fundamentals of the offshore drilling industry are lousy as well. Offshore drilling rig day rates have been driven down, due to a trifecta of challenging market conditions, namely one, a steep drop in oil prices; two, the reduction in oil companies exploration and production budgets; and three, a wave of new rig deliveries that began about 6 years ago. 
These conditions have caused drilling contracts to be shortened, canceled or renegotiated resulting in rigs being idled. Additionally, oil companies have deferred or canceled new drilling projects even with day rates currently at less than half of their peak levels oftentimes, there are still no takers for the rig. 
These circumstances have created a difficult backdrop for the offshore drilling industry, to say the least. Not to be lost in all of this and despite the doom and gloom, Diamond did perform well this quarter, reporting strong earnings from their new drillships with very little downtime good cost management.
Since the start of this down cycle, I've been asked is offshore drilling coming back? My answer is an unequivocal yes. By some estimates, offshore oil production supplies up to 30% of the world's oil. This is a significant percentage that cannot be replaced by conventional onshore drilling or shale production. I believe that the lack of drilling now will sow the seeds for an oil price recovery later. 
When prices rise, which they will, Diamond's customers will return to exploring for new sources of production and while Diamond is mostly being affected by the cyclical downturn in the offshore drilling market, with its conservative capitalization, strong liquidity position and the added bonus that all of its 6 generation rigs are contracted. I'm confident that the company will be able to weather this cycle and emerge well positioned for the rebound.
Turning to Boardwalk. Their stock was down but somewhat less than the Alerian index, which is a composite of energy infrastructure master limited partnerships. The index took a 25% nosedive in the third quarter as investors became concerned about ML distribution growth rates or as I'd like to call it the MLP treadmill. This is the very same treadmill that Boardwalk stepped off of about a year ago allowing its management team to focus on positioning the company for long-term growth and profitability. 
This longer horizon strategy has allowed Boardwalk to take advantage of a changing supply and demand dynamics in the natural gas market by connecting its network of natural gas pipeline and storage assets to new end-use markets, without the dilutive effects of significant share issuance at low prices. 
Boardwalk's focus has been on developing organic growth projects backed by long-term contracts. These projects promise to be great investments and are expected to provide Boardwalk with an unlevered double-digit rate of return on assets as they're completed over the next 2 to 4 years. 
Even though the industry is in transition and the stock price is low we are bullish about Boardwalk's long-term prospects.
Finally, let's take a look at CNA. The company's stock is down a bit more than the 6% decline of its peer group. CNA had a solid third quarter, and to my mind, there does not seem to be a correlation between stock price and performance here. CNA's strategy continues to be to deliver improved underwriting margins and its commercial business is the strongest it's been in years, while positive developments in the core P&C business were offset somewhat by reduced performance in the limited partnership portfolio, the underlying business is very strong.
Before I turn the call over to our CFO, David Edelson, I want to reiterate why we remain positive on the long-term prospects of each of our subsidiaries. CNA is stronger than it's ever been. Its specialty business has always been a top performer and is the envy of the insurance industry while its commercial business has shown tremendous improvement and there's still room for more. 
As for Diamond Offshore, to say that it's operating in a very tough environment is an understatement. However, we've seen this movie before, and we know how it ends. That's why Diamond has maintained a strong balance sheet and worked hard to secure long-term contracts for its new build rigs, there is no doubt that the company will weather the storm, and hopefully, grow in the process. 
Boardwalk has been able to capitalize on the changing supply and demand dynamics of the natural gas industry. The company is developing significant organic growth projects with outstanding rates of return that will be coming online in the next several years. 
And finally, Loews Hotels & Resorts has successfully focused on profitable growth and operational excellence. From 2012 through 2015 the hotel chain added 8 hotels across the country. These additions have contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. It's a trend that we hope to see continue.
At Loews, our actions are guided by our responsibility to our shareholders and our focus on creating long-term value. The strategies employed and steps taken by each of our subsidiaries have the same motivations and goals. So while our stock, and those of our subsidiaries may be out of favor among some, you won't find us complaining. Rather you're more likely to find us repurchasing Loews stock and creating value for all of our shareholders.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to David."
285930,313907272,889561,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2015",2015-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In this year's third quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.50 per share, up slightly from $179 million or $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2014. The favorable yea",1102,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In this year's third quarter, Loews reported income from continuing operations of $182 million or $0.50 per share, up slightly from $179 million or $0.47 per share in the third quarter of 2014. The favorable year-over-year variance stems from higher quarterly net income at Diamond and Boardwalk as well as higher net operating income at CNA. Offsetting these positive factors were realized investment losses at CNA versus realized gains in the prior year. 
On a net income basis, this year's third quarter was down from last year as last year's third quarter contained a gain from discontinued operations to reduce the previously recognized impairment charge from the sale of HighMount. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, income from continuing operations was $461 million or $1.25 per share, down from $747 million or $1.94 per share in the prior year. Diamond and CNA drove the decrease, along with lower parent company investment income. 
Diamond booked rig impairments in both years with significantly larger impairments in 2015 than in 2014. Additionally, Diamond's rig operating income declined in 2015 because of reduced rig utilization, especially for the mid-water fleet, along with higher depreciation and interest expense. 
Numerous offsetting items impacted CNA's year-over-year -- year-to-date comparison, including lower LP income in 2015, a retroactive reinsurance charge in 2015, but not in 2014, higher favorable net prior year development in 2015 than in 2014 and several other items. The net of all of these was a year-over-year income decline.
Year-to-date net income was up 20%. Last year's results included a $364 million after tax loss from discontinued operations, attributable to the HighMount disposition and CNA's sale of its life business.
We ended this past quarter with book value per share of $52.52, total shareholders' equity of $18.7 billion and parent company cash investments of $4.8 billion against debt of $1.7 billion.
Let me now delve more deeply into our quarterly earnings. CNA contributed $190 million to our third quarter income before realized investment results, up from $164 million last year. Note that last year's third quarter included a $31 million hit to CNA's earnings contribution associated with the sale of its Life business. CNA benefited in Q3 from improved accident year underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year development. The company's combined ratio before catastrophes and development, in its core P&C business improved almost 1 point to 95.5%. 
Favorable prior year development lowered the calendar year combined ratio to 85.7%, a 10.4% point improvement from last year's third quarter. It's encouraging to see CNA continuing its year-over-year improvement in underwriting margin. 
On a year-to-date basis, CNA posted a 94.3% calendar year combined ratio, excluding development and catastrophe losses, the ratio was slightly higher at 95.9%. Again, both of these represented real improvement from the prior year. The strong increase in CNA's P&C underwriting profit in Q3 was partially offset by a loss on limited partnership investments, which CNA maintains in its portfolio to provide equity-like returns with less volatility. 
This loss reduced CNA's profit contribution to Loews by $54 million versus a positive contribution of $17 million last year, a $71 million after tax year-to-year swing.
Further reducing CNA's contribution to Q3 net income were realized investment losses of $29 million after tax compared to $24 million of after-tax gains in Q3 2014. These losses were largely other-than-temporary impairment taken to give CNA the flexibility to sell certain securities. 
Diamond's contribution to income from continuing operations was $47 million up from $25 million for the same period last year. Two unusual items obscure the year-over-year comparison. In last year's third quarter, Diamond impaired the carrying value of 6 rigs, which reduced its earnings contribution by $55 million. In this year's third quarter, we wrote off $20 million of goodwill on Loews' books associated with Diamond. Excluding these 2 unusual charges, earnings decreased modestly. 
Contract drilling revenues fell 18% as the revenue increases from ultra-deepwater and deepwater rigs failed to offset the lost revenue from mid-water and jack-up rigs. The company's rigorous expense management program brought contract drilling expenses down almost as much as the decline in contract drilling revenues. But depreciation and interest expense were up year-over-year, reflecting the delivery of the last 2 new build drillships. 
Diamond's management is working hard to manage expenses and optimize the operating performance of its fleet during this difficult period in the offshore drilling market.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to income from continuing operations was $18 million in Q3 2015 as opposed $8 million in Q3 2014. Boardwalk's net operating revenues were up with growth projects, the Evangeline pipeline and the Gulf South rate case all contributing. 
This uptick in revenues outpaced expense increases, including higher depreciation and interest expense. Additionally, at the Loews level, we benefited in the third quarter from a $6 million after tax franchise tax refund related to Boardwalk. Loews and Boardwalk have a subordinated loan agreement in place under which Boardwalk can borrow up to $300 million at any time until the end of December. Boardwalk has not yet drawn under the agreement. We have agreed to extend the agreement to make the proceeds available to Boardwalk through year-end 2016. 
Loews Hotels contribution to income from continuing operations was $2 million during the third quarter up from a minimal contribution last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $30 million down slightly from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA during Q3 was hurt by results in our wholly-owned hotels, particularly in our New York and Coronado properties, notably the 4 joint venture hotels at the Universal Orlando Resort continued to perform strongly as did numerous other properties. 
The parent company portfolio posed an after-tax loss of $22 million in the third quarter, driven by losses incurred on equities and limited partnership investments, including gold-related investments. As a reminder, cash and equivalents make up about 70% of this $4.8 billion portfolio. 
We received $83 million in dividends from our subsidiaries in the quarter: $61 million from CNA; $9 million from Diamond; and $13 million from Boardwalk. During the first 9 months of the year we received $733 million in dividends from our subsidiaries up from $647 million for the same period in 2014. 
During 2015 we have repurchased 19.6 million shares of Loews common stock, over 5% of our beginning of year shares outstanding. We repurchased 7.6 million shares in the first half, 8.7 million shares during the third quarter and 3.3 million shares thus far in Q4. In total we have spent $753 million on share repurchase this year. 
And with that, I will now hand the call back to Mary."

So let me take a stab at it and tell me if I answered your question. So CNA is the big gorilla in the room. CNA, as you correctly say, represents 2/3 of the value of Loews and also generates probably -- this past year, generated 80% or 85% of our ca",450,"Okay. So let me take a stab at it and tell me if I answered your question. So CNA is the big gorilla in the room. CNA, as you correctly say, represents 2/3 of the value of Loews and also generates probably -- this past year, generated 80% or 85% of our cash flow. Behind that are Boardwalk and Diamond Offshore. I would say that both are recuperating. Diamond Offshore, as you know, cut its dividend so that it could get off of the MLP treadmill; cut that distribution in January and has been able to finance its growth with primarily internally generated funds, and as I said, in my remarks has very good growth prospects going forward. We're looking forward to that $1.05 billion of organic growth coming online. There's still more organic growth that they're hoping to put on the books. So even though Boardwalk doesn't -- isn't paying out significant dividends, it is building its business and its network and we're really very pleased with that. At Diamond Offshore, it is the strongest company in its industry. It has investment grade ratings. It's got cash available to it to invest, and it's just waiting for the opportune time to invest in more rig assets. Diamond Offshore, as you well recall between '06 and '14 paid out $41 a share of dividend. So to Loews Corporation, that represented almost $3 billion and there was a time when instead of Diamond stock being $20 a share, it was 7x higher, so it represented very significant value to Loews. Now I'm not predicting that Diamond is going to go back to $140 anytime soon but I do think that in the fullness of time and once this oil cycle has played itself out and oil prices are back to what I would consider to be equilibrium prices, that Diamond Offshore shares can improve as well. And then finally, I'd say that with respect to Loews Hotels, it doesn't have a lot of earnings but it does have a lot of value. The hotels in our portfolio, many of them are the envy of a lot of people in the hotel business and the goal at Loews Hotels is to continue building the value of the company. As I said it may be difficult for you to see in the form of net income. We do show adjusted EBITDA as a measure to help give you some ability to give value to the business. But I'd simply end by saying that as I've said before, I love all my children. I love all our businesses and, I think, each one of them is doing well within the context of their industry."
