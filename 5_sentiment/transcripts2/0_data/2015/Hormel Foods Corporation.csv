We're off to an excellent start to our fiscal year, with adjusted net earnings of 22% from a year ago on record first quarter sales of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase over last year. 
In terms of segment performance, Refrigerated Foods delivered a 19% increase in operating profit on a 1% sales increase. Our foodservice group achieved strong sales of branded items such as HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, Hormel pizza toppings and menu Master hams. Meat Products grew retail sales in HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays, HORMEL pepperoni and Hormel Natural Choice lunchmeat. 
In addition to this value-added product growth, lower-than-anticipated hog prices were a nice tailwind for this segment during this quarter. The combination of lower feed cost, a more mild winter and a fairly quick rebound from the PED virus that plagued the industry over the past year is resulting in an increasing domestic hog supply. Pork remains an excellent relative value to consumers, and we continue to see solid demand from our customers. 
While we drove growth in our value-added Refrigerated Foods businesses, our overall sales increases only 1%, and volume was down 3%. We reduced harvest levels by 2% compared to last year, as certain market conditions did not support volume increases for much of the quarter. 
Also, as we announced on our last call, we dissolved our Precept Foods joint venture, which resulted in lower sales and volumes this quarter. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered impressive growth this quarter, exceeding our expectations, with segment profit up 56% and sales up 10% compared to last year. Results were driven by value-added sales and excellent execution throughout the segment, along with favorable commodity turkey prices and lower feed costs. JENNIE-O lean ground turkey, rotisserie turkey and premium seasoned Delhi turkey led sales growth this quarter. We continue to support and build the Jennie-O brand through our Make The Switch media campaign, which began running in new U.S. markets in January. 
Grocery Products adjusted segment profit decreased 8% this quarter, with sales up 2%. High meat input costs and varied pricing actions in key categories hampered the growth of some of our brands. Products including SKIPPY peanut butter and HORMEL chili were down this quarter. 
On a positive side, our SPAM family of products, WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips and HERDEZ salsas and sauces grew nicely during the quarter. 
Grocery Products is dedicated to strengthening our brand through advertising and merchandising support, with campaigns running in the first half of the year for SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL chili and Hormel Compleats microwave meals. 
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 13% and a sales increase of 34%. Excluding sales of CytoSport products, sales were up 3%. The lower operating profit was primarily driven by reduced contract manufacturing business during the quarter, which offset the incremental CytoSport results. 
Specialty Foods achieved solid distribution gains from MUSCLE MILK protein attrition products in the food, drug and mass channel over the past quarter. 
International & Other adjusted segment profit increased 6%, with solid increases from both our retail and foodservice businesses in China, offset in part by lower results from SPAM exports due to high input cost and transportation challenges. 
First quarter sales for international were up 17%, benefiting from strong growth in China, increased SKIPPY peanut butter sales and the addition of the SKIPPY China business. 
Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2015. We believe hog and grain costs will remain favorable. We expect the high turkey commodity prices, which have been beneficial over the last several months, to trend down as the year progresses. We anticipate sales of our value-added products in Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store will remain strong throughout the year. 
Lower meat prices will provide the input cost relief for some of our Grocery Products categories after we work through higher cost inventories. Specialty Foods will maintain its focus on maximizing CytoSport synergies, gaining distribution, igniting innovation and building the MUSCLE MILK brand to drive segment growth. We continue to expect the CytoSport business to deliver the $0.05 per share earnings accretion we have previously guided. 
We look for Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments to contribute to our growth goals in the back half of the fiscal year. 
We expect international to build on its growth trajectory in China, with some challenges to its export business over the next few months, offsetting a portion of that growth. 
Due to our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range, excluding the nonrecurring charges, from $2.45 to $2.55 per share up to $2.50 to $2.60 per share. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter."

Excluding nonrecurring charges, non-GAAP adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $187.3 million, up 22% from net earnings of $153.3 million last year. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.69, up 21% compared to $0.57 per share a year ago. 
The first quarter included pretax nonrecurring charges of $10.5 million related to the Stockton, California plant closure and $9.5 million for the exit of international joint venture businesses. 
Sales for the first quarter totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion for the same period last year, a 7% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 3% from fiscal 2014. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.5% of sales compared to 7.4% for the same period last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales for fiscal 2015. 
Advertising expenses for the first quarter were $42.2 million compared to $36.1 million last year. The increase over the prior year was primarily associated with advertising for CytoSport products in the Specialty Foods segment. 
Equity and earnings of affiliate was $1.7 million in the first quarter versus $4.7 million last year. Charges associated with the exit of international joint business -- joint venture businesses totaling $9.5 million offset improved performance from our MegaMex Foods joint venture. 
Interest and investment income was $1.1 million for the first quarter compared to $1.2 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.7% versus 34.4% in fiscal 2014. We expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35% for fiscal year 2015. 
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 263.7 million shares. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270.1 million shares. We did not repurchase shares during the first quarter. We have 8.2 million shares remaining to be repurchased from the current authorization in place. 
Total debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at $250 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $27.7 million compared to $37 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $175 million to $190 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.8 million compared to $31.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015.

We are looking to create innovative products, the first of which are the SKIPPY singles items out in the marketplace. And even this quarter, SKIPPY, on an international basis, it showed very good results. And we're pleased with where that's heading. CytoSport is also off to a good start. I mean, a lot of activity has gone on in these first few months of ownership. We've already seen some really significant sales achievements within the food, drug and mass channel that we, frankly, kind of knew that HORMEL could -- would be an advantage for us bringing that skill set to the market -- to that brand. And we continue to bolster efforts in some of the other channels as well, the club and specialty channels. The team is hard at work at creating the right cost structure for that overall business. We're now running that business on a collaborative or combined basis with our previous Century Foods organization that was a custom manufacturer within the sports nutrition world.

We definitely -- our expectation is that SKIPPY is going to be a solid growth contributor for our company comment, and it has been every quarter that we've owned it, except for this one. And so we need to get through this kind of price decrease activity that occurred during the quarter and move on and restore growth there. We continue to enjoy growth with our SPAM product line, have good consumer marketing against that line and can continue to add flavors. So overall, we're encouraged the Grocery Products should be able to deliver growth within that segment. On the input or more cost-oriented side, I mean, we're talking about probably the second half of year, where we really expect Grocery Products to start showing significant year-over-year growth. That will come in part, we think, from the top line benefit of the ad campaigns that we referenced in our earlier comments. We're in a better raw material cost picture. When you look at term cost, for example, they're much more favorable right now than they were a year ago. And we're still working through some old inventory before we can fully reflect those, but that definitely will be of help. We're should be in a better position in terms of our production resources, following the closure of the Stockton plant and moving of a couple of those lines as well as some new lines of production at Dubuque that we previously announced.

And I guess, I would attribute that to some of the innovative new products that the team's come up with, including the bacon line we're having good success with right away this year; and then also their focused approach on certain of the business segments, some of the noncommercial areas such as colleges and universities and health care that they've really been able to crate new items for and really create some excellent relationships and service that, again, allow them to perform about the market trend."

We're off to an excellent start to our fiscal year, with adjusted net earnings of 22% from a year ago on record first quarter sales of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase over last year.In terms of segment performance, Ref",798,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We're off to an excellent start to our fiscal year, with adjusted net earnings of 22% from a year ago on record first quarter sales of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase over last year.
In terms of segment performance, Refrigerated Foods delivered a 19% increase in operating profit on a 1% sales increase. Our foodservice group achieved strong sales of branded items such as HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, HORMEL pizza toppings and MENUMASTER hams. Meat Products grew retail sales in HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays, HORMEL pepperoni and Hormel Natural Choice lunchmeat. 
In addition to this value-added product growth, lower-than-anticipated hog prices were a nice tailwind for this segment during this quarter. The combination of lower feed cost, a more mild winter and a fairly quick rebound from the PED virus that plagued the industry over the past year is resulting in an increasing domestic hog supply. Pork remains an excellent relative value to consumers, and we continue to see solid demand from our customers.
While we drove growth in our value-added Refrigerated Foods businesses, our overall sales increases only 1%, and volume was down 3%. We reduced harvest levels by 2% compared to last year, as certain market conditions did not support volume increases for much of the quarter. Also, as we announced on our last call, we dissolved our Precept Foods joint venture, which resulted in lower sales and volumes this quarter.
Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered impressive growth this quarter, exceeding our expectations, with segment profit up 56% and sales up 10% compared to last year. Results were driven by value-added sales and excellent execution throughout the segment, along with favorable commodity turkey prices and lower feed costs. JENNIE-O lean ground turkey, rotisserie turkey and premium seasoned deli turkey led sales growth this quarter. We continue to support and build the Jennie-O brand through our Make The Switch media campaign, which began running in new U.S. markets in January.
Grocery Products adjusted segment profit decreased 8% this quarter, with sales up 2%. High meat input costs and varied pricing actions in key categories hampered the growth of some of our brands. Products including SKIPPY peanut butter and HORMEL Chili were down this quarter. On a positive side, our SPAM family of products, WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips and HERDEZ salsas and sauces grew nicely during the quarter.
Grocery Products is dedicated to strengthening our brand through advertising and merchandising support, with campaigns running in the first half of the year for SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL chili and HORMEL COMPLEATS microwave meals.
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 13% and a sales increase of 34%. Excluding sales of CytoSport products, sales were up 3%. The lower operating profit was primarily driven by reduced contract manufacturing business during the quarter, which offset the incremental CytoSport results. Specialty Foods achieved solid distribution gains from Muscle Milk protein attrition products in the food, drug and mass channel over the past quarter.
International & Other adjusted segment profit increased 6%, with solid increases from both our retail and foodservice businesses in China, offset in part by lower results from SPAM exports due to high input cost and transportation challenges. First quarter sales for international were up 17%, benefiting from strong growth in China, increased SKIPPY peanut butter sales and the addition of the SKIPPY China business.
Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2015. We believe hog and grain costs will remain favorable. We expect the high turkey commodity prices, which have been beneficial over the last several months, to trend down as the year progresses. We anticipate sales of our value-added products in Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store will remain strong throughout the year.
Lower meat prices will provide the input cost relief for some of our Grocery Products categories after we work through higher cost inventories. Specialty Foods will maintain its focus on maximizing CytoSport synergies, gaining distribution, igniting innovation and building the Muscle Milk brand to drive segment growth. We continue to expect the CytoSport business to deliver the $0.05 per share earnings accretion we have previously guided.
We look for Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments to contribute to our growth goals in the back half of the fiscal year. We expect International to build on its growth trajectory in China, with some challenges to its export business over the next few months, offsetting a portion of that growth.
Due to our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range, excluding the nonrecurring charges, from $2.45 to $2.55 per share up to $2.50 to $2.60 per share.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter."

Advertising expenses for the first quarter were $42.2 million compared to $36.1 million last year. The increase over the prior year was primarily associated with advertising for CytoSport products in the Specialty Foods segment.
Equity and earnings of affiliate was $1.7 million in the first quarter versus $4.7 million last year. Charges associated with the exit of international joint business -- joint venture businesses totaling $9.5 million offset improved performance from our MegaMex Foods joint venture.
Interest and investment income was $1.1 million for the first quarter compared to $1.2 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year.
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.7% versus 34.4% in fiscal 2014. We expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35% for fiscal year 2015.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 263.7 million shares. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270.1 million shares. We did not repurchase shares during the first quarter. We have 8.2 million shares remaining to be repurchased from the current authorization in place.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at $250 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $27.7 million compared to $37 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $175 million to $190 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.8 million compared to $31.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015.

We are looking to create innovative products, the first of which are the SKIPPY Singles items out in the marketplace. And even this quarter, SKIPPY, on an international basis, enjoyed very good results, and we're pleased with where that's heading. CytoSport is also off to a good start. I mean, a lot of activity has gone on in these first few months of ownership. We've already seen some really significant sales achievements within the food, drug and mass channel that we frankly kind of knew that HORMEL could -- would be an advantage for us bringing that skill set to that brand. And we continue to bolster efforts in some of the other channels as well, the club and specialty channels. The team is hard at work at creating the right cost structure for that overall business.

We continue to enjoy growth with our SPAM product line, have good consumer marketing against that line and continue to add flavors. So overall, we're encouraged that Grocery Products should be able to deliver growth within that segment. On the input or more cost-oriented side, I mean, we're talking about -- probably the second half of year is where we really expect Grocery Products to start showing significant year-over-year growth. That will come, in part, we think, from the top line benefit of the ad campaigns that we referenced in our earlier comments. We're in a better raw material cost picture. When you look at term costs, for example, they're much more favorable right now than they were a year ago. And we're still working through some old inventory before we can fully reflect those, but that definitely will be of help. We're -- it should be in a better position in terms of our production resources, following the closure of the Stockton plant and moving of a couple of those lines as well as some new lines of production at Dubuque that we've previously announced.

And after trying for several years, in collaboration with our partner there, we just kind of decided, ""Look, this just doesn't seem to be working for us,"" and so we've sold our interest to the partner. But no, that should not be seen as a reflection of any sort of abandonment of Asia overall. We're still very high on that.

We're off to an excellent start to our fiscal year, with adjusted net earnings up 22% from a year ago on record first quarter sales of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase over last year.In terms of segment performance, Ref",798,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We're off to an excellent start to our fiscal year, with adjusted net earnings up 22% from a year ago on record first quarter sales of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase over last year.
In terms of segment performance, Refrigerated Foods delivered a 19% increase in operating profit on a 1% sales increase. Our foodservice group achieved strong sales of branded items such as HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, HORMEL pizza toppings and MENUMASTER hams. Meat Products grew retail sales in HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays, HORMEL pepperoni and Hormel Natural Choice lunchmeat. 
In addition to this value-added product growth, lower-than-anticipated hog prices were a nice tailwind for this segment during this quarter. The combination of lower feed cost, a more mild winter and a fairly quick rebound from the PED virus that plagued the industry over the past year is resulting in an increasing domestic hog supply. Pork remains an excellent relative value to consumers, and we continue to see solid demand from our customers.
While we drove growth in our value-added Refrigerated Foods businesses, our overall sales increase was only 1%, and volume was down 3%. We reduced harvest levels by 2% compared to last year as certain market conditions did not support volume increases for much of the quarter. Also, as we announced on our last call, we dissolved our Precept Foods joint venture, which resulted in lower sales and volumes this quarter.
Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered impressive growth this quarter, exceeding our expectations, with segment profit up 56% and sales up 10% compared to last year. Results were driven by value-added sales and excellent execution throughout the segment, along with favorable commodity turkey prices and lower feed costs. JENNIE-O lean ground turkey, rotisserie turkey and premium seasoned deli turkey led sales growth this quarter. We continue to support and build the Jennie-O brand through our Make The Switch media campaign, which began running in new U.S. markets in January.
Grocery Products adjusted segment profit decreased 8% this quarter, with sales up 2%. High meat input costs and varied pricing actions in key categories hampered the growth of some of our brands. Products including SKIPPY peanut butter and HORMEL Chili were down this quarter. On a positive side, our SPAM family of products, WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips and HERDEZ salsas and sauces grew nicely during the quarter.
Grocery Products is dedicated to strengthening our brand through advertising and merchandising support, with campaigns running in the first half of the year for SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL chili and HORMEL COMPLEATS microwave meals.
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 13% and a sales increase of 34%. Excluding sales of CytoSport products, sales were up 3%. The lower operating profit was primarily driven by reduced contract manufacturing business during the quarter, which offset the incremental CytoSport results. Specialty Foods achieved solid distribution gains from Muscle Milk protein attrition products in the food, drug and mass channel over the past quarter.
International & Other adjusted segment profit increased 6%, with solid increases from both our retail and foodservice businesses in China, offset in part by lower results from SPAM exports due to high input costs and transportation challenges. First quarter sales for international were up 17%, benefiting from strong growth in China, increased SKIPPY peanut butter sales and the addition of the SKIPPY China business.
Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2015. We believe hog and grain costs will remain favorable. We expect the high turkey commodity prices, which have been beneficial over the last several months, to trend down as the year progresses. We anticipate sales of our value-added products in Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store will remain strong throughout the year.
Lower meat prices will provide input cost relief for some of our Grocery Products categories after we work through higher cost inventories. Specialty Foods will maintain its focus on maximizing CytoSport synergies, gaining distribution, igniting innovation and building the Muscle Milk brand to drive segment growth. We continue to expect the CytoSport business to deliver the $0.05 per share earnings accretion we have previously guided.
We look for Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments to contribute to our growth goals in the back half of the fiscal year. We expect International to build on its growth trajectory in China, with some challenges to its export business over the next few months offsetting a portion of that growth.
Due to our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range, excluding the nonrecurring charges, from $2.45 to $2.55 per share up to $2.50 to $2.60 per share.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter."

Excluding nonrecurring charges, non-GAAP adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $187.3 million, up 22% from net earnings of $153.3 million last year. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.69, up 21% compared to $0.57 per share a year ago.
The first quarter included pretax nonrecurring charges of $10.5 million related to the Stockton, California plant closure and $9.5 million for the exit of international joint venture businesses.
Sales for the first quarter totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion for the same period last year, a 7% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 3% from fiscal 2014.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.5% of sales compared to 7.4% for the same period last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales for fiscal 2015.
Advertising expenses for the first quarter were $42.2 million compared to $36.1 million last year. The increase over the prior year was primarily associated with advertising for CytoSport products in the Specialty Foods segment.
Equity and earnings of affiliates was $1.7 million in the first quarter versus $4.7 million last year. Charges associated with the exit of international joint business -- joint venture businesses totaling $9.5 million offset improved performance from our MegaMex Foods joint venture.
Interest and investment income was $1.1 million for the first quarter compared to $1.2 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year.
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.7% versus 34.4% in fiscal 2014. We expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35% for fiscal year 2015.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 263.7 million shares. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270.1 million shares. We did not repurchase shares during the first quarter. We have 8.2 million shares remaining to be repurchased from the current authorization in place.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at $250 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $27.7 million compared to $37 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $175 million to $190 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.8 million compared to $31.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015.

I mean, a lot of activity has gone on in these first few months of ownership. We've already seen some really significant sales achievements within the food, drug and mass channel that we frankly kind of knew that HORMEL could -- would be an advantage for us bringing that skill set to that brand. And we continue to bolster efforts in some of the other channels as well, the club and specialty channels. The team is hard at work at creating the right cost structure for that overall business.

We continue to enjoy growth with our SPAM product line, have good consumer marketing against that line and continue to add flavors. So overall, we're encouraged that Grocery Products should be able to deliver growth within its segment. On the input or more cost-oriented side, I mean, we're talking about -- probably the second half of year is where we really expect Grocery Products to start showing significant year-over-year growth. That will come, in part, we think, from the top line benefit of the ad campaigns that we referenced in our earlier comments. We're in a better raw material cost picture. When you look at term costs, for example, they're much more favorable right now than they were a year ago. And we're still working through some old inventory before we can fully reflect those, but that definitely will be of help. We're -- it should be in a better position in terms of our production resources, following the closure of the Stockton plant and moving of a couple of those lines as well as some new lines of production at Dubuque that we've previously announced.

The consumers that have found the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand are trying more items and enjoying it more often.

Segment operating profit increased by 29%, with all 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We also generated record sales of $2.3 billion, an increase of 2% over last year on a 5% volume increase.
In terms of segment performance, Refrigerated Foods grew segment profit 52%, driven by strong performance by our value-added businesses and lower pork input costs. Segment sales were down 8% this quarter despite a 1% volume increase. Lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by declining pork market values. Additionally, the dissolution of our Precept Foods joint venture announced at the beginning of the year impacts Refrigerated Foods segment sales by approximately 2.5% each quarter in fiscal 2015.
We enjoyed strong sales of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of HORMEL Pepperoni, HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays and LLOYD'S Ribs. Foodservice sales of HORMEL BACON 1, fully cooked bacon, old smokehouse bacon and HORMEL Pizza Toppings also delivered solid growth.
We launched a new AUSTIN BLUES competition style barbecued meats line in the FoodService Channel this quarter as we continue to drive innovation in the category.
Grocery Products segment profit increased 1% on a 1% increase in sales. Segment results were aided by lower pork input costs, along with strong sales growth from SPAM Luncheon Meat and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips. Sales volumes of SKIPPY Peanut Butter grew this quarter, benefiting from our new advertising campaign. However, dollars sales decreased as a result of the category price decline earlier this year, pressuring segment margins. Sales of HORMEL COMPLEATS microwave meals were lower this quarter. Grocery Products continues to drive sales by leveraging our iconic brands in new and innovative ways. We recently kicked off the coast-to-coast American tour with our food truck traveling to popular events across the country this summer, featuring SPAM creations by Food Network Chef Sonny Anderson.
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 11% and a sales increase of 32%, largely led by the recently acquired CytoSport business. During the second quarter, we announced that we will be closing the Benicia, California CytoSport manufacturing facility in June and moving portions of the production to our Century Foods operation in Wisconsin and to a third-party facility near Benicia. The plant closure of the facility negatively impacted second quarter segment results by $4.5 million. The team continues to achieve additional distribution of our MUSCLE MILK protein rich products, delivering gains in the club, food, drug, mass and convenience channels this quarter.
International & Other Segment profit increased 2%, while sales fell 7%. Improved joint venture results were mostly offset by lower exports, a result of port issues and a strong U.S. dollar during the quarter. We did experience higher sales of SPAM Luncheon Meat gift packs, which are popular gifts in South Korea during celebration of the lunar new year. Meat sales in our China operations were also up, primarily driven by growth in the foodservice business.
Jennie-O Turkey Store increased segment profit 41% and grew sales 15%. Results were driven by robust sales of value-added products and lower grain and fuel costs as compared to last year. Sales growth was led by JENNIE-O lean ground turkey and JENNIE-O rotisserie turkey.
The Midwest began experiencing significant outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in late March. To date, approximately 55 farms have been impacted that were to supply Jennie-O Turkey Store with turkeys. While we experienced modest financial impact from the outbreak in the second quarter, Jennie-O Turkey Store is estimating a loss of approximately 15% of second half sales. This sizable estimated loss of volume is not only due to bird losses over the past month, but also takes into account the fact that many of our barns remain empty under quarantine. Due to lack of internal turkey supply, we will be purchasing some additional meat from external sources but at a higher cost. We are also planning for lower sales as we are forced to rationalize some business. As a result of the turkey supply shortages, on May 5 we regrettably announced a temporary layoff of our second shift employees at our Minnesota facility. We will look forward to welcoming our team members back when bird numbers and production levels return to normal.
Our team is working closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control the spread. As always, employee safety and food safety are top priorities in our organization and we remain focused on safety even as we work through these unprecedented challenges.
Looking ahead to the second half, operating margins at Jennie-O Turkey Store will be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain, reducing expected segment operating margins in the back half to the 10% to 12% range.
refrigerated Foods should continue to benefit from strong value-added sales and lower input costs, although segment earnings growth is expected to be less robust in light of difficult comparisons to last year's third quarter. We look for Grocery Products to deliver strong segment profit growth in the back half, benefiting from lower input costs and softer prior-year comparisons. Specialty Foods is positioned for strong performance in the second half as the team has realized synergies, achieved distribution gains and ignited innovation in the recently acquired MUSCLE MILK business. We expect our International segment to deliver growth in the second half as well, with improved export sales and solid results from our China business.
Based on our assessment of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store to date and given that Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments delivered excellent results in the first half, we are maintaining our fiscal 2015 adjusted guidance range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, but expect full year earnings to be near the lower end of this range. Our balanced business model provides Hormel Foods the ability to navigate challenges such as this year's unprecedented turkey supply shortage and continue to deliver consistent growth over the long-term.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen, to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $180.2 million or $0.67 per share compared to $140.1 million or $0.52 per share a year ago.Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $2.28 billion compared",426,"Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $180.2 million or $0.67 per share compared to $140.1 million or $0.52 per share a year ago.
Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $2.28 billion compared to $2.24 billion last year, a 2% increase. Sales excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport and MegaMex products were down 3%. Lower pork prices, the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture, lower exports and the price reduction on SKIPPY peanut butter products were the primary drivers.
Volume for the second quarter was 1.29 billion pounds, increasing 5% from the same period last year. Tonnage was up 1% excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport and MegaMex products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 8.3% of sales, up from 7.4% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher this year due to employee-related expenses along with higher advertising expense. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales.
Advertising expense for the quarter was $39.5 million compared to $34.8 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the MUSCLE MILK brand, which was acquired last August.
Equity in earnings of affiliates was $7.9 million in the second quarter versus $3.6 million last year. The increase is largely the result of prior year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Foods acquisition not repeated this year and also savings associated with the exit of the international joint ventures last quarter.
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34.6% versus 34% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015 full year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 270.4 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33 million versus $31.9 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015.
Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $27.3 million, down $12.7 million compared to last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $165 million to $180 million.

Domestic demand seems to be pretty robust at this point in time. We do see that exports have fallen a bit, so we'll keep an eye on that. But it's really our value-added businesses that are driving the results for Refrigerated Foods. They didn't have a big benefit from any pork operating margins this quarter. It really was the value-added side of the portfolio that was delivering for them. They came in above our guided range, but we'll continue to monitor given the amount of volatility that can occur in that segment. So not willing to call that this is the new norm going forward.

We are still a little too early to know exactly what might be required but in talking with and just kind of studying okay what are better ways to potentially prevent this in the future and also given the fact that there seems to have been airborne introduction this time and so that may cause some added and ventilation requirements that would be different than what we've done in the past.

In terms of AI, clearly, it is a time-consuming challenge, particularly for the Jennie-O Turkey Store team, but it's not having any impact in terms of our overall team's ability to seek out M&A opportunities nor would it have any issues in regard to our ability to finance such a transaction."

We did see with the price decline, our net sale number was down. And as I mentioned in the introductory comments, that did squeeze our operating margins a little bit on SKIPPY. We're happy thus far with the performance of the ad campaign. We've been able to see demonstrable results in advertised markets that were enhanced over the nonadvertised markets and we also continue to look for new product innovation and we'll have some things to show the marketplace later this year in that regard in terms of the SKIPPY brand. Outside of the United States, so far our experience in China has been it's kind of an up-and-down quarter-to-quarter business. The second quarter wasn't particularly strong this last quarter, but in visiting with the team they're very comfortable that they will see overall growth in terms of the SKIPPY international portfolio for the second half of the year as they have programs in place to generate that. In terms of REV, we're kind of making a little bit of transition with that product. Upon advice to some of our trade customers, we've changed the case, we've changed the product packaging somewhat. We're trying to obtain a price point that we think is going to be able to stimulate the next wave of growth for that item. And so second quarter kind of was the transition quarter for that, the new products are now in the marketplace and then we're complementing that with the new ad campaign that just launched at the very end of April and early reads on that are positive, but we'll be able to give you that full report when Q3 is done."

We announced record second quarter earnings this morning of $0.67 per share, up 29% over last year. Segment operating profit increased by 29%, with all 5 segments registering gains this quarter.

Segment operating profit increased by 29%, with all 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We also generated record sales of $2.3 billion, an increase of 2% over last year on a 5% volume increase.
In terms of segment performance, Refrigerated Foods grew segment profit 52%, driven by strong performance by our value-added businesses and lower pork input costs. Segment sales were down 8% this quarter despite a 1% volume increase. Lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by declining pork market values. Additionally, the dissolution of our Precept Foods joint venture announced at the beginning of the year impacts refrigerated Foods segment sales by approximately 2.5% each quarter in fiscal 2015.
We enjoyed strong sales of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of Hormel Pepperoni, HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays and LLOYD'S Ribs. Foodservice sales of HORMEL BACON 1, Fully Cooked Bacon, Old Smokehouse bacon and Hormel Pizza Toppings also delivered solid growth.
We launched a new AUSTIN BLUES competition style barbecued meats line in the foodservice channel this quarter, as we continue to drive innovation in the category.
Grocery Products segment profit increased 1% on a 1% increase in sales. Segment results were aided by lower pork input costs, along with strong sales growth from SPAM luncheon meat and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips. Sales volumes of SKIPPY peanut butter grew this quarter, benefiting from our new advertising campaign. However, dollar sales decreased as a result of the category price decline earlier this year, pressuring segment margins. 
Sales of HORMEL COMPLEATS microwave meals were lower this quarter. Grocery Products continues to drive sales by leveraging our iconic brands in new and innovative ways. We recently kicked off the coast-to-coast SPAMERICAN Tour with our food truck traveling to popular events across the country this summer, featuring SPAM creations by Food Network Chef, Sunny Anderson.
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 11% and a sales increase of 32%, largely led by the recently acquired CytoSport business. During the second quarter, we announced that we will be closing the Benicia, California CytoSport manufacturing facility in June and moving portions of the production to our Century Foods operation in Wisconsin and to a third-party facility near Benicia. The plant closure of the facility negatively impacted second quarter segment results by $4.5 million. The team continues to achieve additional distribution of our MUSCLE MILK protein-rich products, delivering gains in the club, food, drug and mass and convenience channels this quarter.
International & Other segment profit increased 2%, while sales fell 7%. Improved joint venture results were mostly offset by lower exports, a result of port issues and a strong U.S. dollar during the quarter. We did experience higher sales of SPAM luncheon meat gift packs, which are popular gifts in South Korea during the celebration of the lunar new year. Meat sales in our China operations were also up, primarily driven by growth in the foodservice business.
Jennie-O Turkey Store increased segment profit 41% and grew sales 15%. Results were driven by robust sales of value-added products and lower grain and fuel costs as compared to last year. Sales growth was led by JENNIE-O lean ground turkey and JENNIE-O rotisserie turkey.
The Midwest began experiencing significant outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in late March. To date, approximately 55 farms have been impacted that were to supply Jennie-O Turkey Store with turkeys. While we experienced modest financial impact from the outbreak in the second quarter, Jennie-O Turkey Store is estimating a loss of approximately 15% of second half sales. This sizable estimated loss of volume is not only due to bird losses over the past month, but also takes into account the fact that many of our barns remain empty under quarantine. Due to lack of internal turkey supply, we will be purchasing some additional meat from external sources but at a higher cost. We are also planning for lower sales as we are forced to rationalize some business. As a result of the turkey supply shortages, on May 5, we regrettably announced a temporary layoff of our second shift employees at our favorable [ph] Minnesota facility. We look forward to welcoming our team members back when bird numbers and production levels return to normal.
Our team is working closely with government agencies and other organizations, as they study this virus and work to control the spread. As always, employee safety and food safety are top priorities in our organization and we remain focused on safety even as we work through these unprecedented challenges.
Looking ahead to the second half, operating margins at Jennie-O Turkey Store will be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain, reducing expected segment operating margins in the back half to the 10% to 12% range.
Refrigerated Foods should continue to benefit from strong value-added sales and lower input costs, although segment earnings growth is expected to be less robust in light of difficult comparisons to last year's third quarter. We look for Grocery Products to deliver strong segment profit growth in the back half, benefiting from lower input costs and softer prior year comparisons. 
Specialty Foods is positioned for strong performance in the second half as the team has realized synergies, achieved distribution gains and ignited innovation in the recently acquired MUSCLE MILK business. We expect our International segment to deliver growth in the second half as well, with improved export sales and solid results from our China business.
Based on our assessment of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store to date and given that Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments delivered excellent results in the first half, we are maintaining our fiscal 2015 adjusted guidance range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, but expect full year earnings to be near the lower end of this range. Our balanced business model provides Hormel Foods the ability to navigate challenges such as this year's unprecedented turkey supply shortage and continue to deliver consistent growth over the long term.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen, to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $180.2 million or $0.67 per share compared to $140.1 million or $0.52 per share a year ago.
Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $2.28 billion compared to $2.24 billion last year, a 2% increase. Sales excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport and MegaMex products were down 3%. Lower pork prices, the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture, lower exports and the price reduction on SKIPPY peanut butter products were the primary drivers.
Volume for the second quarter was 1.29 billion pounds, increasing 5% from the same period last year. Tonnage was up 1%, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport and MegaMex products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 8.3% of sales, up from 7.4% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher this year due to employee-related expenses along with higher advertising expense. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales.
Advertising expense for the quarter was $39.5 million compared to $34.8 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the MUSCLE MILK brand, which was acquired last August.
Equity in earnings of affiliates was $7.9 million in the second quarter versus $3.6 million last year. The increase is largely the result of prior year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Food acquisition not repeated this year and also savings associated with the exit of the international joint ventures last quarter.
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34.6% versus 34% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015 full year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 270.4 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33 million versus $31.9 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015.
Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $27.3 million, down $12.7 million compared to last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $165 million to $180 million.

We announced record second quarter earnings this morning of $0.67 per share, up 29% over last year. Segment operating profit increased by 29%, with all 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We also generated record sales of $2",1053,"Good morning, everyone. We announced record second quarter earnings this morning of $0.67 per share, up 29% over last year. Segment operating profit increased by 29%, with all 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We also generated record sales of $2.3 billion, an increase of 2% over last year on a 5% volume increase.
In terms of segment performance, Refrigerated Foods grew segment profit 52%, driven by strong performance by our value-added businesses and lower pork input costs. Segment sales were down 8% this quarter despite a 1% volume increase. Lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by declining pork market values. Additionally, the dissolution of our Precept Foods joint venture announced at the beginning of the year impacts refrigerated Foods segment sales by approximately 2.5% each quarter in fiscal 2015.
We enjoyed strong sales of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of Hormel Pepperoni, HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays and LLOYD'S Ribs. Foodservice sales of HORMEL BACON 1, Fully Cooked Bacon, Old Smokehouse bacon and Hormel Pizza Toppings also delivered solid growth.
We launched a new AUSTIN BLUES competition style barbecued meats line in the foodservice channel this quarter, as we continue to drive innovation in the category.
Grocery Products segment profit increased 1% on a 1% increase in sales. Segment results were aided by lower pork input costs, along with strong sales growth from SPAM luncheon meat and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips. Sales volumes of SKIPPY peanut butter grew this quarter, benefiting from our new advertising campaign. However, dollar sales decreased as a result of the category price decline earlier this year, pressuring segment margins. 
Sales of HORMEL COMPLEATS microwave meals were lower this quarter. Grocery Products continues to drive sales by leveraging our iconic brands in new and innovative ways. We recently kicked off the coast-to-coast SPAMERICAN Tour with our food truck traveling to popular events across the country this summer, featuring SPAM creations by Food Network Chef, Sunny Anderson.
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 11% and a sales increase of 32%, largely led by the recently acquired CytoSport business. During the second quarter, we announced that we will be closing the Benicia, California CytoSport manufacturing facility in June and moving portions of the production to our Century Foods operation in Wisconsin and to a third-party facility near Benicia. The planned closure of the facility negatively impacted second quarter segment results by $4.5 million. The team continues to achieve additional distribution of our MUSCLE MILK protein-rich products, delivering gains in the club, food, drug and mass and convenience channels this quarter.
International & Other segment profit increased 2%, while sales fell 7%. Improved joint venture results were mostly offset by lower exports, a result of port issues and a strong U.S. dollar during the quarter. We did experience higher sales of SPAM luncheon meat gift packs, which are popular gifts in South Korea during the celebration of the lunar new year. Meat sales in our China operations were also up, primarily driven by growth in the foodservice business.
Jennie-O Turkey Store increased segment profit 41% and grew sales 15%. Results were driven by robust sales of value-added products and lower grain and fuel costs as compared to last year. Sales growth was led by JENNIE-O lean ground turkey and JENNIE-O rotisserie turkey.
The Midwest began experiencing significant outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in late March. To date, approximately 55 farms have been impacted that were to supply Jennie-O Turkey Store with turkeys. While we experienced modest financial impact from the outbreak in the second quarter, Jennie-O Turkey Store is estimating a loss of approximately 15% of second half sales. This sizable estimated loss of volume is not only due to bird losses over the past month, but also takes into account the fact that many of our barns remain empty under quarantine. Due to lack of internal turkey supply, we will be purchasing some additional meat from external sources but at a higher cost. We are also planning for lower sales as we are forced to rationalize some business. As a result of the turkey supply shortages, on May 5, we regrettably announced a temporary layoff of our second shift employees at our Faribault, Minnesota facility. We look forward to welcoming our team members back when bird numbers and production levels return to normal.
Our team is working closely with government agencies and other organizations, as they study this virus and work to control the spread. As always, employee safety and food safety are top priorities in our organization and we remain focused on safety even as we work through these unprecedented challenges.
Looking ahead to the second half, operating margins at Jennie-O Turkey Store will be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain, reducing expected segment operating margins in the back half to the 10% to 12% range.
Refrigerated Foods should continue to benefit from strong value-added sales and lower input costs, although segment earnings growth is expected to be less robust in light of difficult comparisons to last year's third quarter. We look for Grocery Products to deliver strong segment profit growth in the back half, benefiting from lower input costs and softer prior year comparisons. 
Specialty Foods is positioned for strong performance in the second half as the team has realized synergies, achieved distribution gains and ignited innovation in the recently acquired MUSCLE MILK business. We expect our International segment to deliver growth in the second half as well, with improved export sales and solid results from our China business.
Based on our assessment of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store to date and given that Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments delivered excellent results in the first half, we are maintaining our fiscal 2015 adjusted guidance range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, but expect full year earnings to be near the lower end of this range. Our balanced business model provides Hormel Foods the ability to navigate challenges such as this year's unprecedented turkey supply shortage and continue to deliver consistent growth over the long term.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen, to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $180.2 million or $0.67 per share compared to $140.1 million or $0.52 per share a year ago.
Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $2.28 billion compared to $2.24 billion last year, a 2% increase. Sales excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport and MegaMex products were down 3%. Lower pork prices, the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture, lower exports and the price reduction on SKIPPY peanut butter products were the primary drivers.
Volume for the second quarter was 1.29 billion pounds, increasing 5% from the same period last year. Tonnage was up 1%, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport and MegaMex products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 8.3% of sales, up from 7.4% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher this year due to employee-related expenses along with higher advertising expense. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales.
Advertising expense for the quarter was $39.5 million compared to $34.8 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the MUSCLE MILK brand, which was acquired last August.
Equity in earnings of affiliates was $7.9 million in the second quarter versus $3.6 million last year. The increase is largely the result of prior year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Food acquisition not repeated this year and also savings associated with the exit of the international joint ventures last quarter.
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year.
Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34.6% versus 34% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015 full year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 270.4 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33 million versus $31.9 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015.
Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $27.3 million, down $12.7 million compared to last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $165 million to $180 million.

So we have tried to factor in that somewhat, but also are expecting that the thing should slow down during the summer. The fall is a wildcard in terms of if and when it comes back. In terms of next year, and we really are not in a position to give you any quantifiable new range for Jennie-O or for the whole company for that matter, we're just beginning our planning process. But I do believe it would be fair to say that, at this point, the outlook for the first half of the year for Jennie-O Turkey Store should be somewhat subdued based on the issues that you've raised. I mean, it's going to take them some time to get back into full production. I just -- I can't tell you whether that 10% to 12% range, although we gave you for the second half, is the right range for the first half yet, but it probably will be something short of what we experienced this year."

In terms of ramped up CapEx, I think the theory that you've laid out is probably correct. We're still a little too early to know exactly what might be required but in talking with AHF [ph] and then -- and just kind of study, okay, what are better ways to potentially prevent this in the future and also given the fact that there seems to have been airborne introduction this time and so that may cause some added stand and ventilation requirements that will be different than what we've done in the past.

Earlier today, we announced record third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, up 10% over last year with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We generated sales of $2.2 billion, a decrea",932,"Thank you, Jana, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, up 10% over last year with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We generated sales of $2.2 billion, a decrease of 4% versus last year on a 3% volume increase. Sales were lower due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork markets, primarily impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments. 
To illustrate the dramatic change in pork markets, the average USDA pork cutout price in July of 2014 was $133 compared to $83 in July of 2015, almost a 40% decrease. While across the company, our team is generally focused on our goal of 5% top line growth, in this particular market scenario, volume growth may be the more appropriate metric by which to gauge results. I will now take you through each segment.
Refrigerated Foods finalized the purchase of Applegate near the end of the third quarter on July 30, 2015. I am pleased to welcome the Applegate team to Hormel Foods. Refrigerated Foods grew operating profit 9%, inclusive of incurring $8.6 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of Applegate. Results were driven by lower pork input cost and strong performance by our value-added retail and foodservice businesses. Refrigerated Foods sales were down 11% this quarter despite a 2% volume increase. As I mentioned earlier, lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by the declining pork market values. We enjoyed strong sales growth of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of Hormel Pepperoni and HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays and Foodservice sales of HORMEL Natural Choice deli meats and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats.
Grocery products delivered an excellent segment profit increase of 57% on an 8% sales increase. Segment results were driven by favorable raw material cost and increased sales of SKIPPY Peanut Butter, HORMEL Chili and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE refrigerated dips. WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis in the single-serve container have been a key driver to the brand's growth this past year. They squarely meet consumer's desires for portable, better-for-use snacking options.
Grocery Products continues to build brand equity and drive sales with marketing sport were key items. Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit decreased 45% and sales decreased 12%. Results were impacted by a high pathogens avian influenza, as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now repopulated approximately 2/3 of the farms previously impacted, and we expect to complete the repopulation process during the fourth quarter.
While we have been able to purchase some turkey meets from other suppliers to partially offset flock losses, Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to estimate approximately 15% lower sales in the fourth quarter versus last year, similar to the sales impacting the third quarter.
Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks. Our Specialty Foods segment reported a robust operating profit increase of 79%. Improvements to the cost structure in the CytoSport and Century Foods operations, along with stronger performance in our specialty products business, benefited results this quarter. Specialty Foods segment sales increased 31%, largely driven by the recently acquired CytoSport business.
The CytoSport team has achieved additional distribution of MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products with baked gains coming from one of our most recent product introductions, MUSCLE MILK Pro series. Innovation is a top priority for our CytoSport business, and we look forward to the launches some great new items currently in the pipeline for our MUSCLE MILK brand.
International and Other segment profit increased 3% while sales declined 6%. Higher royalties on sales of our SPAM family of products, strong performance by our China businesses and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter drove the profit gains. However, sales and margins were hampered by significantly lower pork exports due to soft demand in key markets in East Asia.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Refrigerated Foods to benefit from value-added sales increases and lower input costs. We look for Grocery products to deliver another quarter of strong segment profit growth with favorable raw material cost and volume growth in key categories. Jennie-O Turkey Store will continue to be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain. However, we do anticipate modest margin improvement as compared to third quarter results.
Specialty Foods should finish the year well based on the fast pace growth and improved cost structure of our recently acquired MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. And we expect our International segment to continue to face headwinds in the pork export markets over the near-term, partially offset with anticipated gains from our China businesses.
Given the strong results through 3 quarters, along with our positive outlook for Refrigerated Foods, grocery products and Specialty Foods as we close the year, and better visibility of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store in the near term, we are raising our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP earnings guidance range from $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up to $2.57 to $2.63 per share.
I am proud of our experienced team as we have demonstrated our ability to navigate on an unprecedented raw material supply challenge and still be on track to deliver another double-digit increase in earnings in fiscal 2015. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $146.9 million or $0.54 per share, compared to $138 million or $0.51 per share a year ago. Excluding the impact of Applegate-related transaction cost of $8.6 million, non-GAAP earnings were $0.56 per share.
Consistent with our guidance given on the announcement of the deal, we expect the Applegate acquisition to be net neutral to fiscal 2015 earnings. The bulk of deal-related expenses have been booked in the third quarter. The non-GAAP adjusted earnings guidance just provided of $2.57 to $2.63 per share for fiscal 2015 assumes this neutral impact on a full year basis for the Applegate acquisition.
Dollars sales for the third quarter totaled $2.19 billion compared to $2.28 billion last year, a 4% decrease. Sales excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate and MegaMex products that were not included in last year's results were down 10%. Lower pork prices, lower turkey supply and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declines compared to last year.
Volume for the third quarter was 1.21 billion pounds, increasing 3% from the same period last year. Tonnage was down 2%, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate and MegaMex products not included in last year's results.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 8.4% of sales, up from 6.7% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher compared to last year, due to increased advertising expense, the Applegate deal costs and employee-related expenses.
For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales. Advertising expenses for the quarter were $34 million compared to $21 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the MUSCLE MILK brand, which was acquired last August, as well as increased HORMEL brand support in the Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products segment compared to last year.
Equity and earnings of affiliates was $6.4 million in the third quarter versus $3.5 million last year. The increase is largely the result of prior year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Food business not repeated this year, as well as the -- as well as savings associated with the exit from the international joint ventures businesses announced in the first quarter of this year.
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.6% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, we expect the expected tax rate to be 34.5% and 35%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 264.3 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 270.6 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.3 million versus $33.5 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2015.
Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. The Applegate acquisition was funded in July with cash and $350 million of short-term debt. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $41.8 million, up from $34.8 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $155 million to $165 million. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Levi?"

We have taken the opportunity to combine the previous manufacturing capabilities in Venetia with the spider was Wisconsin-based entry operation, and you're seeing some of the benefit of that already being reflected in the Q3 results. Another key area of gains has just been the general management of the business in terms of organizing the sales and marketing structures and so forth. And then a lot of top line benefit. I mean, the business is growing very nicely. We've been able to gain distribution in the food, drug and mass channel. We've been able to rejuvenate the portfolio in the specialty channel. We continue to enjoy an excellent relationship with Pepsi in terms of distribution into the convenience channel and also parts of the food, drug and mass. The MUSCLE MILK franchise, on a Nielsen basis, the ready-to-drink items grew in the high single-digit levels and the powder items grew double digits. And so that's all contributing to very solid results, and I do believe this new level of performance for Specialty Foods should be repeatable in Q4."

No, I mean, we're really happy with the performance of the China group. I mean, you look back even 4 years ago, that business was not making money or maybe barely making money, and this year's going to be a solidly double-digit returning in its entity. We provide niche products in that market, particularly to the foodservice channel. Obviously, SKIPPY will be another retail-based item. And so a lot to us, at least so far, the macro level things going on with their currency and their stock market and so forth, we really have not seen any detrimental impact to our sales capabilities or our margins in our business. In terms of exports, it was a more challenging quarter for international. We've had some port issues. Obviously, there was the U.S. port issues earlier in the year, that was less of an effect in Q3. We continue to have Philippine-based port issues, though that did impact Q3 results. We've seen a little bit of a turndown in demand in some of the key Asian markets, particularly Korea and China, that we sell some of our products to. So that was a more challenging areas. I mean, typically, for the last 4 years, you've seen international deliver top line and bottom line double-digit growth, and we clearly haven't done that's the last couple of quarters. So we need to turn that around. But notwithstanding that, I mean, China is growing double digits. SKIPPY is growing double digits. So we're very high on what international should be able to achieve overall."

And then we have a lot of our portfolio that just doesn't move quite as rapidly with changes in market conditions, such as the items Jeff called out the pepperoni and the party tray business. We're fully expecting hog supplies to continue to increase for the balance of the year. Exports will remain a wildcard, if you will, like I think the USDA's calling for them to be up over 4% for the year when they're down 4% through June. So we'll see if that happens or not. Pork operating margins have been lower than last year. We saw extremely high results last year in our third quarter. We're expecting them to be neutral to our results for the fourth quarter. So that's kind of my take on the port markets. Hopefully, I answered all your questions."

We are filling up the barns, by there is clearly us at least a little bit of risk associated with that. We've certainly -- we've heard a similar theory as to perhaps birds go south faster than they come north and they may not linger as long in the areas. And so that might be a positive factor. But I mean, at this point, it's just such a wildcard. I mean, that this was an unprecedented incident already. We're trying to learn from it. The government is trying to learn from it. It could hit other parts of the country. It could hit another time of the year. It could go away. It could come back in a smaller manner. And so we're trying to be ready for any contingency. The best I can tell you right now is we haven't had a system outbreak since early June. And that frankly, even if something they hit this fall, it won't affect 2015 results because I mean, you just wouldn't see the loss of flow that quickly. But by the time we're talking about in November, we should have a much better sense of whether something seems to be occurring on a fall basis of this year and not -- and what potential impact that might have. Even if nothing occurs, however, as we indicated last call, I mean, with the 22-week life span and with egg shortages and so forth, we're expecting volume struggles even in the first half of next year until we cycle through this."

In terms of the EBITDA drop, I mean, I really don't have a way of quantifying exactly what's what.

Earlier today, we announced record third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, up 10% over last year with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter.

Earlier today, we announced record third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, up 10% over last year with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We generated sales of $2.2 billion, a decrease of 4% versus last year on a 3% volume increase. Sales were lower due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork markets primarily impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments. 
To illustrate the dramatic change in pork markets, the average USDA pork cutout price in July of 2014 was $133 compared to $83 in July of 2015, almost a 40% decrease. While across the company, our team is generally focused on our goal of 5% top line growth, in this particular market scenario, volume growth may be the more appropriate metric by which to gauge results. 
I will now take you through each segment.
Refrigerated Foods finalized the purchase of Applegate near the end of the third quarter on July 13, 2015. I am pleased to welcome the Applegate team to Hormel Foods. Refrigerated Foods grew operating profit 9%, inclusive of incurring $8.6 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of Applegate. Results were driven by lower pork input cost and strong performance by our value-added retail and foodservice businesses. 
Refrigerated Foods sales were down 11% this quarter despite a 2% volume increase. As I mentioned earlier, lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by the declining pork market values. 
We enjoyed strong sales growth of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of Hormel Pepperoni and HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays and foodservice sales of HORMEL Natural Choice deli meats and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats.
Grocery products delivered an excellent segment profit increase of 57% on an 8% sales increase. Segment results were driven by favorable raw material costs and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL Chili and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE refrigerated dips. WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis in a single-serve container have been a key driver to the brand's growth this past year. They squarely meet consumers' desires for portable, better-for-you snacking options. Grocery Products continues to build brand equity and drive sales with marketing support for key items. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit decreased 45% and sales decreased 12%. Results were impacted by  high-pathogen avian influenza as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now repopulated approximately 2/3 of the farms previously impacted, and we expect to complete the repopulation process during the fourth quarter. While we have been able to purchase some turkey meat from other suppliers to partially offset flock losses, Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to estimate approximately 15% lower sales in the fourth quarter versus last year, similar to the sales impact in the third quarter. Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks. 
Our Specialty Foods segment reported a robust operating profit increase of 79%. Improvements to the cost structure in the CytoSport and Century Foods operations, along with stronger performance in our Specialty Products business, benefited results this quarter. Specialty Foods segment sales increased 31%, largely driven by the recently acquired CytoSport business.
The CytoSport team has achieved additional distribution of MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products with big gains coming from one of our more recent product introductions, MUSCLE MILK Pro Series. Innovation is a top priority for our CytoSport business, and we look forward to the launch of some great new items currently in the pipeline for our MUSCLE MILK brand.
International and Other segment profit increased 3% while sales declined 6%. Higher royalties on sales of our SPAM family of products, strong performance by our China businesses and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter drove the profit gains. However, sales and margins were hampered by significantly lower pork exports due to soft demand in key markets in East Asia.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Refrigerated Foods to benefit from value-added sales increases and lower input costs. We look for Grocery Products to deliver another quarter of strong segment profit growth with favorable raw material costs and volume growth in key categories. Jennie-O Turkey Store will continue to be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain. However, we do anticipate modest margin improvement as compared to third quarter results.
Specialty Foods should finish the year well based on the fast-paced growth and improved cost structure of our recently acquired MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. And we expect our International segment to continue to face headwinds in the pork export markets over the near term, partially offset with anticipated gains from our China businesses.
Given the strong results through 3 quarters, along with our positive outlook for Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods as we close the year and better visibility of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store in the near term, we are raising our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP earnings guidance range from $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up to $2.57 to $2.63 per share. I am proud of our experienced team as we have demonstrated our ability to navigate an unprecedented raw material supply challenge and still be on track to deliver another double-digit increase in earnings in fiscal 2015. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $146.9 million or $0.54 per share compared to $138 million or $0.51 per share a year ago. Excluding the impact of Applegate-related transaction costs of $8.6",571,"Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. 
Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $146.9 million or $0.54 per share compared to $138 million or $0.51 per share a year ago. Excluding the impact of Applegate-related transaction costs of $8.6 million, non-GAAP earnings were $0.56 per share.
Consistent with our guidance given on the announcement of the deal, we expect the Applegate acquisition to be net neutral to fiscal 2015 earnings. The bulk of deal-related expenses have been booked in the third quarter. The non-GAAP adjusted earnings guidance just provided of $2.57 to $2.63 per share for fiscal 2015 assumes this neutral impact on a full year basis for the Applegate acquisition.
Dollars sales for the third quarter totaled $2.19 billion compared to $2.28 billion last year, a 4% decrease. Sales, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate and MegaMex products that were not included in last year's results, were down 10%. Lower pork prices, lower turkey supply and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declines compared to last year.
Volume for the third quarter was 1.21 billion pounds, increasing 3% from the same period last year. Tonnage was down 2%, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate and MegaMex products not included in last year's results.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 8.4% of sales, up from 6.7% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher compared to last year due to increased advertising expense, the Applegate deal costs and employee-related expenses. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales. 
Advertising expenses for the quarter were $34 million compared to $21 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the MUSCLE MILK brand, which was acquired last August, as well as increased HORMEL brand support in the Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products segments compared to last year.
Equity in earnings of affiliates was $6.4 million in the third quarter versus $3.5 million last year. The increase was largely the result of prior year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Food business not repeated this year as well as the -- as well as savings associated with the exit from the international joint venture businesses announced in the first quarter of this year.
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.6% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34.5% and 35%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 264.3 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 270.6 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.3 million versus $33.5 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2015.
Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. The Applegate acquisition was funded in July with cash and $350 million of short-term debt.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $41.8 million, up from $34.8 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $155 million to $165 million.

They're a manufacturer on the powdered side of that business. We have taken the opportunity to combine the previous manufacturing capabilities in Benicia with the Sparta, Wisconsin-based Century operation, and you're seeing some of the benefit of that already being reflected in the Q3 results. Another key area of gains has just been the general management of the business in terms of organizing the sales and marketing structures and so forth. And then a lot of top line benefit. I mean, the business is growing very nicely. We've been able to gain distribution in the food, drug and mass channel. We've been able to rejuvenate the portfolio in the specialty channel. We continue to enjoy an excellent relationship with Pepsi in terms of distribution into the convenience channel and also parts of the food, drug and mass. The MUSCLE MILK franchise, on a Nielsen basis, the ready-to-drink items grew in the high single-digit levels and the powder items grew double digits. And so that's all contributing to very solid results, and I do believe this new level of performance for Specialty Foods should be repeatable in Q4."

No, I mean, we're really happy with the performance of the China group. I mean, you look back even 4 years ago, that business was not making money or maybe barely making money, and this year it's going to be a solidly double-digit-returning entity. We provide niche products in that market, particularly to the foodservice channel. Obviously, SKIPPY would be another retail-based item. And so a lot -- to us, at least so far, the macro-level things going on with their currency and their stock market and so forth, we really have not seen any detrimental impact to our sales capabilities or our margins on that business. In terms of exports, it was a more challenging quarter for International. We've had some port issues. Obviously, there were the U.S. port issues earlier in the year. That was less of an effect in Q3. We continue to have Philippine-based port issues, though, that did impact Q3 results. We've seen a little bit of a turndown in demand in some of the key Asian markets, particularly Korea and China that we sell some of our products to. So that was the more challenging areas. I mean, typically, for the last 4 years, you've seen International deliver top line and bottom line double-digit growth, and we clearly haven't done that the last couple of quarters. So we need to turn that around. But notwithstanding that, I mean, China is growing double digits, SKIPPY is growing double digits. So we're very high on what International should be able to achieve overall."

I think the USDA is calling for them to be up over 4% for the year when they're down 4% through June. So we'll see if that happens or not. Pork operating margins have been lower than last year.

So I think there's a big contingent of us on The Street that's looking for you guys to really kind of lever up your balance sheet. But to me, it sounds like you've taken on some short-term debt to fund that, and you probably will pay that off with cash flow in the next 12 months. Is that how we should be thinking about that? I'm just trying to model your interest heading into '16."

It could hit other parts of the country. It could hit another time of year. It could go away. It could come back in a smaller manner. And so we're trying to be ready for any contingency. So the best I can tell you right now is we haven't had a system outbreak since early June and that frankly, even if something did hit this fall, it won't affect 2015 results because, I mean, what -- you just wouldn't see the loss of bird flow that quickly. But by the time we're talking again in November, we should have a much better sense of whether something seems to be occurring on a fall basis this year or not and what potential impact that might have.

In terms of the EBITDA drop, I mean, I really don't have a way of quantifying exactly what's what. I mean, it's -- there were some costs in the Lyre [ph] production system that were reimbursed by the government. There were some costs that weren't. When you're that short in volume in your plants, that creates all sorts of overhead issues. When you literally don't have product to sell, I mean, you're losing that margin and that volume.

Earlier today, we announced record third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, up 10% over last year, with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter.

Earlier today, we announced record third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, up 10% over last year, with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We generated sales of $2.2 billion, a decrease of 4% versus last year on a 3% volume increase. Sales were lower due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork markets, primarily impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments. 
To illustrate the dramatic change in pork markets, the average USDA pork cutout price in July of 2014 was $133, compared to $83 in July of 2015, almost a 40% decrease. While across the company, our team is generally focused on our goal of 5% top line growth, in this particular market scenario, volume growth may be the more appropriate metric by which to gauge results. 
I will now take you through each segment.
Refrigerated Foods finalized the purchase of Applegate near the end of the third quarter on July 13, 2015. I am pleased to welcome the Applegate team to Hormel Foods. Refrigerated Foods grew operating profit 9%, inclusive of incurring $8.6 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of Applegate. Results were driven by lower pork input cost and strong performance by our value-added retail and foodservice businesses. 
Refrigerated Foods sales were down 11% this quarter despite a 2% volume increase. As I mentioned earlier, lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by the declining pork market values. 
We enjoyed strong sales growth of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of Hormel Pepperoni and HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays and foodservice sales of Hormel Natural Choice deli meats and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats.
Grocery Products delivered an excellent segment profit increase of 57% on an 8% sales increase. Segment results were driven by favorable raw material costs and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL Chili and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE refrigerated dips. WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis in a single-serve container have been a key driver to the brand's growth this past year. They squarely meet consumers' desires for portable, better-for-you snacking options. Grocery Products continues to build brand equity and drive sales with marketing support for key items. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit decreased 45% and sales decreased 12%. Results were impacted by  high-pathogen avian influenza, as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now repopulated approximately 2/3 of the farms previously impacted, and we expect to complete the repopulation process during the fourth quarter. While we have been able to purchase some turkey meat from other suppliers to partially offset flock losses, Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to estimate approximately 15% lower sales in the fourth quarter versus last year, similar to the sales impact in the third quarter. Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks. 
Our Specialty Foods segment reported a robust operating profit increase of 79%. Improvements to the cost structure in the CytoSport and Century Foods operations, along with stronger performance in our Specialty Products business, benefited results this quarter. Specialty Foods segment sales increased 31%, largely driven by the recently acquired CytoSport business.
The CytoSport team has achieved additional distribution of MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products with big gains coming from one of our more recent product introductions, MUSCLE MILK Pro Series. Innovation is a top priority for our CytoSport business, and we look forward to the launch of some great new items currently in the pipeline for our MUSCLE MILK brand.
International and Other segment profit increased 3% while sales declined 6%. Higher royalties on sales of our SPAM family of products, strong performance by our China businesses and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter drove the profit gains. However, sales and margins were hampered by significantly lower pork exports due to soft demand in key markets in East Asia.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Refrigerated Foods to benefit from value-added sales increases and lower input costs. We look for Grocery Products to deliver another quarter of strong segment profit growth with favorable raw material costs and volume growth in key categories. Jennie-O Turkey Store will continue to be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain. However, we do anticipate modest margin improvement as compared to third quarter results.
Specialty Foods should finish the year well based on the fast-paced growth and improved cost structure of our recently acquired MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. And we expect our International segment to continue to face headwinds in the pork export markets over the near term, partially offset with anticipated gains from our China businesses.
Given the strong results through 3 quarters, along with our positive outlook for Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods as we close the year and better visibility of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store in the near term, we are raising our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP earnings guidance range from $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up to $2.57 to $2.63 per share. I am proud of our experienced team as we have demonstrated our ability to navigate an unprecedented raw material supply challenge and still be on track to deliver another double-digit increase in earnings in fiscal 2015. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

The bulk of deal-related expenses have been booked in the third quarter. The non-GAAP adjusted earnings guidance just provided of $2.57 to $2.63 per share for fiscal 2015 assumes this neutral impact on a full year basis for the Applegate acquisition.
Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $2.19 billion, compared to $2.28 billion last year, a 4% decrease. Sales, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate and MegaMex products that were not included in last year's results, were down 10%. Lower pork prices, lower turkey supply and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declines compared to last year.
Volume for the third quarter was 1.21 billion pounds, increasing 3% from the same period last year. Tonnage was down 2%, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate and MegaMex products not included in last year's results.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 8.4% of sales, up from 6.7% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher compared to last year due to increased advertising expense, the Applegate deal costs and employee-related expenses. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales. 
Advertising expenses for the quarter were $34 million, compared to $21 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the MUSCLE MILK brand, which was acquired last August, as well as increased HORMEL brand support in the Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products segments compared to last year.
Equity in earnings of affiliates was $6.4 million in the third quarter versus $3.5 million last year. The increase was largely the result of prior year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Food business not repeated this year as well as the -- as well as savings associated with the exit from the international joint venture businesses announced in the first quarter of this year.
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.6% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34.5% and 35%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 264.3 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 270.6 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.3 million versus $33.5 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2015.
Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. The Applegate acquisition was funded in July with cash and $350 million of short-term debt.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $41.8 million, up from $34.8 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $155 million to $165 million.

They're a manufacturer on the powdered side of that business. We have taken the opportunity to combine the previous manufacturing capabilities in Benicia with the Sparta, Wisconsin-based Century operation, and you're seeing some of the benefit of that already being reflected in the Q3 results. Another key area of gains has just been the general management of the business in terms of organizing the sales and marketing structures and so forth. And then a lot of top line benefit. I mean, the business is growing very nicely. We've been able to gain distribution in the food, drug and mass channel. We've been able to rejuvenate the portfolio in the specialty channel. We continue to enjoy an excellent relationship with Pepsi in terms of distribution into the convenience channel and also parts of the food, drug and mass. The MUSCLE MILK franchise, on a Nielsen basis, the ready-to-drink items grew in the high single-digit levels and the powder items grew double digits. And so that's all contributing to very solid results, and I do believe this new level of performance for Specialty Foods should be repeatable in Q4."

No, I mean, we're really happy with the performance of the China group. I mean, you look back even 4 years ago, that business was not making money or maybe barely making money, and this year it's going to be a solidly double-digit-returning entity. We provide niche products in that market, particularly to the foodservice channel. Obviously, SKIPPY would be another retail-based item. And so a lot -- to us, at least so far, the macro-level things going on with their currency and their stock market and so forth, we really have not seen any detrimental impact to our sales capabilities or our margins on that business. In terms of exports, it was a more challenging quarter for International. We've had some port issues. Obviously, there were the U.S. port issues earlier in the year. That was less of an effect in Q3. We continue to have Philippine-based port issues, though, that did impact Q3 results. We've seen a little bit of a turndown in demand in some of the key Asian markets, particularly Korea and China, that we sell some of our products to. So that was the more challenging areas. I mean, typically, for the last 4 years, you've seen International deliver top line and bottom line double-digit growth, and we clearly haven't done that the last couple of quarters. So we need to turn that around. But notwithstanding that, I mean, China is growing double digits, SKIPPY is growing double digits. So we're very high on what International should be able to achieve overall."

I think the USDA is calling for them to be up over 4% for the year when they're down 4% through June. So we'll see if that happens or not. Pork operating margins have been lower than last year.

Earlier today, we announced record third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, up 10% over last year, with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We generated sales of $2.2 billion, a decre",931,"Thank you, Jana, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, up 10% over last year, with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We generated sales of $2.2 billion, a decrease of 4% versus last year on a 3% volume increase. Sales were lower due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork markets, primarily impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments. 
To illustrate the dramatic change in pork markets, the average USDA pork cutout price in July of 2014 was $133 compared to $83 in July of 2015, almost a 40% decrease. While across the company, our team is generally focused on our goal of 5% top line growth, in this particular market scenario, volume growth may be the more appropriate metric by which to gauge results. 
I will now take you through each segment. Refrigerated Foods finalized the purchase of Applegate near the end of the third quarter on July 13, 2015. I am pleased to welcome the Applegate team to Hormel Foods. Refrigerated Foods grew operating profit 9%, inclusive of incurring $8.6 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of Applegate. Results were driven by lower pork input cost and strong performance by our value-added retail and foodservice businesses. 
Refrigerated Foods sales were down 11% this quarter despite a 2% volume increase. As I mentioned earlier, lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by the declining pork market values. 
We enjoyed strong sales growth of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of Hormel Pepperoni and HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays and foodservice sales of Hormel Natural Choice deli meats and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats.
Grocery Products delivered an excellent segment profit increase of 57% on an 8% sales increase. Segment results were driven by favorable raw material costs and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL Chili and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE refrigerated dips. WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis in a single-serve container have been a key driver to the brand's growth this past year. They squarely meet consumers' desires for portable, better-for-you snacking options. Grocery Products continues to build brand equity and drive sales with marketing support for key items. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit decreased 45% and sales decreased 12%. Results were impacted by high-pathogen avian influenza, as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now repopulated approximately 2/3 of the farms previously impacted, and we expect to complete the repopulation process during the fourth quarter. While we have been able to purchase some turkey meat from other suppliers to partially offset flock losses, Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to estimate approximately 15% lower sales in the fourth quarter versus last year, similar to the sales impact in the third quarter. Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks. 
Our Specialty Foods segment reported a robust operating profit increase of 79%. Improvements to the cost structure in the CytoSport and Century Foods operations, along with stronger performance in our Specialty Products business, benefited results this quarter. Specialty Foods segment sales increased 31%, largely driven by the recently acquired CytoSport business.
The CytoSport team has achieved additional distribution of MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products with big gains coming from one of our more recent product introductions, MUSCLE MILK Pro Series. Innovation is a top priority for our CytoSport business, and we look forward to the launch of some great new items currently in the pipeline for our MUSCLE MILK brand.
International and Other segment profit increased 3% while sales declined 6%. Higher royalties on sales of our SPAM family of products, strong performance by our China businesses and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter drove the profit gains. However, sales and margins were hampered by significantly lower pork exports due to soft demand in key markets in East Asia.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Refrigerated Foods to benefit from value-added sales increases and lower input costs. We look for Grocery Products to deliver another quarter of strong segment profit growth with favorable raw material costs and volume growth in key categories. Jennie-O Turkey Store will continue to be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain. However, we do anticipate modest margin improvement as compared to third quarter results.
Specialty Foods should finish the year well based on the fast-paced growth and improved cost structure of our recently acquired MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. And we expect our International segment to continue to face headwinds in the pork export markets over the near term, partially offset with anticipated gains from our China businesses.
Given the strong results through 3 quarters, along with our positive outlook for Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods as we close the year and better visibility of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store in the near term, we are raising our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP earnings guidance range from $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up to $2.57 to $2.63 per share. I am proud of our experienced team as we have demonstrated our ability to navigate an unprecedented raw material supply challenge and still be on track to deliver another double-digit increase in earnings in fiscal 2015. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $146.9 million or $0.54 per share compared to $138 million or $0.51 per share a year ago. Excluding the impact of Applegate-related transaction costs of $8.6",571,"Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. 
Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $146.9 million or $0.54 per share compared to $138 million or $0.51 per share a year ago. Excluding the impact of Applegate-related transaction costs of $8.6 million, non-GAAP earnings were $0.56 per share.
Consistent with our guidance given on the announcement of the deal, we expect the Applegate acquisition to be net neutral to fiscal 2015 earnings. The bulk of deal-related expenses have been booked in the third quarter. The non-GAAP adjusted earnings guidance just provided of $2.57 to $2.63 per share for fiscal 2015 assumes this neutral impact on a full year basis for the Applegate acquisition.
Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $2.19 billion compared to $2.28 billion last year, a 4% decrease. Sales, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate and MegaMex products that were not included in last year's results, were down 10%. Lower pork prices, lower turkey supply and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declines compared to last year.
Volume for the third quarter was 1.21 billion pounds, increasing 3% from the same period last year. Tonnage was down 2%, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate and MegaMex products not included in last year's results.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 8.4% of sales, up from 6.7% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher compared to last year due to increased advertising expense, the Applegate deal costs and employee-related expenses. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales. 
Advertising expenses for the quarter were $34 million compared to $21 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the MUSCLE MILK brand, which was acquired last August as well as increased HORMEL brand support in the Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products segments compared to last year.
Equity in earnings of affiliates was $6.4 million in the third quarter versus $3.5 million last year. The increase was largely the result of prior year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Food business not repeated this year as well as the -- as well as savings associated with the exit from the international joint venture businesses announced in the first quarter of this year.
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.6% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34.5% and 35%.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 264.3 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 270.6 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.3 million versus $33.5 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2015.
Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. The Applegate acquisition was funded in July with cash and $350 million of short-term debt.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $41.8 million, up from $34.8 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $155 million to $165 million.

They're a manufacturer on the powdered side of that business. We have taken the opportunity to combine the previous manufacturing capabilities in Benicia with the Sparta, Wisconsin-based Century operation, and you're seeing some of the benefit of that already being reflected in the Q3 results. Another key area of gains has just been the general management of the business in terms of organizing the sales and marketing structures and so forth. And then a lot of top line benefit. I mean, the business is growing very nicely. We've been able to gain distribution in the food, drug and mass channel. We've been able to rejuvenate the portfolio in the specialty channel. We continue to enjoy an excellent relationship with Pepsi in terms of distribution into the convenience channel and also parts of the food, drug and mass. The MUSCLE MILK franchise, on a Nielsen basis, the ready-to-drink items grew in the high single-digit levels and the powder items grew double digits. And so that's all contributing to very solid results, and I do believe this new level of performance for Specialty Foods should be repeatable in Q4."

No, I mean, we're really happy with the performance of the China group. I mean, you look back even 4 years ago, that business was not making money or maybe barely making money, and this year it's going to be a solidly double-digit-returning entity. We provide niche products in that market, particularly to the foodservice channel. Obviously, SKIPPY would be another retail-based item. And so a lot -- to us, at least so far, the macro-level things going on with their currency and their stock market and so forth, we really have not seen any detrimental impact to our sales capabilities or our margins on that business. In terms of exports, it was a more challenging quarter for International. We've had some port issues. Obviously, there were the U.S. port issues earlier in the year. That was less of an effect in Q3. We continue to have Philippine-based port issues, though, that did impact Q3 results. We've seen a little bit of a turndown in demand in some of the key Asian markets, particularly Korea and China, that we sell some of our products to. So that was the more challenging areas. I mean, typically, for the last 4 years, you've seen International deliver top line and bottom line double-digit growth, and we clearly haven't done that the last couple of quarters. So we need to turn that around. But notwithstanding that, I mean, China is growing double digits, SKIPPY is growing double digits. So we're very high on what International should be able to achieve overall."

But to me, it sounds like you've taken on some short-term debt to fund that, and you probably will pay that off with cash flow in the next 12 months. Is that how we should be thinking about that? I'm just trying to model your interest heading into '16."

It could hit other parts of the country. It could hit another time of year. It could go away. It could come back in a smaller manner. And so we're trying to be ready for any contingency. So the best I can tell you right now is we haven't had a system outbreak since early June and that frankly, even if something did hit this fall, it won't affect 2015 results because, I mean, what -- you just wouldn't see the loss of bird flow that quickly. But by the time we're talking again in November, we should have a much better sense of whether something seems to be occurring on a fall basis this year or not and what potential impact that might have.

In terms of the EBITDA drop, I mean, I really don't have a way of quantifying exactly what's what. I mean, it's -- there were some costs in the layer [ph] production system that were reimbursed by the government. There were some costs that weren't. When you're that short in volume in your plants, that creates all sorts of overhead issues. When you literally don't have product to sell, I mean, you're losing that margin and that volume.

Sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, down 6%. Fo",971,"Thanks very much, Jana, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong finish to fiscal 2015. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $0.74 per share, up 17% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, down 6%. For the full year, the company earned an adjusted $2.64 per share, representing an 18% increase over fiscal 2014. On an adjusted basis, all 5 segments registered earnings growth this year.
Sales for the full year were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1%. Lower sales for the quarter and the year were primarily due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork market, impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments.
I will now take you through each segment. Grocery Products operating profit was up 57% in the quarter. Normalized input costs and improved productivity drove the gains. Sales grew 4% this quarter, led by SKIPPY peanut butter, DINTY MOORE stew, HORMEL Chili and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips. For the year, adjusted segment profit was up 23%, and sales were up 4%.
We're especially pleased with the sales growth of our SKIPPY peanut butter products given our price decrease in the peanut butter category earlier this year. We continue to build momentum in our snacking portfolio, with excellent results from our WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis along with positive early reads on our most recent innovation, SKIPPY PB bites.
Refrigerated Foods fourth quarter segment profit increased 27%, with sales down 5% and volume, up 2%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was up 26%, and sales decreased 6% on a volume increase of 1%. Results in the fourth quarter were driven by nice increases by affiliated foods businesses, higher pork operating margins, the addition of the Applegate business and an improved product mix. Our Refrigerated Foods team had a heightened focus on margin expansion this year and has made nice strides. Lower dollar sales reflect price reductions on some items compared to last year's record high pork markets and the dissolution of Precept Foods, the latter of which we will have lapped after this quarter.
Our foodservice group continues to deliver innovative solutions for food-service operators, with notable growth on items such as our HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats and Hormel pizza toppings.
On the retail side of the business, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel refrigerated entrees and HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays delivered sales gains this quarter. We have owned the Applegate business for a few months now, and we are pleased with its performance, constrained partially by the availability of pork and turkey raw materials during the quarter. The Applegate team remains on track to deliver results consistent with our initial guidance for this business.
Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit declined 23% on an 18% sales decrease. For the full year, operating profit was up 1%, and sales decreased 2%. Results were impacted by high passage in avian influenza, as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now completed the repopulation of all of our turkey barns. We have not experienced any new outbreaks thus far into the fall migration of wild birds.
While we have been able to purchase some turkey meat to partially offset flock losses, turkey breast prices remain at a record high due to overall industry shortages. Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks and with our customers as we manage through that turkey breast meat shortages.
We have made many adjustments and are prepared to minimize any future impact to our operations in the event that the virus returns to our area as the migration season progresses.
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an adjusted operating profit increase of 155%. MUSCLE MILK sport nutrition product sales increased nicely, though the gain was not enough to offset some reductions in Contract Packaging sales, leading to a net 3% decrease in overall segment sales this quarter.
Full year results for Specialty Foods showed adjusted operating profit of 48%, with sales up 22%. The positive fourth quarter segment profit results reflect synergies captured within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain and a beneficial comparison to last year's CytoSport acquisition-related costs of $9.3 million. The CytoSport acquisition is meeting our valuation expectations.
We have decided to explore the sale of a portion of our Diamond Crystal Brands business. While the business is still performing acceptably, we feel it no longer fits within our strategic priorities. We will pursue a sale over the course of the next few months, allowing us to redeploy capital in investments that better support our growth goals.
International fourth quarter operating profit increased 3% on flat dollar sales and a 5% higher volume. Results were driven by strong SPAM luncheon meat exports and continued growth of our China business, muted by soft demand for fresh pork exports in certain markets. 
For the full year, adjusted operating profits in the International segment was up 4% on flat sales. In October, the leader of our International segment for the past 3 years, Jim Snee, was elected to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer and was appointed to our Board of Directors. Jim is only the 10th President in our company's 124-year history. In his new capacity, Jim will be responsible for all 5 reporting segments, while the finance sanctions including M&A, R&D, legal, supply chain and human resources will continue to report to me. Jim's vast experience in both our Refrigerated Foods segment and our emerging growth markets internationally position him exceptionally well to take on these additional responsibilities.
I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our long-term segment margin guidance and 2016 outlook."

Grocery Products should benefit from improved pork and beef input costs this year, especially as compared to the first half of 2015, along with positive sales trends for our key product lines, including WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips, SKIPPY peanut butter and our SPAM family of products, we have made significant improvements in manufacturing efficiencies over this past year, giving us the confidence to raise our long-term Grocery Products segment operating guidance from 12% to 14% up to the 13% to 15% range going forward.
Our value-added businesses in Refrigerated Foods should benefit from favorable raw material costs, and the segment is positioned to start the year with strong earnings momentum. We expect modestly lower pork operating margins and hog prices in 2016 and plan to increase pork production by 1% to 2% over fiscal 2015. While Refrigerated Foods clearly benefited from favorable market conditions in 2015, our team has also made significant progress in their efforts to improve product mix and drive sustainable margin improvement. Given these advancements, we are increasing our long-term segment profit margin range from 5% to 8% up to 7% to 10% going forward. 
We look for Jennie-O Turkey Store to return to growth in the back half the year if there are no significant recurrences of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Volumes will remain constrained in the early part of the year, as we continue to rebuild our system after significant bird losses last spring. In addition to lower volumes, Jennie-O Turkey store is also facing difficult comparisons to fiscal 2015's strong first half performance. We expect turkey breast meat prices to remain elevated until the industry can see the impact of the spring bird migration. Lower grain input costs will be a tailwind in 2016.
In terms of long-term segment profit margin guidance, we are modestly tightening our guidance range for Jennie-O Turkey Store, previously at 13% to 17% narrowed to 14% to 17%. 
We expect the Specialty Foods segment to deliver increases through the growth of our MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. Protein nutrition products remain on trend, and promising new products in our innovation pipeline for this category should continue to drive success. Our long-term segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods remains at 8% to 11%. Though we are encouraged to see their upward migration within this range, the range does include contributions from the Diamond Crystal Brands business. If a sale occurs, we will provide an updated guidance range for this segment. 
We look for International segment to achieve year-over-year improved results through increase sales of our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products, along with expansion of our China business. We are maintaining our long-term International segment margin guidance at 14% to 17%. From a total company perspective, in light of the improved ranges mentioned, we are increasing our operating profit margin's range from 9% to 12% to a new range of a 13 -- 10% to 13%, reflecting our current business structure product mix and typical market volatility.
Supporting our brands remains a top focus for us. In 2016, we are planning a double-digit increase in advertising support over the prior year. We will focus advertising dollars on rev snack wraps, HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays, Hormel Pepperoni, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, MUSCLE MILK protein rich products. And in the back of the year, we expect to reignite our Jennie-O Make The Switch campaign. The MegaMex joint venture will also continue to provide significant marketing support to the WHOLLY and brands of Mexican food products.
We also plan to reinvest in our business through higher capital investments in fiscal 2016. We expect to complete the construction of our new plant in Joshing, China and start production there by the end of 2016. 
Here in the U.S., we intend to increase capacity for our Hormel bacon products and Jennie-O fresh turkey tray pack items. Additionally, we plan to expand our research and development capabilities through the construction of a new facility to support our team's constant focus on food safety, quality and innovation.
After taking these significant factors into account, we have established our fiscal 2016 earnings guidance range at $2.85 to $2.95 per share.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015."

On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $187.2 million, up 9% over last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.69, a 10% increase.Excluding non-recurring charges, adjuste",996,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $187.2 million, up 9% over last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.69, a 10% increase.
Excluding non-recurring charges, adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $199.9 million, up 17% from net earnings of $171.3 million last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.74, up 17% compared to $0.63 per share a year ago.
As Jeff mentioned, we have made the decision to sell a portion of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. This business has now been classified as held for sale, and asset impairment tests were performed as part of the evaluation process. The fourth quarter included pretax non-recurring charges of $21.5 million relating to a goodwill impairment charge for this business, and it is reflected in our Specialty Foods segment. We also had a positive $8.9 million adjustment due to a reduction of a contingent consideration liability related to the CytoSport acquisition. This adjustment was due to an updated evaluation of the earnout target associated with the acquisition. The CytoSport earnout agreement requires aggressive financial targets to be met, and sales got off to a slower start than anticipated in the earnout. To be clear, CytoSport continues to meet the base business case used in our evaluation.
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $2.64, representing an 18% increase over last year, with all 5 segments contributing to the earnings growth. Sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.5 billion for the same period last year, a 6% decrease. Sales were down 10%, excluding the incremental impact of Applegate and MegaMex products not included in last year's results. Lower pork prices, turkey supply shortages due to high-pass avian influenza and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declined compared to last year. For the full year, dollar sales were $9.3 billion, down less than 1% compared to last year.
Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales for the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. For the full year, volume was 5.1 billion pounds, up 2% over the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 7.9% of sales compared to 6.5% last year. For the full year, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8% of sales compared to 7% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales for fiscal 2016.
Advertising expense for the fourth quarter was $29.6 million compared to $22.4 million last year. Full year 2015 advertising expense was $145 million compared to $114 million last year. Equity and earnings of affiliates was $8 million in the fourth quarter versus $5.7 million last year. The increase is largely the result of improved earnings at our MegaMex joint venture. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $3.4 million last year. Year-to-date interest expense was $13.1 million, up from $12.7 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $14 million for fiscal 2016. 
Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35.2% versus 34.1% in fiscal 2014. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 35% compared to 34.3% last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 34%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 264.3 million and 264.1 million, respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 270.9 million and 270.5 million shares, respectively. 
We repurchased 400,000 shares of common stock spending $24.9 million in the fourth quarter. We have 7.8 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year.
During the fourth quarter, we paid down $165 million of the $350 million short-term debt associated with the Applegate acquisition. The remaining $185 million is expected to be repaid in fiscal 2016. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $47.3 million, unchanged from last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $144.1 million compared to $159.1 million last year. The primary driver for the lower capital expenditures was our decision to delay the additional capacity for Jennie-O fresh tray pack products in the face of lower turkey supply in 2015. We plan to move forward with this project in 2016, assuming there are no significant recurrences of avian influenza.
For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million, as several projects and process during 2015 are completed in 2016, including the construction of our new plant in China and the other projects Jim mentioned earlier.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $34.4 million compared to $32.9 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $133 million compared to $130 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2016.
As Jim mentioned earlier, we have established our fiscal earnings guidance range at $2.85 to $2.95 per share for 2016. This guidance includes a full year of contributions from our Diamond Crystal Brands. When a sale of the business occurs, we will provide updated earnings guidance. 
Fiscal 2016 also includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. We have assumed the 53rd week will contribute approximately 1% of the earnings increase over last year in our guidance range.
We announced the $0.16 per share increase to the annual dividend, making a new dividend $1.16 per share. This represents a 16% increase on top of a 25% increase last year and marks the 50th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend rate.

This is Jeff. So in terms of the current quarter, on the Grocery Products side, what we feel we're seeing is kind of a return to normalized margins in terms of some of the raw material inputs, coupled with some systemic changes in our overall operations environment where we feel we've added efficiencies that will stick, and that we attribute that to the strong quarter that just generated. And also that was why we have now increased that earnings guidance range by 1% on either end for the Grocery Products group. In the case of Jennie-O Turkey Store, you'll recall, we provided kind of our best shot with a second half adjusted guidance range will be in light of avian influenza and had pulled the range down to the 10% to 12% range. We certainly did see better returns on that in the fourth quarter. On the aggregate for the half, it turned out to be closer to 14%. They were able to do better on some of the dark meat-based items than we had originally anticipated, and they did a nice job of obtaining as much efficiency as possible in their operation. In case of the Jennie-O Turkey Store, you'll see we're clearly not changing the upper end of the guidance range, but we did tighten up the bottom and partial in light partially to their success and being able to achieve what they did this quarter. The only other thing I guess I would add in terms of the long-term product range it is clearly the Refrigerated Foods with their performance this year broke out of the previous range that we ratified the 8% range and they exceeded 9% this year. We have confidence in that business unit's ability to maintain margins and grow them over time from that level. And hence, we've raised that guidance range to the 7% to 10% range. Specialty Foods has seen improvement within the range, as Jim indicated in his comments, but the overall results for the year are still within the guidance range we had previously provided. So we're leaving that unchanged, especially with the BCB issues still lurking out there. Overall, what we've felt added up was kind of 100 basis point change in the total company margins. And so we're looking at now 10% to 13% as being what we think we can look at going forward versus the 9% to 12% we've previously provided."

The affiliated part of Refrigerated Foods, which is our Farmer John Birkin dance price operations, all had excellent years and contributed nicely to the results. And they, too, as I mentioned, in Grocery, we've tried to attain some long-term efficiencies. Refrigerated Foods is certainly not been quite in that respect also.

We were able to completely refill our barns. But as we talked about before, the primary turkey for most of our value-added items is our Tom turkey. That's a 22-week market cycle, and so we will not be kind of fully back to normalized volumes, the earliest the second quarter of fiscal 2016. That being said, the team has done the best job they can with making sure that we have the product allocated fairly among our customers in terms of what was -- what is available.

Last year, 2015 was a struggle with the pork export, especially with our international business. One of the bigger contributing factors was when Russia banned the imports from the European Union, that supply had to go somewhere, and it did find its way into the Asian market in general at some more favorable currency rates. And so more supply, favorable rates, really we're almost a perfect storm against us last year. Certainly, the opening up of the China market and the approval of our plants, while we don't export port directly into the China markets because of their ractopamine -- or lack of ractopamine requirement, what we do think it will do though is really maybe redistribute to the supply of the available product. And so as we're looking into 2016 for our pork exports in the International business specifically, we think sometime in the second quarter, the back half of the year, we'll be able to return to more normalized levels of our export business, which is still a very important part for our overall international business."

I mean, it ranges from apparently our mixed brands were that the retailer was certainly seeking to attain some margins out of their whole turkey sales, all the way to kind of the more historical treatment. Frankly, a lot of retailers use it as a loss leader. And so you'll see a price out there, and you might think that's breathtakingly low sometimes, yet that's not necessarily what are value up to them. It's up to our retailer to decide how to price the product. In the aggregate, we came up with as many whole birds as we could for this year given the shortages we were kind of fronted with and allocated them out on a national basis. In terms of your question about pricing in general and the guidance, we -- fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest quarter. You get your most favorable feed conversion and so forth in your birds. You do have the added bump, if you will, of kind of a Thanksgiving sales rolling through.

We are pleased to report a strong finish to fiscal 2015. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $0.74 per share, up 17% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, down 6%. Fo",971,"Thanks very much, Jana, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong finish to fiscal 2015. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $0.74 per share, up 17% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, down 6%. For the full year, the company earned an adjusted $2.64 per share, representing an 18% increase over fiscal 2014. On an adjusted basis, all 5 segments registered earnings growth this year.
Sales for the full year were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1%. Lower sales for the quarter and the year were primarily due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork market impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments.
I will now take you through each segment. Grocery Products operating profit was up 57% in the quarter. Normalized input costs and improved productivity drove the gains. Sales grew 4% this quarter, led by SKIPPY peanut butter, Dinty Moore stew, HORMEL Chili and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips. For the year, adjusted segment profit was up 23%, and sales were up 4%.
We're especially pleased with the sales growth of our SKIPPY peanut butter products given our price decrease in the peanut butter category earlier this year. We continue to build momentum in our snacking portfolio with excellent results from our Wholly Guacamole minis along with positive early reads on our most recent innovation, SKIPPY P.B. bites.
Refrigerated Foods fourth quarter segment profit increased 27% with sales down 5% and volume up 2%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was up 26%, and sales decreased 6% on a volume increase of 1%. 
Results in the fourth quarter were driven by nice increases by our affiliated foods businesses, higher pork operating margins, the addition of the Applegate business and an improved product mix. Our Refrigerated Foods team had a heightened focus on margin expansion this year and has made nice strides. Lower dollar sales reflect price reductions on some items compared to last year's record high pork markets and the dissolution of Precept Foods, the latter of which we will have lapped after this quarter.
Our foodservice group continues to deliver innovative solutions for foodservice operators with notable growth on items such as our HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats and Hormel Pizza Toppings.
On the retail side of the business, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel Refrigerated Entrees and HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays delivered sales gains this quarter. 
We have owned the Applegate business for a few months now and we are pleased with its performance, constrained partially by the availability of pork and turkey raw materials during the quarter. The Applegate team remains on track to deliver results consistent with our initial guidance for this business.
Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit declined 23% on an 18% sales decrease. For the full year, operating profit was up 1% and sales decreased 2%. Results were impacted by high pathogen avian influenza as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now completed the repopulation of all of our turkey barns. We have not experienced any new outbreaks thus far into the fall migration of wild birds.
While we have been able to purchase some turkey meat to partially offset flock losses, turkey breast prices remain at a record high due to overall industry shortages. Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks and with our customers as we manage through the turkey breast meat shortages.
We have made many adjustments and are prepared to minimize any future impact to our operations in the event that the virus returns to our area as the migration season progresses.
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an adjusted operating profit increase of 155%. MUSCLE MILK sport nutrition product sales increased nicely, though the gain was not enough to offset some reductions in Contract Packaging sales, leading to a net 3% decrease in overall segment sales this quarter. 
Full year results for Specialty Foods showed adjusted operating profit of 48% with sales up 22%. 
The positive fourth quarter segment profit results reflect synergies captured within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain and a beneficial comparison to last year's CytoSport acquisition-related costs of $9.3 million. The CytoSport acquisition is meeting our valuation expectations.
We have decided to explore the sale of a portion of our Diamond Crystal Brands business. While the business is still performing acceptably, we feel it no longer fits within our strategic priorities. We will pursue a sale over the course of the next few months, allowing us to redeploy capital in investments that better support our growth goals.
International's fourth quarter operating profit increased 3% on flat dollar sales and a 5% higher volume. Results were driven by strong SPAM luncheon meat exports and continued growth of our China business, muted by soft demand for fresh pork exports in certain markets. 
For the full year, adjusted operating profit in the International segment was up 4% on flat sales. 
In October, the leader of our International segment for the past 3 years, Jim Snee, was elected to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer and was appointed to our Board of Directors. Jim is only the 10th president in our company's 124-year history. In his new capacity, Jim will be responsible for all 5 reporting segments while the finance functions including M&A, R&D, legal, supply chain and human resources will continue to report to me. Jim's vast experience in both our Refrigerated Foods segment and our emerging growth markets internationally position him exceptionally well to take on these additional responsibilities.
I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our long-term segment margin guidance and 2016 outlook."

Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect renewed revenue growth as the year proceeds. Grocery Products should benefit from improved pork and beef input costs this year especially as compared to the first half of 2015. Along with positive sales trends for our key product lines including WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips, SKIPPY peanut butter and our SPAM family of products, we have made significant improvements in manufacturing efficiencies over this past year giving us the confidence to raise our long-term Grocery Products segment operating guidance from 12% to 14% up to the 13% to 15% range going forward.
Our value-added businesses in Refrigerated Foods should benefit from favorable raw material costs and the segment is positioned to start the year with strong earnings momentum. We expect modestly lower pork operating margins and hog prices in 2016 and plan to increase pork production by 1% to 2% over fiscal 2015. While Refrigerated Foods clearly benefited from favorable market conditions in 2015, our team has also made significant progress in their efforts to improve product mix and drive sustainable margin improvement. Given these advancements, we are increasing our long-term segment profit margin range from 5% to 8% up to 7% to 10% going forward. 
We look for Jennie-O Turkey Store to return to growth in the back half the year if there are no significant recurrences of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Volumes will remain constrained in the early part of the year as we continue to rebuild our system after significant bird losses last spring. In addition to lower volumes, Jennie-O Turkey store is also facing difficult comparisons to fiscal 2015's strong first half performance. We expect turkey breast meat prices to remain elevated until the industry can see the impact of the spring bird migration. Lower grain input costs will be a tailwind in 2016. In terms of long-term segment profit margin guidance, we are modestly tightening our guidance range for Jennie-O Turkey Store, previously at 13% to 17% narrowed to 14% to 17%. 
We expect the Specialty Foods segment to deliver increases through the growth of our MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. Protein nutrition products remain on trend and promising new products in our innovation pipeline for this category should continue to drive success. Our long-term segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods remains at 8% to 11%. Though we are encouraged to see their upward migration within this range, the range does include contributions from the Diamond Crystal Brands business. If a sale occurs, we will provide an updated guidance range for this segment. 
We look for the International segment to achieve year-over-year improved results through increased sales of our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products, along with expansion of our China business. We are maintaining our long-term International segment margin guidance at 14% to 17%. 
From a total company perspective, in light of the improved ranges mentioned, we are increasing our operating profit margin's range from 9% to 12% to a new range of 13 -- 10% to 13%, reflecting our current business structure product mix and typical market volatility.
Supporting our brands remains a top focus for us. In 2016, we are planning a double-digit increase in advertising support over the prior year. We will focus advertising dollars on REV snack wraps, HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays, Hormel Pepperoni, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, MUSCLE MILK protein rich products, and in the back of the year, we expect to reignite our Jennie-O Make The Switch campaign. The MegaMex joint venture will also continue to provide significant marketing support to the WHOLLY and HERDEZ brands of Mexican food products.
We also plan to reinvest in our business through higher capital investments in fiscal 2016. We expect to complete the construction of our new plant in Jiaxing, China and start production there by the end of 2016. Here in the U.S., we intend to increase capacity for our HORMEL bacon products and Jennie-O fresh turkey tray pack items. 
Additionally, we plan to expand our research and development capabilities through the construction of a new facility to support our team's constant focus on food safety, quality and innovation.
After taking these significant factors into account, we have established our fiscal 2016 earnings guidance range at $2.85 to $2.95 per share.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015."

Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.74, up 17% compared to $0.63 per share a year ago.
As Jeff mentioned, we have made the decision to sell a portion of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. This business has now been classified as held for sale and asset impairment tests were performed as part of the evaluation process. The fourth quarter included pretax nonrecurring charges of $21.5 million relating to a goodwill impairment charge for this business and it is reflected in our Specialty Foods segment. 
We also had a positive $8.9 million adjustment due to a reduction of a contingent consideration liability related to the CytoSport acquisition. This adjustment was due to an updated evaluation of the earn-out target associated with the acquisition. The CytoSport earn-out agreement requires aggressive financial targets to be met and sales got off to a slower start than anticipated in the earn-out. To be clear, CytoSport continues to meet the base business case used in our valuation.
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $2.64, representing an 18% increase over last year with all 5 segments contributing to the earnings growth. 
Sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.5 billion for the same period last year, a 6% decrease. Sales were down 10% excluding the incremental impact of Applegate and MegaMex products not included in last year's results. Lower pork prices, turkey supply shortages due to high path avian influenza and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declines compared to last year. For the full year, dollar sales were $9.3 billion, down less than 1% compared to last year.
Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales for the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. For the full year, volume was 5.1 billion pounds, up 2% over the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 7.9% of sales compared to 6.5% last year. For the full year, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8% of sales compared to 7% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales for fiscal 2016.
Advertising expense for the fourth quarter was $29.6 million compared to $22.4 million last year. Full year 2015 advertising expense was $145 million compared to $114 million last year. 
Equity and earnings of affiliates was $8 million in the fourth quarter versus $5.7 million last year. The increase is largely the result of improved earnings at our MegaMex joint venture. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $3.4 million last year. Year-to-date interest expense was $13.1 million, up from $12.7 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $14 million for fiscal 2016. 
Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35.2% versus 34.1% in fiscal 2014. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 35% compared to 34.3% last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 34%. 
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 264.3 million and 264.1 million, respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 270.9 million and 270.5 million shares, respectively. 
We repurchased 400,000 shares of common stock, spending $24.9 million in the fourth quarter. We have 7.8 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. 
Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. 
During the fourth quarter, we paid down $165 million of the $350 million short-term debt associated with the Applegate acquisition. The remaining $185 million is expected to be repaid in fiscal 2016. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $47.3 million, unchanged from last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $144.1 million compared to $159.1 million last year. The primary driver for the lower capital expenditures was our decision to delay the addition of capacity for Jennie-O fresh tray pack products in the face of lower turkey supply in 2015. We plan to move forward with this project in 2016 assuming there are no significant recurrences of avian influenza.
For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million as several projects in process during 2015 are completed in 2016 including the construction of our new plant in China and the other projects Jim mentioned earlier.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $34.4 million compared to $32.9 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $133 million compared to $130 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2016.
As Jim mentioned earlier, we have established our fiscal earnings guidance range at $2.85 to $2.95 per share for 2016. This guidance includes a full year of contributions from our Diamond Crystal Brands. When a sale of the business occurs, we will provide updated earnings guidance. 
Fiscal 2016 also includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. We have assumed the 53rd week will contribute approximately 1% of the earnings increase over last year in our guidance range.
We announced a $0.16 per share increase to the annual dividend making the new dividend $1.16 per share. This represents a 16% increase on top of a 25% increase last year and marks the 50th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend rate.

This is Jeff. So in terms of the current quarter, on the Grocery Products side, what we feel we're seeing is kind of a return to normalized margins in terms of some of the raw material inputs, coupled with some systemic changes in our overall operations environment where we feel we've added efficiencies that will stick and that -- we attribute that to the strong quarter they just generated and also that was why we have now increased that earnings guidance range by 1% on either end for the Grocery Products group. In the case of Jennie-O Turkey Store, you'll recall we provided kind of our best shot at what a second half adjusted guidance range would be in light of avian influenza and had pulled the range down to the 10% to 12% range. We certainly did see better returns on that in the fourth quarter. On the aggregate, for the half, it turned out to be closer to 14%. They were able to do better on some of the dark meat-based items than we had originally anticipated and they did a nice job of obtaining as much efficiency as possible in their operation. In the case of the Jennie-O Turkey Store, you'll see we really are not changing the upper end of the guidance range, but we did tighten up the bottom end in light partially to their success and being able to achieve what they did this quarter. The only other thing, I guess, I would add in terms of the long-term product ranges is clearly the Refrigerated Foods group with their performance this year broke out of the previous range, the 5% to 8% range, and they exceeded 9% this year. We have confidence in that business unit's ability to maintain margins and grow them over time from that level. And hence, we've raised that guidance range to the 7% to 10% range. Specialty Foods has seen improvement within the range, as Jim indicated in his comments, but the overall results for the year are still within the guidance range we had previously provided. So we're leaving that unchanged, especially with the DCB issues still lurking out there. Overall, what we felt it added up to was kind of 100 basis point change in the total company margins and so we're looking at now 10% to 13% as being what we think we can look at going forward versus the 9% to 12% we had previously provided."

We mentioned some of the brands that did well in the release, pepperoni and party trays and entrées for the Refrigerated Foods retail group and then on the foodservice side, pizza toppings and fire braised meats and other items. The affiliated part of Refrigerated Foods, which is our Farmer John, Burke and Dan's Prize operations, all had excellent years and contributed nicely to the results. And they, too, as I mentioned, with Grocery, we've tried to attain some long-term efficiencies. Refrigerated Foods certainly has not been quiet in that respect also and so it all really adds up to that new level that they're now able to attain."

That's a 22-week market cycle and so we will not be kind of fully back to normalized volumes. The earliest, the second quarter of fiscal 2016. That being said, the team has done the best job they can with making sure that we have the product allocated fairly among our customers in terms of what was -- what is available.

One of the bigger contributing factors was when Russia banned the imports from the European Union. That supply had to go somewhere and it did find its way into the Asian market in general at some more favorable currency rates. And so more supply, favorable rates, really were almost a perfect storm against us last year. Certainly, the opening up of the China market and the approval of our plants, while we don't export pork directly into the China markets because of their ractopamine -- or lack of ractopamine requirement, what we do think it'll do though is really maybe redistribute the supply of the available product. And so as we're looking into 2016 for our pork exports in the International business specifically, we think sometime in the second quarter, the back half of the year, we'll be able to return to more normalized levels of our export business, which is still a very important part to our overall international business."

I mean, we were the one that's advertising, we're the company that creates innovative new products, we have a dedicated team that focuses on the sale of those items into multiple channels. And so, yes, definitely, if we have the supply in place, that team is primed and ready to renew our momentum of growing the value-added businesses, indeed.

Our experience in the past has been that when you're on buying programs for those types of items, you really don't get a whole extra week. I mean, a lot of them are on monthly programs and so forth and so we're just kind of trying to provide the guidance based on what our best experience has been. I would say, though, there is a certain element of reinvestment going on. I mean, we've been stepping our brand spend on an annualized basis and this current plan is no exception to that. We have a number of brands that we're excited about that we think we can continue to build momentum in the marketplace and so there's a little bit of element in general of us making sure we're reinvesting in our brands."

I mean, first of all, Robert, when it comes to the whole bird pricing, I mean, it's a relatively small percentage of the overall results of the business and you're also dealing with something that's very retailer-specific and retailer-dependent. I mean, it ranges from apparently you had an experience where the retailer was certainly seeking to attain some margins out of their whole turkey sales all the way to kind of the more historical treatment, frankly, as a lot of retailers use it as a loss leader. And so you'll see a price out there and you might think that's breathtakingly low sometimes, yet that's not necessarily what our value was in to them. It's up to our retailer to decide how to price the product. In the aggregate, we came up with as many whole birds as we could for this year, given the shortages we were kind of fronted with and allocated them out on a national basis. In terms of your question about pricing in general and the guidance, we -- fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest quarter. You could hear most favorable feed conversion and so forth in your birds. You do have the added bump, if you will, of kind of a Thanksgiving sales rolling through. We know we're going to be short product again in Q1. We're certainly going to try to perform as strong as we can where we're going to be comparing against a very robust performance by Jennie-O Turkey Store in Q1 and Q2 in fiscal 2015. So we're comfortable that Jennie-O will be a solid contributor to the guidance range that we've provided you on an aggregate basis with most of it coming in the second half of the year."

We are pleased to report a strong finish to fiscal 2015. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $0.74 per share, up 17% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, down 6%. Fo",971,"Thanks very much, Jana, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong finish to fiscal 2015. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $0.74 per share, up 17% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, down 6%. For the full year, the company earned an adjusted $2.64 per share, representing an 18% increase over fiscal 2014. On an adjusted basis, all 5 segments registered earnings growth this year.
Sales for the full year were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1%. Lower sales for the quarter and the year were primarily due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork market impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments.
I will now take you through each segment. Grocery Products operating profit was up 57% in the quarter. Normalized input costs and improved productivity drove the gains. Sales grew 4% this quarter, led by SKIPPY peanut butter, Dinty Moore stew, HORMEL Chili and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips. For the year, adjusted segment profit was up 23%, and sales were up 4%.
We're especially pleased with the sales growth of our SKIPPY peanut butter products given our price decrease in the peanut butter category earlier this year. We continue to build momentum in our snacking portfolio with excellent results from our Wholly Guacamole minis along with positive early reads on our most recent innovation, SKIPPY P.B. bites.
Refrigerated Foods fourth quarter segment profit increased 27% with sales down 5% and volume up 2%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was up 26%, and sales decreased 6% on a volume increase of 1%. 
Results in the fourth quarter were driven by nice increases by our affiliated foods businesses, higher pork operating margins, the addition of the Applegate business and an improved product mix. Our Refrigerated Foods team had a heightened focus on margin expansion this year and has made nice strides. Lower dollar sales reflect price reductions on some items compared to last year's record high pork markets and the dissolution of Precept Foods, the latter of which we will have lapped after this quarter.
Our foodservice group continues to deliver innovative solutions for foodservice operators with notable growth on items such as our HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats and Hormel Pizza Toppings.
On the retail side of the business, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel Refrigerated Entrees and HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays delivered sales gains this quarter. 
We have owned the Applegate business for a few months now and we are pleased with its performance, constrained partially by the availability of pork and turkey raw materials during the quarter. The Applegate team remains on track to deliver results consistent with our initial guidance for this business.
Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit declined 23% on an 18% sales decrease. For the full year, operating profit was up 1% and sales decreased 2%. Results were impacted by high pathogen avian influenza, as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now completed the repopulation of all of our turkey barns. We have not experienced any new outbreaks thus far into the fall migration of wild birds.
While we have been able to purchase some turkey meat to partially offset flock losses, turkey breast prices remain at a record high due to overall industry shortages. Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks, and with our customers as we manage through the turkey breast meat shortages.
We have made many adjustments and are prepared to minimize any future impact to our operations in the event that the virus returns to our area as the migration season progresses.
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an adjusted operating profit increase of 155%. MUSCLE MILK sport nutrition product sales increased nicely, though the gain was not enough to offset some reductions in Contract Packaging sales, leading to a net 3% decrease in overall segment sales this quarter. 
Full year results for Specialty Foods showed adjusted operating profit up 48% with sales up 22%. 
The positive fourth quarter segment profit results reflect synergies captured within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain and a beneficial comparison to last year's CytoSport acquisition-related costs of $9.3 million. The CytoSport acquisition is meeting our valuation expectations.
We have decided to explore the sale of a portion of our Diamond Crystal Brands business. While the business is still performing acceptably, we feel it no longer fits within our strategic priorities. We will pursue a sale over the course of the next few months, allowing us to redeploy capital in investments that better support our growth goals.
International's fourth quarter operating profit increased 3% on flat dollar sales and a 5% higher volume. Results were driven by strong SPAM luncheon meat exports and continued growth of our China business, muted by soft demand for fresh pork exports in certain markets. 
For the full year, adjusted operating profit in the International segment was up 4% on flat sales. 
In October, the leader of our International segment for the past few years, Jim Snee, was elected to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer and was appointed to our Board of Directors. Jim is only the 10th president in our company's 124-year history. In his new capacity, Jim will be responsible for all 5 reporting segments while the finance functions, including M&A, R&D, legal, supply chain and human resources, will continue to report to me. Jim's vast experience in both our Refrigerated Foods segment and our emerging growth markets internationally position him exceptionally well to take on these additional responsibilities.
I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our long-term segment margin guidance and 2016 outlook."

Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect renewed revenue growth as the year proceeds. Grocery Products should benefit from improved pork and beef input costs this year, especially as compared to the first half of 2015. Along with positive sales trends for our key product lines including WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips, SKIPPY peanut butter and our SPAM family of products, we have made significant improvements in manufacturing efficiencies over this past year giving us the confidence to raise our long-term Grocery Products segment operating margin guidance from 12% to 14% up to the 13% to 15% range going forward.
Our value-added businesses in Refrigerated Foods should benefit from favorable raw material costs, and the segment is positioned to start the year with strong earnings momentum. We expect modestly lower pork operating margins and hog prices in 2016 and plan to increase pork production by 1% to 2% over fiscal 2015. While Refrigerated Foods clearly benefited from favorable market conditions in 2015, our team has also made significant progress in their efforts to improve product mix and drive sustainable margin improvement. Given these advancements, we are increasing our long-term segment profit margin range from 5% to 8% up to 7% to 10% going forward. 
We look for Jennie-O Turkey Store to return to growth in the back half the year if there are no significant recurrences of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Volumes will remain constrained in the early part of the year as we continue to rebuild our system after significant bird losses last spring. In addition to lower volumes, Jennie-O Turkey Store is also facing difficult comparisons to fiscal 2015's strong first half performance. We expect turkey breast meat prices to remain elevated until the industry can see the impact of the spring bird migration. Lower grain input costs will be a tailwind in 2016. In terms of long-term segment profit margin guidance, we are modestly tightening our guidance range for Jennie-O Turkey Store, previously at 13% to 17% narrowed to 14% to 17%. 
We expect the Specialty Foods segment to deliver increases through the growth of our MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. Protein nutrition products remain on trend and promising new products in our innovation pipeline for this category should continue to drive success. Our long-term segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods remains at 8% to 11%. Though we are encouraged to see their upward migration within this range, the range does include contributions from the Diamond Crystal Brands business. If a sale occurs, we will provide an updated guidance range for this segment. 
We look for the International segment to achieve year-over-year improved results through increased sales of our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products, along with expansion of our China business. We are maintaining our long-term International segment margin guidance at 14% to 17%. 
From a total company perspective, in light of the improved ranges mentioned, we are increasing our operating profit margin's range from 9% to 12% to a new range of 13 -- 10% to 13%, reflecting our current business structure, product mix and typical market volatility.
Supporting our brands remains a top focus for us. In 2016, we are planning a double-digit increase in advertising support over the prior year. We will focus advertising dollars on REV snack wraps, HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays, Hormel Pepperoni, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, MUSCLE MILK protein-rich products, and in the back half of the year, we expect to reignite our Jennie-O Make The Switch campaign. The MegaMex joint venture will also continue to provide significant marketing support to the WHOLLY and HERDEZ brands of Mexican food products.
We also plan to reinvest in our business through higher capital investments in fiscal 2016. We expect to complete the construction of our new plant in Jiaxing, China and start production there by the end of 2016. Here in the U.S., we intend to increase capacity for our HORMEL bacon products and Jennie-O fresh turkey tray pack items. 
Additionally, we plan to expand our research and development capabilities through the construction of a new facility to support our team's constant focus on food safety, quality and innovation.
After taking these significant factors into account, we have established our fiscal 2016 earnings guidance range at $2.85 to $2.95 per share.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015."

On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $187.2 million, up 9% over last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.69, a 10% increase. Excluding nonrecurring charges, adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $199.9 million, up 17% from net earnings of $171.3 million last year. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.74, up 17% compared to $0.63 per share a year ago.
As Jeff mentioned, we have made the decision to sell a portion of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. This business has now been classified as held for sale and asset impairment tests were performed as part of the evaluation process. The fourth quarter included pretax nonrecurring charges of $21.5 million relating to a goodwill impairment charge for this business and it is reflected in our Specialty Foods segment. 
We also had a positive $8.9 million adjustment due to a reduction of a contingent consideration liability related to the CytoSport acquisition. This adjustment was due to an updated evaluation of the earn-out targets associated with the acquisition. The CytoSport earn-out agreement requires aggressive financial targets to be met and sales got off to a slower start than anticipated in the earn-out. To be clear, CytoSport continues to meet the base business case used in our valuation.
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $2.64, representing an 18% increase over last year with all 5 segments contributing to the earnings growth. 
Sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.5 billion for the same period last year, a 6% decrease. Sales were down 10% excluding the incremental impact of Applegate and MegaMex products not included in last year's results. Lower pork prices, turkey supply shortages due to high path avian influenza and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declines compared to last year. For the full year, dollar sales were $9.3 billion, down less than 1% compared to last year.
Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales for the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. For the full year, volume was 5.1 billion pounds, up 2% over the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 7.9% of sales compared to 6.5% last year. For the full year, selling, general and administrative expenses were 8% of sales compared to 7% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales for fiscal 2016.
Advertising expense for the fourth quarter was $29.6 million compared to $22.4 million last year. Full year 2015 advertising expense was $145 million compared to $114 million last year. 
Equity and earnings of affiliates was $8 million in the fourth quarter versus $5.7 million last year. The increase is largely the result of improved earnings at our MegaMex joint venture. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $3.4 million last year. Year-to-date interest expense was $13.1 million, up from $12.7 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $14 million for fiscal 2016. 
Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35.2% versus 34.1% in fiscal 2014. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 35% compared to 34.3% last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 34%. 
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 264.3 million and 264.1 million, respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 270.9 million and 270.5 million shares, respectively. 
We repurchased 400,000 shares of common stock, spending $24.9 million in the fourth quarter. We have 7.8 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. 
Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. 
During the fourth quarter, we paid down $165 million of the $350 million short-term debt associated with the Applegate acquisition. The remaining $185 million is expected to be repaid in fiscal 2016. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $47.3 million, unchanged from last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $144.1 million compared to $159.1 million last year. The primary driver for the lower capital expenditures was our decision to delay the addition of capacity for Jennie-O fresh tray pack products in the face of lower turkey supply in 2015. We plan to move forward with this project in 2016 assuming there are no significant recurrences of avian influenza.
For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million as several projects in process during 2015 are completed in 2016, including the construction of our new plant in China and the other projects Jim mentioned earlier.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $34.4 million compared to $32.9 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $133 million compared to $130 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2016.
As Jim mentioned earlier, we have established our fiscal earnings guidance range at $2.85 to $2.95 per share for 2016. This guidance includes a full year of contributions from our Diamond Crystal business. When a sale of the business occurs, we will provide updated earnings guidance. 
Fiscal 2016 also includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. We have assumed the 53rd week will contribute approximately 1% of the earnings increase over last year in our guidance range.
We announced a $0.16 per share increase to the annual dividend, making the new dividend $1.16 per share. This represents a 16% increase on top of a 25% increase last year and marks the 50th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend rate.
At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers. Operator?"

And then on the long-term targets, appreciate updating the long-term ranges, but I'm just trying to think about where you are today in especially Grocery, Refrigerated and Jennie-O still running kind of near or at the high end of the ranges that you've laid out.

This is Jeff. So in terms of the current quarter, on the Grocery Products side, what we feel we're seeing is kind of a return to normalized margins in terms of some of the raw material inputs, coupled with some systemic changes in our overall operations environment where we feel we've added efficiencies that will stick and that -- we attribute that to the strong quarter they just generated and also that was why we have now increased that earnings guidance range by 1% on either end for the Grocery Products group. In the case of Jennie-O Turkey Store, you'll recall we provided kind of our best shot at what a second half adjusted guidance range would be in light of avian influenza and had pulled the range down to the 10% to 12% range. We certainly did see better returns than that in the fourth quarter. On the aggregate, for the half, it turned out to be closer to 14%. They were able to do better on some of the dark meat-based items than we had originally anticipated and they did a nice job of obtaining as much efficiency as possible in their operation. In the case of the Jennie-O Turkey Store, you'll see we really are not changing the upper end of the guidance range, but we did tighten up the bottom end in light [ph] partially to their success and being able to achieve what they did this quarter. The only other thing I guess I would add in terms of the long-term product ranges is clearly the Refrigerated Foods group with their performance this year broke out of the previous range. We were at a 5% to 8% range, and they exceeded 9% this year. We have confidence in that business unit's ability to maintain margins and grow them over time from that level. And hence, we've raised that guidance range to the 7% to 10% range. Specialty Foods has seen improvement within the range, as Jim indicated in his comments, but the overall results for the year are still within the guidance range we had previously provided. So we're leaving that unchanged, especially with the DCB issues still lurking out there. Overall, what we felt it added up to was kind of 100 basis point change in the total company margins, and so we're looking at now 10% to 13% as being what we think we can look at going forward versus the 9% to 12% we had previously provided."

We mentioned some of the brands that did well in the release, pepperoni and party trays and entrées for the Refrigerated Foods retail group, and then on the foodservice side, pizza toppings and fire braised meats and other items. The affiliated part of Refrigerated Foods, which is our Farmer John, Burke and Dan's Prize operations, all had excellent years and contributed nicely to the results. And they, too, as I mentioned, with Grocery, we've tried to attain some long-term efficiencies. Refrigerated Foods certainly has not been quiet in that respect also, and so it all really adds up to that new level that they're now able to attain."

But as we've talked about before, the primary turkey for most of our value-added items is our tom turkeys. That's a 22-week market cycle, and so we will not be kind of fully back to normalized volumes, at the earliest, the second quarter of fiscal 2016. That being said, the team has done the best job they can with making sure that we have the product allocated fairly among our customers in terms of what was -- what is available.

One of the bigger contributing factors was when Russia banned the imports from the European Union. That supply had to go somewhere and it did find its way into the Asian market in general at some more favorable currency rates. And so more supply, favorable rates, really were almost a perfect storm against us last year. Certainly, the opening up of the China market and the approval of our plants, while we don't export pork directly into the China markets because of their ractopamine -- or lack of ractopamine requirement, what we do think it'll do though is really maybe redistribute the supply of the available product. And so as we're looking into 2016 for our pork exports in the International business specifically, we think sometime in the second quarter, the back half of the year, we'll be able to return to more normalized levels of our export business, which is still a very important part to our overall international business."

I mean, we're the one that's advertising, we're the company that creates innovative new products, we have a dedicated team that focuses on the sale of those items into multiple channels.

But second question, I look at your pricing back half the year, there is no pricing despite the fact that the industry is volume constrained. And I'm trying to think about next year for Jennie-O. Why is the pricing kind of flattish? And for next year, will it continue to be flattish? And then I'm still not quite sure I understand the cautious guidance for the first half for '16 for Jennie-O if fourth quarter came in wildly above what I had forecasted, and I understand the volume constraints, but can you give us an order of magnitude on the first half profit guidance for Jennie-O?"

I mean, first of all, Robert, when it comes to whole-bird pricing, I mean, it's a relatively small percentage of the overall results of the business and you're also dealing with something that's very retailer-specific and retailer-dependent. I mean,",290,"Okay. I mean, first of all, Robert, when it comes to whole-bird pricing, I mean, it's a relatively small percentage of the overall results of the business and you're also dealing with something that's very retailer-specific and retailer-dependent. I mean, it ranges from -- apparently you had an experience where the retailer was certainly seeking to attain some margins out of their whole turkey sales all the way to kind of the more historical treatment, frankly, as a lot of retailers use it as a loss leader. And so you'll see a price out there and you might think that's breathtakingly low sometimes, yet that's not necessarily what our value was in to them. It's up to the retailer to decide how to price the product. In the aggregate, we came up with as many whole birds as we could for this year, given the shortages we were kind of fronted with, and allocated them out on a national basis. In terms of your question about pricing in general and the guidance, we -- fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest quarter. You get your most favorable feed conversions and so forth in your birds. You do have the added bump, if you will, of kind of the Thanksgiving sales rolling through. We know we're going to be short product again in Q1. We're certainly going to try to perform as strong as we can, where we're going to be comparing against a very robust performance by Jennie-O Turkey Store in Q1 and Q2 in fiscal 2015. So we're comfortable that Jennie-O will be a solid contributor to the guidance range that we've provided you on an aggregate basis, with most of it coming in the second half of the year."

And if in you're in a significant enough shortage position, you may end up having to raise the price of what you have left. There are other aspects though of the portfolio that you are on more of a contract basis or on a committed basis. And so it just kind of ends up blending out to the position you're seeing. Clearly, there has been a steep increase in the commodity turkey pricing. But I think as we've talked about in the past, even in years when we're not short turkeys, we're not really a net seller of breast meat at commodity meat markets. And so these very lofty $4 and $5 rates that you're seeing on the commodity breast side, that's not something we're able to enjoy in our sales."
