We are clearly disappointed with our top line performance in Q3 and are committed to taking the steps necessary to get back on track.Despite the soft revenue, we delivered another quarter of solid operation",1044,"Thank you, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone. We are clearly disappointed with our top line performance in Q3 and are committed to taking the steps necessary to get back on track.
Despite the soft revenue, we delivered another quarter of solid operational performance with improved gross margin from Q3 year ago and non-GAAP operating margin and at the high end of our prior guidance. We've further reduced diluted share count and delivered EPS within our previous guidance range. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and continued to make progress against our hybrid cloud strategy.
Top line revenue finished below the low end of our guidance, impacted by greater-than-anticipated FX movement in the quarter, which Nick quantify shortly, as well as our own sales execution issues. EMEA and APAC were impacted by FX, U.S. Public Sector's driven by strong performance in federal had the highest growth, but Americas commercial fell short of expectation.
The Americas team bullied the increase in enterprise large deal activity in the first half of the fiscal year was optimistic about their forecast. Deals over $1 mils increased yet again in Q3, but we also saw a significant number of large deals slip out of the quarter. We have new leadership in global and Americas sales, and I'm confident in the team and fully expect the execution to improve.
Looking ahead, we see FX headwinds affecting growth for not only NetApp, but our customers as well. As companies lower their revenue expectations for The coming calendar year, there is an increase deferral of IT projects. We clearly so that in January. The anticipated budget was no longer available as companies delivered updated spending targets for the new calendar year and deals that were pushed out may not return in the near term. We are seeing large tech refresh opportunities being replaced with 1-year support renewals and in the case customers remain committed to NetApp, but do not have budget to operate at this time.
Despite the revenue shortfall, we continue to make progress in key areas. As I mentioned earlier, Q3 marked our third consecutive quarter of growth in large deals, a point of validation of our enterprise strategy. In November, we further delivered against our data fabric vision with the availability of NetApp Private Storage for IBM SoftLayer, the SteelStore appliance and Cloud ONTAP or Amazon Web Services.
We also introduced the newest version of Data ONTAP, the industry's #1 storage operating system, Data ONTAP 8.3. To date, ONTAP 8.3 has had the fastest ramp of any of our Clustered ONTAP release introductions. Shipments of clustered nodes grew 160% from Q3 a year ago. The attach rate of Clustered ONTAP continues to increase and now stands at roughly 40% of fast controllership in the quarter.
Total system units shipped increased 9% from Q3 last year. We saw notable strength in E-Series branded and configurations of all-flash. The entire portfolio has been refreshed over the past year with the recent launch of the E560 and the EF560. We continue to see sustained momentum with our broad flash portfolio as flash capacity shipped grew 69% year-over-year.
With FlashRay innovation injected into all-flash and the new EF560, we anticipate that our all-flash array systems will soon hold 2 of the top spots in the industry proponents benchmark.
ONTAP insight also continue to perform well with the a number of deals increasing from Q3 a year ago. Overall, we are confident with our portfolio and pleased with the growth of our margin products.
As we have discussed in the past, both the market and enterprise IT are undergoing a major transition. Likewise, NetApp has been undergoing a decision to position ourselves for the future as we talked about at our Analyst Day last June. The NetApp Data Fabric mission, our seamless hybrid cloud strategy, is up leveraging the nature of the conversations we're having with customers. We have delivered an unprecedented portfolio expansion, including new offerings in flash, object and cloud integration. We further augmented that integration with the SteelStore product line acquisition. We have also had highlighted the internal productivity, efficiency and supply line initiatives that have resulted in gross margin and operating margin improvements, despite a very challenging growth environment. We have increased emphasis on our enterprise and cloud service provider customers, while maintaining the memento we have in mid-sized business.
We are seeing progress on our go-to-market transformation, but it's still a work in process and in need of ongoing improvement and investment. The increase the breadth of the portfolio and our compelling data fabric vision are yielding positive results, it is clear that to fully realize the brand value of these new capabilities, we must expand our go-to-market capacity with greater product coverage, product specialists and partner enablement. Clustered Data ONTAP currently needs the technical requirements of our largest and most demanding customers. We believe NetApp's engagement helping them execute the transition to Clustered ONTAP over the next year will unlock the tech refreshes.
In prior years, go-to-market capacity expansion in times of high confidence in the portfolio proved to be a growth driver, even in difficult environments. We believe we are in a similar situation today. We also understand to delivering shareholder value in a low growth environment and the resulting pressure on operating expenses. We will continue to employ the discipline of shifting resources away from lower-yield activities, as well as driving productivity and efficiency through the organization to offset as much as possible the impact of high priority investments to expand capacity.
Overall, the growth of the emerging products, the uptick of Clustered ONTAP and the residence of our mission customers as well as our operational focus have been on a positive trajectory. All of this only compounds our disappointment with our performance last quarter. External factors, such as FX, was a clear headwinds, but our focus is on our own issues on what it takes to get back on track. We do not see any change to our strategic priorities and we'll aggressively seek to maximize return on our product portfolio within the confines of our business model.
I will now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on Q3 and our guidance for Q4 before returning with summary comments.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin in fiscal Q3, underscoring the resiliency of our business model. We delivered non-GAAP EPS within our previous guidance",1186,"Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin in fiscal Q3, underscoring the resiliency of our business model. We delivered non-GAAP EPS within our previous guidance range. However, as Tom indicated, the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, combined with our own sales execution challenges, presented headwinds in Q3 and resulted in revenue below our expectations.
Net revenues of $1.55 billion were up about 1% sequentially, but down 4% year-over-year. FX headwinds reduced year-over-year revenue comparison by about 1.5 points , only 1 point of which we had anticipated when we gave revenue guidance from Q3 90 days ago.
Product revenue of $930[ph] million was down 8% year-over-year. The combination of soft atonement maintenance and service revenues totaling $622 million was up 5% year-over-year. Branded revenue was 92% of net revenues for Q3 and at $1.43 billion was flat sequentially, but down 2% year-over-year due to a combination of unfavorable foreign exchange and execution challenges in our Americas Commercial sales geography. Adjusted for FX, branded revenue would have been about flat year-over-year.
OEM revenue, which is transacted in U.S. dollar was $124 million in Q3, up 4% sequentially, but down 21% on a year-over-year basis as expected. Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs accounted for 81% of Q3 net revenues. Arrow and Avnet contributed 22% and 16% of net revenues, respectively.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 64.6% was up just over 1 point from Q3 last year and just above our prior guidance range, despite FX headwinds. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57% was relatively flat year-over-year, driven by unfavorable mix and FX, partially offset by continued supply chain execution. Sequentially, non-GAAP product gross margin was down just over 1 point due to mix.
Service gross margins of 64.5% was 3.7 points above Q3 of last year and 1.8 points above Q2 due to higher services revenues and lower spending.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 18.5%, at the high end of our previous guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 46% of revenue.
Consistent with our expectations on non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 16.5%.
Q3 weighted average diluted share count of 317 million shares was below our prior guidance, down 6 million shares sequentially and down 29 million shares or 8% from Q3 last year due to continued stock repurchase activity. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 was inline with our prior guidance range and reflects the net impact of year-over-year FX headwinds of $0.02.
Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments, 13% of which is onshore. The sequential decrease in onshore cash was predominantly due to shares repurchased and dividends paid in the quarter. Inventory turns were at 19 and day sales outstanding was 39. Deferred revenue was $3.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year.
Q3 cash from operations was $275 million and free cash flow was 68%[ph] of revenue, impacted by an increase in days sales outstanding due to unfavorable linearity.
In Q3, we returned $251 million to shareholders, which included $200 million in share repurchases and $51 million in cash dividends. Consistent with the guidance we provided last May, we remain on track to complete the remaining $206 million of our current share repurchase program by the end of May 2015, a year ahead of our original schedule.
Over the last few years, we have developed our capital structure and delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders since May 2013. We are well-positioned to move ahead with the next phase of our capital allocation strategy.
I am pleased to announce that we have increased the size of our share repurchase authorization by $2.5 billion. We intend to complete this additional $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016.
Today, we also announced our net cash dividend of $0.165 per share of the company stock to be paid on April 23, 2015. We remain committed to increasing our dividend over time.
Enhancements to our capital allocation strategy reflect our confidence and the long-term strength of NetApp's business, as well as our ongoing commitment increasing shareholder value. We have structured the capital allocation plan to ensure flexibility to support innovation and growth initiatives, the timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the program as well as future dividends and dividend increases will depend on market conditions, business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements.
Now to guidance. We remain confident in our strategy and competitive position. However, based on our own sales execution issues and the continued challenging IT spending environment, we are building a degree of caution into our top line expectations. We also expect FX headwinds to continue and impact year-over-year comparisons.
As a result, our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies 3% sequential growth but a 3% decline in revenue versus Q4 last year. Based on current rate, we have embedded an FX headwinds of $50 million into our Q4 revenue guidance.
We expect our strong value proposition to continue to resonate with customers, and we will have an ongoing focus on supply-chain efficiencies. with that said, we expect non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% in Q4, including about 1 point of FX headwinds. We expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 17% to 17.5%, reflecting about 1 point of FX headwind as well as investments in our go-to-market capacity.
Based on our repurchases in Q3, we expect Q4 diluted share count of approximately 319 million shares, down 5% versus last year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 to range from approximately $0.70 to $0.75 per share, which reflects about $0.05 of dilution from unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year.
Our full year fiscal 2015 revenue will be lower than anticipated due to currency headwinds and incremental caution entering Q4, which I referenced earlier. EPS is expected to be flat from FY '14 due to affects headwinds, revenue softness and investments in the business, offset by gross margin improvement ensure purchases.
In closing, our product portfolio is as strong as it's ever been and our discussions with customers continue, to involve the mark strategic levels. Our capital allocation strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and organically inorganically in the business as well as return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The investments we're making today position us to fully take advantage of the opportunity ahead, and we expect to emerge from the this transition with greater levels of growth and profitability. Through this evolution, we remain committed to our business model and to delivering shareholder value.
Now I would like to turn back to Tom first summary comments. Tom."

So it wasn't a question of we didn't have pipeline and we didn't",595,"Well, I think, from the question about whether it be secular or competitive, effectively, what we're talking about here, what we saw pushed out were actually deals in the committed pipeline. So it wasn't a question of we didn't have pipeline and we didn't have deals that we're pursuing. This are deals that the salesforce had committed that reflected in our forecast, reflected in our guidance and reflected in our planning as the quarter proceeded. And so not surprisingly, Monday the quarter ended, I was with a head for Americas sales and went to what happened to these deals? They went to a relatively long list of deals, 2 pages worth, deals that were committed that we expect to account but didn't come in. And all of them have a story of which competitive and lost deals was a trivially small amount of that. So from a competitive perspective, I'd say first and foremost, competitive wasn't it a key component, some of it clearly was closeable deals that we didn't get done. And after [indiscernible], some of them were changes in customer behavior, with a change of the calendar year and companies looking at their own financial forecast, their own FX impact, we certainly saw the deals that were there. The other thing is in order for deals to be in the committed pipeline, there are deals for which substantially, we have 1 difficult technical a lot of these transactions is effectively over. So it's really about the customers changing budgets, requiring more scrutiny in their approval process or fundamentally thinking about their new budget in the new calendar year. I think onward clearly, when that the watch this a little both posted, we certainly see elongated sales cycle earlier in the quarter, but the forecast has remained unchanged, the team was still relatively bullish about pulling it out. So I think that's we need to look at some of the data points along the way. Certainly, we need to inspect a lot closer and you can argue that the other side of this and the message the team is there's uncertainty about closing deals, you need more deals. So what are we going to do to enhance the pipeline. So clearly, we'll be watching this closely. As we look at our productivity, whether it be pipeline generation, per rep, or -- and even despite the quarter, in terms of actually bookings per rep, the numbers are actually quite high, relatively high in our history. So sales force productivity is still pretty high, yet we didn't get these deals closed. But the feeling is it isn't like the sales force can't sell or productivity is down, that will be more of an indicator of a product problem or there's no opportunity out there. And so feeling as a loss productivity aside, that people are generating abundant peak levels historically, that if we can put more feet on the street and get more people buying out there selling the product, we could drive some more business. So that, of course, has a lead time associated with it and hiring and bringing up to speed. By the end of the day, we would have these deals in the committed pipeline, we wouldn't have the pipeline productivity we had unless we felt strongly about the portfolio and the portfolio was resonating. So I think where we are now, I don't think product is our issue, I think capacity is our issue and that's the bet we're making. And that what you will see from us going to forward."

So didn't really know the answer to your question, and so was actually more companies that are reporting generate quarters. So our assumption is FX ins purely mathematical and everything else is our responsibility to get into a fix. And like I said, if you look at these individual accounts, there's no doubt that we have closable deals that we didn't get done in time and that's pure execution and those will fall into Q4. But we've also seen elongated approval cycles, and we've also seen people reevaluating what their plans are for the year now that the calendar year changed. People thought they had budget when we put this in the pipeline that don't now. and I think the return of those transaction is yet unknown. So I think from our perspective, we just clearly need to do better on that. I'm certainly not ready to say there's a bullet unless I see some more data points.

And likewise, frankly, I think we need to see what other companies are reporting that as January closed to see if this is common or not. So I think that there's just a natural sense of conservatism, both in terms of the forecast we received and likewise, our own judging of those forecast as a result of this. I mean, simply put, we came out last quarter relatively bullish. I mean, when a lay out the valance, we were pushing the cloud story came out of insight, we have a lot of momentum, the feedback on the cloud and the hybrid cloud from the customers and partners has been tremendous. We did a dramatic expansion of the portfolio with refreshers of E-Series, introduction of the StorageGRID Webscale, we acquired the SteelStore product, the release of 8.3. So very strong about the portfolio, felt very strong about the forecast and I think, we came out of this last call, actually, relative excited where we're heading. So that's why we're really doubly disappointed about all of this. I don't in the end if suddenly there was a competitive disjunk, competitive disjoint or some type of quality issue or some type of product issue, but there's really none of that. So things were pretty much normal curve as far as we look at the quarter as it played out until we get to the end."

So I think exciting that, that's clearly the case. But I think in terms of markets in general, certainly, energy was 1 that kind of jumped out of people being very, very cautious, obviously, with the movement of the price of oil. And I think certainly on the oil and gas, it has a negative impact, presumably it will help the rest of the industry, but I think that's a lot more diffused now taking the time to flow through. So I'd say probably the only segment that I'd say that we could clearly identify with relatively urgent caution would be oil and gas. But I'd say, most of the business is spread around. I mean, other sectors were very robust. One of the things that we talked about in prior calls was I believe that we're going to see solid growth on the federal side in the second half of the year easier compared to last year. That entirely came through. So if I think about the roadmap we've had here, we communicated at Analyst Day, we talked about of a rebound in federal in terms of growth in the second half of the year, we certainly saw that. We talked about focus on the enterprise and certainly saw record $1 million[ph] deals with certainly saw that, we certainly saw[ph] the $1 million[ph] deals. And I think overall, became a number of those things were on tract and that's what kind of left last quarter with, in terms of how we felt about the second half of the year. So I think some of the things came together and but other ones didn't. I think we sense that FX was clearly an issue, that will certainly comment that we have last quarter. And I think that's proven to be a bigger issue that we originally thought and Nick quantified that.

The other question about that, acquisitions? I think, acquisitions, I don't think this changes our opinions in acquisitions. I think we will continue to move ahead with tuck-in acquisitions that expand our portfolio, we did 2 this past quarter. Still the one that got through the headlines and I think we will continue to do that, that should be a normal course of business. I wouldn't expect that to neither accelerate nor decline. I think on the question of larger deals, those tend to be very, very, asynchronous and hard to predict. So I think from our point of view, if I look at transactions that we've done, E-Series branded had a very, very strong quarter up 100% again. If I look at on-demand insight, which is also an acquired technology, that was also -- had a very, very good quarter. So I think the success of our acquired businesses has been very good. So from my point of view, I think we'll continue to do tuck-in acquisitions. In terms of larger deals, we get don't get to predict when they are going to be available or when they are going to come about. But certainly, our recent record has been pretty good. And for the right transaction at the right price, when that's executable, we'll certainly move ahead with that.

So I think we're looking at both of those differently. Overall, in terms of our international business, the immediacy in dealing with FX, obviously, the Russia situation, even the French situation late in the quarter were all factors. And I think overall, from a booking perspective, they did quite well. So actually, the numbers don't show it, I'm actually quite pleased with the EMEA team. Asia-Pac is not a unified region, all the different geographies perform differently. But I think overall, they did well.

So it's not something that's going to move the needle in the immediate term, I don't think that we're going our people in the full quarter in a very, very short period of time. There'll be a sliding scale in terms of how they ultimately ramp up. So the real impact to that will probably towards the middle -- the end of next year. But the investment will be front ended. And as Nick indicated, in terms of as we think about our full year business model, as our full attention operate within the bounds of the business model we have previously communicated. But if I look at it, it's independent of the individual issues at the end of last quarter. If I look at our ratios and I look at our investments, we've done a substantial expansion of the portfolio. Within that portfolio has been carved out for specialists to drive things like E-Series and on command. I think that's paid off quite nicely for us. As we think about adding new products for the portfolio, whether it be storage or SteelStore, we're going to do some of that. So I expect all of those investments to come in. While in the meantime, we still need to be cultivating new accounts and new opportunities for Clustered ONTAP. The other one is, I think, that our partners are a key part of this. I think, investment in the partners so they come to speed on the new products since they're pitching in success and successfully be self-sufficient and pursuing these opportunities. And likewise, helping customers with immigration of Clustered ONTAP as the go-to-market activities that, I think, have immediate impact or relatively near-term impact on the business. But the simple fact of the matter is, if sales force productivity was the issue and they were not anywhere near quota and they were suboptimal because we don't have the products and we didn't have competitive technology, then I think we're making an entirely different investment choice. But the feeling is that the portfolio was strong and we just don't have enough people out there promoting it, selling it, serving customers.

So I think, clearly, we've been doing shifting of resources within the envelope. I think across the entire company, we've worked very hard at that. And I think that manifest itself in terms of the engineering choice that we made and the price that we're bringing to market and we were able to do that by deemphasizing other products of moving out of certain spaces. We've certainly seen it in terms of carving out part of the sales resource to focus on some of these newer products, I talked about E-Series and on command and that has worked out well for us. And I also thought that we spoke at Analyst Day around the enterprise strategy and getting our partners more self-sufficient in the mid-sized business so we can migrate some of our resources against the bigger opportunities in the enterprise. So we've seen that $1 million deals. And so if we look at that data and that is more specialist around the new products generate sales, if we look at moving more resource to the enterprise, we'll generate more $1 million deals. If we can continue to make our partner self-sufficient and continue that and widen the total umbrella, the total number of people engaged in that, I think, it's hard to conclude that there's an opportunity for growth in that and that's the knob that we want to turn. Certainly, Clustered ONTAP has been a big investment, 8.3 is a culminating release for that. We needed to get that done, we need to get customers migrate to it. We certainly have to finish investments so we're making the other key technologies around all-flash FAS and flash in general.

But all-flash FAS, clearly, as a product that a team who's familiar with, it had a very, very big growth quarter. And overall, I think that the idea of an all-flash FAS, instead of a stand-alone point product, it's actually be a node of a cluster that's compatible with all of our data movers in all of our storage efficiency and all of our scale out capability, it's a compelling value proposition. So I think FlashRay is going to serve a segment of the market, we continue to invest in it. It's in customers hands and we're getting a feedback around the key efficiency and performance and ease-of-use component. But that's not the totality of the flash portfolio. In fact, the overall majority of our flash is in the other products. And in fact, the all-flash FAS, which is only introduced quite 1.5 quarters ago, is actually the one that's ramping the hardest of all of those, and we're pretty pleased with the use cases. And what you'll see from that is, in fact, from a number of our products, compelling performance benchmarks that we're going to publish in the very, very near future. I think, from a performance perspective, certainly all-flash FAS has a feature set far beyond any other flash and compelling performance and compelling efficiency. I think you'll see a lot of more of that product in the new future as well, while we continue to evolve and develop FlashRay to serve the segments that it's targeted at."

I think we want to be able to both of these are the same time. So I think we have invested in those overlay. I'd say, the increment from here will be not merely a significant percentage wise. What we're really looking to do is getting more people out there, getting in front of new customers, new customer acquisitions and deeper into our largest, biggest customers. So I'd say that the reason why I brought the product specialist is within the fixed envelope, the more product specialist you have, the less generalists you have. And our view is that we need more generalists out there, pushing the ONTAP-base products. Pursuant to our enterprise strategy, we've proven that we can get big deals if we move in that direction and now we want to get more people out there cultivating new accounts, deeper and existing accounts and bringing more big deals."

But really what I see Cloud ONTAP is the completion of our end-to-end, seamless data management storage with the cloud. So I can run in Cloud ONTAP on 1 extreme, I could run on-premise, yet our private search, which I've seen a lot of acceleration, that's actually 1 of my favorite use cases.

I think, what skills are effectively is, is a backup of clients that integrated with the cloud. And clearly, from our point of view and those of you who inside at the Analyst Day, we talked about the economics of the cloud, cloud being a resting place for very low utilization data, like backup and archive. It's a way to seamlessly extend traditional backup all the way to the cloud is something at we felt very, very strongly about as an opportunity and that was really the motivation for pursuing SteelStore. So I say that post transaction, I think, a couple of things came out, one of which was this is a product with a fair amount visibility within Amazon. And the Amazon relationship is developing quite nicely around Cloud ONTAP, around NetApp Private Storage. And this 1 has become a third leg of the store in that relationship, in fact, they've actually referenced actually give us some reference accounts to pursue with this. So I think at this point, it's not material to the number that Nick just gave. it will be certainly not 0, in fact, it's already been non 0. I think, it's ahead of our initial forecast, but certainly, one of those very, very front end of that curve. So I think, so far so good, no regrets. But I think this is a bit too early to tell. But the real goal there is ultimately, is how do we enable the next-generation backup successfully integrates the cloud but is compatible with all the back up methodology that people currently deploy on-premise.
Okay, so first of all, thank you all for joining us today. As I think about the quarter that we just completed and I think about where we were last quarter, the evolution of the roadmap we introduced more new technology in the last 6 months whether it be a Clustered ONTAP 8.3, the acquisition of SteelStore, StorageGRID, on-command insight, E-Series, FlashRay, all-flash FAS and the momentum that we saw, both in terms of the last quarter, the forecast for this quarter, I think we felt very, very good about the business.
So as I talked in this prepared text, clearly, disappointed with the setback that we had, probably a little bit more disappointed, probably downright angry because I felt like we were in very, very good shape and we need to do better than that.
So as I think where we go forward, I think we are -- my belief and we're in as good as shape we are in the portfolio is unshaken. The execution issues, we will fix and we're going to make key investments within the bounds of our business model to fully exploit the full potential of this portfolio and drive growth to this company and that's our covenant.
So once again thank you for your time and I'll see you all next quarter."

We are clearly disappointed with our top line performance in Q3 and are committed to taking the steps necessary to get back on track.Despite the soft revenue, we delivered another quarter of solid operation",1054,"Thank you, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone. We are clearly disappointed with our top line performance in Q3 and are committed to taking the steps necessary to get back on track.
Despite the soft revenue, we delivered another quarter of solid operational performance with improved gross margins from Q3 a year ago and non-GAAP operating margin at the high end of our prior guidance. We've further reduced diluted share count and delivered EPS within our previous guidance range. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and continue to make progress against our hybrid cloud strategy.
Top line revenue finished below the low end of our guidance, impacted by greater-than-anticipated FX movement in the quarter, which Nick will quantify shortly, as well as our own sales execution issues. EMEA and APAC were impacted by FX, U.S. Public Sector, driven by strong performance in federal, had the highest growth, but Americas Commercial fell short of expectation.
The Americas team, bullied by the increase in enterprise large deal activity in the first half of the fiscal year, was optimistic about their forecast. Deals over $1 million increased yet again in Q3, but we also saw a significant number of large deals slip out of the quarter. We have new leadership in global and Americas sales, and I'm confident in the team and fully expect the execution to improve.
Looking ahead, we see FX headwinds impacting growth for not only NetApp but our customers as well. As companies lower their revenue expectations for the coming calendar year, there is an increase deferral of IT projects. We clearly saw that in January. Anticipated budget was no longer available as companies delivered updated spending targets for the new calendar year, and deals that were pushed out may not return in the near term. We are seeing large tech refresh opportunities being replaced with 1-year support renewals and in the case that customers remain committed to NetApp but do not have budget to operate at this time.
Despite the revenue shortfall, we continue to make progress in key areas. As I mentioned earlier, Q3 marked our third consecutive quarter of growth in large deals, a point of validation of our enterprise strategy. In November, we further delivered against our data fabric vision with the availability of NetApp Private Storage for IBM SoftLayer, the SteelStore appliance and Cloud ONTAP for Amazon Web Services.
We also introduced the newest version of Data ONTAP, the industry's #1 storage operating system, Data ONTAP 8.3. To date, ONTAP 8.3 has had the fastest ramp of any of our Clustered ONTAP software release introductions. Shipments of clustered nodes grew 160% from Q3 a year ago. The attach rate of Clustered ONTAP continues to increase and now stands at roughly 40% of FAS controller shipped in the quarter.
Total system units shipped increased 9% from Q3 last year. We saw a notable strength in E-Series branded and configurations of all-flash FAS. The entirety of our portfolio has been refreshed over the past year with the recent launch of the E560 and the EF560. We continue to see sustained momentum with our broad flash portfolio as flash capacity shipped grew 69% year-over-year. With FlashRay innovation injected into all-flash FAS and the new EF560, we anticipate that our all-flash array systems will soon hold 2 of the top spots in the industry performance benchmark. 
OnCommand Insight also continues to perform well with the number of deals increasing from Q3 a year ago. 
Overall, we are confident with our portfolio and pleased with the growth of our emerging products.
As we have discussed in the past, both the market and enterprise IT are undergoing a major transition. Likewise, NetApp has been undergoing a transition to position ourselves for the future as we talked about at our Analyst Day last June. The NetApp Data Fabric vision, our seamless hybrid cloud strategy, is upleveling the nature of the conversations we are having with customers. We have delivered an unprecedented portfolio expansion, including new offerings in flash, object and cloud integration. We further augmented that cloud integration with the SteelStore product line acquisition. We have also highlighted the internal productivity, efficiency and supply line initiatives that have resulted in gross margin and operating margin improvements despite a very challenging growth environment. We have increased emphasis on our enterprise and cloud service provider customers while maintaining the memento we have in midsize business.
We are seeing progress with our go-to-market transformation, but it's still a work in process and in need of ongoing improvement and investment. The increase of breadth of the portfolio and our compelling data fabric vision are yielding positive results, but it's clear that to fully realize the value of these new capabilities, we must expand our go-to-market capacity with greater account coverage, product specialists and partner enablement. Clustered Data ONTAP currently meets the technical requirements of our largest and most demanding customers. We believe NetApp's engagement in helping them execute the transition to Clustered ONTAP over the next year will unlock deferred tech refreshes.
In prior years, go-to-market capacity expansion in times of high confidence in the portfolio proved to be a growth driver, even in difficult environments. We believe we are in a similar situation today. We also understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a low growth environment and the resulting pressure on operating expenses. We will continue to employ the discipline of shifting resources away from lower-yield activities as well as driving productivity and efficiency through the organization to offset as much as possible the impact of high priority investments to expand capacity.
Overall, the growth of the emerging products, the uptake of Clustered ONTAP and the resonance of our vision with customers as well as our operational focus have been on a positive trajectory. All of this only compounds our disappointment with our performance last quarter. External factors such as FX were clear headwinds, but our focus is on our own issues and what it takes to get back on track. We do not see any change to our strategic priorities, and we'll aggressively seek to maximize return on our product portfolio within the confines of our business model.
I will now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on Q3 and our guidance for Q4 before returning with summary comments.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin in fiscal Q3, underscoring the resiliency of our business model. We delivered non-GAAP EPS within our previous guidance",1192,"Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin in fiscal Q3, underscoring the resiliency of our business model. We delivered non-GAAP EPS within our previous guidance range. However, as Tom indicated, the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, combined with our own sales execution challenges, presented headwinds in Q3 and resulted in revenue below our expectations.
Net revenues of $1.55 billion were up about 1% sequentially but down 4% year-over-year. FX headwinds reduced the year-over-year revenue comparison by about 1.5 points , only 1 point of which we had anticipated when we gave revenue guidance for Q3 90 days ago.
Product revenue of $930 million was down 8% year-over-year. The combination of software entitlements and maintenance and service revenues totaling $622 million was up 5% year-over-year. 
Branded revenue was 92% of net revenues for Q3 and at $1.43 billion was flat sequentially but down 2% year-over-year due to a combination of unfavorable foreign exchange and execution challenges in our Americas Commercial sales geography. Adjusted for FX, branded revenue would have been about flat year-over-year.
OEM revenue, which is transacted in U.S. dollars, was $124 million in Q3, up 4% sequentially but down 21% on a year-over-year basis as expected. 
Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs accounted for 81% of Q3 net revenues. Arrow and Avnet contributed 22% and 16% of net revenues, respectively.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 64.6% was up just over 1 point from Q3 last year and just above our prior guidance range despite FX headwinds. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57% was relatively flat year-over-year, driven by unfavorable mix and FX, partially offset by continued supply chain execution. Sequentially, non-GAAP product gross margin was down just over 1 point due to mix.
Service gross margin of 64.5% was 3.7 points above Q3 of last year and 1.8 points above Q2 due to higher services revenues and lower spending.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 18.5%, at the high end of our previous guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 46% of revenue.
Consistent with our expectations, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 16.5%.
Q3 weighted average diluted share count of 317 million shares was below our prior guidance, down 6 million shares sequentially and down 29 million shares or 8% from Q3 last year due to continued stock repurchase activity. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 was in line with our prior guidance range and reflects the net impact of year-over-year FX headwinds of $0.02.
Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments, 13% of which is onshore. The sequential decrease in onshore cash was predominantly due to shares repurchased and dividends paid in the quarter. 
Inventory turns were at 19, and day sales outstanding were 
39. Deferred revenue was $3.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year.
Q3 cash from operations was $275 million, and free cash flow was 16% of revenue, impacted by an increase in days sales outstanding due to unfavorable linearity.
In Q3, we returned $251 million to shareholders, which included $200 million in share repurchases and $51 million in cash dividends. Consistent with the guidance we provided last May, we remain on track to complete the remaining $206 million of our current share repurchase program by the end of May 2015, a year ahead of our original schedule.
Over the last few years, we have evolved our capital structure and delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders since May 2013. We are well-positioned to move ahead with the next phase of our capital allocation strategy.
I am pleased to announce that we have increased the size of our share repurchase authorization by $2.5 billion. We intend to complete this additional $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016.
Today, we also announced our net cash dividend of $0.165 per share of the company stock to be paid on April 23, 2015. We remain committed to increasing our dividend over time.
Enhancements to our capital allocation strategy reflect our confidence in the long-term strength of NetApp's business as well as our ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. We have structured the capital allocation plan to ensure flexibility to support innovation and growth initiatives. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the program as well as future dividends and dividend increases will depend on market conditions, business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements.
Now to guidance. We remain confident in our strategy and competitive position. However, based on our own sales execution issues and the continued challenging IT spending environment, we are building a degree of caution into our top line expectations. We also expect FX headwinds to continue and impact year-over-year comparisons.
As a result, our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies 3% sequential growth but a 3% decline in revenue versus Q4 last year. Based on current rates, we have embedded an FX headwind of $50 million into our Q4 revenue guidance.
We expect our strong value proposition to continue to resonate with customers, and we will have an ongoing focus on supply chain efficiencies. With that said, we expect non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% in Q4, including about 1 point of FX headwind. We expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 17% to 17.5%, reflecting about 1 point of FX headwind as well as investments in our go-to-market capacity.
Based on our repurchases in Q3, we expect Q4 diluted share count of approximately 319 million shares, down 5% versus last year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 to range from approximately $0.70 to $0.75 per share, which reflects about $0.05 of dilution from unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year.
Our full year fiscal 2015 revenue will be lower than anticipated due to currency headwinds and incremental caution entering Q4, which I referenced earlier. EPS is expected to be flat from FY '14 due to FX headwinds, revenue softness and investments in the business, offset by gross margin improvement and share repurchases.
In closing, our product portfolio is as strong as it's ever been, and our discussions with customers continue to involve to more strategic levels. Our capital allocation strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and inorganically in the business as well as return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The investments we're making today position us to fully take advantage of the opportunity ahead, and we expect to emerge from this transition with greater levels of growth and profitability.

So it wasn't a question of we didn't have pipeline and we didn't",627,"Well, I think from the question about whether it be secular or competitive, effectively, what we're talking about here, what we saw pushed out were actually deals in the committed pipeline. So it wasn't a question of we didn't have pipeline and we didn't have deals that we're pursuing. These are deals that the sales force had committed that reflected in our forecast, reflected in our guidance and reflected in our planning as the quarter proceeded. And so not surprisingly, Monday the quarter ended, I was with a head of Americas sales and went through what happened to these deals. They went through a relatively long list of deals, 2 pages worth of deals that were committed, that we expected to count that didn't come in. And all of them have a story of which competitive and lost deals was a trivially small amount of that. So from a competitive perspective, I'd say, first and foremost, the competitive wasn't the key component. Some of it clearly was closeable deals that we didn't get done, and that's entirely on us. Some of it was changes in customer behavior. With the change of the calendar year and companies looking at their own financial forecast, their own FX impact, we certainly saw the funnel of [ph] deals that we thought were -- that were there. The other thing is in order for deals to be in the committed pipeline, there are deals for which, substantially, we have won the technical recommendation. So the competitive phase of a lot of these transactions was effectively over. So it was really about either customers changing budgets, requiring more scrutiny in their approval process or fundamentally thinking about their new budgets in light of the new calendar year. I think going forward, clearly, we need to watch this a lot more closely. We certainly saw elongated sales cycles earlier in the quarter, but the forecast has remained unchanged and the team was still relatively bullish about pulling it out. So I think that we need to look at some of the data points along the way. Certainly, we need to inspect a lot closer. And you can argue that the other side of this and the message to the team is if there's uncertainty about closing deals, you need more deals. So what are we going to do to enhance the pipeline? So clearly, we're going to be watching this closely. As we look at our productivity, whether it be pipeline generation per rep or -- and even despite the quarter in terms of actually bookings per rep, the numbers are actually quite high, relatively high in our history. So sales force productivity is actually still pretty high. Yes, we didn't get these deals closed, but the feeling is it isn't like the sales force can't sell and productivity is down. That will be more of an indicator of a product problem or there's no opportunity out there. So our feeling, as long as productivity is high, that people are generating pipeline at peak levels historically, that if we can put more feet on the street and get more people out there selling the products, we can drive some more business. So that, of course, has a lead time associated with it in terms of hiring and bringing up to speed. By at the end of the day, we wouldn't have these deals in the committed pipeline, we wouldn't have the pipeline productivity we had unless we felt strongly about the portfolio and the portfolio was resonating. So I think where we are now, I don't think product is our issue. I think capacity is our issue, and that's the bet we're making. And that's what you're going to see from us going forward."

Likewise, we see FX not only in our industry, but we also see FX impact on our customers. And that's got the lead through into the decisions that they make. So I don't really know the answer to your question until we see actually more companies that are reporting January quarters. So our assumption is FX is purely mathematical, and everything else is our responsibility to get on to a fix. And like I said, if we look at these individual accounts, there's no doubt that we had closable deals, that we didn't get done in time, and that's just pure execution and those will fall into Q4. But we've also seen elongated approval cycles, and we've also seen people reevaluating what their plans are for the year. Now the calendar year has changed. People thought they had budget when we put this in the pipeline that don't now. And I think the return of those transactions is yet unknown. So I think from our perspective, we just clearly need to do better on that. I'm certainly not ready to say that there's a broader trend until I see some more data points. But for our point of view is that we're going to focus on our deals and our pipeline, and we're going to do a better job executing this quarter."

So we were -- obviously, this is a quarter where you've got kind of the end of the quarter push and you've got the end of the calendar year push, which is a little bit different than other quarters. But from our point of view is, certainly, we saw bullishness going into the end of the year, and then still, we have expectation of a relatively strong normal quarter end in January. And a fair amount of that business didn't come through the way we would have thought. So I think we did see the budget flush. Maybe we can debate whether it's as robust as we thought, but certainly close enough. But we certainly had a lot of January business that was a normal part of our final month of a quarter that we'd see being back-end-loaded that didn't come in. And like I said, every deal has a story. But when you go through 40 deals and only 1 or 2 are competitive and the rest of them are deal-specific, I don't think the competition is really the issue. And on top of that, the feedback from the field was optimistic all quarter. We still did a record number of millions -- or increased number of million-dollar deals. So it wasn't like they were searching for business. They had business that they had, that was lined up and they thought they were going to close and they didn't."

So I think that there's just a natural sense of conservatism, both in terms of the forecast we received and, likewise, our own judging of those forecast as a result of this. I mean, simply put, we came out of last quarter relatively bullish. I mean, when I lay out the lay of the land, we were pushing the cloud story, came out of Insight with a lot of momentum. The feedback on the cloud and the hybrid cloud from customers and partners has been tremendous. We did a dramatic expansion of the portfolio with refreshers of E-Series, introduction of the StorageGRID Webscale, we acquired the SteelStore product, the release of 8.3. So very strong about the portfolio, felt very strong about the forecast and I think we came out of this last call, actually, relative excited about where we're heading. So that's why we're really doubly disappointed about all of this. I don't -- in the end, if suddenly there was a competitive disjunct -- competitive disjoint or some type of quality issue or some type of product issue, but there's really none of that.

So I think that, that's clearly the case. I think in terms of markets in general, certainly, energy was one that kind of jumped out and people being very, very cautious, obviously, with the movement of the price of oil. And I think certainly, on the oil and gas, it has a negative impact. Presumably, it will help the rest of the industry, but I think that's a lot more diffused, now taking more time to flow through. So I'd say probably the only segment that I'd say that we could clearly identify with relatively urgent caution would be oil and gas. But I'd say most of the rest of the business is spread around. I mean, other sectors were very robust. I mean, one of the things that we talked about in prior calls is our belief that we were going to see solid growth on the federal side the second half of the year over easier compares last year. That entirely came through. So if I think about the road map that we went into this year, we communicated at Analyst Day, we talked about a rebound in federal in terms of growth rate in the second half of the year. We certainly saw that. We talked about focus on the enterprise, and we certainly saw record $1 million deals. We certainly saw that. We certainly growth [ph] $1 million deals. And I think overall, it seemed like a number of those things were on track, and that's what we kind of left last quarter with in terms of how we felt about the second half of the year. So I think some of the things came together and -- but other ones didn't. I think we sense that FX was clearly an issue. That was certainly a comment that we have last quarter. And I think that's proven to be a bigger issue that we originally thought, and Nick quantified that.

So I'd say, certainly, the FX one, there's really 2 questions, I think, in play, one of them is the relative performance and the other one is deals that we actually had in the pipeline that we were expecting to close. So I think we're looking at both of those differently. Overall, in terms of our international business, the EMEA team dealing with FX, obviously, the Russia situation, even the French situation late in the quarter, were all factors. And I think overall, from a booking perspective, they did quite well. So I'm actually -- while the numbers don't show it, I'm actually quite pleased with the EMEA team. Asia-Pac is not a unified region. All the different geographies perform differently. But I think overall, they did pretty well. We saw growth in China again. Certainly, the China headlines haven't been great, but I think the team there continues to make progress.

I think that's a model that we're working through on our own. But obviously, it'll be something that we think is going to move the needle and something that we want to move the needle this coming fiscal year. So it's not something that's going to move the needle in the immediate term. I don't think that we're going to hire people, and they're going to be on full quarter in a very, very short period of time. There'll be a sliding scale in terms of how they ultimately ramp up. So the real impact to that will probably be towards the middle if it's the end of next year. But the investment will be front-ended. And as Nick indicated, in terms -- as we think about our full year business model, it's our full intention to operate within the bounds of the business model that we have previously communicated. But if I look at it, it's independent of the individual issues at the end of last quarter. If I look at our ratios and I look at our investments, we've done a substantial expansion of the portfolio. Within that portfolio has been carve-outs for specialists to drive things like E-Series and OnCommand, and I think that's paid off quite nicely for us. As we think about adding new products to the portfolio, whether it be StorageGRID or SteelStore, we're going to have to do some of that. So I expect all of those investments to come in, while in the meantime, we still need to be cultivating new accounts and new opportunities for Clustered ONTAP. And the other one is I think that our partners are a key part of this, I think investment in the partners so they come to speed on the new products that they are pitching and successfully be self-sufficient and pursuing these opportunities and, likewise, helping our customers with the migration to Clustered ONTAP as they're all go-to-market activities that I think have immediate impact or relatively near-term impact on the business. But the simple fact of the matter is, if sales force productivity was the issue and they were not anywhere near quota and they were suboptimal because we didn't have competitive products and we didn't have competitive technology, then I think we're making an entirely different investment choice. But the feeling is that the portfolio was strong and we just don't have enough people out there promoting it, selling it, serving customers. And that's the investment that we want to make within the confines of the business model that we talked about."

So I think, clearly, we've been doing shifting of resources within the envelope. I think across the entire company, we've worked very hard at that. And I think that manifests itself in terms of the engineering choice that we made and the price that we're bringing to market. And we were able to do that by deemphasizing other products and perhaps moving out of certain spaces. We have certainly seen it in terms of carving out part of the sales resource to focus on some of these newer products. I talked about E-Series and OnCommand, and that has worked out well for us. And I also talked -- in fact, we spoke at the Analyst Day around the enterprise strategy and getting our partners more self-sufficient in the midsize business so we can migrate some of our resources against the bigger opportunities in the enterprise. So we've seen that $1 million deals. And so if we look at that data, and that is more specialists around the new products generate sales. If we look at moving more resource towards the enterprise, we generate more $1 million deals. If we can continue to make our partners self-sufficient and continue that and widen the total umbrella, the total number of people engaged in that, I think we're hard-pressed not to conclude that there's an opportunity for growth in that, and that's the knob that we want to turn. Certainly, Clustered ONTAP has been a big investment. 8.3 is a culminating release for that. We absolutely needed to get that done. We need to get customers migrated to it. We certainly had to finish investments, so we'll make another key technologies around all-flash FAS and flash in general. But I think we're ready to shift that transition towards field-going activities now that the product arsenal is ready."

So -- and then we've got the hybrid arrays that also have flash. We certainly talked at Analyst Day. And our view of this is that flash is a compelling technology, it's got a compelling set of deployments and they're all different form factors. There's flash in the host [ph], there's all-flash arrays, there's hybrid arrays and all of those are going to be important. And the key component for us, ultimately, is not any of the individual products or any of the individual categories, it's about total flash under management, which was up huge year-over-year. So from our perspective, I think we're absolutely in the flash game. I think FlashRay has been a key driver of innovation for us. We've seen not only FlashRay in its own incarnation but FlashRay technology integrated and introduced in the form of all-flash FAS and EF as well. But all-flash FAS, clearly, is a product that the team is familiar with. Apache had a very, very big growth quarter. And overall, I think that the idea of an all-flash FAS, instead of a stand-alone point product, it's actually be a node of a cluster that's compatible with all of our data movers and all of our storage efficiency and all of our scale-out capability, it's a compelling value proposition. So I think FlashRay is going to serve a segment of the market. We continue to invest in it. It's in customers' hands, and we're getting feedback around the key efficiency and performance and ease-of-use components. But that's not the totality of the flash portfolio. In fact, the overall majority of our flash is in the other products. And in fact, the all-flash FAS, which is only introduced about 1.5 quarters ago, is actually the one that's actually ramping the hardest of all of those. And actually -- we're actually pretty pleased with the use cases. And what you'll see from that is, in fact, from a number of our products, our compelling performance benchmarks that we're going to publish in the very, very near future. So I think from a performance perspective, certainly, all-flash FAS has a feature set far beyond any other flash array and compelling performance and compelling efficiency. I think you'll see a lot of more of that product in the new future as well, while we continue to evolve and develop FlashRay to serve the segments that it's targeted at."

Now there's actually a fair amount of activity around Cloud ONTAP. The numbers of hours is in the 40,000 range. So those are people kicking the tires, playing with it. Some people are actually using it in production. But really, what I see Cloud ONTAP, it's a completion of our end-to-end seamless data management story with the cloud.

I think what SteelStore effectively is, is a backup appliance that's integrated with the cloud. And clearly, from our point of view and for those of you who were inside and certainly Analyst Day, we talked about the economics of the cloud, cloud being a resting place for very low utilization data, like backup and archive. So a way to seamlessly extend traditional backup all the way to the cloud is something that we felt very, very strongly about as an opportunity, and that was really the motivation for pursuing SteelStore. So I say that post-transaction, I think a couple of things came out, one of which was this is a product with a fair amount of visibility within Amazon. And the Amazon relationship is developing quite nicely around Cloud ONTAP, around NetApp Private Storage. And this one has become a third leg of the stool in that relationship. In fact, they've actually referenced -- actually, gave us some reference accounts to pursue with this. So I think at this point, it's not material to the number that Nick just gave. It will be certainly not 0. In fact, it's already been non-0. I think it's ahead of our initial forecast, but certainly, we're on the very, very front end of that curve. So I think so far, so good, no regrets. But I think it's a little bit too early to tell. But the real goal there is, ultimately, is how do we enable the next-generation of backup that successfully integrates the cloud but is compatible with all the backup methodologies that people currently deploy on-premise.
Okay. So first of all, thank you, all, for joining us today. As I think about the quarter that we just completed and I think about where we were last quarter, the evolution of the road map, we introduced more new technology in the last 6 months, whether it be a Clustered ONTAP 8.3, the acquisition of SteelStore, StorageGRID, OnCommand Insight, E-Series, FlashRay, all-flash FAS and the momentum that we saw, both in terms of the last quarter, the forecast for this quarter, I think we felt very, very good about the business.
So as I talked in the prepared text, clearly disappointed with the setback that we had, probably a little bit more than disappointed, probably downright angry because I felt like we were in very, very good shape, and we need to do better than that.
So as I think where we go forward, I think we are -- my belief, and as good a shape as we are in the portfolio, is unshaken. The execution issues, we will fix, and we're going to make key investments within the bounds of our business model to fully exploit the full potential of this portfolio and drive growth to this company. And that's our commitment.
So once again, thank you for your time, and I'll see you all next quarter."

We are clearly disappointed with our top line performance in Q3 and are committed to taking the steps necessary to get back on track.Despite the soft revenue, we delivered another quarter of solid operation",1052,"Thank you, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone. We are clearly disappointed with our top line performance in Q3 and are committed to taking the steps necessary to get back on track.
Despite the soft revenue, we delivered another quarter of solid operational performance with improved gross margins from Q3 a year ago and non-GAAP operating margin at the high end of our prior guidance. We've further reduced diluted share count and delivered EPS within our previous guidance range. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and continue to make progress against our hybrid cloud strategy.
Top line revenue finished below the low end of our guidance, impacted by greater-than-anticipated FX movement in the quarter, which Nick will quantify shortly, as well as our own sales execution issues. EMEA and APAC were impacted by FX, U.S. Public Sector, driven by strong performance in federal, had the highest growth, but Americas Commercial fell short of expectations.
The Americas team, buoyed by the increase in enterprise large deal activity in the first half of the fiscal year, was optimistic about their forecast. Deals over $1 million increased yet again in Q3, but we also saw a significant number of large deals slip out of the quarter. We have new leadership in global and Americas sales, and I'm confident in the team and fully expect the execution to improve.
Looking ahead, we see FX headwinds impacting growth for not only NetApp, but our customers as well. As companies lower their revenue expectations for the coming calendar year, there is an increased deferral of IT projects. We clearly saw that in January. Anticipated budget was no longer available as companies delivered updated spending targets for the new calendar year, and deals that were pushed out may not return in the near term. We are seeing large tech refresh opportunities being replaced with 1-year support renewals, an indication that customers remain committed to NetApp, but do not have budget to upgrade at this time.
Despite the revenue shortfall, we continue to make progress in key areas. As I mentioned earlier, Q3 marked our third consecutive quarter of growth in large deals, a point of validation of our enterprise strategy. In November, we further delivered against our data fabric vision with the availability of NetApp Private Storage for IBM SoftLayer, the SteelStore appliance and Cloud ONTAP for Amazon Web Services.
We also introduced the newest version of Data ONTAP, the industry's #1 storage operating system, Data ONTAP 8.3. To date, ONTAP 8.3 has had the fastest ramp of any of our Clustered ONTAP software release introductions. Shipments of clustered nodes grew 160% from Q3 a year ago. The attach rate of clustered ONTAP continues to increase and now stands at roughly 40% of FAS controllers shipped in the quarter.
Total system units shipped increased 9% from Q3 last year. We saw a notable strength in E-Series branded and configurations of all-flash FAS. The entirety of our portfolio has been refreshed over the past year with the recent launch of the E560 and the EF560. We continue to see sustained momentum with our broad flash portfolio as flash capacity shipped grew 69% year-over-year. With FlashRay innovation injected into all-flash FAS and the new EF560, we anticipate that our all-flash array systems will soon hold 2 of the top spots in the industry performance benchmark. 
OnCommand Insight also continues to perform well with the number of deals increasing from Q3 a year ago. 
Overall, we are confident with our portfolio and pleased with the growth of our emerging products.
As we have discussed in the past, both the market and enterprise IT are undergoing a major transition. Likewise, NetApp has been undergoing a transition to position ourselves for the future as we talked about at our Analyst Day last June. The NetApp Data Fabric vision, our seamless hybrid cloud strategy, is upleveling the nature of the conversations we are having with customers. We have delivered an unprecedented portfolio expansion, including new offerings in flash, object and cloud integration. We further augmented our cloud integration with the SteelStore product line acquisition. We have also highlighted the internal productivity, efficiency and supply line initiatives that have resulted in gross margin and operating margin improvements despite a very challenging growth environment. We have increased emphasis on our enterprise and cloud service provider customers while maintaining the momentum we have in midsize business.
We are seeing progress with our go-to-market transformation, but it's still a work in process and in need of ongoing improvement and investment. The increase of breadth of the portfolio and our compelling data fabric vision are yielding positive results, but it's clear that to fully realize the value of these new capabilities, we must expand our go-to-market capacity with greater account coverage, product specialists and partner enablement. Clustered Data ONTAP currently meets the technical requirements of our largest and most demanding customers. We believe NetApp's engagement in helping them execute the transition to Clustered ONTAP over the next year will unlock deferred tech refreshes.
In prior years, go-to-market capacity expansion in times of high confidence in the portfolio proved to be a growth driver, even in difficult environments. We believe we are in a similar situation today. 
We also understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a low growth environment and the resulting pressure on operating expenses. We will continue to employ the discipline of shifting resources away from lower-yield activities as well as driving productivity and efficiency through the organization to offset as much as possible the impact of high priority investments to expand capacity.
Overall, the growth of the emerging products, the uptake of Clustered ONTAP and the resonance of our vision with customers as well as our operational focus have been on a positive trajectory. All of this only compounds our disappointment with our performance last quarter. External factors such as FX were clear headwinds, but our focus is on our own issues and what it takes to get back on track. We do not see any change to our strategic priorities, and we'll aggressively seek to maximize return on our product portfolio within the confines of our business model.
I will now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on Q3 and our guidance for Q4 before returning with summary comments.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin in fiscal Q3, underscoring the resiliency of our business model. We delivered non-GAAP EPS within our previous guidance",1191,"Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin in fiscal Q3, underscoring the resiliency of our business model. We delivered non-GAAP EPS within our previous guidance range. However, as Tom indicated, the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, combined with our own sales execution challenges, presented headwinds in Q3 and resulted in revenue below our expectations.
Net revenues of $1.55 billion were up about 1% sequentially, but down 4% year-over-year. FX headwinds reduced the year-over-year revenue comparison by about 1.5 points, only 1 point of which we had anticipated when we gave revenue guidance for Q3 90 days ago.
Product revenue of $930 million was down 8% year-over-year. The combination of software entitlements and maintenance and service revenues totaling $622 million was up 5% year-over-year. 
Branded revenue was 92% of net revenues for Q3 and at $1.43 billion was flat sequentially, but down 2% year-over-year due to a combination of unfavorable foreign exchange and execution challenges in our Americas Commercial sales geography. Adjusted for FX, branded revenue would have been about flat year-over-year.
OEM revenue, which is transacted in U.S. dollars, was $124 million in Q3, up 4% sequentially, but down 21% on a year-over-year basis as expected. 
Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs accounted for 81% of Q3 net revenues. Arrow and Avnet contributed 22% and 16% of net revenues, respectively.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 64.6% was up just over 1 point from Q3 last year and just above our prior guidance range despite FX headwinds. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57% was relatively flat year-over-year, driven by unfavorable mix and FX, partially offset by continued supply chain execution. Sequentially, non-GAAP product gross margin was down just over 1 point due to mix.
Service gross margin of 64.5% was 3.7 points above Q3 of last year and 1.8 points above Q2 due to higher services revenues and lower spending.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 18.5%, at the high end of our previous guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 46% of revenue.
Consistent with our expectations, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 16.5%.
Q3 weighted average diluted share count of 317 million shares was below our prior guidance, down 6 million shares sequentially and down 29 million shares or 8% from Q3 last year due to continued stock repurchase activity. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 was in line with our prior guidance range and reflects the net impact of year-over-year FX headwinds of $0.02.
Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments, 13% of which is onshore. The sequential decrease in onshore cash was predominantly due to shares repurchased and dividends paid in the quarter. 
Inventory turns were at 19, and day sales outstanding were 39. Deferred revenue was $3.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year.
Q3 cash from operations was $275 million, and free cash flow was 16% of revenue, impacted by an increase in days sales outstanding due to unfavorable linearity.
In Q3, we returned $251 million to shareholders, which included $200 million in share repurchases and $51 million in cash dividends. Consistent with the guidance we provided last May, we remain on track to complete the remaining $206 million of our current share repurchase program by the end of May 2015, a year ahead of our original schedule.
Over the last few years, we have evolved our capital structure and delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders since May 2013. We are well-positioned to move ahead with the next phase of our capital allocation strategy.
I am pleased to announce that we have increased the size of our share repurchase authorization by $2.5 billion. We intend to complete this additional $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016.
Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.165 per share of the company stock to be paid on April 23, 2015. We remain committed to increasing our dividend over time.
Enhancements to our capital allocation strategy reflect our confidence in the long-term strength of NetApp's business as well as our ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. We have structured the capital allocation plan to ensure flexibility to support innovation and growth initiatives. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the program as well as future dividends and dividend increases will depend on market conditions, business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements.
Now to guidance. We remain confident in our strategy and competitive position. However, based on our own sales execution issues and the continued challenging IT spending environment, we are building a degree of caution into our top line expectations. We also expect FX headwinds to continue and impact year-over-year comparisons.
As a result, our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion which, at the midpoint, implies 3% sequential growth, but a 3% decline in revenue versus Q4 last year. Based on current rates, we have embedded an FX headwind of $50 million into our Q4 revenue guidance.
We expect our strong value proposition to continue to resonate with customers, and we will have an ongoing focus on supply chain efficiencies. With that said, we expect non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% in Q4, including about 1 point of FX headwind. We expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 17% to 17.5%, reflecting about 1 point of FX headwind as well as investments in our go-to-market capacity.
Based on our repurchases in Q3, we expect Q4 diluted share count of approximately 319 million shares, down 5% versus last year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 to range from approximately $0.70 to $0.75 per share, which reflects about $0.05 of dilution from unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year.
Our full year fiscal 2015 revenue will be lower than anticipated due to currency headwinds and incremental caution entering Q4, which I referenced earlier. EPS is expected to be flat from FY '14 due to FX headwinds, revenue softness and investments in the business, offset by gross margin improvement and share repurchases.
In closing, our product portfolio is as strong as it's ever been, and our discussions with customers continue to evolve to more strategic levels. Our capital allocation strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and inorganically in the business as well as return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The investments we're making today position us to fully take advantage of the opportunity ahead, and we expect to emerge from this transition with greater levels of growth and profitability. Through this evolution, we remain committed to our business model and to delivering shareholder value.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Tom for summary comments. Tom?"

We face ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and FX headwinds. Our industry is in transition as enterprises manage their existing infrastructure to meet the current and growing demands of the business while adopting new technologies and delivery options. Our solutions and technology vision are well-suited to help customers meet both of these requirements.
Cloud will play a key role in creating value for enterprise customers, and we want to accelerate their ability to realize that value. Enterprise will deploy a hybrid model with both cloud-based and on-premise resources in their IT environments. Our NetApp Data Fabric vision provides customers with the only consistent way to manage, secure and protect their data regardless of where they choose to store it. The NetApp Data Fabric weaves together disparate data elements of the hybrid cloud into a single integrated architecture, giving customers control and choice with the flexibility, elasticity and ubiquity of cloud resources.
Data ONTAP is the foundation of the NetApp Data Fabric. Clustered Data ONTAP delivers true software-defined functionality with a set of enterprise-wide data management capabilities, independent of the underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP enables customers to grow incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options, from converged and integrated systems to third-party arrays as well as software-only and cloud options.
We are confident in our ability to help customers take advantage of the evolving IT landscape. Our data fabric vision and portfolio of data management solutions offer differentiated approach that improves the economics and flexibility of customers' existing infrastructure while giving them a path to a hybrid cloud future. 
Our best-of-breed solutions are compelling for existing requirements and are integrated into a broader vision for the hybrid cloud that only NetApp can deliver.
The investments we are making in our go-to-market capacity and in accelerating the migration to Clustered ONTAP demonstrate the strength of our conviction in our technology and our strategy. During this transition, we remain committed to our business model and delivering shareholder value. Our expanded repurchase authorization exemplifies this commitment. We expect to come through the transition in a stronger position with a higher level of growth and profitability.
Before moving to Q&A, I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment. Despite the challenging environment, we are making the right choices and remain focused on innovation and execution, which enable us to deliver value to our customers and yield solid operational returns.

So it wasn't a question of we didn't have pipeline and we didn't",626,"Well, I think from the question about whether it be secular or competitive, effectively, what we're talking about here, what we saw pushed out were actually deals in the committed pipeline. So it wasn't a question of we didn't have pipeline and we didn't have deals that we're pursuing. These are deals that the sales force had committed that reflected in our forecast, reflected in our guidance and reflected in our planning as the quarter proceeded. And so not surprisingly, Monday the quarter ended, I was with our head of Americas sales and went through what happened to these deals. They went through a relatively long list of deals, 2 pages worth of deals that were committed, that we expected to count that didn't come in. And all of them have a story of which competitive and lost deals was a trivially small amount of that. So from a competitive perspective, I'd say, first and foremost, the competitive wasn't the key component. Some of it clearly was closeable deals that we didn't get done, and that's entirely on us. Some of it was changes in customer behavior. With the change of the calendar year and companies looking at their own financial forecast, their own FX impact, we certainly saw a deferral of deals that we thought were -- that were there. The other thing is in order for deals to be in the committed pipeline, they are deals for which, substantially, we have won the technical recommendation. So the competitive phase of a lot of these transactions was effectively over. So it was really about either customers changing budgets, requiring more scrutiny in their approval process or fundamentally thinking about their new budgets in light of the new calendar year. I think going forward, clearly, we need to watch this a lot more closely. We certainly saw elongated sales cycles earlier in the quarter, but the forecast has remained unchanged and the team was still relatively bullish about pulling it out. So I think that we need to look at some of the data points along the way. Certainly, we need to inspect a lot closer. And you can argue that the other side of this and the message to the team is, if there's uncertainty about closing deals, you need more deals. So what are we going to do to enhance the pipeline? So clearly, we're going to be watching this closely. As we look at our productivity, whether it be pipeline generation per rep or -- and even despite the quarter in terms of actually bookings per rep, the numbers are actually quite high, relatively high in our history. So sales force productivity is actually still pretty high. Yes, we didn't get these deals closed, but the feeling is it isn't like the sales force can't sell and productivity is down. That would be more of an indicator of a product problem or there's no opportunity out there. So our feeling, as long as productivity is high, that people are generating pipeline at peak levels historically, that if we can put more feet on the street and get more people out there selling the product, we can drive some more business. So that, of course, has a lead time associated with it in terms of hiring and bringing up to speed. By at the end of the day, we wouldn't have these deals in the committed pipeline, we wouldn't have the pipeline productivity we had unless we felt strongly about the portfolio and the portfolio was resonating. So I think where we are now, I don't think product is our issue. I think capacity is our issue, and that's the bet we're making. And that's what you're going to see from us going forward."

Likewise, we see FX not only in our industry, but we also see FX impact on our customers. And that's got to lead through into the decisions that they make. So I don't really know the answer to your question until we see actually more companies that are reporting January quarters. So our assumption is FX is purely mathematical, and everything else is our responsibility to get on to a fix. And like I said, if we look at these individual accounts, there's no doubt that we had closable deals, that we didn't get done in time, and that's just pure execution and those will fall into Q4. But we've also seen elongated approval cycles, and we've also seen people reevaluating what their plans are for the year now that the calendar year has changed. People thought they had budget when we put this in the pipeline that don't now. And I think the return of those transactions is as yet unknown. So I think from our perspective, we just clearly need to do better on that. I'm certainly not ready to say that there's a broader trend until I see some more data points.

So we were -- obviously, this is a quarter where you've got kind of the end of the quarter push and you've got the end of the calendar year push, which is a little bit different than other quarters. But from our point of view is, certainly, we saw bullishness going into the end of the year, and then still, we have expectation of a relatively strong normal quarter end in January. And a fair amount of that business didn't come through the way we would have thought. So I think we did see the budget flush. Maybe we could debate whether it's as robust as we thought, but certainly close enough. But we certainly had a lot of January business that was a normal part of our final month of a quarter that we'd see being back-end-loaded that didn't come in. And like I said, every deal has a story. But when you go through 40 deals and only 1 or 2 are competitive and the rest of them are deal-specific, I don't think the competition is really the issue. And on top of that, the feedback from the field was optimistic all quarter. We still did a record number of millions -- or increased number of million-dollar deals. So it wasn't like they were searching for business. They had business that they had, that was lined up and they thought they were going to close and they didn't."

So I guess at some point, your customers and your installed base just need to spend too much data growth. And despite all the efficiencies out there, why isn't that helping your visibility at some point? I'm just kind of curious, we've had a period of kind of sluggish growth in storage in the industry, frankly, not just with your numbers. And so I'm curious as to how you would think about that dynamic going through last year and then now having this added issue. And then the other clarification is despite this deferral of spending that you talk about, you're not really assuming any of it comes back in the near term, just to be clear, just to be conservative.

And likewise, frankly, I think we need to see what other companies are reporting that have January closed and see if this is common or not. So I think that there's just a natural sense of conservatism, both in terms of the forecast we received and, likewise, our own judging of those forecast as a result of this. I mean, simply put, we came out of last quarter relatively bullish. I mean, when I lay out the lay of the land, we were pushing the cloud story, came out of Insight with a lot of momentum. The feedback on the cloud and the hybrid cloud from customers and partners has been tremendous. We did a dramatic expansion of the portfolio with refreshers of E-Series, introduction of the StorageGRID Webscale, we acquired the SteelStore product, the release of 8.3. So very strong about the portfolio, felt very strong about the forecast and I think we came out of this last call, actually, relatively excited about where we're heading. So that's why we're really doubly disappointed about all of this. I don't -- in the end, if suddenly there was a competitive disjunct -- competitive disjoint or some type of quality issue or some type of product issue, but there's really none of that. So things were pretty much normal as far as we looked at the quarter, as it played out until we got to the end."

And I think certainly, on the oil and gas, it has a negative impact. Presumably, it will help the rest of the industry, but I think that's a lot more diffuse, now taking more time to flow through. So I'd say probably the only segment that I'd say that we could clearly identify with relatively urgent caution would be oil and gas. But I'd say most of the rest of the business is spread around. I mean, other sectors were very robust. I mean, one of the things that we talked about in prior calls is our belief that we were going to see solid growth on the federal side in the second half of the year over easier compares last year. That entirely came through. So if I think about the road map that we went into this year, we communicated at Analyst Day, we talked about a rebound in federal in terms of growth rate in the second half of the year. We certainly saw that. We talked about focus on the enterprise, and we certainly saw record $1 million deals. We certainly saw that. We certainly grow [ph] some $1 million deals. And I think overall, it seemed like a number of those things were on track, and that's what we kind of left last quarter with in terms of how we felt about the second half of the year. So I think some of the things came together and -- but other ones didn't. I think we sense that FX was clearly an issue. That was certainly a comment that we had last quarter. And I think that's proven to be a bigger issue that we originally thought, and Nick quantified that. And likewise, it's not just an issue for us or our competitors, it's also an issue for our customers, which has impact on their buying."

And I think we will continue to do that, and that should be a normal course of business. I wouldn't expect that to neither accelerate nor decline. I think on the question of larger deals, those tend to be very, very, asynchronous and hard to predict. So I think from our point of view, if I look at transactions that we've done, E-Series branded had a very, very strong quarter, up 100% again. I look at OnCommand Insight, which is also an acquired technology, that was also -- had a very, very good quarter. So I think the success of our acquired businesses has been very good. So from my point of view, I think we'll continue to do tuck-in acquisitions. In terms of larger deals, we don't get to predict when they're going to be available or when they're going to come about. But certainly, our recent track record has been pretty good. And for the right transaction at the right price, when that's executable, we'll certainly move ahead with that.

So I think we're looking at both of those differently. Overall, in terms of our international business, the EMEA team dealing with FX, obviously, the Russia situation, even the French situation late in the quarter, were all factors. And I think overall, from a booking perspective, they did quite well. So I'm actually -- while the numbers don't show it, I'm actually quite pleased with the EMEA team. Asia-Pac is not a unified region. All the different geographies perform differently. But I think overall, they did pretty well. We saw growth in China again. Certainly, the China headlines haven't been great, but I think the team there continues to make progress.

I think that's a model that we're working through on our own. But obviously, it'll be something that we think is going to move the needle and something that we want to move the needle this coming fiscal year. So it's not something that's going to move the needle in the immediate term. I don't think that we're going to hire people, and they're going to be on full quota in a very, very short period of time. There'll be a sliding scale in terms of how they ultimately ramp up. So the real impact of that will probably be towards the middle, the end of next year. But the investment will be front-ended. And as Nick indicated, in terms -- as we think about our full year business model, it's our full intention to operate within the bounds of the business model that we have previously communicated. But if I look at it, it's independent of the individual issues at the end of last quarter. If I look at our ratios and I look at our investments, we've done a substantial expansion of the portfolio. Within that portfolio has been carve-outs for specialists to drive things like E-Series and OnCommand, and I think that's paid off quite nicely for us. As we think about adding new products to the portfolio, whether it be StorageGRID or SteelStore, we're going to have to do some of that. So I expect all of those investments to come in, while in the meantime, we still need to be cultivating new accounts and new opportunities for Clustered ONTAP. And the other one is I think that our partners are a key part of this, I think investment in the partners so they come to speed on the new products as they are pitching and successing [ph] and successfully be self-sufficient and pursuing these opportunities and, likewise, helping our customers with the migration to Clustered ONTAP, those are all go-to-market activities that I think have immediate impact or relatively near-term impact on the business. But the simple fact of the matter is, if sales force productivity was the issue and they were not anywhere near quota and they were suboptimal because we didn't have competitive products and we didn't have competitive technology, then I think we'd be making an entirely different investment choice. But the feeling is that the portfolio was strong and we just don't have enough people out there promoting it, selling it, serving customers.

So I think, clearly, we've been doing shifting of resources within the envelope. I think across the entire company, we've worked very hard at that. And I think that manifests itself in terms of the engineering choice that we made and the price that we're bringing to market. And we were able to do that by deemphasizing other products and perhaps moving out of certain spaces. We have certainly seen it in terms of carving out part of the sales resource to focus on some of these newer products. I talked about E-Series and OnCommand, and that has worked out well for us. And I also talked -- in fact, we spoke at the Analyst Day around the enterprise strategy and getting our partners more self-sufficient in the midsize business so we can migrate some of our resources against the bigger opportunities in the enterprise. So we've seen that in $1 million deals. And so if we look at that data, and that is more specialists around the new products generate sales. If we look at moving more resource towards the enterprise, we generate more $1 million deals. If we can continue to make our partners self-sufficient and continue that and widen the total umbrella, the total number of people engaged in that, I think we're hard-pressed not to conclude that there's an opportunity for growth in that, and that's the knob that we want to turn. Certainly, Clustered ONTAP has been a big investment. 8.3 is a culminating release for that. We absolutely needed to get that done. We need to get customers migrated to it. We certainly had to finish investments, so we're making other key technologies around all-flash FAS and flash in general. But I think we're ready to shift that transition towards field-going activities now that the product arsenal is ready."

So -- and then we've got the hybrid arrays that also have flash. We certainly talked at Analyst Day. And our view of this is that flash is a compelling technology, it's got a compelling set of deployments and they're all different form factors. There's flash in the host [ph], there's all-flash arrays, there's hybrid arrays and all of those are going to be important. And the key component for us, ultimately, is not any of the individual products or any of the individual categories, it's about total flash under management, which was up huge year-over-year. So from our perspective, I think we're absolutely in the flash game. I think FlashRay has been a key driver of innovation for us. We've seen not only FlashRay in its own incarnation but FlashRay technology integrated and introduced in the form of all-flash FAS and EF as well. But all-flash FAS, clearly, as a product that the team is familiar with, actually had a very, very big growth quarter. And overall, I think that the idea of an all-flash FAS, instead of a stand-alone point product, it's actually be a node of a cluster that's compatible with all of our data movers and all of our storage efficiency and all of our scale-out capability, it's a compelling value proposition. So I think FlashRay is going to serve a segment of the market. We continue to invest in it. It's in customers' hands, and we're getting feedback around the key efficiency and performance and ease-of-use components. But that's not the totality of the flash portfolio. In fact, the overall majority of our flash is in the other products. And in fact, the all-flash FAS, which is only introduced about 1.5 quarters ago, is actually the one that's actually ramping the hardest of all of those. And actually -- we're actually pretty pleased with the use cases. And what you'll see from that is, in fact, from a number of our products, our compelling performance benchmarks that we're going to publish in the very, very near future. So I think from a performance perspective, certainly, all-flash FAS has a feature set far beyond any other flash array and compelling performance and compelling efficiency. I think you'll see a lot of more of that product in the new future as well, while we continue to evolve and develop FlashRay to serve the segments that it's targeted at."

What we're really looking to do is getting more people out there, getting in front of new customers, new customer acquisitions and deeper into our largest, biggest customers. So I'd say that -- the reason why I brought up the product specialists is within a fixed envelope, the more product specialists you have, the less generalists you have.

I think what SteelStore effectively is, is a backup appliance that's integrated with the cloud. And clearly, from our point of view and for those of you who were at Insight and certainly Analyst Day, we talked about the economics of the cloud, the cloud being a resting place for very low utilization data, like backup and archive. So a way to seamlessly extend traditional backup all the way to the cloud is something that we felt very, very strongly about as an opportunity, and that was really the motivation for pursuing SteelStore. So I say that post-transaction, I think a couple of things came out, one of which was this is a product with a fair amount of visibility within Amazon. And the Amazon relationship is developing quite nicely around Cloud ONTAP, around NetApp Private Storage. And this one has become a third leg of the stool in that relationship. In fact, they've actually referenced -- actually, gave us some reference accounts to pursue with this. So I think at this point, it's not material to the number that Nick just gave. It will be certainly not 0. In fact, it's already been non-0. I think it's ahead of our initial forecast, but certainly, we're on the very, very front end of that curve. So I think so far, so good, no regrets. But I think it's a little bit too early to tell. But the real goal there is, ultimately, is how do we enable the next-generation of backup that successfully integrates the cloud but is compatible with all the backup methodologies that people currently deploy on-premise.
Okay. So first of all, thank you, all, for joining us today. As I think about the quarter that we just completed and I think about where we were last quarter, the evolution of the road map, we introduced more new technology in the last 6 months, whether it be a Clustered ONTAP 8.3, the acquisition of SteelStore, StorageGRID, OnCommand Insight, E-Series, FlashRay, all-flash FAS and the momentum that we saw, both in terms of the last quarter, the forecast for this quarter, I think we felt very, very good about the business.
So as I talked in the prepared text, clearly disappointed with the setback that we had, probably a little bit more than disappointed, probably downright angry because I felt like we were in very, very good shape, and we need to do better than that.
So as I think where we go forward, I think we are -- my belief, in as good a shape as we are with the portfolio, is unshaken. The execution issues, we will fix, and we're going to make key investments within the bounds of our business model to fully exploit the full potential of this portfolio and drive growth to this company. And that's our commitment.
So once again, thank you for your time, and I'll see you all next quarter."

We are clearly disappointed with our top line performance in Q3 and are committed to taking the steps necessary to get back on track.Despite the soft revenue, we delivered another quarter of solid operation",1052,"Thank you, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone. We are clearly disappointed with our top line performance in Q3 and are committed to taking the steps necessary to get back on track.
Despite the soft revenue, we delivered another quarter of solid operational performance with improved gross margins from Q3 a year ago and non-GAAP operating margin at the high end of our prior guidance. We've further reduced diluted share count and delivered EPS within our previous guidance range. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and continue to make progress against our hybrid cloud strategy.
Top line revenue finished below the low end of our guidance, impacted by greater-than-anticipated FX movement in the quarter, which Nick will quantify shortly, as well as our own sales execution issues. EMEA and APAC were impacted by FX, U.S. Public Sector, driven by strong performance in federal, had the highest growth, but Americas Commercial fell short of expectations.
The Americas team, buoyed by the increase in enterprise large deal activity in the first half of the fiscal year, was optimistic about their forecast. Deals over $1 million increased yet again in Q3, but we also saw a significant number of large deals slip out of the quarter. We have new leadership in global and Americas sales, and I'm confident in the team and fully expect the execution to improve.
Looking ahead, we see FX headwinds impacting growth for not only NetApp, but our customers as well. As companies lower their revenue expectations for the coming calendar year, there is an increased deferral of IT projects. We clearly saw that in January. Anticipated budget was no longer available as companies delivered updated spending targets for the new calendar year, and deals that were pushed out may not return in the near term. We are seeing large tech refresh opportunities being replaced with 1-year support renewals, an indication that customers remain committed to NetApp, but do not have budget to upgrade at this time.
Despite the revenue shortfall, we continue to make progress in key areas. As I mentioned earlier, Q3 marked our third consecutive quarter of growth in large deals, a point of validation of our enterprise strategy. In November, we further delivered against our data fabric vision with the availability of NetApp Private Storage for IBM SoftLayer, the SteelStore appliance and Cloud ONTAP for Amazon Web Services.
We also introduced the newest version of Data ONTAP, the industry's #1 storage operating system, Data ONTAP 8.3. To date, ONTAP 8.3 has had the fastest ramp of any of our Clustered ONTAP software release introductions. Shipments of clustered nodes grew 160% from Q3 a year ago. The attach rate of clustered ONTAP continues to increase and now stands at roughly 40% of FAS controllers shipped in the quarter.
Total system units shipped increased 9% from Q3 last year. We saw a notable strength in E-Series branded and configurations of all-flash FAS. The entirety of our portfolio has been refreshed over the past year with the recent launch of the E560 and the EF560. We continue to see sustained momentum with our broad flash portfolio as flash capacity shipped grew 69% year-over-year. With FlashRay innovation injected into all-flash FAS and the new EF560, we anticipate that our all-flash array systems will soon hold 2 of the top spots in the industry performance benchmark. 
OnCommand Insight also continues to perform well with the number of deals increasing from Q3 a year ago. 
Overall, we are confident with our portfolio and pleased with the growth of our emerging products.
As we have discussed in the past, both the market and enterprise IT are undergoing a major transition. Likewise, NetApp has been undergoing a transition to position ourselves for the future as we talked about at our Analyst Day last June. The NetApp Data Fabric vision, our seamless hybrid cloud strategy, is upleveling the nature of the conversations we are having with customers. We have delivered an unprecedented portfolio expansion, including new offerings in flash, object and cloud integration. We further augmented our cloud integration with the SteelStore product line acquisition. We have also highlighted the internal productivity, efficiency and supply line initiatives that have resulted in gross margin and operating margin improvements despite a very challenging growth environment. We have increased emphasis on our enterprise and cloud service provider customers while maintaining the momentum we have in midsize business.
We are seeing progress with our go-to-market transformation, but it's still a work in process and in need of ongoing improvement and investment. The increase of breadth of the portfolio and our compelling data fabric vision are yielding positive results, but it's clear that to fully realize the value of these new capabilities, we must expand our go-to-market capacity with greater account coverage, product specialists and partner enablement. Clustered Data ONTAP currently meets the technical requirements of our largest and most demanding customers. We believe NetApp's engagement in helping them execute the transition to Clustered ONTAP over the next year will unlock deferred tech refreshes.
In prior years, go-to-market capacity expansion in times of high confidence in the portfolio proved to be a growth driver, even in difficult environments. We believe we are in a similar situation today. 
We also understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a low growth environment and the resulting pressure on operating expenses. We will continue to employ the discipline of shifting resources away from lower-yield activities as well as driving productivity and efficiency through the organization to offset as much as possible the impact of high priority investments to expand capacity.
Overall, the growth of the emerging products, the uptake of Clustered ONTAP and the resonance of our vision with customers as well as our operational focus have been on a positive trajectory. All of this only compounds our disappointment with our performance last quarter. External factors such as FX were clear headwinds, but our focus is on our own issues and what it takes to get back on track. We do not see any change to our strategic priorities, and we'll aggressively seek to maximize return on our product portfolio within the confines of our business model.
I will now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on Q3 and our guidance for Q4 before returning with summary comments.

We delivered non-GAAP EPS within our previous guidance",1191,"Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin in fiscal Q3, underscoring the resiliency of our business model. We delivered non-GAAP EPS within our previous guidance range. However, as Tom indicated, the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, combined with our own sales execution challenges, presented headwinds in Q3 and resulted in revenue below our expectations.
Net revenues of $1.55 billion were up about 1% sequentially, but down 4% year-over-year. FX headwinds reduced the year-over-year revenue comparison by about 1.5 points, only 1 point of which we had anticipated when we gave revenue guidance for Q3 90 days ago.
Product revenue of $930 million was down 8% year-over-year. The combination of software entitlements and maintenance and service revenues totaling $622 million was up 5% year-over-year. 
Branded revenue was 92% of net revenues for Q3 and at $1.43 billion was flat sequentially, but down 2% year-over-year due to a combination of unfavorable foreign exchange and execution challenges in our Americas Commercial sales geography. Adjusted for FX, branded revenue would have been about flat year-over-year.
OEM revenue, which is transacted in U.S. dollars, was $124 million in Q3, up 4% sequentially, but down 21% on a year-over-year basis as expected. 
Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs accounted for 81% of Q3 net revenues. Arrow and Avnet contributed 22% and 16% of net revenues, respectively.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 64.6% was up just over 1 point from Q3 last year and just above our prior guidance range despite FX headwinds. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57% was relatively flat year-over-year, driven by unfavorable mix and FX, partially offset by continued supply chain execution. Sequentially, non-GAAP product gross margin was down just over 1 point due to mix.
Service gross margin of 64.5% was 3.7 points above Q3 of last year and 1.8 points above Q2 due to higher services revenues and lower spending.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 18.5%, at the high end of our previous guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 46% of revenue.
Consistent with our expectations, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 16.5%.
Q3 weighted average diluted share count of 317 million shares was below our prior guidance, down 6 million shares sequentially and down 29 million shares or 8% from Q3 last year due to continued stock repurchase activity. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 was in line with our prior guidance range and reflects the net impact of year-over-year FX headwinds of $0.02.
Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments, 13% of which is onshore. The sequential decrease in onshore cash was predominantly due to shares repurchased and dividends paid in the quarter. 
Inventory turns were at 19, and day sales outstanding were 39. Deferred revenue was $3.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year.
Q3 cash from operations was $275 million, and free cash flow was 16% of revenue, impacted by an increase in days sales outstanding due to unfavorable linearity.
In Q3, we returned $251 million to shareholders, which included $200 million in share repurchases and $51 million in cash dividends. Consistent with the guidance we provided last May, we remain on track to complete the remaining $206 million of our current share repurchase program by the end of May 2015, a year ahead of our original schedule.
Over the last few years, we have evolved our capital structure and delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders since May 2013. We are well-positioned to move ahead with the next phase of our capital allocation strategy.
I am pleased to announce that we have increased the size of our share repurchase authorization by $2.5 billion. We intend to complete this additional $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016.
Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.165 per share of the company stock to be paid on April 23, 2015. We remain committed to increasing our dividend over time.
Enhancements to our capital allocation strategy reflect our confidence in the long-term strength of NetApp's business as well as our ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. We have structured the capital allocation plan to ensure flexibility to support innovation and growth initiatives. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under the program as well as future dividends and dividend increases will depend on market conditions, business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements.
Now to guidance. We remain confident in our strategy and competitive position. However, based on our own sales execution issues and the continued challenging IT spending environment, we are building a degree of caution into our top line expectations. We also expect FX headwinds to continue and impact year-over-year comparisons.
As a result, our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion which, at the midpoint, implies 3% sequential growth, but a 3% decline in revenue versus Q4 last year. Based on current rates, we have embedded an FX headwind of $50 million into our Q4 revenue guidance.
We expect our strong value proposition to continue to resonate with customers, and we will have an ongoing focus on supply chain efficiencies. With that said, we expect non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% in Q4, including about 1 point of FX headwind. We expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 17% to 17.5%, reflecting about 1 point of FX headwind as well as investments in our go-to-market capacity.
Based on our repurchases in Q3, we expect Q4 diluted share count of approximately 319 million shares, down 5% versus last year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 to range from approximately $0.70 to $0.75 per share, which reflects about $0.05 of dilution from unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year.
Our full year fiscal 2015 revenue will be lower than anticipated due to currency headwinds and incremental caution entering Q4, which I referenced earlier. EPS is expected to be flat from FY '14 due to FX headwinds, revenue softness and investments in the business, offset by gross margin improvement and share repurchases.
In closing, our product portfolio is as strong as it's ever been, and our discussions with customers continue to evolve to more strategic levels. Our capital allocation strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and inorganically in the business as well as return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The investments we're making today position us to fully take advantage of the opportunity ahead, and we expect to emerge from this transition with greater levels of growth and profitability. Through this evolution, we remain committed to our business model and to delivering shareholder value.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Tom for summary comments. Tom?"

So it wasn't a question of we didn't have pipeline and we didn't",626,"Well, I think from the question about whether it be secular or competitive, effectively, what we're talking about here, what we saw pushed out were actually deals in the committed pipeline. So it wasn't a question of we didn't have pipeline and we didn't have deals that we're pursuing. These are deals that the sales force had committed that reflected in our forecast, reflected in our guidance and reflected in our planning as the quarter proceeded. And so not surprisingly, Monday the quarter ended, I was with our head of Americas sales and went through what happened to these deals. They went through a relatively long list of deals, 2 pages worth of deals that were committed, that we expected to count that didn't come in. And all of them have a story of which competitive and lost deals was a trivially small amount of that. So from a competitive perspective, I'd say, first and foremost, the competitive wasn't the key component. Some of it clearly was closeable deals that we didn't get done, and that's entirely on us. Some of it was changes in customer behavior. With the change of the calendar year and companies looking at their own financial forecast, their own FX impact, we certainly saw a deferral of deals that we thought were -- that were there. The other thing is in order for deals to be in the committed pipeline, they are deals for which, substantially, we have won the technical recommendation. So the competitive phase of a lot of these transactions was effectively over. So it was really about either customers changing budgets, requiring more scrutiny in their approval process or fundamentally thinking about their new budgets in light of the new calendar year. I think going forward, clearly, we need to watch this a lot more closely. We certainly saw elongated sales cycles earlier in the quarter, but the forecast has remained unchanged and the team was still relatively bullish about pulling it out. So I think that we need to look at some of the data points along the way. Certainly, we need to inspect a lot closer. And you can argue that the other side of this and the message to the team is, if there's uncertainty about closing deals, you need more deals. So what are we going to do to enhance the pipeline? So clearly, we're going to be watching this closely. As we look at our productivity, whether it be pipeline generation per rep or -- and even despite the quarter in terms of actually bookings per rep, the numbers are actually quite high, relatively high in our history. So sales force productivity is actually still pretty high. Yes, we didn't get these deals closed, but the feeling is it isn't like the sales force can't sell and productivity is down. That would be more of an indicator of a product problem or there's no opportunity out there. So our feeling, as long as productivity is high, that people are generating pipeline at peak levels historically, that if we can put more feet on the street and get more people out there selling the product, we can drive some more business. So that, of course, has a lead time associated with it in terms of hiring and bringing up to speed. By at the end of the day, we wouldn't have these deals in the committed pipeline, we wouldn't have the pipeline productivity we had unless we felt strongly about the portfolio and the portfolio was resonating. So I think where we are now, I don't think product is our issue. I think capacity is our issue, and that's the bet we're making. And that's what you're going to see from us going forward."

Likewise, we see FX not only in our industry, but we also see FX impact on our customers. And that's got to lead through into the decisions that they make. So I don't really know the answer to your question until we see actually more companies that are reporting January quarters. So our assumption is FX is purely mathematical, and everything else is our responsibility to get on to a fix. And like I said, if we look at these individual accounts, there's no doubt that we had closable deals, that we didn't get done in time, and that's just pure execution and those will fall into Q4. But we've also seen elongated approval cycles, and we've also seen people reevaluating what their plans are for the year now that the calendar year has changed. People thought they had budget when we put this in the pipeline that don't now. And I think the return of those transactions is as yet unknown. So I think from our perspective, we just clearly need to do better on that. I'm certainly not ready to say that there's a broader trend until I see some more data points. But for our point of view is that we're going to focus on our deals and our pipeline, and we're going to do a better job executing this quarter."

So we were -- obviously, this is a quarter where you've got kind of the end of the quarter push and you've got the end of the calendar year push, which is a little bit different than other quarters. But from our point of view is, certainly, we saw bullishness going into the end of the year, and then still, we have expectation of a relatively strong normal quarter end in January. And a fair amount of that business didn't come through the way we would have thought. So I think we did see the budget flush. Maybe we could debate whether it's as robust as we thought, but certainly close enough. But we certainly had a lot of January business that was a normal part of our final month of a quarter that we'd see being back-end-loaded that didn't come in. And like I said, every deal has a story. But when you go through 40 deals and only 1 or 2 are competitive and the rest of them are deal-specific, I don't think the competition is really the issue. And on top of that, the feedback from the field was optimistic all quarter. We still did a record number of millions -- or increased number of million-dollar deals. So it wasn't like they were searching for business. They had business that they had, that was lined up and they thought they were going to close and they didn't."

So I think that there's just a natural sense of conservatism, both in terms of the forecast we received and, likewise, our own judging of those forecast as a result of this. I mean, simply put, we came out of last quarter relatively bullish. I mean, when I lay out the lay of the land, we were pushing the cloud story, came out of Insight with a lot of momentum. The feedback on the cloud and the hybrid cloud from customers and partners has been tremendous. We did a dramatic expansion of the portfolio with refreshers of E-Series, introduction of the StorageGRID Webscale, we acquired the SteelStore product, the release of 8.3. So very strong about the portfolio, felt very strong about the forecast and I think we came out of this last call, actually, relatively excited about where we're heading. So that's why we're really doubly disappointed about all of this. I don't -- in the end, if suddenly there was a competitive disjunct -- competitive disjoint or some type of quality issue or some type of product issue, but there's really none of that.

And I think certainly, on the oil and gas, it has a negative impact. Presumably, it will help the rest of the industry, but I think that's a lot more diffuse, now taking more time to flow through. So I'd say probably the only segment that I'd say that we could clearly identify with relatively urgent caution would be oil and gas. But I'd say most of the rest of the business is spread around. I mean, other sectors were very robust. I mean, one of the things that we talked about in prior calls is our belief that we were going to see solid growth on the federal side in the second half of the year over easier compares last year. That entirely came through. So if I think about the road map that we went into this year, we communicated at Analyst Day, we talked about a rebound in federal in terms of growth rate in the second half of the year. We certainly saw that. We talked about focus on the enterprise, and we certainly saw record $1 million deals. We certainly saw that. We certainly grow [ph] some $1 million deals. And I think overall, it seemed like a number of those things were on track, and that's what we kind of left last quarter with in terms of how we felt about the second half of the year. So I think some of the things came together and -- but other ones didn't. I think we sense that FX was clearly an issue. That was certainly a comment that we had last quarter.

So while there were elongated sales cycles, we still were back-end-loaded even though we didn't take all this business at the end. But that said, I don't think there's really anything more to the DSO story. The other question about -- oh acquisitions? I think acquisitions, I don't think this changes our opinion on acquisitions. I think we will continue to move ahead with tuck-in acquisitions that expand our portfolio. We did 2 this past quarter. The SteelStore one is the one that got more headlines. And I think we will continue to do that, and that should be a normal course of business. I wouldn't expect that to neither accelerate nor decline. I think on the question of larger deals, those tend to be very, very, asynchronous and hard to predict. So I think from our point of view, if I look at transactions that we've done, E-Series branded had a very, very strong quarter, up 100% again. I look at OnCommand Insight, which is also an acquired technology, that was also -- had a very, very good quarter. So I think the success of our acquired businesses has been very good. So from my point of view, I think we'll continue to do tuck-in acquisitions. In terms of larger deals, we don't get to predict when they're going to be available or when they're going to come about. But certainly, our recent track record has been pretty good. And for the right transaction at the right price, when that's executable, we'll certainly move ahead with that. But I wouldn't want to predict any rate or any either increased desire or a decreased desire to pursue those."

So I think we're looking at both of those differently. Overall, in terms of our international business, the EMEA team dealing with FX, obviously, the Russia situation, even the French situation late in the quarter, were all factors. And I think overall, from a booking perspective, they did quite well. So I'm actually -- while the numbers don't show it, I'm actually quite pleased with the EMEA team. Asia-Pac is not a unified region. All the different geographies perform differently. But I think overall, they did pretty well. We saw growth in China again. Certainly, the China headlines haven't been great, but I think the team there continues to make progress. And so I think the biggest surprise relative to where we thought we were going to be is in the Americas and, particularly, the Americas non-federal."

I think that's a model that we're working through on our own. But obviously, it'll be something that we think is going to move the needle and something that we want to move the needle this coming fiscal year. So it's not something that's going to move the needle in the immediate term. I don't think that we're going to hire people, and they're going to be on full quota in a very, very short period of time. There'll be a sliding scale in terms of how they ultimately ramp up. So the real impact of that will probably be towards the middle, the end of next year. But the investment will be front-ended. And as Nick indicated, in terms -- as we think about our full year business model, it's our full intention to operate within the bounds of the business model that we have previously communicated. But if I look at it, it's independent of the individual issues at the end of last quarter. If I look at our ratios and I look at our investments, we've done a substantial expansion of the portfolio. Within that portfolio has been carve-outs for specialists to drive things like E-Series and OnCommand, and I think that's paid off quite nicely for us. As we think about adding new products to the portfolio, whether it be StorageGRID or SteelStore, we're going to have to do some of that. So I expect all of those investments to come in, while in the meantime, we still need to be cultivating new accounts and new opportunities for Clustered ONTAP. And the other one is I think that our partners are a key part of this, I think investment in the partners so they come to speed on the new products as they are pitching and successing [ph] and successfully be self-sufficient and pursuing these opportunities and, likewise, helping our customers with the migration to Clustered ONTAP, those are all go-to-market activities that I think have immediate impact or relatively near-term impact on the business. But the simple fact of the matter is, if sales force productivity was the issue and they were not anywhere near quota and they were suboptimal because we didn't have competitive products and we didn't have competitive technology, then I think we'd be making an entirely different investment choice. But the feeling is that the portfolio was strong and we just don't have enough people out there promoting it, selling it, serving customers. And that's the investment that we want to make within the confines of the business model that we talked about."

So I think, clearly, we've been doing shifting of resources within the envelope. I think across the entire company, we've worked very hard at that. And I think that manifests itself in terms of the engineering choice that we made and the price that we're bringing to market. And we were able to do that by deemphasizing other products and perhaps moving out of certain spaces. We have certainly seen it in terms of carving out part of the sales resource to focus on some of these newer products. I talked about E-Series and OnCommand, and that has worked out well for us. And I also talked -- in fact, we spoke at the Analyst Day around the enterprise strategy and getting our partners more self-sufficient in the midsize business so we can migrate some of our resources against the bigger opportunities in the enterprise. So we've seen that in $1 million deals. And so if we look at that data, and that is more specialists around the new products generate sales. If we look at moving more resource towards the enterprise, we generate more $1 million deals. If we can continue to make our partners self-sufficient and continue that and widen the total umbrella, the total number of people engaged in that, I think we're hard-pressed not to conclude that there's an opportunity for growth in that, and that's the knob that we want to turn. Certainly, Clustered ONTAP has been a big investment. 8.3 is a culminating release for that. We absolutely needed to get that done. We need to get customers migrated to it. We certainly had to finish investments, so we're making other key technologies around all-flash FAS and flash in general. But I think we're ready to shift that transition towards field-going activities now that the product arsenal is ready."

So -- and then we've got the hybrid arrays that also have flash. We certainly talked at Analyst Day. And our view of this is that flash is a compelling technology, it's got a compelling set of deployments and they're all different form factors. There's flash in the host [ph], there's all-flash arrays, there's hybrid arrays and all of those are going to be important. And the key component for us, ultimately, is not any of the individual products or any of the individual categories, it's about total flash under management, which was up huge year-over-year. So from our perspective, I think we're absolutely in the flash game. I think FlashRay has been a key driver of innovation for us. We've seen not only FlashRay in its own incarnation but FlashRay technology integrated and introduced in the form of all-flash FAS and EF as well. But all-flash FAS, clearly, as a product that the team is familiar with, actually had a very, very big growth quarter. And overall, I think that the idea of an all-flash FAS, instead of a stand-alone point product, it's actually be a node of a cluster that's compatible with all of our data movers and all of our storage efficiency and all of our scale-out capability, it's a compelling value proposition. So I think FlashRay is going to serve a segment of the market. We continue to invest in it. It's in customers' hands, and we're getting feedback around the key efficiency and performance and ease-of-use components. But that's not the totality of the flash portfolio. In fact, the overall majority of our flash is in the other products. And in fact, the all-flash FAS, which is only introduced about 1.5 quarters ago, is actually the one that's actually ramping the hardest of all of those. And actually -- we're actually pretty pleased with the use cases. And what you'll see from that is, in fact, from a number of our products, our compelling performance benchmarks that we're going to publish in the very, very near future. So I think from a performance perspective, certainly, all-flash FAS has a feature set far beyond any other flash array and compelling performance and compelling efficiency. I think you'll see a lot of more of that product in the new future as well, while we continue to evolve and develop FlashRay to serve the segments that it's targeted at."

I think what SteelStore effectively is, is a backup appliance that's integrated with the cloud. And clearly, from our point of view and for those of you who were at Insight and certainly Analyst Day, we talked about the economics of the cloud, the cloud being a resting place for very low utilization data, like backup and archive. So a way to seamlessly extend traditional backup all the way to the cloud is something that we felt very, very strongly about as an opportunity, and that was really the motivation for pursuing SteelStore. So I say that post-transaction, I think a couple of things came out, one of which was this is a product with a fair amount of visibility within Amazon. And the Amazon relationship is developing quite nicely around Cloud ONTAP, around NetApp Private Storage. And this one has become a third leg of the stool in that relationship. In fact, they've actually referenced -- actually, gave us some reference accounts to pursue with this. So I think at this point, it's not material to the number that Nick just gave. It will be certainly not 0. In fact, it's already been non-0. I think it's ahead of our initial forecast, but certainly, we're on the very, very front end of that curve. So I think so far, so good, no regrets. But I think it's a little bit too early to tell. But the real goal there is, ultimately, is how do we enable the next-generation of backup that successfully integrates the cloud but is compatible with all the backup methodologies that people currently deploy on-premise.
Okay. So first of all, thank you, all, for joining us today. As I think about the quarter that we just completed and I think about where we were last quarter, the evolution of the road map, we introduced more new technology in the last 6 months, whether it be a Clustered ONTAP 8.3, the acquisition of SteelStore, StorageGRID, OnCommand Insight, E-Series, FlashRay, all-flash FAS and the momentum that we saw, both in terms of the last quarter, the forecast for this quarter, I think we felt very, very good about the business.
So as I talked in the prepared text, clearly disappointed with the setback that we had, probably a little bit more than disappointed, probably downright angry because I felt like we were in very, very good shape, and we need to do better than that.
So as I think where we go forward, I think we are -- my belief, in as good a shape as we are with the portfolio, is unshaken. The execution issues, we will fix, and we're going to make key investments within the bounds of our business model to fully exploit the full potential of this portfolio and drive growth to this company. And that's our commitment.
So once again, thank you for your time, and I'll see you all next quarter."

And on today's call, I will outline the key reasons for our disappointing performance as well as the steps we are taking to position NetApp for the next phase of our evolution. I will then turn the call over to Nick to provide additional detail on the quarter and our expectations going into fiscal year 2016.  Before we open the call for questions, I'll return to summarize the reasons for our continued confidence in the business.
As I discussed on past calls, the IT industry is undergoing a radical shift as customers rebalance their IT investments to take advantage of the cloud. IT organizations will deploy a mix of on-premises and cloud-based resources, which have slowed the growth rate of the storage market. Every IT vendor is faced with this transition, and the successful ones will evolve their business to incorporate this new reality.  We are well positioned for the era of cloud computing and with a robust portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions that enable customers to meet the current and growing demands of their business, while adopting new technologies and delivery options.  
NetApp itself is also undergoing a significant transition to the conversion of our customers to clustered ONTAP. On our last call, we talked about execution challenges in our Americas commercial business that materialized late in the third quarter. We also discussed the need to increase our go-to-market capacity. After a analysis of these challenges, it is clear we underestimated the disruption that the transition to clustered ONTAP has had on our direct and indirect pipeline. The disruption has been most acutely felt in our Americas geography due to the heavy concentration of large enterprise customers in the U.S.
Clustered ONTAP is a re-architected and a modernized version of the ONTAP technology. It is our platform for the next decade of innovation. However, to fully realize the benefits of this technology, customers have to update existing storage management processes and migrate their data. While the value of clustered ONTAP is driving momentum with these new customers and new workloads in existing customers, many of our largest install base customers have been resistant to upgrade until parity with the traditional version of ONTAP was achieved. This is even truly in case for customers who have standardized clustered ONTAP for new workloads elsewhere in their environment.
The inhibitors to upgrade have now been mitigated with a generally available release of clustered ONTAP 8.3. Our largest customers now see a path to the advanced innovation and functionality of clustered ONTAP and our planning for migrating. 
Since most of the upgrades are in conjunction with hardware refreshes, we are seeing delays in new hardware purchases until planning for process changes and downtime windows can be completed. This planning can be complex. And as a consequence, customers are deferring hardware refreshes and extending the life of existing gear. The financial impact to us is lower product sales and increased short-term service renewals.
The complexity and duration of clustered ONTAP transitions have implications on several dimensions. First, it reduces predictability on some of our largest accounts. We saw that in Q3, and it continues in Q4. 
Second, our smaller accounts, which are often partner led, are similarly facing this transition. While installations tend to be less complex, we are often dependent upon our channel partners to guide them through the process. These partners that have made an investment in clustered ONTAP training, typically our largest, have had a good year. However, others who are not as well versed in selling clustered ONTAP have seen their customers defer upgrades, which has negatively impacted our channel business. 
And third, the effort to drive this conversion has adversely impacted our ability to acquire new footprint and new customers.
The net impact of these dynamics has resulted in insufficient pipeline to meet our bookings objectives. To drive pipeline expansion, we are taking 3 actions. First and foremost, we must accelerate the adoption of clustered ONTAP within our install base now that the feature inhibitors have been removed. This requires an investment in training and migration services. The objective is to unlock the tech refreshes that are waiting for clustered ONTAP upgrades.  
Some of these upgrades at our largest installations are complex and will be driven through direct engagement. But others are far simpler and can be facilitated by our channel partners. Therefore, our second action is to invest in the training and assistance necessary to build that confidence and competence in our broad partner base. 
And finally, to offset diversion in field focus in addressing these issues, we need to be actively engaged in acquiring new customers and new footprint through both direct and indirect channels. And we will continue to invest in our sales capacity to create additional bandwidth.
Overall, we remain confident in the value proposition of clustered ONTAP and our customers' commitment to the transition. Certainly, we see some customer consideration of alternative cloud-based models, but we do not see as much risk from on-premise alternatives. It is unlikely that customers will adopt competitive technologies that have fewer features and require even more complex migrations when compared to clustered ONTAP.  Therefore, we are confident that our investment in accelerating clustered ONTAP migrations will unlock business. Likewise, we need to broaden our reach to address more customers through sales capacity expansion, both direct and indirect, is an investment that we expect to yield positive results.
While our once in a generation re-architecting of ONTAP has created a complexity for our sales channels that we are addressing, the rest of the portfolio has shown excellent progress. Looking ahead to the next generation of IT, we see the cloud as the biggest transitional force in the industry. And for many use cases, it provides flexibility, economics and functionality that cannot be achieved with on-premise solutions.  We are focused on accelerating enterprise ability to realize the full potential of the cloud, while recognizing that they will deploy a hybrid model with both cloud-based and on-premises resources in their IT environments.
Our strategy for the hybrid cloud and our portfolio of solutions provides customers with the only consistent way to manage, secure and protect their data regardless of where they choose to storage it.  NetApp hybrid cloud solutions weave together disparate data elements into a single integrated architecture, giving customers control and choice with the flexibility, elasticity and ubiquity of cloud resources.  The customer feedback on our hybrid cloud strategy has been outstanding. It's viewed as relevant, compelling, differentiated and real. Even for customers who are not ready to go mainstream on the cloud components, the completeness of our storage and the enablement of their future direction are proving to be reasons to buy NetApp solutions today.
NetApp private storage for cloud gives customers the flexibility and economic benefits of multi-cloud solution without the risks and regulatory concerns associated with relinquishing data stewardship or the threat of cloud vendor lock .  During the fourth quarter, we further augmented our cloud solutions with new models of steel store as an Amazon machine image, giving customers an efficient and secure approach to backing up cloud-based workloads. Additionally, for customers who want a scalable, durable objects storage solution for long-term archives, we have delivered on a major new release of storage web scale with added support for industry-leading storage efficiency, support for Amazon S3 an integrated object storage  and introduced the StorageGRID 5660 appliance. We also released updates to On Command Cloud Manager and cloud ONTAP, giving customers new capabilities to speed business innovation and IT responsiveness.
We offer enterprise the choice for cloud providers and the ability to select based on cost, performance and service models. Our cloud solutions demonstrate our commitment to enable customers to fully realize the flexibility and economics of hyperscale clouds and to do so as a seamless extension of their on-premise environment.
Other new elements of our portfolio have shown excellent progress this past year. Almost half of our enterprise customers are buying multiple solutions from our portfolio, proving that we are much broader than just ONTAP. Unit shipments of branded E-Series inclusive of the all-flash EF family, grew by 45% from Q4 a year ago and more than doubled in fiscal year 2015.  E-Series augments our storage offerings with a high-performance flash array for environments that do not require the level of data management provided by clustered ONTAP. 
Additionally, On-Command Insight, in use at the largest companies in the world continues to exhibit strong growth with orders in the fourth quarter nearly doubling from a year ago. On-Command Insight allows IT organizations to monitor the heterogeneous storage infrastructure and optimize asset utilization, which is critical as they manage through constrained spending environments.
Much of the acceleration of the growth of these products in fiscal year 2015 resulted from bringing product specialists into a single organization focused on bringing new products to market. We recently added our hybrid cloud products to this organization, and they will continue to be one of the areas of increased investment.
We are excited by the increasing thought leadership of our cloud offerings and the sales momentum of the newer products, but that has been more than offset by the slowdown in the aggregate ONTAP business. New investments in traditional ONTAP deployments have been declining, with unit shipments down 30% in fiscal year 2015. But the storage of those customers have made the transition to clustered ONTAP is a cause for optimism. Clustered ONTAP delivers a software-defined flash-optimized cloud-enabled operating environment with a set of enterprise-wide data management capabilities independent of the hardware. Customers can grow incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options from conversion integrated systems to third-party arrays as well as software-only and cloud options.
We see a growing number of clustered ONTAP customers up 135% in fiscal year 2015 from the prior year. The bulk of this growth came from new-to-NetApp customers, which are up roughly 250% in fiscal year '15. The number of repeat clustered ONTAP customers was also robust, growing more than 140% in the year. Additionally, shipments of clustered nodes grew 138% from Q4 a year ago, and for the full year, they grew 163%. The attach rates of clustered ONTAP continues to increase with roughly 50% of controller shipped in the fourth quarter going to clustered environments. Once transitioned to clustered ONTAP, we see customer growth above current industry growth rates.
Clustered ONTAP is also a vehicle for our leadership in key emerging segments of the storage industry. In converged infrastructure, FlexPod had another good year with unit shipments up almost 20% this year. More than 70% of our FlexPod systems are shipped with clustered ONTAP. 
All-flash with clustered ONTAP is the only unified scale-out all-flash array in the market and gives customers the ability to deploy a high-performance node in a storage pool without having to make compromises.  The clustered ONTAP all-flash array demonstrates the ability to match the performance and efficiency claims on deploying product all-flash solutions, while uniquely delivering the scalability of clustering and the industry-leading data management of ONTAP.
Rather than creating yet another infrastructure, NetApp seamlessly integrates flash into our data management framework that not only extends the discs, but to the cloud as well. Shipments of all-flash FAS grew significantly at more than 350% from Q4 a year ago, and for the full year, they grew 260%. In the fourth quarter, 72% of all-flash FAS arrays shipped as clustered configurations.
Ultimately, we remain confident in the innovative value proposition that clustered ONTAP offers IT organizations as they build out their hybrid cloud environments. Customers and partners who have made the transition to clustered ONTAP are growing, and this underpins our confidence that now is the time to position investments towards our 3 priorities of accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP, regaining traction in the channel and increasing our sales capacity.
I'll now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on the fourth quarter and our expectations for the first quarter and fiscal year 2016. Nick?"

We are disappointed that our performance in the fourth quarter fell outside of our previous guidance ranges. As Tom discussed, we are experiencing not only a market transition, but the transition related to clustered ONTAP. We achieved our financial targets in the first half of fiscal year 2015. But in the second half, a combination of FX headwinds and weakness in our Americas commercial geography negatively impacted results.  
While we are confident in our strategy and technology, we need to retool aspects of our business to position NetApp for long-term growth and strong sustainable shareholder returns.  We expect that there will be disruption related to this transition and retooling during the first half of fiscal year 2016. But by the second half, we will return to a growth trajectory and to our business model. I will talk through this further after I review Q4 and fiscal year 2015 results.
Net revenues for Q4 were $1.54 billion, down about 1% sequentially, and down about 7% year-over-year.  Our results fell short of our previous guidance range due to the impact of continued weakness in our Americas commercial sales geography and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. FX headwinds reduced sequential growth in Q4 by about 2 points and year-over-year growth by about 3 points.
For fiscal year 2015, net revenues were $6.12 billion, down 3% from fiscal year 2014, reflecting about 1 point of foreign exchange headwind. Our revenues were on plan in the first half of the fiscal year, but lower-than-expected branded revenue negatively impacted the second half.
Branded revenue was 93% of net revenues in Q4, and at $1.44 billion was up 1% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year.  The year-over-year decline reflects 4 points of foreign exchange impact, with the remainder due to weakness in our Americas commercial geography.  OEM revenue of $102 million was down 18% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year, in line with expectations.
For the year, branded revenue was $5.6 billion, down 2% from fiscal year 2014 and flat when adjusted for FX, again reflecting weakness in our Americas commercial geography.  
OEM revenue was $473 million, down 19% from last year as expected. OEM revenue ended the year at less than 10% of fiscal year net revenues and has normalized to a level of revenue that we will no longer be discussing separately.  
Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs declined to 79% of Q4 net revenues compared to 81% in Q3 and 83% in Q4 last year.
From a geographic perspective, all geos performed as or better than expected in Q4 when adjusted for FX, with the exception of Americas commercial. Americas commercial revenue declined 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by the challenges Tom talked about associated with our clustered ONTAP transition and sales coverage.
Product revenue was $913 million in the fourth quarter, down 2% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Adjusted for FX, product revenue was down 8% year-over-year.
Over the course of fiscal year 2015 including in the fourth quarter, we saw an increase in the number of short-term support renewals. We believe these renewals, which show up on the balance sheet largely in short-term deferred revenue, are an indication that customers remain committed to NetApp, but are not yet ready to do a tech refresh and upgrade to clustered ONTAP.  The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues totaling $626 million in the fourth quarter was up 3% year-over-year or 5% adjusted for FX.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 62% was down 2.6 points from Q3 and below our prior guidance range. Product gross margin of 53.4% was down 5 points year-over-year due to FX headwinds, higher discounting and unfavorable product mix.  Software maintenance gross margin was down almost 1 point year-over-year, but flat to Q3. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 62.6% was relatively flat year-over-year, reflecting increased revenue, offset by infrastructure investment in people and projects.  For fiscal year 2015, gross margin of 64% was almost 1 point above fiscal year 2014 and at the high end of our previous guidance range.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 15.6%, below our previous guidance range due to lower revenue and gross margins. We held operating expense dollars flat from Q4 a year ago, aided in part by favorable foreign exchange. However, operating expenses rose as a percentage of revenue as we were not able to reduce costs in the business at the same pace as the revenue decline. Operating margin for the full year was down just over 1 point from fiscal year 2014 and 1 point below our previous guidance.
Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 was below our prior guidance range due to lower revenue and lower gross margin.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.5% for fiscal year 2015 and 16.7% for the fourth quarter, slightly higher than prior guidance reflecting normal course year-end true ups.
Q4 weighted average diluted share count of 313 million shares decreased by almost 4 million shares from Q3 due to repurchase activity in the quarter. Over the course of the year, we reduced weighted average fully diluted share count by 8% to 321 million shares.
Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed fiscal 2015 and with just over $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately 11% of which is onshore. Inventory turns decreased to 16 due to build-up of finished goods to support a higher anticipated level of demand than was recognized. Days sales outstanding increased to 46, reflecting typical seasonality. Deferred revenue was up $88 million in Q4 versus Q3 and up $97 million from Q4 last year.
Free cash flow of $359 million was about 23% of net revenue in the fourth quarter. Over the course of the year, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, marking the fifth consecutive year of strong performance. At approximately 18% of revenue, fiscal year 2015 free cash flow was within our previous guidance range.
Finally, we repurchased approximately $246 million of stock and paid $51 million in cash dividends during the quarter.  We completed the $3 billion share repurchase program we announced in May 2013 a year ahead of our original schedule. We also commenced purchasing stock related to the $2.5 billion share repurchase program we announced last quarter. As you may recall, our Board of Directors authorized $2.5 billion of repurchases by the end of May 2018, with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016.  We have enhanced our capital structure and, during the year, once again delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders since May 2013.
Today, we announced an increase of 9% to our next cash dividend to $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on July 23, 2015. We have now increased the dividend 20% since announcing the program in May 2013.  At current stock prices, the new dividend rate represents a yield of approximately 2%, which reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the underlying business and our ongoing commitment to drive shareholder value.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance.  We remain confident in our business over the long term. However, consistent with Tom's comment, we are in a period of transition and consequently expect some impact while we retool business for the future.  The disruption related to this transition will impact the first half of fiscal year 2016. But by the second half, we expect to return to growth trajectory, and to our business model.
Related to this transition, we are focused on balancing disciplined investments with profitability to drive our business priorities and ultimately generate value for shareholders. With respect to our expense structure, we are intent on returning to a level of operating expenses comments direct with our operating model. We are committed to looking for efficiency, taking costs out of our structure and directing resources and people to highest-return activities. We recently executed a set of decisions across our cost structure that will generate savings in fiscal year 2016, including a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 4%.
For fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to be no better than flat with FX headwinds and limited top line predictability in the first half and an overall recovery and revenue growth in the second half. So ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, we expect fiscal 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about 1 point from fiscal 2015 ultimately related to the clustered ONTAP transition.  We expect operating margin as a percentage of revenue to be down 1 to 2 points for the year, but to return to our 18% to 20% target operating margin range by the second half.  We expect a year of continued strong cash flow generation as well as deferred revenue growth. 
And finally, we expect to continue to repurchase our stock and based on the current prices, reduce share count by another 5%. This equates to a return of over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders again in fiscal 2016.
We expect our Q1 net revenues to range between $1.275 billion to $1.375 billion, which at the midpoint implies a sequential decline of approximately 14% and an 11% decrease year-over-year.  This is despite a 14-week quarter in Q1, an event that occurs every 6 years. 
As we begin the year, we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by FX as well as disruption related to the transition to clustered ONTAP and a onetime increase in lead times due to a factory move. We expect Q1 consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% and operating expense before the 14th week to be approximately flat to Q4.  That said, given the decline in revenues and gross margins and the increase of operating expenses, we expect Q1 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 6% to 7%. 
Based on our stock repurchases in Q4 and in the first 10 days of Q1, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 315 million shares and non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1 to range from approximately $0.20 to $0.25 per share.
In closing, NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers as they navigate the transformation of their IT deployments by providing a bridge from the choices of today to the requirements for the future. We are firmly convinced that the investments we are making today will position NetApp for long-term success and enable us to quickly return to our operate model. Finally, our capital allocation strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and inorganically in the business as well as continue to return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Tom for summary comments. Tom?"

Clustered ONTAP is the foundation of a data fabric vision, providing customers efficient and consistent data management that spans the hybrid cloud and unified isolated date of resources.
On-Command Insight, FlashRay and cloud ONTAP have drive value proposition outside of our installed base. Our flash solutions deliver industry-leading performance, coupled with enterprise software.  NetApp private storage for cloud, store and web scale offers customers a secure way to leverage the resources of the hyperscalers cloud providers.
We have 3 clear priorities for investments: accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP, regaining traction in the channel and increasing our sales capacity. Our strength of conviction in the benefits of those investments come from the fact that customers and partners that have moved to clustered ONTAP are growing. It is our imperative to transition more customers and partners to clustered ONTAP. We believe that these investments will drive long-term revenue growth, although that growth will be somewhat muted and will ramp time as we work through our transition and shift to the hybrid cloud. We expect the investments we are making today will be catalysts for growth and drive improvements in the second half of the year, putting us back on our operating model in the second half of fiscal year '16 and with momentum going into fiscal year '17.
Before closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their dedication and focus on execution as we work through this transition. At this point, we will open up the call for Q&A. As always, I ask that you be respectful of your peers on the call. [Operator Instructions] Operator?"

And we were ahead of our internal plan at the halfway point. it seems like things were -- things wer e picking up, and we felt on prior calls like this. We talked about where that optimism the second half. And we certainly knew that we're going to get easier compare is on the public sector, and we saw that come to fruition. And the other side is the breadth of the product portfolio. We had a lot of new products in the portfolio, whether it be E-Series StorageGRID or On-Command Insight, and. The other key thing was the release of 8.3 coming, 8.3 in clustered ONTAP. And it's my full intention that, that is going to be a big growth stimulant for us. In terms of featured gaps, relative to prior releases at 7-mode, in terms of customer inhibitors, those have been substantial as it's not in technical is from the Q1 on this 1 was high-availability for our most obligated workloads. And not only close if you just provide for that to be caught up to release to be. We've got a lot of compelling functionality that didn't exist at any -- in any of our old products or any of our competitors' products. Also in this was a set of tools to help the transition. We had -- around the 2000 family, we had efficiency capabilities to make clustered ONTAP a natural target for the 2000 as well. we have a lot of performance enhancements particularly around all-flash FAS and around things like quality of service. So from a technical perspective, I think the confidence is a very, very, very high that this is going to be the release that customers are going to go to. And certainly, new customer wins validated our confidence in the value proposition and this is the one that customers are going to migrate to. And all of that, everything that I previously said, remains unchanged. There's no evidence that customers are rejecting this technology or isn't meeting their expectation. That is not the story that we're getting. I mean, clearly the flaw here on our part is that we underestimated the complexity of these transitions, the planning associated with it and frankly, the dependence on us to help them through that. So I mean, at the end of the day, I think these are the most sophisticated customers. They were our largest customers. These are ones with higher availability and the process changes, the getting downtime windows, all of that is proving to be a lot more complicated, a lot more time-consuming than we originally anticipated. So simply put, that's on us. That's entirely our fault, and it is up to us to fix it. And the good news here is that there isn't a technical impediment. It isn't something that we wish we had or some technical invention that we need to have to complete the vision here. The product is what it is. It's exactly what we expected to be. It's exactly what we wanted it to be, and metered power through this and get the customers the transition."

So the gross margin for Q1 should be in the 63% to 63.5% range. That includes about 1 point of foreign exchange pressure in there. I think to get to the operating margin, you have to be -- have a couple things in mind. One is this 14-week quarter we have is the once a 6-year event type of thing. So if you build that in, we've actually taken the revenue down on a sequential basis much more substantially than we've done in prior Q4 to Q1 transition. So if I normalize out that 14th week, moving manufacturing that we're doing, I'm down about 15% sequentially versus my typical 10, right? take that down at that 63% to 63.5% gross margin, then you have to go through the operating expense side of the fence. In essence, our operating expenses for the first quarter will be flat to Q4 before the 14th week. If you add in the 14th week, that's an additional about $40 million of expense. So I'm trying to walk you through the pieces of math here. But suffice it to say that the gross margin percentage range should be about 63% to 63.5% including about 1 point, reflecting about 1 point of exposure. But you really have to think about the implications of the 14th week on operating expenses, which means operating expenses are going up by that. And then the implications of really what we're doing on the revenue side, which is saying yes, we get some 14th week benefit. However, we're taking a step down here to be reflective of the transition we're in."

Our mid-range machines are in the 70% range. And the lower end of machines really were, because of budget technical reasons, really aren't going to convert over to clustered ONTAP until 8.3, and that's happening now. So 50% of the models that are targeted for clustered ONTAP are well up in the 2/3 of 3 quarters. But another important metric and one that we track constantly, it's not only metric. The metric that's also important is what percentage of our installed base has converted over. So if customers are in the mode where the methodology by which they convert to clustered ONTAP typically involves buying equipment and then basically migrating the data over, so most big ONTAP transitions occur in conjunction with tech refreshes. So if the customers in the category of saying, ""Okay, 8.3 is the release I'm looking for. I'm beginning to start my planning process. But I'm not going to buy hardware today, and then move to it and then do another migration in the future. I'm going to do both of those at the same time."" And that's where the delay comes in. So we could ship 100% of the new systems out the door with clustered ONTAP on them. But if old machines aren't hour being upgraded, then those customers aren't buying these new systems. So that's the the key metric is what percentage of our customers are moving to clustered ONTAP now.  
Now question of well, is there something us to play here? If whatever reason was if they basically lost patience and they were going in the different direction, I think they would have gone there by now. Our issue at this particular point in time isn't that customers are waiting for the next 20 things to come along. Our issue is, ""Okay, this is the release. We've been waiting for these things. It's here now. How do we go about doing this process?"" And -- would they consider competitive product at this point in time? And the reason they've been delaying is because they've been waiting for new features to come along, they're not going to go to another part with even a more complicated migration it's actually missing even more features. So I think that the customers are at the stage for onboard. They're continuing to do service renewals. We certainly see that. And when we saw deferred revenue actually grow year-over-year, which are indication that people are buying the tech refreshes, which hurts us on the product side. But they are renewing and they are continuing to run this equipment. So it's not like they've made other decisions. And I think that as equipment gets older and an 8.3 meeting the needs, this a lot of tender business behind that and we need to power through it, and could maybe even more prepared for it? Absolutely. That's the lesson we learned today and that's the area, the constraint investment environment, that is the place that your investing our money and when the customers do this transition. The other thing we see in the data is that those customers have successfully transition to clustered ONTAP that are doing capacity expansion in software connect way to that or above the industry averages. So from our point of view is the healthiest thing we can do for the business is to gather as much of our installed base as possible on clustered ONTAP."

And a lot of our business is concentrated at the top. So clearly making our largest part is more successful has been a focus. And in fact, our largest partners actually had a pretty good year with us last year in terms of our reseller partners. I think the channel is also seeing the dynamics around clustered ONTAP. Those that are made the investment, some of our partners were the first to go. In fact, that was going to be a differentiator for them, and they were going to lead the way. And I think they've done a really good job in terms of getting the customers transitioned, being trained up and actually using the new accounts. Other partners who are back behind this, they're watching customers not necessarily upgrade. And that's impacting not only the NetApp business, but it's also impacting our lion share with them are on the other elements of the portfolio. as as I look at the business, clearly, we got to get the channel partners trade up, get them through that transition. And we also need to get them actively engaged with the rest of the portfolio both things that are ONTAP based like all-flash FAS as well as E-Series and On-Command Insight and the rest of it.  
But the other point that I also want to point out is that it's not only direct and indirect. When you look at our customers, we look at Storage 5000 and the global accounts. And for the first 3 quarters of this year, those are all growing. And it says that once we've got account intensity, even despite these other issues with clustered ONTAP we, were selling other areas of the fully particularly On-Command Insight, which had huge year in our accounts. So where we had account intensity, we can basically still drive growth despite the ONTAP slowdown, both it's taken a lot of resources to do it. The next generation of accounts have adopted the next 1,000 accounts. Beyond that, we have what we used to call the rest of the Storage 5000, beyond that, the midsize business. bottoms of category, which are primarily challenge driven, actually did reasonably well also. The category where we struggled with that next generation beyond the top global accounts. Those are primarily direct lead and maybe fulfilled intellect are not but there's a big NetApp presence in those accounts, and I think that's where the dilution of resources came in. As we a lot of time in our global accounts, they surely shored them up. But it's not really as on that next 1,000. And my simple observation as I watch the business is yes, there's kind of a tough macro backdrop. There aren't as many deals as they used to be. But when we're in this business and when we show up and when we compete, we're winning more than our fair share, so win rate is not our issue. We need to be in front of more accounts, and our next 1,000 is our area of focus. That's why when you talked about ONTAP transition, we talked of investment in the channel, so we need more sales capacity that be telling the storage to more people. And it's just as much conviction about that now as it was 90 days ago. And we're in a situation now when we're back to full . We're continuing content invest beyond that. But we also had to go through the training cycle to get people up to speed. And that's kind of we stay the players here. But there's no doubt that when we show up our people for our trade partners in front of people, that NetApp can close and NetApp can win."

Or are you kind of going under the assumption that the 1-year service renewals will convert to product sales at the end of the extensions? And then just directly related to that, understanding customers are unlikely to move to other on-prem solutions, is there any reason why we shouldn't anticipate that customers might use this transition to negotiate price? Because it sounds like the gross margins are going to go back to sort of the normalized levels. So I'm just curious why you wouldn't anticipate that in the transition like this?"

So from our point of view, what can be due to get them this initial cycle which is a lot of planning, letting them learn the tools that we have.

That's not going to be the dominant case and we're not going to be able to do that across the board.

But I think we talked about radical transition, the radical transition is the cloud. The cloud was the impact of any of those other technologies. And some of these companies, their incremental revenue year-over-year might be $50 million or $30 million or $100 million. And you look at the kind of money that thing invest in the cloud. And cloud is not just the hyperscalers. It's also things like Microsoft office 365 and Exchange and things like that, that are moving to the cloud. So the cloud transition is all the transition. Everything else is technology based. But NetApp is a technology company, and the areas that the invest in, we're confident in our ability to be that and take leadership position in those areas. So I don't minimize that technology. It's work. It's engineering. It's hard, but that's what we do. The cloud is clearly much the thing that's role in the industry at this point in time. There's no doubt about that. And our view on the cloud is rather than the cloud or declare it a fad or fight against it our position them as a competition, our view is to embrace the cloud, find a way to monetize it. And that's the rationale between the evolution of our product offerings. talked about NetApp private storage where the data remains on the network, but you have access to the flexible compute of Amazon and SoftLayer Microsoft. We've got cloud ONTAP, the ability to run ONTAP on the virtual system in the cloud and bye-bye that our. And the other day, the storage is that the cloud is going to be part of everybody's environment and will be everything. We're firm believer that everybody's going through some combination of on infrastructure, and our job is a company is to strength of data management is how do we make that data management experiencing this across all of those domains. So one set of tools, one set of processes, one set of backup, one set of application whether the date is on our equipment or not or whether it's on-premise or not. That's the value proposition that we're driving, and that's our definition of software-defined. in fact, that's the epitome of software-defined. It's not the point solution for certain workloads. It's not some thin veneer of software over some very dissimilar hardware. this is it's one set of tools across all of these use cases. So as far as cloud is concerned, that is the thing that systems are talking about. Everything else, I'm not going to minimize it. We can talk about each one individually, if you want, but the cloud is the big change. That's the one that's driving our strategy, and I've been doing a lot of these cloud pitches. I know some of you have seen the initial version of that at Insight, but it works, and we have a lot of momentum around it. Simply put, ONTAP on-premise is the stores stars and nut that we need to crack in the near term. The rest of it whether be new products, whether it be our cloud strategy, that's what we're looking for, and I'm extremely pleased how that's going."

It's actually growing and growing quite substantially every year. So that, that's a function of equipment not taking out the service plus. there are thousands of new systems that we put out there every day. What we are not seeing is a bunch of machines that mysteriously being operated and dropping out of our order reporting database. So these machines reporting back, which means that they are live. Customers are buying maintenance on them. So a lot of install base is continuing to grow. So there was this big competitive pressure that is taken out of those environment, we'd be effectively seeing that go away, and we're not. In terms of the broader competitive landscape, certainly, EMC and the other server vendors, there's usually one of them in every transaction that we do our every competitive situation that we're in. We're certainly see the start of that is sitting not underestimating but they're not ubiquitous like the other guys are. On the job of workloads, I think fallen off to a bunch of different categories, whether it be analytic workloads, whether it desktop worklaods, whether it be new apps workloads, web scale type things. I think we're seeing the cloud and application development and a lot of these new workloads, whether Hadoop is an on-premise solution or whether we see analytics in the cloud, whether it be some of the customer service, whether it be the mobile apps, this type of things. And I think those are very, very much a jump off. I think as far as the other vendors, I'd say certainly the hyper converts, we see them in those domains, flash is a little bit different. I think a lot of flash battlefield to some of the new workloads, particularly virtual desktop, but that's not big enough to support everybody's flash investment. The other place where we see flash is basically application acceleration and database, and generically high-performance SAN. So for NetApp, high-performance SAN is not been historically a strength of us. With clustered on second quarter want to compete effectively it's not an installed base -- it's not a NetApp install base that are fought over and the high-performance SAN market. So it's an opportunity that would clustered ONTAP and now with the all-flash brands, the latest release into that they have that are compelling comment something that we want to compete in more effectively. So I think it depends on the workload. I think the cloud is more relevant the next-gen workloads and start to see flash around BDI, but a lot of workloads particularly around database."

And at this point in time, I don't want to preclude our ability to do that.

So certainly, there's an opportunity to take more costs out of the infrastructure. I think to take more costs out of the infrastructure now, when we know what big bets that we think on the customer are realizing over the next 6 months, we start to see impact, then, I think we want to make bets now. But if they don't materialize quickly, we have to think what the long-term growth rate in this business is, what we think the long-term growth rate in this industry is and we have to look at our cost structure. So we're not wedded to a dollar figure on the cost structure at this point in time. We're going to be practical. At this point, we took out a certain amount of headcount. We took out well more than that and other infrastructure costs in the company to a couple hundred million dollars out.

I will then turn the call over to Nick to provide additional detail on the quarter and our expectations going into fiscal year 2016. Before we open the call for questions, I'll return to summarize the reasons for our continued confidence in the business.
As I've discussed on past calls, the IT industry is undergoing a radical shift as customers rebalance their IT investments to take advantage of the cloud. IT organizations will deploy a mix of on-premises and cloud-based resources, which have slowed the growth rate of the storage market. Every IT vendor is faced with this transition, and the successful ones will evolve their business to incorporate this new reality. We are well positioned for the era of cloud computing and with a robust portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions that enable customers to meet the current and growing demands of their business while adopting new technologies and delivery options.
NetApp itself is also undergoing a significant transition with the conversion of our customers to clustered Data ONTAP. On our last call, we talked about the execution challenges in our Americas Commercial business that materialized late in the third quarter. We also discussed the need to increase our go-to-market capacity. After a thorough analysis of these challenges, it is clear that we underestimated the disruption that the transition to clustered ONTAP has had on our direct and indirect pipeline. The disruption has been most acutely felt in our Americas Commercial geography due to the heavy concentration of large enterprise customers in the U.S.
Clustered ONTAP is a re-architected and modernized version of the ONTAP technology. It is our platform for the next decade of innovation. However, to fully realize the benefits of this technology, customers have to update existing storage management processes and migrate their data. While the value of clustered ONTAP is driving momentum with new customers and new workloads in existing customers, many of our largest installed base customers have been resisting to upgrade until [indiscernible] parity with the traditional version of ONTAP was achieved. This is even truly in cases where customers have standardized on clustered ONTAP for new workloads elsewhere in their environment.
The inhibitors to upgrade have now been mitigated with a generally available release of clustered ONTAP 8.3. Our largest customers now see a path to the advanced innovation and functionality of clustered ONTAP and are planning for migration.
Since most of the upgrades are currently in conjunction with hardware refreshes, we have seen delays in new hardware purchases until planning for process changes and downtime windows can be completed. This planning can be complex. And as a consequence, customers are deferring hardware refreshes and extending the life of existing gear. The financial impact to us is lower product sales and increased short-term service renewals.
The complexity and duration of clustered ONTAP transitions have implications on several dimensions. First, it reduces predictability on some of our largest accounts. We saw that in Q3, and it continued in Q4.
Second, our smaller accounts, which are often partner-led, are similarly facing this transition. While their installations tend to be less complex, we are often dependent upon our channel partners to guide them through the process. Those partners that have made an investment in clustered ONTAP training, typically our largest, have had a good year. However, others who are not as well-versed in selling clustered ONTAP have seen their customers defer upgrades, which has negatively impacted our channel business
And third, the effort to drive this conversion has adversely impacted our ability to acquire new footprints and new customers.
The net impact of these dynamics has resulted in insufficient pipeline to meet our bookings objectives. To drive pipeline expansion, we are taking concrete actions. First and foremost, we must accelerate the adoption of clustered ONTAP within our installed base now that the feature inhibitors have been removed. This requires an investment in training and migration services. The objective is to unlock the tech refreshes that are waiting for clustered ONTAP upgrades.
Some of these upgrades at our largest installations are complex and will be driven through direct engagement. But others are far simpler and can be facilitated by our channel partners. Therefore, our second action is to invest in the training and assistance necessary to build the confidence and competence in our broad partner base.
And finally, to offset the diversion of field focus in addressing these issues, we need to be actively engaged in acquiring new customers and new footprints, through both direct and indirect channels, and we will continue to invest in our sales capacity to create additional bandwidth.
Overall, we remain confident in the value proposition of clustered ONTAP and our customers' commitment to the transition. Certainly, we see some customer consideration of alternative cloud-based models, but we do not see as much risk from on-premise alternatives. It is unlikely that customers will adopt competitive technologies that have fewer features and require even more complex migrations when compared to clustered ONTAP. Therefore, we are confident that our investment in accelerating clustered ONTAP migrations will unlock business. Likewise, the need to broaden our reach to address more customers through sales capacity expansion, both direct and indirect, is an investment that we expect to yield positive results.
While our ""once in a generation"" re-architecting of ONTAP has created complexity for our sales channels that we are addressing, the rest of the portfolio has shown excellent progress. Looking ahead to the next generation of IT, we see the cloud as the biggest transitional force in the industry. And for many use cases, it provides flexibility, economics and functionality that cannot be achieved with on-premises solutions. We are focused on accelerating enterprise ability to realize the full potential of the cloud, while recognizing that they will deploy a hybrid model with both cloud-based and on-premises resources in their IT environments.
Our strategy for the hybrid cloud and our portfolio of solutions provides customers with the only consistent way to manage, secure and protect their data regardless of where they choose to store it. NetApp hybrid cloud solutions weave together disparate data elements into a single integrated architecture, giving customers control and choice with the flexibility, elasticity and ubiquity of cloud resources. The customer feedback on our hybrid cloud strategy has been outstanding. It's viewed as relevant, compelling, differentiated and real. Even for customers who are not ready to go mainstream on the cloud components, the completeness of our story and the enablement of their future direction are proving to be reasons to buy NetApp solutions today.
NetApp Private Storage for cloud gives customers the flexibility and economic benefits of a multi-cloud solution without the risks and regulatory concerns associated with relinquishing data stewardship or the threat of cloud vendor lock in. During the fourth quarter, we further augmented our cloud solutions with new models of steel store as an Amazon machine image, giving customers an efficient and secure approach to backing up cloud-based workloads.
Additionally, for customers who want a scalable, durable objects storage solution for long-term archives, we have delivered on a major new release of StorageGRID Webscale, which added support for industry-leading storage efficiency, support for Amazon S3 as an integrated object storage tier and introduced the StorageGRID 5660 appliance. We also released updates to OnCommand Cloud Manager and Cloud ONTAP, giving customers new capabilities to speed business innovation and IT responsiveness.
We offer enterprises the choice of cloud providers and the ability to select based on cost, performance and service levels. Our cloud solutions demonstrate our commitment to enable customers to fully realize the flexibility and economics of hyperscale clouds and to do so as a seamless extension of their on-premise environment.
Other new elements of our portfolio have shown excellent progress this past year. Almost half of our enterprise customers are buying multiple solutions from our portfolio, proving that we are much broader than just ONTAP. Unit shipments of Branded E-Series inclusive of the all-flash EF family, grew by 45% from Q4 a year ago and more than doubled in fiscal year 2015. E-Series augments our storage offerings with a high-performance SAN array for environments that do not require the level of data management provided by clustered ONTAP.
Additionally, OnCommand Insight, in use at the largest companies in the world, continues to exhibit strong growth with orders in the fourth quarter nearly doubling from a year ago. OnCommand Insight allows IT organizations to monitor their heterogeneous storage infrastructure and optimize asset utilization, which is critical as they manage through constrained spending environments.
Much of the acceleration of the growth of these products in fiscal year 2015 resulted from bringing product specialists into a single organization focused on bringing new products to market. We recently added our hybrid cloud products to this organization, and they will continue to be one of the areas of increased investment.
We are excited by the increasing thought leadership of our cloud offerings and the sales momentum of the newer products, but has been more than offset by the slowdown in the aggregate ONTAP business. New investments in traditional ONTAP deployments have been declining, with unit shipments down 30% in fiscal year 2015. But the story of those customers who have made the transition to clustered ONTAP is a cause for optimism. Clustered ONTAP delivers a software-defined, flash-optimized, cloud-enabled operating environment with a set of enterprise-wide data management capabilities independent of the underlying hardware. Customers can grow incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options from conversion integrated systems to third-party arrays as well as software-only and cloud options.
We see a growing number of clustered ONTAP customers up 135% in fiscal year 2015 from the prior year. The bulk of this growth came from new-to-NetApp customers, which are up roughly 250% in fiscal year '15. The number of repeat clustered ONTAP customers was also robust, growing more than 140% in the year. Additionally, shipments of clustered nodes grew 138% from Q4 a year ago, and for the full year, they grew 163%. The attach rate of clustered ONTAP continues to increase with roughly 50% of FAS controller shipped in the fourth quarter going into clustered environments. Once transitioned to clustered ONTAP, we see customer growth above current industry growth rates.
Clustered ONTAP is also a vehicle for our leadership in key emerging segments of the storage industry. In converged infrastructure, FlexPod had another good year with unit shipments up almost 20% this year. More than 70% of our FlexPod systems are shipped with clustered ONTAP.
All-flash FAS with clustered ONTAP is the only unified scale-out all-flash array in the market and gives customers the ability to deploy a high-performance node in their storage pool without having to make compromises. The clustered ONTAP base all-flash arrays had demonstrated the ability to match the performance and efficiency claims of deploying product all-flash solutions while uniquely delivering the scalability of clustering and the industry-leading data management of ONTAP.
Rather than creating yet another island of infrastructure, NetApp seamlessly integrates flash into our data management framework that not only extends to discs, but to the cloud as well. Shipments of all-flash FAS grew significantly at more than 350% from Q4 a year ago, and for the full year, they grew 260%. In the fourth quarter, 72% of all-flash FAS arrays shipped as clustered configurations.
Ultimately, we remain confident in the innovative value proposition that clustered ONTAP offers IT organizations as they build out their hybrid cloud environments. Customers and partners who have made the transition to clustered ONTAP are growing, and this underpins our confidence that now is the time to position investments towards our 3 priorities of accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP, regaining traction in the channel and increasing our sales capacity.
I'll now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on the fourth quarter and our expectations for the first quarter and fiscal year 2016. Nick?"

We are disappointed that our performance in the fourth quarter fell outside of our previous guidance ranges. As Tom discussed, we are experiencing not only a market transition, but a transition related to clustered ONTAP. We achieved our financial targets in the first half of fiscal year 2015. But in the second half, a combination of FX headwinds and weakness in our Americas Commercial geography negatively impacted results.
While we are confident in our strategy and technology, we need to retool aspects of our business to position NetApp for long-term growth and strong sustainable shareholder returns. We expect that there will be disruption related to this transition and retooling during the first half of fiscal year 2016, but that by the second half, we will return to a growth trajectory and to our business model. I will talk through this further after I review Q4 and fiscal year 2015 results.
Net revenues for Q4 were $1.54 billion, down about 1% sequentially, and down about 7% year-over-year. Our results fell short of our previous guidance range due to the impact of continued weakness in our Americas Commercial sales geography and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. FX headwinds reduced sequential growth in Q4 by about 2 points and year-over-year growth by about 3 points.
For fiscal year 2015, net revenues were $6.12 billion, down 3% from fiscal year 2014, reflecting about 1 point of foreign exchange headwind. Our revenues were on-plan in the first half of the fiscal year, but lower-than-expected branded revenue negatively impacted the second half.
Branded revenue was 93% of net revenues in Q4, and at $1.44 billion, was up 1% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects 4 points of foreign exchange impact, with the remainder due to weakness in our Americas Commercial geography.  OEM revenue of $102 million was down 18% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year, in line with expectations. For the year, branded revenue was $5.6 billion, down 2% from fiscal year 2014 and flat when adjusted for FX, again reflecting weakness in our Americas Commercial geography.
OEM revenue was $473 million, down 19% from last year as expected. OEM revenue ended the year at less than 10% of fiscal year net revenues and has normalized to a level of revenue that we will no longer be discussing separately.
Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs declined to 79% of Q4 net revenues compared to 81% in Q3 and 83% in Q4 last year.
From a geographic perspective, all geos performed as or better than expected in Q4 when adjusted for FX, with the exception of Americas Commercial. Americas Commercial revenue declined 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by the challenges Tom talked about associated with our clustered ONTAP transition and sales coverage.
Product revenue was $913 million in the fourth quarter, down 2% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Adjusted for FX, product revenue was down 8% year-over-year.
Over the course of fiscal year 2015 including in the fourth quarter, we saw an increase in the number of short-term support renewals. We believe these renewals, which show up on the balance sheet largely in short-term deferred revenue, are an indication that customers remain committed to NetApp, but are not yet ready to do a tech refresh and upgrade to clustered ONTAP. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues totaling $626 million in the fourth quarter was up 3% year-over-year or 5% adjusted for FX.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 62% was down 2.6 points from Q3 and below our prior guidance range. Product gross margin of 53.4% was down 5 points year-over-year due to FX headwinds, higher discounting and unfavorable product mix. Software maintenance gross margin was down almost 1 point year-over-year, but flat to Q3. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 62.6% was relatively flat year-over-year, reflecting increased revenue, offset by infrastructure investments in people and projects.  For fiscal year 2015, gross margin of 64% was almost 1 point above fiscal year 2014 and at the high end of our previous guidance range.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 15.6%, below our previous guidance range due to lower revenue and gross margins. We held operating expense dollars flat from Q4 a year ago, aided in part by favorable foreign exchange. However, operating expenses rose as a percentage of revenue as we were not able to reduce cost in the business at the same pace as the revenue decline. Operating margin for the full year was down just over 1 point from fiscal year 2014 and 1 point below our previous guidance.
Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 was below our prior guidance range due to lower revenue and lower gross margin.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.5% for fiscal year 2015 and 16.7% for the fourth quarter, slightly higher than prior guidance reflecting normal course year-end's true-ups.
Q4 weighted average diluted share count of 313 million shares decreased by almost 4 million shares from Q3 due to repurchase activity in the quarter. Over the course of the year, we reduced weighted average fully diluted share count by 8% to 321 million shares.
Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed fiscal 2015 with just over $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately 11% of which is onshore. Inventory turns decreased to 16 due to a build-up of finished goods to support a higher anticipated level of demand than was recognized. Days sales outstanding increased to 46, reflecting typical seasonality. Deferred revenue was up $88 million in Q4 versus Q3 and up $97 million from Q4 last year.
Free cash flow of $359 million was about 23% of net revenue in the fourth quarter. Over the course of the year, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, marking the fifth consecutive year of strong performance. At approximately 18% of revenue, fiscal year 2015 free cash flow was within our previous guidance range.
Finally, we repurchased approximately $246 million of stock and paid $51 million in cash dividends during the quarter. We completed the $3 billion share repurchase program we announced in May 2013 a year ahead of our original schedule. We also commenced purchasing stock related to the $2.5 billion share repurchase program we announced last quarter. As you may recall, our Board of Directors authorized $2.5 billion of repurchases by the end of May 2018, with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. We have enhanced our capital structure and, during the year, once again delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders since May 2013.
Today, we announced an increase of 9% to our next cash dividend to $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on July 23, 2015. We have now increased the dividend 20% since announcing the program in May 2013. At current stock prices, the new dividend rate represents a yield of approximately 2%, which reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the underlying business and our ongoing commitment to driving shareholder value.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance. We remain confident in our business over the long term. However, consistent with Tom's comments, we are in a period of transition and consequently expect some impact while we retool the business for the future. The disruption related to this transition will impact the first half of fiscal year 2016. But by the second half, we expect to return to a growth trajectory and to our business model.
Related to this transition, we are focused on balancing disciplined investments with profitability to drive our business priorities and ultimately generate value for shareholders. With respect to our expense structure, we are intent on returning to a level of operating expenses commensurate with our operating model. We are committed to looking for efficiency, taking cost out of our structure and to redirecting resources and people to highest-return activities. We recently executed a set of decisions across our cost structure that will generate savings in fiscal year 2016, including a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 4%.
For fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to be no better than flat, with FX headwinds and limited top line predictability in the first half and an overall recovery and revenue growth in the second half. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, we expect fiscal 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about 1 point from fiscal 2015 ultimately related to the clustered ONTAP transition 
we expect operating margin as a percentage of revenue to be down 1 to 2 points for the year, but to return to our 18% to 20% target operating margin range by the second half. We expect a year of continued strong cash flow generation as well as deferred revenue growth.
Finally, we expect to continue to repurchase our stock, and based on the current prices, reduce share count by another 5%. This equates to a return of over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders again in fiscal 2016.
We expect our Q1 net revenues to range between $1.275 billion and $1.375 billion, which at the midpoint implies a sequential decline of approximately 14% and an 11% decrease year-over-year. This is despite a 14-week quarter in Q1, an event that occurs every 6 years.
As we begin the year, we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by FX as well as disruption related to the transition to clustered ONTAP and a onetime increase in lead times due to a factory move. We expect Q1 consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% and operating expense before the 14th week to be approximately flat to Q4.  That said, given the decline in net revenues and gross margins and the increase of operating expenses, we expect Q1 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 6% to 7%.
Based on our stock repurchases in Q4 and in the first 10 days of Q1, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 315 million shares and non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1 to range from approximately $0.20 to $0.25 per share.
In closing, NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers as they navigate the transformation of their IT deployments by providing a bridge from the choices of today to their requirements for the future. We are firmly convinced that the investments we are making today will position NetApp for long-term success and enable us to quickly return to our operate model.
Finally, our capital allocation strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and inorganically in the business as well as continue to return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Tom for summary comments. Tom?"

NetApp is in the midst of 2 transitions: one faced by all IT vendors, the shift to the cloud; and one that is NetApp-specific, the transition from legacy ONTAP to clustered ONTAP. We are confident in our ability to navigate these transitions, but expect some amount of turbulence over the course of fiscal year 2016. Our disappointing top line growth in the second half of fiscal year 2015 has likely resulted in some market share loss, but we are confident in our ability to gain share going forward. Our best-of-breed solutions compete effectively against point products and are integrated into a broader vision for the hybrid cloud that only NetApp can deliver.
Our portfolio of data management solutions offers a differentiated approach that enables customers to solve today's problems with a technology set that provides the path to the future, improving their ability to navigate through the evolving IT landscape.
Clustered ONTAP is the foundation of a data fabric vision, providing customers efficient and consistent data management that spans the hybrid cloud and unifies isolated data resources.
OnCommand Insight, FlexArray and Cloud ONTAP help drive our value proposition outside of our installed base. Our flash solutions deliver industry-leading performance, coupled with enterprise hard and software. NetApp Private Storage for cloud, SteelStore and storageGRID Webscale offer customers a secure way to leverage the resources of the hyperscale cloud providers.
We have 3 clear priorities for investments: accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP, regaining traction in the channel and increasing our sales capacity. Our strength of conviction in the benefits of those investments come from the fact that customers and partners that have moved to clustered ONTAP are growing. It is our imperative to transition more customers and partners to clustered ONTAP. We believe that these investments will drive long-term revenue growth, although that growth will be somewhat muted and will ramp over time as we work through our transition and shift to the hybrid cloud. We expect the investments we are making today will be catalyst for growth and drive improvements in the second half of the year, putting us back on our operating model in the second half of fiscal year '16 and with momentum going into fiscal year '17.
Before closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their dedication and focus on execution as we work through this transition. At this point, we will open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator?"

And it seems like things were -- things were picking up, and we felt on prior calls like this. We talked about where the optimism in the second half, and we certainly knew that we're going to get easier compares on the U.S. public sector, we saw that come to fruition. And the other side is the breadth of the product portfolio. We had a lot of new products in the portfolio, whether it be E-Series or StorageGRID or OnCommand Insight and that. And the other key thing was we had the release of 8.3 coming, 8.3 in clustered ONTAP. And it was my full intention that, that was going to be a big growth stimulant for us. In terms of feature gaps relative to prior releases and 7-mode. In terms of customer inhibitors, those have been substantially closed, in fact, almost entirely closed. The really key one on this one was really around high-availability for our most complicated workloads. And not only closing features, I felt like we just caught up to where we used to be. We've got a lot of compelling functionality here that doesn't exist at any other -- in any of our old products or any of our competitors' products. Also built in this was a set of tools to help with the transition. We had -- around the 2000 family, we had efficiency capabilities to make clustered ONTAP the natural target for the 2000 as well. And we have a lot of performance enhancements, particularly around all-flash FAS and other things around quality of service. So from a technical perspective, I think the confidence was very, very, very high that this was going to be the release that customers are going to go to. And certainly, the new customer wins validated our confidence in the value proposition and this is the one that customers are going to migrate to. And all of that, everything that I previously said, remains unchanged. There's no evidence that customers are rejecting this technology or it isn't meeting their expectation. That is not the story that we're getting. I mean, clearly the flaw here on our part is that we underestimated the complexity of these transitions, the planning associated with it and frankly, the dependence on us to help them through that. So I mean, at the end of the day, I think these are the most sophisticated customers. These are our largest customers. These are ones that are running high availability and the process changes, the getting downtime -- downtime windows, all of that is proving to be a lot more complicated, a lot more time-consuming than we originally anticipated. So simply put, that's on us. That's entirely our fault, and it's up to us to fix it. And the good news here is that there isn't a technical impediment. It isn't some thing that we wish we had or some technical invention that we need to have to complete the vision here. The product is what it is. It's exactly what we expected it to be. It's exactly what we wanted it to be, and we need to power through this and get our customers to transition."

So the gross margin for Q1 should be in the 63% to 63.5% range. That includes about 1 point of foreign exchange pressure in there. I think to get to the operating margin, you have to be -- have a couple things in mind. One is the -- this 14th-week quarter we have is the once a 6-year event type of thing. So if you build that in, we've actually taken the revenue down on a sequential basis much more substantially than we've done in prior Q4 to Q1 transition. So if I normalize out that 14th week, move in manufacturing that we're doing, I'm down about 15% sequentially versus my typical 10%, right? You take that down at that 63% to 63.5% gross margin, then you have to go through the operating expense side of the fence. In essence, our operating expenses for the first quarter will be flat to Q4 before the 14th week. If you add in the 14th week, that's an additional about $40 million of expense. So I'm trying to walk you through the pieces of math here. But suffice it to say that the gross margin percentage range should be about 63% to 63.5%, including about 1 point -- reflecting about 1 point of FX pressure. But you really have to think about the implications of the 14th week on operating expenses, which means operating expenses are going up by that. And then the implications of really what we're doing on the revenue side, which is saying yes, we get some 14th, we benefit. However, we're taking a step down here to be reflective of the transition we're in."

Our largest machines are in the 80% range. Our mid-range machines are in the 70% range. And the low-end machines really were, because of a bunch of technical reasons, really weren't going to convert over to clustered ONTAP until 8.3, and that's happening now. So 50% of the models, but the models that are targeted for clustered ONTAP are well up in the 2/3 or 3/4. But -- and that's an important metric and one that we track constantly, it's not only metric. The metric that's also important is what percentage of our installed base has converted over. So if customers are in a mode where the methodology by which they convert to clustered ONTAP typically involves buying equipment and then basically migrating the data over. So most big ONTAP transitions occur in conjunction with tech refreshes. So if the customers are in the category of saying, ""Okay, 8.3 is the release I'm looking for. I'm beginning to start my planning process. But I'm not going to buy hardware today, and then move to it and then do another migration in the future. I'm going to do both of those at the same time."" And that's where the delay comes in. So we could ship 100% of the new systems out the door with clustered ONTAP on them. But if old machines aren't being upgraded, then those customers aren't buying those new systems. So that's really the key metric, is which -- what percentage of our big customers are moving to clustered ONTAP now. Now the question of, well, is there something else at play here? If one of the reasons was if they have -- if they basically have lost their patience where they would go in a different direction, I think they would have gone there by now. Our issue at this particular point in time isn't that customers are waiting for the next 20 things to come along. Our issue is, ""Okay, this is the release. We've been waiting for these things. It's here now. How do we go about doing this process?"" And would they consider competitive products at this point in time? The reason that they've been delaying is because they've been waiting for new features to come along, they're not going to go to another product with even a more complicated migration that's actually missing even more features. So I think that the customers that are at this stage are onboard, they're continuing to do service renewals. We certainly see that. I mean we saw deferred revenue actually grow year-over-year, which is an indication that people aren't buying the tech refreshes, which hurts us on the product side. But they are renewing and they are continuing to run this equipment. So it's not like they have made other decisions. And I think that as the equipment gets older and with 8.3 meeting their needs, there's a lot of pent-up business behind that and we need to power through it. And could we have been more prepared for it? Absolutely. That's the lesson we're learning here today. But that's the area, the constrained investment environment, that is the place that we are investing our money via customers through this transition. Because the other thing that we see in the data is that those customers that have successfully transitioned to clustered ONTAP, they are doing capacity expansion and software connect rates that are above the industry averages. So from our point of view is the healthiest thing we can do for our business is to gather as much of our installed base as possible to clustered ONTAP."

So",684,"Yes, I think certainly as we look at our channel base, we have a very, very, very large number of channel partners and a very, very long tail of active partners that aren't doing a lot of business. And a lot of our business is concentrated at the top. So clearly making our largest partners more successful has been a focus. And in fact, our largest partners actually had a pretty good year with us last year in terms of our reseller partners. I think the channel is also seeing the dynamics around clustered ONTAP. Those that have made the investment, some of our partners were the first to go. In fact, that was going to be a differentiator for them, and they will going to lead the way. And I think they've done a really good job in terms of getting their customers transitioned, being trained up and actually using that to sell to new accounts. Out of our partners who are back behind this, they're watching customers not necessarily upgrade. And that's impacting not only the NetApp business, but it's also impacting our mind share with them around the other elements of the portfolio. So as I look at the business, clearly, we got to get the channel partners trained up, get them through that transition. And we also need to get them actively engaged with the rest of the portfolio, both things that are ONTAP-based like all-flash FAS, as well as E-Series and OnCommand Insight and the rest of it. But one other point that I also point out is that it's not only direct and indirect. We look at our customers, we talked about Storage 5000 in the past. We have our largest accounts, our big global accounts. And for the first 3 quarters of this year, those were all growing. And it says that where we've got account intensity, even despite these other issues with clustered ONTAP we were solving, other elements of the portfolio, particularly OnCommand Insight, which had a huge year in our big accounts -- so where we had account intensity, we can basically still drive growth despite the ONTAP slowdown, both  taken a lot of resources to do it. The next generation of accounts who has adopted, the next 1,000 accounts. Beyond that, we have what we used to call the rest of the Storage 5000, beyond that, the midsize business. Those bottom 2 categories, which are primarily channel driven, actually did reasonably well also. The category where we struggled with that next generation beyond the top global accounts, those are primarily direct-led. They may be fulfilled indirect or not but there's a big NetApp presence in those accounts, and I think that's where the dilution of resources came in. And as we spend a lot of time on our global accounts, make sure we shore them up. But we've not been nearly as diligent on that next 1,000. And my simple observation as I watch the business is yes, there's kind of a tough macro backdrop. There aren't as many deals as they used to be. But when there's business and when we show up and when we compete, we're winning more than our fair share. So win rate is not our issue. We need to be in front of more accounts, and that next 1,000 is an area of focus. That's why we talked about clustered ONTAP transition, we talked about investment in the channel, but we just plain need more sales capacity to be telling this story to more people. And there's just as much conviction about that now as there was 90 days ago. And we're in a situation now where we're back to full strength. We continue to invest beyond that. But we also have to go through the training cycle and get people up to speed. And that's kind of where the state of players here. But there's no doubt that when we show up and we're in front of our people or our trained partners or in front of people, that NetApp can close and NetApp can win."

Some of these migrations -- and individual customers include hundreds, if not thousands of machines in dozens of countries. And so there's a planning cycle that they need to get through that they can start a migration. So they could be doing migrations through that entire estate over an extended period of time, and that's okay. Well, we can't be in a situation where they aren't starting that process because they're in the planning cycle, and we need to help them with that. So when we talk about investments in helping them through that, in some of those cases, we will be directly involved. And in some of those cases, where they are very, very strategic and there's a lot of business behind it, we're willing to do that at our own expense because it's in our best interest to do so and the customer's best interest to do so. But the goal is, on these really, really big accounts, once they get this thing rolling, you will have a process and it may take some time. But while they're in the planning cycle, at least to that use case and that workload that's on that equipment, they're not inclined to basically make big hardware purchases around equipment that they aren't going to use right away. So from our point of view, is what can we do to get them over this initial cycle, which is a lot of planning, letting them learn the tools that we have. And also in our case, perhaps putting our own professional services resources against this problem, and in some cases, perhaps even some -- giving them some gear. That's not going to be the dominant case, we're not going to be able to do that across the board. But for some of the big accounts that we need to get going, that are willing to make that commitment of we're willing to invest and help them, that is already underway and we're doing that now in some very, very large accounts."

And some of these small companies",575,"Well, I think a treatise on all those topics could take a long time. But I think we talked about radical transition, the radical transition is the cloud. And the cloud dwarfs the impact of any of those other technologies. And some of these small companies, their incremental revenue year-over-year might be $50 million or $30 million or $100 million. And you look at the kind of money that's being invested in the cloud. And the cloud is not just the hyperscalers. It's also things like Microsoft Office 365 and Exchange and things like that, that are moving to the cloud. So the cloud transition dwarfs all other transitions. Everything else is technology based. But NetApp is a technology company, and the areas that the invest in, we are confident in our ability to basically lead that technology and take leadership position in those areas. So I don't minimize the technology stuff. It's work, it's engineering, it's hard, but that's what we do. The cloud is clearly much the thing that's roiling the industry at this point in time. There's no doubt about that. And our view on the cloud is rather than either design the cloud or declare it a fad or fight against it our position them as the competition, our view is to embrace the cloud, find a way to monetize it. And that's the rationale between the evolution of our product offerings. We talked about NetApp Private Storage where the data remains on your network, but you have access to the flexible compute of Amazon and SoftLayer Microsoft. We've got cloud ONTAP, the ability to actually run ONTAP to the virtual machine in the cloud or virtual system in the cloud and buy it by the hour. And the other day, the story is, is that the cloud is going to be part of everybody's environment, it will be everything. We're firm believer that everybody has got some combination of own infrastructure and cloud infrastructure and our job as a company, since our strength is data management, is how do we make that data management experience seamless across all of those domains. So one set of tools, one set of processes, one set of backup, one set of replication, whether the data is on our equipment or not or whether it's on-premise or not. And that's the value proposition that we're driving, and that's our definition of software-defined. In fact, that's the epitome of software-defined. It's not a point solution for certain workloads. It's not some thin veneer of software over some very dissimilar hardware. This is one set of tools across all of these use cases. So as far as the cloud is concerned, that is the thing that customers are talking about. Everything else, I'm not going to minimize it. We can talk about each one individually if you want, but the cloud is the big change. That's the one that's driving our strategy, and I've been doing a lot of these cloud pitches. I know some of you have seen the initial version of that at Insight, but it works, and we have a lot of momentum around it. Simply put, ONTAP on-premise is the story and the nut that we need to crack in the near term. The rest of it, whether it be our new products, whether it be our cloud strategy, that is clearly working for us, and I'm extremely pleased with how that's going."

What w",465,"Well, the installed base is measured in units, is actually growing and growing quite substantially every year. So that -- and that's a function of equipment not taken out of service plus the thousands of new systems that we put out there every day. What we are not seeing is a bunch of machines that mysteriously are no longer being operated and dropping out of our order reporting database. So these machines are reporting back, which means that they are live. Customers are buying maintenance on them. So that installed base is continuing to grow. So if there was this big competitive pressure, which taken us out of all those environments, we'd effectively be seeing that go away, and we're not. In terms of the broader competitive landscape, certainly, EMC and the other server vendors, there's usually one of them in every transaction that we do or every competitive situation that we're in. We certainly see the start-up vendors, certainly not underestimating, but they are not ubiquitous like the other guys are. In terms of jump-off workloads, I think they fall into a bunch of different categories, whether it be analytic workloads, whether it be virtual desktop workloads, whether it be new apps workloads, webscale type of things. I think where we're seeing the cloud and application development is around a lot of these new workloads, whether Hadoop, is it on-premise solution or whether we see analytics in the cloud, whether it be some of the customer service, whether it be the mobile apps, those types of things. And I think that those are very, very much a jump off. I think as far as the other vendors, I'd say certainly the hyperconverged, we see them in those domains. Flash is a little bit different. I think a lot of flash battlefield is around some of the new workloads, particularly virtual desktop, but that's not big enough to support everybody's flash investment. The other place where we clearly see flash is basically application acceleration and database, and generically high-performance SAN. So for NetApp, high-performance SAN has not been a historical strength of ours. Certainly with clustered ONTAP we want to compete more aggressively there. But that's not the installed base -- it's not the NetApp installed base that's being fought over in the high-performance SAN market. So that's an opportunity that with clustered ONTAP and now with the all-flash FAS, the latest release in the performance benchmarks that we have that are compelling, it's something that we want to compete on more aggressively. So I think it depends on the workload. I think the cloud is more relevant, the next-gen workloads, and then we're starting to see flash around things like VDI, but a lot of it around accelerating traditional workloads particularly around database acceleration."

I think the lay of the land now based on kind of what we believe is achievable the rest of the year gets us back to our operating model in the second half. And the balance that we have clearly is we spent a lot of time on this portfolio. We know there are things that are under our control that if we could overpower it that we believe can unlock growth. And at this point in time, I don't want to preclude our ability to do that. So we're making the investments to go after that and go after that aggressively. If it turns out that the macro substantially deteriorates or our postulate is not correct, although we're pretty convinced that we're on the right track, or any other of number things come in the way and the business doesn't materialize, then clearly, our current operating hypothesis will be invalidated and we're going to have to do other things. So certainly, there's an opportunity to take more cost out of the infrastructure. I think to take more cost out of the infrastructure now, when we know what big bets that we think were on the cusp of realizing over the next 6 months, we start to see impact, then, I think we want to make those bets now. But if they don't materialize, then clearly, we need to rethink the -- what we think the long-term growth rate of this business is, what we think the long-term growth rate of this industry is and we have to look at our cost structure. So we're not wedded to a dollar figure on the cost structure at this point in time. We're going to be practical. At this point, we took out a certain amount of headcount. We took out well more than that, and other infrastructure costs in the company took a couple of hundred million dollars out. So we're prepared to do more if the situation warrants. But right now, I think we have a structure that enables us to still compete for this business. And if we're right in our hypothesis, then I think we win, and I think that we will be well-served [indiscernible] investments we're making right now."

I will then turn the call over to Nick to provide additional detail on the quarter and our expectations going into fiscal year 2016. Before we open the call for questions, I'll return to summarize the reasons for our continued confidence in the business.
As I've discussed on past calls, the IT industry is undergoing a radical shift as customers rebalance their IT investments to take advantage of the cloud. IT organizations will deploy a mix of on-premises and cloud-based resources, which have slowed the growth rate of the storage market. Every IT vendor is faced with this transition, and the successful ones will evolve their business to incorporate this new reality. We are well positioned for the era of cloud computing and with a robust portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions that enable customers to meet the current and growing demands of their business while adopting new technologies and delivery options.
NetApp itself is also undergoing a significant transition with the conversion of our customers to clustered Data ONTAP. On our last call, we talked about the execution challenges in our Americas Commercial business that materialized late in the third quarter. We also discussed the need to increase our go-to-market capacity. After a thorough analysis of these challenges, it is clear that we underestimated the disruption that the transition to clustered ONTAP has had on our direct and indirect pipeline. The disruption has been most acutely felt in our Americas Commercial geography due to the heavy concentration of large enterprise customers in the U.S.
Clustered ONTAP is a re-architected and modernized version of the ONTAP technology. It is our platform for the next decade of innovation. However, to fully realize the benefits of this technology, customers have to update existing storage management processes and migrate their data. While the value of clustered ONTAP is driving momentum with new customers and new workloads in existing customers, many of our largest installed base customers have been resistant to upgrade until feature parity with the traditional version of ONTAP was achieved. This is even true in cases where customers have standardized on clustered ONTAP for new workloads elsewhere in their environment.
The inhibitors to upgrade have now been mitigated with a generally available release of clustered ONTAP 8.3. Our largest customers now see a path to the advanced innovation and functionality of clustered ONTAP and are planning for migration.
Since most of the upgrades are currently in conjunction with hardware refreshes, we have seen delays in new hardware purchases until planning for process changes and downtime windows can be completed. This planning can be complex. And as a consequence, customers are deferring hardware refreshes and extending the life of existing gear. The financial impact to us is lower product sales and increased short-term service renewals.
The complexity and duration of clustered ONTAP transitions have implications on several dimensions. First, it reduces predictability on some of our largest accounts. We saw that in Q3, and it continued in Q4.
Second, our smaller accounts, which are often partner-led, are similarly facing this transition. While their installations tend to be less complex, we are often dependent upon our channel partners to guide them through the process. Those partners that have made an investment in clustered ONTAP training, typically our largest, have had a good year. However, others who are not as well-versed in selling clustered ONTAP have seen their customers defer upgrades, which has negatively impacted our channel business
And third, the effort to drive this conversion has adversely impacted our ability to acquire new footprints and new customers.
The net impact of these dynamics has resulted in insufficient pipeline to meet our bookings objectives. To drive pipeline expansion, we are taking concrete actions. First and foremost, we must accelerate the adoption of clustered ONTAP within our installed base now that the feature inhibitors have been removed. This requires an investment in training and migration services. The objective is to unlock the tech refreshes that are waiting for clustered ONTAP upgrades.
Some of these upgrades at our largest installations are complex and will be driven through direct engagement. But others are far simpler and can be facilitated by our channel partners. Therefore, our second action is to invest in the training and assistance necessary to build the confidence and competence in our broad partner base.
And finally, to offset the diversion of field focus in addressing these issues, we need to be actively engaged in acquiring new customers and new footprints, through both direct and indirect channels, and we will continue to invest in our sales capacity to create additional bandwidth.
Overall, we remain confident in the value proposition of clustered ONTAP and our customers' commitment to the transition. Certainly, we see some customer consideration of alternative cloud-based models, but we do not see as much risk from on-premise alternatives. It is unlikely that customers will adopt competitive technologies that have fewer features and require even more complex migrations when compared to clustered ONTAP. Therefore, we are confident that our investment in accelerating clustered ONTAP migrations will unlock business. Likewise, the need to broaden our reach to address more customers through sales capacity expansion, both direct and indirect, is an investment that we expect to yield positive results.
While our ""once in a generation"" re-architecting of ONTAP has created complexity for our sales channels that we are addressing, the rest of the portfolio has shown excellent progress. Looking ahead to the next generation of IT, we see the cloud as the biggest transitional force in the industry. And for many use cases, it provides flexibility, economics and functionality that cannot be achieved with on-premises solutions. We are focused on accelerating enterprise ability to realize the full potential of the cloud, while recognizing that they will deploy a hybrid model with both cloud-based and on-premises resources in their IT environments.
Our strategy for the hybrid cloud and our portfolio of solutions provides customers with the only consistent way to manage, secure and protect their data regardless of where they choose to store it. NetApp hybrid cloud solutions weave together disparate data elements into a single integrated architecture, giving customers control and choice with the flexibility, elasticity and ubiquity of cloud resources. The customer feedback on our hybrid cloud strategy has been outstanding. It's viewed as relevant, compelling, differentiated and real. Even for customers who are not ready to go mainstream on the cloud components, the completeness of our story and the enablement of their future direction are proving to be reasons to buy NetApp solutions today.
NetApp Private Storage for cloud gives customers the flexibility and economic benefits of a multi-cloud solution without the risk and regulatory concerns associated with relinquishing data stewardship or the threat of cloud vendor lock in. During the fourth quarter, we further augmented our cloud solutions with new models of SteelStore as an Amazon machine image, giving customers an efficient and secure approach to backing up cloud-based workloads.
Additionally, for customers who want a scalable, durable objects storage solution for long-term archives, we have delivered on a major new release of StorageGRID Webscale, which added support for industry-leading storage efficiency, support for Amazon S3 as an integrated object storage tier and introduced the StorageGRID 5660 appliance. We also released updates to OnCommand Cloud Manager and Cloud ONTAP, giving customers new capabilities to speed business innovation and IT responsiveness.
We offer enterprises the choice of cloud providers and the ability to select based on cost, performance and service levels. Our cloud solutions demonstrate our commitment to enable customers to fully realize the flexibility and economics of hyperscale clouds and to do so as a seamless extension of their on-premise environment.
Other new elements of our portfolio have shown excellent progress this past year. Almost half of our enterprise customers are buying multiple solutions from our portfolio, proving that we are much broader than just ONTAP. Unit shipments of Branded E-Series inclusive of the all-flash EF family, grew by 45% from Q4 a year ago and more than doubled in fiscal year 2015. E-Series augments our storage offerings with a high-performance SAN array for environments that do not require the level of data management provided by clustered ONTAP.
Additionally, OnCommand Insight, in use at the largest companies in the world, continues to exhibit strong growth with orders in the fourth quarter nearly doubling from a year ago. OnCommand Insight allows IT organizations to monitor their heterogeneous storage infrastructure and optimize asset utilization, which is critical as they manage through constrained spending environments.
Much of the acceleration of the growth of these products in fiscal year 2015 resulted from bringing product specialists into a single organization focused on bringing new products to market. We recently added our hybrid cloud products to this organization, and it will continue to be one of the areas of increased investment.
We are excited by the increasing thought leadership of our cloud offerings and the sales momentum of the newer products, but has been more than offset by the slowdown in the aggregate ONTAP business. New investments in traditional ONTAP deployments have been declining, with unit shipments down 30% in fiscal year 2015. But the story of those customers who have made the transition to clustered ONTAP is a cause for optimism. Clustered ONTAP delivers a software-defined, flash-optimized, cloud-enabled operating environment with a set of enterprise-wide data management capabilities independent of the underlying hardware. Customers can grow incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options from conversion integrated systems to third-party arrays as well as software-only and cloud options.
We see a growing number of clustered ONTAP customers, up 135% in fiscal year 2015 from the prior year. The bulk of this growth came from new-to-NetApp customers, which are up roughly 250% in fiscal year '15. The number of repeat clustered ONTAP customers was also robust, growing more than 140% in the year. Additionally, shipments of clustered nodes grew 138% from Q4 a year ago, and for the full year, they grew 163%. The attach rate of clustered ONTAP continues to increase with roughly 50% of FAS controller shipped in the fourth quarter going into clustered environments. Once transitioned to clustered ONTAP, we see customer growth above current industry growth rates.
Clustered ONTAP is also a vehicle for our leadership in key emerging segments of the storage industry. In converged infrastructure, FlexPod had another good year with unit shipments up almost 20% this year. More than 70% of our FlexPod systems are shipped with clustered ONTAP.
All-flash FAS with clustered ONTAP is the only unified scale-out all-flash array in the market and gives customers the ability to deploy a high-performance node in their storage pool without having to make compromises. The clustered ONTAP base all-flash arrays have demonstrated the ability to match the performance and efficiency claims of deploying product all-flash solutions while uniquely delivering the scalability of clustering and the industry-leading data management of ONTAP.
Rather than creating yet another island of infrastructure, NetApp seamlessly integrates flash into our data management framework that not only extends to discs, but to the cloud as well. Shipments of all-flash FAS grew significantly at more than 350% from Q4 a year ago, and for the full year, they grew 260%. In the fourth quarter, 72% of all-flash FAS arrays shipped as clustered configurations.
Ultimately, we remain confident in the innovative value proposition that clustered ONTAP offers IT organizations as they build out their hybrid cloud environments. Customers and partners who have made the transition to clustered ONTAP are growing, and this underpins our confidence that now is the time to position investments towards our 3 priorities of accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP, regaining traction in the channel and increasing our sales capacity.
I'll now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on the fourth quarter and our expectations for the first quarter and fiscal year 2016. Nick?"

We are disappointed that our performance in the fourth quarter fell outside of our previous guidance ranges. As Tom discussed, we are experiencing not only a market transition, but a transition related to clustere",1854,"Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. We are disappointed that our performance in the fourth quarter fell outside of our previous guidance ranges. As Tom discussed, we are experiencing not only a market transition, but a transition related to clustered ONTAP. We achieved our financial targets in the first half of fiscal year 2015. But in the second half, a combination of FX headwinds and weakness in our Americas Commercial geography negatively impacted results.
While we are confident in our strategy and technology, we need to retool aspects of our business to position NetApp for long-term growth and strong sustainable shareholder returns. We expect that there will be disruption related to this transition and retooling during the first half of fiscal year 2016, but that by the second half, we will return to a growth trajectory and to our business model. I will talk through this further after I review Q4 and fiscal year 2015 results.
Net revenues for Q4 were $1.54 billion, down about 1% sequentially, and down about 7% year-over-year. Our results fell short of our previous guidance range due to the impact of continued weakness in our Americas Commercial sales geography and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. FX headwinds reduced sequential growth in Q4 by about 2 points and year-over-year growth by about 3 points.
For fiscal year 2015, net revenues were $6.12 billion, down 3% from fiscal year 2014, reflecting about 1 point of foreign exchange headwind. Our revenues were on-plan in the first half of the fiscal year, but lower-than-expected branded revenue negatively impacted the second half.
Branded revenue was 93% of net revenues in Q4, and at $1.44 billion, was up 1% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects 4 points of foreign exchange impact, with the remainder due to weakness in our Americas Commercial geography. OEM revenue of $102 million was down 18% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year, in line with expectations. For the year, branded revenue was $5.6 billion, down 2% from fiscal year 2014 and flat when adjusted for FX, again reflecting weakness in our Americas Commercial geography.
OEM revenue was $473 million, down 19% from last year as expected. OEM revenue ended the year at less than 10% of fiscal year net revenues and has normalized to a level of revenue that we will no longer be discussing separately.
Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs declined to 79% of Q4 net revenues compared to 81% in Q3 and 83% in Q4 last year.
From a geographic perspective, all geos performed as or better than expected in Q4 when adjusted for FX, with the exception of Americas Commercial. Americas Commercial revenue declined 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by the challenges Tom talked about associated with our clustered ONTAP transition and sales coverage.
Product revenue was $913 million in the fourth quarter, down 2% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Adjusted for FX, product revenue was down 8% year-over-year.
Over the course of fiscal year 2015, including in the fourth quarter, we saw an increase in the number of short-term support renewals. We believe these renewals, which show up on the balance sheet largely in short-term deferred revenue, are an indication that customers remain committed to NetApp, but are not yet ready to do a tech refresh and upgrade to clustered ONTAP. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues totaling $626 million in the fourth quarter was up 3% year-over-year or 5% adjusted for FX.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 62% was down 2.6 points from Q3 and below our prior guidance range. Product gross margin of 53.4% was down 5 points year-over-year due to FX headwinds, higher discounting and unfavorable product mix. Software maintenance gross margin was down almost 1 point year-over-year, but flat to Q3. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 62.6% was relatively flat year-over-year, reflecting increased revenue, offset by infrastructure investments in people and projects. For fiscal year 2015, gross margin of 64% was almost 1 point above fiscal year 2014 and at the high end of our previous guidance range.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 15.6%, below our previous guidance range due to lower revenue and gross margins. We held operating expense dollars flat from Q4 a year ago, aided in part by favorable foreign exchange. However, operating expenses rose as a percentage of revenue as we were not able to reduce cost in the business at the same pace as the revenue decline. Operating margin for the full year was down just over 1 point from fiscal year 2014 and 1 point below our previous guidance.
Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 was below our prior guidance range due to lower revenue and lower gross margin.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.5% for fiscal year 2015 and 16.7% for the fourth quarter, slightly higher than prior guidance reflecting normal course year-end's true-ups.
Q4 weighted average diluted share count of 313 million shares decreased by almost 4 million shares from Q3 due to repurchase activity in the quarter. Over the course of the year, we reduced weighted average fully diluted share count by 8% to 321 million shares.
Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed fiscal 2015 with just over $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately 11% of which is onshore. Inventory turns decreased to 16 due to a build-up of finished goods to support a higher anticipated level of demand than was recognized. Days sales outstanding increased to 46, reflecting typical seasonality. Deferred revenue was up $88 million in Q4 versus Q3 and up $97 million from Q4 last year.
Free cash flow of $359 million was about 23% of net revenue in the fourth quarter. Over the course of the year, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, marking the fifth consecutive year of strong performance. At approximately 18% of revenue, fiscal year 2015 free cash flow was within our previous guidance range.
Finally, we repurchased approximately $246 million of stock and paid $51 million in cash dividends during the quarter. We completed the $3 billion share repurchase program we announced in May 2013 a year ahead of our original schedule. We also commenced purchasing stock related to the $2.5 billion share repurchase program we announced last quarter. As you may recall, our Board of Directors authorized $2.5 billion of repurchases by the end of May 2018, with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. We have enhanced our capital structure and, during the year, once again delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders since May 2013.
Today, we announced an increase of 9% to our next cash dividend to $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on July 23, 2015. We have now increased the dividend 20% since announcing the program in May 2013. At current stock prices, the new dividend rate represents a yield of approximately 2%, which reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the underlying business and our ongoing commitment to driving shareholder value.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance. We remain confident in our business over the long term. However, consistent with Tom's comments, we are in a period of transition and consequently expect some impact while we retool the business for the future. The disruption related to this transition will impact the first half of fiscal year 2016. But by the second half, we expect to return to a growth trajectory and to our business model.
Related to this transition, we are focused on balancing disciplined investments with profitability to drive our business priorities and ultimately generate value for shareholders. With respect to our expense structure, we are intent on returning to a level of operating expenses commensurate with our operating model. We are committed to looking for efficiency, taking cost out of our structure and to redirecting resources and people to highest-return activities. We recently executed a set of decisions across our cost structure that will generate savings in fiscal year 2016, including a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 4%.
For fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to be no better than flat, with FX headwinds and limited top line predictability in the first half and an overall recovery and revenue growth in the second half. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, we expect fiscal 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about 1 point from fiscal 2015 ultimately related to the clustered ONTAP transition.
We expect operating margin as a percentage of revenue to be down 1 to 2 points for the year, but to return to our 18% to 20% target operating margin range by the second half. We expect a year of continued strong cash flow generation as well as deferred revenue growth.
Finally, we expect to continue to repurchase our stock, and based on the current prices, reduce share count by another 5%. This equates to a return of over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders again in fiscal 2016.
We expect our Q1 net revenues to range between $1.275 billion and $1.375 billion, which at the midpoint implies a sequential decline of approximately 14% and an 11% decrease year-over-year. This is despite a 14-week quarter in Q1, an event that occurs every 6 years.
As we begin the year, we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by FX as well as disruption related to the transition to clustered ONTAP and a onetime increase in lead times due to a factory move. We expect Q1 consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% and operating expense before the 14th week to be approximately flat to Q4. That said, given the decline in net revenues and gross margins and the increase of operating expenses, we expect Q1 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 6% to 7%.
Based on our stock repurchases in Q4 and in the first 10 days of Q1, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 315 million shares and non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1 to range from approximately $0.20 to $0.25 per share.
In closing, NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers as they navigate the transformation of their IT deployments by providing a bridge from the choices of today to their requirements for the future. We are firmly convinced that the investments we are making today will position NetApp for long-term success and enable us to quickly return to our operating model.
Finally, our capital allocation strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and inorganically in the business as well as continue to return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Tom for summary comments. Tom?"

NetApp is in the midst of 2 transitions: one faced by all IT vendors, the shift to the cloud; and one that is NetApp-specific, the transition from legacy ONTAP to clustered ONTAP. We are confident in our ability to navigate these transitions, but expect some amount of turbulence over the course of fiscal year 2016. Our disappointing top line growth in the second half of fiscal year 2015 has likely resulted in some market share loss, but we are confident in our ability to gain share going forward. Our best-of-breed solutions compete effectively against point products and are integrated into a broader vision for the hybrid cloud that only NetApp can deliver.
Our portfolio of data management solutions offers a differentiated approach that enables customers to solve today's problems with a technology set that provides a path to the future, improving their ability to navigate through the evolving IT landscape.
Clustered ONTAP is the foundation of a data fabric vision, providing customers efficient and consistent data management that spans the hybrid cloud and unifies isolated data resources.
OnCommand Insight, FlexArray and Cloud ONTAP help drive our value proposition outside of our installed base. Our flash solutions deliver industry-leading performance, coupled with enterprise hard and software. NetApp Private Storage for cloud, SteelStore and storageGRID Webscale offer customers a secure way to leverage the resources of the hyperscale cloud providers.
We have 3 clear priorities for investments: accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP, regaining traction in the channel and increasing our sales capacity. Our strength of conviction in the benefits of those investments comes from the fact that customers and partners that have moved to clustered ONTAP are growing. It is our imperative to transition more customers and partners to clustered ONTAP. We believe that these investments will drive long-term revenue growth, although that growth will be somewhat muted and will ramp over time as we work through our transition and shift to the hybrid cloud. We expect the investments we are making today will be catalysts for growth and drive improvements in the second half of the year, putting us back on our operating model in the second half of fiscal year '16 and with momentum going into fiscal year '17.
Before closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their dedication and focus on execution as we work through this transition. 
At this point, we will open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator?"

And it seemed like things were -- thin",576,"Yes, I think -- first of all, on clustered ONTAP, that is -- as we went into the year and even as the year progressed is, we got off to a pretty good start and we were ahead of our internal plan at the halfway point. And it seemed like things were -- things were picking up, and we felt on prior calls like this. We talked about where the optimism in the second half, and we certainly knew that we're going to get easier compares on the U.S. public sector, we saw that come to fruition. And the other side is the breadth of the product portfolio. We had a lot of new products in the portfolio, whether it be E-Series or StorageGRID or OnCommand Insight and that. And the other key thing was we had the release of 8.3 coming, 8.3 of clustered ONTAP. And it was my full intention that, that was going to be a big growth stimulant for us. In terms of feature gaps relative to prior releases and 7-mode. In terms of customer inhibitors, those have been substantially closed, in fact, almost entirely closed. The really key one on this one was really around high-availability for our most complicated workloads. And not only closing features, so it's not like we just caught up to where we used to be. We've got a lot of compelling functionality here that doesn't exist at any other -- in any of our old products or any of our competitors' products. Also built in this was a set of tools to help with the transition. We had -- around the 2000 family, we had efficiency capabilities to make clustered ONTAP the natural target for the 2000 as well. And we had a lot of performance enhancements, particularly around all-flash FAS and other things around quality of service. So from a technical perspective, I think the confidence was very, very, very high that this was going to be the release that customers were going to go to. And certainly, the new customer wins validated our confidence in the value proposition and this was the one that customers were going to migrate to. And all of that, everything that I previously said, remains unchanged. There's no evidence that customers are rejecting this technology or it isn't meeting their expectation. That is not the story that we're getting. I mean, clearly the flaw here on our part is that we underestimated the complexity of these transitions, the planning associated with it and frankly, the dependence on us to help them through that. So I mean, at the end of the day, I think these are the most sophisticated customers. These are our largest customers. These are ones that are running high availability and the process changes, the getting downtime -- downtime windows, all of that is proving to be a lot more complicated, a lot more time-consuming than we originally anticipated. So simply put, that's on us. That's entirely our fault, and it's up to us to fix it. And the good news here is that there isn't a technical impediment. It isn't something that we wish we had or some technical invention that we need to have to complete the vision here. The product is what it is. It's exactly what we expected it to be. It's exactly what we wanted it to be, and we need to power through this and get our customers to transition."

So the gross margin for Q1 should be in the 63% to 63.5% range. That includes about 1 point of foreign exchange pressure in there. I think to get to the operating margin, you have to be -- have a couple things in mind. One is the -- this 14th-week quarter we have -- this is a once in a 6-year event type of thing. So if you build that in, we've actually taken the revenue down on a sequential basis much more substantially than we've done in prior Q4 to Q1 transition. So if I normalize out that 14th week, move in manufacturing that we're doing, I'm down about 15% sequentially versus my typical 10%, right? You take that down at that 63% to 63.5% gross margin, then you have to go through the operating expense side of the fence. In essence, our operating expenses for the first quarter will be flat to Q4 before the 14th week. If you add in the 14th week, that's an additional about $40 million of expense. So I'm trying to walk you through the pieces of math here. But suffice it to say that the gross margin percentage range should be about 63% to 63.5%, including about 1 point -- reflecting about 1 point of FX pressure. But you really have to think about the implications of the 14th week on operating expenses, which means operating expenses are going up by that. And then the implications of really what we're doing on the revenue side, which is saying yes, we get some 14th week benefit. However, we're taking a step down here to be reflective of the transition we're in."

Our largest machines are in the 80% range. Our mid-range machines are in the 70% range. And the low-end machines really weren't -- because of a bunch of technical reasons, really weren't going to convert over to clustered ONTAP until 8.3, and that's happening now. So 50% of the models, but the models that are targeted for clustered ONTAP are well up in the 2/3 to 3/4. But -- and that's an important metric and one that we track constantly, it's not only metric. The metric that's also important is what percentage of our installed base has converted over. So if customers are in a mode where the methodology by which they convert to clustered ONTAP typically involves buying new equipment and then basically migrating the data over. So most big ONTAP transitions occur in conjunction with tech refreshes. So if the customer is in the category of saying, ""Okay, 8.3 is the release I'm looking for. I'm beginning to start my planning process. But I'm not going to buy hardware today, and then move to it and then do another migration in the future. I'm going to do both of those at the same time."" And that's where the delay comes in. So we could ship 100% of the new systems out the door with clustered ONTAP on them. But if old machines aren't being upgraded, then those customers aren't buying those new systems. So that's really the key metric, is which -- what percentage of our big customers are moving to clustered ONTAP now. Now the question of, well, is there something else at play here? If one of the reasons was if they have -- if they basically have lost their patience or they want to go in a different direction, I think they would have gone there by now. Our issue at this particular point in time isn't that customers are waiting for the next 20 things to come along. Our issue is, ""Okay, this is the release. We've been waiting for these things. It's here now. How do we go about doing this process?"" And would they consider competitive products at this point in time? If the reason that they've been delaying is because they've been waiting for new features to come along, they're not going to go to another product with even a more complicated migration that's actually missing even more features. So I think that the customers that are at this stage are onboard, they're continuing to do service renewals. We certainly see that. I mean we saw deferred revenue actually grow year-over-year, which is an indication that people aren't buying the tech refreshes, which hurts us on the product side. But they are renewing and they are continuing to run this equipment. So it's not like they've made other decisions. And I think that as the equipment gets older and with 8.3 meeting their needs, there's a lot of pent-up business behind that and we need to power through it. And could we have been more prepared for it? Absolutely. That's the lesson we're learning here today. But that's the area, and the constrained investment environment, that is the place that we are investing our money via customers through this transition. Because the other thing that we see in the data is that those customers that have successfully transitioned to clustered ONTAP, they are doing capacity expansion and software connect rates that are above the industry averages. So from our point of view is the healthiest thing we can do for our business is to gather as much of our installed base as possible to clustered ONTAP."

And a lot of our business is concentrated at the top. So",688,"Yes, I think certainly as we look at our channel base, we have a very, very, very large number of channel partners and a very, very long tail of active partners that aren't doing a lot of business. And a lot of our business is concentrated at the top. So clearly making our largest partners more successful has been a focus. And in fact, our largest partners actually had a pretty good year with us last year in terms of our reseller partners. I think the channel is also seeing the dynamics around clustered ONTAP. Those that have made the investment, some of our partners were the first to go. In fact, that was going to be a differentiator for them, and they will going to lead the way. And I think they've done a really good job in terms of getting their customers transitioned, being trained up and actually using this to sell to new accounts. Other of our partners who are back behind this, they're watching customers not necessarily upgrade. And that's impacting not only the NetApp business, but it's also impacting our mind share with them around the other elements of the portfolio. So as I look at the business, clearly, we got to get the channel partners trained up, get them through that transition. And we also need to get them actively engaged with the rest of the portfolio, both things that are ONTAP-based like all-flash FAS, as well as E-Series and OnCommand Insight and the rest of it. But one other point that I also point out is that it's not only direct and indirect. We look at our customers, we talked about Storage 5000 in the past. We have our largest accounts, our big global accounts. And for the first 3 quarters of this year, those were all growing. And it says that where we've got account intensity, even despite these other issues with clustered ONTAP we were solving other elements of the portfolio, particularly OnCommand Insight, which had a huge year in our big accounts -- so where we had account intensity, we can basically still drive growth despite the ONTAP slowdown, both taken a lot of resources to do it. The next generation of accounts who will adopt it, the next 1,000 accounts. Beyond that, we have what we used to call the rest of the Storage 5000, beyond that, the midsize business. Those bottom 2 categories, which are primarily channel driven, actually did reasonably well also. The category where we struggled was that next generation beyond the top global accounts, those are primarily direct-led. They may be fulfilled indirect or not but there's a big NetApp presence in those accounts, and I think that's where the dilution of resources came in. And as we said, we spent a lot of time on our global accounts, make sure we shored them up. But we've not been nearly as diligent on that next 1,000. And my simple observation as I watch the business is yes, there's kind of a tough macro backdrop. There aren't as many deals as they used to be. But when there's business and when we show up and when we compete, we're winning more than our fair share. So win rate is not our issue. We need to be in front of more accounts, and that next 1,000 is an area of focus. That's why we talked about clustered ONTAP transition, we talked about investment in the channel, but we just plain need more sales capacity to be telling this story to more people. And there's just as much conviction about that now as there was 90 days ago. And we're in a situation now where we're back to full strength. We're continuing to invest beyond that. But we also have to go through the training cycle and get people up to speed. And that's kind of where the state of play is here. But there's no doubt that when we show up and we're in front of our people or our trained partners or in front of people, that NetApp can close and NetApp can win."

Are customers indicating they have migration plans? Or is this -- how long does a typical migration take? Is this purely a function of having enough people to do the migration? Or are you kind of going under the assumption that the 1-year service renewals will convert to product sales at the end of the extensions? And then just directly related to that, understanding customers are unlikely to move to other on-prem solutions, is there any reason why we shouldn't anticipate that customers might use this transition to negotiate price? Because it sounds like the gross margins are going to go back to sort of the normalized levels. So I'm just curious why you wouldn't anticipate that in a transition like this?"

Some of these migrations -- and individual customers include hundreds, if not thousands of machines in dozens of countries. And so there's a planning cycle that they need to get through that they can start a migration. So they can be doing migrations through that entire estate over an extended period of time, and that's okay. Well, we can't be in a situation where they aren't starting that process because they're in the planning cycle, and we need to help them with that. So when we talk about investments in helping them through that, in some of those cases, we will be directly involved. And in some of those cases, where they are very, very strategic and there's a lot of business behind it, we're willing to do that at our own expense because it's in our best interest to do so and the customer's best interest to do so. But the goal is, on these really, really big accounts, once they get this thing rolling, it will have a process and it may take some time. But while they're in the planning cycle, at least for that use case and that workload that's on that equipment, they're not inclined to basically make big hardware purchases around equipment that they aren't going to use right away. So from our point of view, is what can we do to get them over this initial cycle, which is a lot of planning, letting them learn the tools that we have. And also in our case, perhaps putting our own professional services resources against this problem, and in some cases, perhaps even some -- giving them some gear. That's not going to be the dominant case, we're not going to be able to do that across the board. But for some of the big accounts that we need to get going, that are willing to make that commitment of we're willing to invest and help them, that is already underway and we're doing that now in some very, very large accounts."

And the cloud dwarfs the impact of any of those other technologies. And some of these small companies, their incremental revenue year-over-year might be $50 million or $30 million or $100 million. And you look at the kind of money that's being invested in the cloud. And the cloud is not just the hyperscalers. It's also things like Microsoft Office 365 and Exchange and things like that, that are moving to the cloud. So the cloud transition dwarfs all other transitions. Everything else is technology based. The NetApp is a technology company, and the areas that we invest in, we are confident in our ability to basically lead that technology and take leadership positions in those areas. So I don't minimize the technology stuff. It's work, it's engineering, it's hard, but that's what we do. The cloud is clearly the much -- the thing that's roiling the industry at this point in time. There's no doubt about that. And our view on the cloud is rather than either deny the cloud or declare it a fad or fight against it or position them as the competition, our view is to embrace the cloud, find a way to monetize it. And that's the rationale between the evolution of our product offerings. We talked about NetApp Private Storage where the data remains on your network, but you have access to the flexible compute of Amazon and SoftLayer and Microsoft. We've got cloud ONTAP, the ability to actually run ONTAP, build a virtual machine in the cloud, a virtual system in the cloud and buy it by the hour. And at the end of the day, the story is, is that the cloud is going to be part of everybody's environment, it won't be everything. We're a firm believer that everybody has got some combination of owned infrastructure and cloud infrastructure and our job as a company, since our strength is data management, is how do we make that data management experience seamless across all of those domains. So one set of tools, one set of processes, one set of backup, one set of replication, whether the data is on our equipment or not or whether it's on-premise or not. And that's the value proposition that we're driving, and that's our definition of software-defined. In fact, that's the epitome of software-defined. It's not a point solution for certain workloads. It's not some thin veneer of software over some very dissimilar hardware. This is one set of tools across all of these use cases. So as far as the cloud is concerned, that is the thing that customers are talking about. Everything else, I'm not going to minimize it. We can talk about each one individually if you want, but the cloud is the big change. That's the one that's driving our strategy, and I've been doing a lot of these cloud pitches. I know some of you have seen the initial version of that at Insight, but it works, and we have a lot of momentum around it. Simply put, ONTAP on-premise is the story and the nut that we need to crack in the near term. The rest of it, whether it be our new products, whether it be our cloud strategy, that is clearly working for us, and I'm extremely pleased with how that's going."

So that -- and that's a function of equipment not taken out of service plus the thousands of new systems that we put out there every day. What we are not seeing is a bunch of machines that mysteriously are no longer being operated and dropping out of our order reporting database. So these machines are reporting back, which means that they are live. Customers are buying maintenance on them. So that installed base is continuing to grow. So if there was this big competitive push that was taking us out of all those environments, we'd effectively be seeing that go away, and we're not. In terms of the broader competitive landscape, certainly, EMC and the other server vendors, there's usually one of them in every transaction that we do or every competitive situation that we're in. We certainly see the start-up vendors, certainly not underestimating, but they are not ubiquitous like the other guys are. In terms of jump-off [ph] workloads, I think they fall into a bunch of different categories, whether it be analytic workloads, whether it be virtual desktop workloads, whether it be new apps workloads, webscale types of things. I think where we're seeing the cloud and application development is around a lot of these new workloads, whether Hadoop is it on-premise solution or whether we see analytics in the cloud, whether it be some of the customer service, whether it be the mobile apps, those types of things. And I think that those are very, very much a jump ball. I think as far as the other vendors, I'd say certainly the hyperconverged, we see them in those domains. Flash is a little bit different. I think a lot of flash battlefield is around some of the new workloads, particularly virtual desktop, but that's not big enough to support everybody's flash investment. The other place where we clearly see flash is basically application acceleration and database, and generically high-performance SAN. So for NetApp, high-performance SAN has not been a historical strength of ours. Certainly with clustered ONTAP we want to compete more aggressively there. But that's not the installed base -- it's not the NetApp installed base that's being fought over in the high-performance SAN market. So that's an opportunity that with clustered ONTAP and now with the all-flash FAS, the latest release in the performance benchmarks that we have that are compelling, it's something that we want to compete on more aggressively. So I tell you, it depends on the workload. I think the cloud is more relevant to next-gen workloads, and then we're starting to see flash around things like VDI, but a lot of it around accelerating traditional workloads particularly around database acceleration."

I think the lay of the land now based on kind of what we believe is achievable the rest of the year gets us back to our operating model in the second half. And the balance that we have clearly is -- we spent a lot of time on this portfolio. We know there are things that are under our control that if we could overpower it that we believe can unlock growth. And at this point in time, I don't want to preclude our ability to do that. So we're making the investments to go after that and go after that aggressively. If it turns out that either the macro substantially deteriorates or our postulate is not correct, although we're pretty convinced that we're on the right track, or any other of number things come in the way and the business doesn't materialize, then clearly, our current operating hypothesis will be invalidated and we're going to have to do other things. So certainly, there's an opportunity to take more cost out of the infrastructure. I think to take more cost out of the infrastructure now, when we know what big bets that we think were on the cusp of realizing over the next 6 months, we start to see impact, then, I think we want to make those bets now. But if they don't materialize, then clearly, we need to rethink the -- what we think the long-term growth rate of this business is, what we think the long-term growth rate of this industry is and we have to look at our cost structure. So we're not wedded to a dollar figure on the cost structure at this point in time. We're going to be practical. At this point, we took out a certain amount of headcount. We took out well more than that in other infrastructure costs in the company -- took a couple of hundred million dollars out. So we're prepared to do more if the situation warrants. But right now, I think we have a structure that enables us to still compete for this business. And if we're right in our hypothesis, then I think we win, and I think that we will be well-served by [indiscernible] the investments we're making right now."

This is my first earnings call as NetApp's CEO and it's an honor to be here. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our prior guidance, with gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above our previous guidance ranges. We did what we said we would, but we are clear that we have a lot more work to do. We're committed to helping our customers navigate their IT transformations, to improving our own execution and to enhancing value for our shareholders. We are making progress against our plans, adding new customers and expanding the adoption of our portfolio by aggressively pivoting towards modern architectures such as Scale-Out, software defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, all while planning to return to our operating model in the second half of this fiscal year. 
This is my first time addressing many of you, and what you'll hear from me today is a focus on portfolio management, execution and enhancing shareholder value. I want to start by sharing my views on how I think about managing our business and how we are shaping our strategy to respond to the transformation of the IT industry, to increase efficiency and to deliver strong financial returns. Then I will provide an update on our business in the quarter, and handing over to Nick to cover our financial results before we open the call to Q&A. 
In my first day as the CEO, I spent time to ensure that we had a well-articulated view of the industry transitions and a clear understanding of customers' IT transformation priorities. But this alone is not enough. To maximize results from our strong portfolio of technologies, we need to operate the business with a greater level discipline and to align resources against our most important priorities. In addition to improving alignment and inspection, you can expect from me highly-disciplined portfolio management across all aspects of the business: technology, customers and go-to-market. We must manage the business to drive efficiency and profitability from the mature parts of our portfolio so we can afford investment in emerging high-growth areas, to deliver innovation ahead of the market, drive increased awareness and expand our footprint. You can expect to hear about the results of this rigorous portfolio management as we come back over successive quarters. 
The requirement for digital capabilities and cloud-based solutions is driving fundamental change across the IT industry. Enterprises must transforming in order to survive and data management is at the heart of the transition they need to make. Whether it's dealing with data growth efficiently, drawing real-time insight from data or integrating data across their globally-distributed value chain, managing data is of great importance to our customers. This is aware NetApp has a profoundly important role to play. We are the only company that can help customers manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures and provide the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth generated by the digital world. This is what I see as our big opportunity. 
To accelerate this transformation, customers are seeking to take advantage of new applications and modern data center storage and data management architectures. This implies a reduced opportunity in the traditional storage market, but at the same time, growth in new areas such as Scale-Out storage, software defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud. We are and will continue to actively drive a shift within our product and go-to-market portfolio to meet the changing demands of our customers. And you will see me drive a more disciplined approach around managing this portfolio, both to increase focus on the growth in emerging parts of our business and to drive efficiency in the mature parts. 
As customers transform their IT environment, they are reducing their spend on traditional storage, which has put pressure on our ONTAP 7-Mode business. The 7-Mode storage operating system was shipped in only 35% of FAS units in the quarter, down from roughly 75% a year ago. Customers are also slowing investment in the capacity expansion of the traditional storage environment. Both of these dynamics lowered new unit shipments of and lower incremental capacity in ONTAP 7-Mode systems, puts downward pressure in our product revenue despite strong growth in other parts of our business. We have a heightened sense of urgency in working with our customers to enable their move to the modern architectures delivered by our portfolio. 
As customers replace their traditional storage architectures and transform the data centers, they want Scale-Out of software-defined storage functionality to both manage data growth efficiently and deliver service provider like flexibility. Clustered Data ONTAP provides this through a highly efficient, multitenant, nonstop shared-storage infrastructure to replace legacy still-type architectures for enterprise applications like databases, virtualization, VDI and e-commerce. Clustered ONTAP also enables customers to seamlessly manage their applications and data across flash disk and cloud footprints. And as customers plan their hybrid cloud architectures, the software-defined architecture of clustered ONTAP provides a consistent way to manage data across private and public clouds, regardless of underlying hardware. 
Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 65% [ph] of the FAS systems shipped in Q1, up from roughly 25% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems group by approximately 115%, the 13the consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. The value proposition of clustered ONTAP for the next generation data center is strong, as evidenced by continued rapid customer adoption. We are migrating our installed base customers clustered ONTAP and gaining new customers in competitive environments. The number of customers using clustered ONTAP grew by more than 130% [ph] in Q1 from Q1 a year ago. The fastest growth was in new to NetApp customers, which group 225%. 
Let me give you some examples to illustrate why new customers are choosing NetApp. We won the business of a midsized Internet radio provider, who had moved off a leading hyperscale cloud service provider due to cost, and onto a solution from one of the startups. Ultimately, that infrastructure could not scale to meet the customer's needs, so they turned to clustered ONTAP for its ability to spread the load across multiple controllers and for its virtual storage-sharing capability, which efficiently prioritizes workload. 
At a multibillion dollar construction services company, we replaced an established vendor. Clustered ONTAP was able to solve their problem with less hardware and greater flexibility. In addition to buying new systems from us, the customer is also using our FlexArray software to run clustered ONTAP on the underappreciated hardware assets from their now legacy vendor. 
We told you last quarter that we would make investments to accelerate the migration of our customer's ONTAP 7-Mode installed base to clustered ONTAP, and we have. Our transition programs offer customers and certified partners with transition support, temporarily gear and financial incentives. Just formalized in Q1, this program is already showing earlier results. A large semiconductor manufacturer in Asia-Pacific, building its private cloud on clustered ONTAP, leveraged the program to deploy a cluster of all-flash FAS systems, leading our flash offerings from established and emerging vendors. And they plan to migrate additional 7-Mode systems in the future the clustered ONTAP. 
A U.S.-based multicampus university is replacing its existing storage silos systems from NetApp and multiple competitors. They will standardize on clustered ONTAP and OnCommand Insight to provide services for all of their campuses and medical centers. Only NetApp could fulfill their performance, archive and reporting needs. Over the course of fiscal '16, we will continue to refine and extend our transition programs. 
Customers are seeking to gain competitive advantage and economic benefits from accelerated business transactions, processes and their supporting enterprise applications. To do so, they are deploying high-performance enterprise-grade flash technology. Our all-flash FAS products offer built-in data protection, multi-protocol support, Scale-Out performance and seamless data movement from flash to disk to cloud. These benefits have driven rapid customer adoption of our all-flash FAS solutions, with unit shipments growing almost 140% year-on-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. In Q1, we launched new lower-cost all-flash FAS products with Flash Essentials innovations to improve performance and efficiency. Customer reception to this launch has been tremendous, and we saw a strong uptick in all-flash FAS sales momentum during the quarter. 
We had significant and growing numbers of competitive wins against established and emerging flash-only vendors. For example, at a major software-as-a-service provider, designing their next-generation infrastructure to migrate from a traditional database architecture to an in-memory architecture, all-flash FAS beat solutions from both established and emerging flash-only and hybrid flash competitors. At a leading online retail financial services company with demanding critical applications that monitor and analyze trading data throughout the day, the EFC all-flash array easily outperformed all of the leading competitors. 
To improve business insight and decision making, customers are also deploying new webscale and analytic applications like Hadoop and Splunk as long as well as increasing the amount of data that they retain online to support the performance, availability and cost requirements of these applications, customers are using our E-Series platforms. As we aggressively target this part of the market, we see continued growth of the E-Series platforms with unit shipments up almost 50% [ph] from Q1 last year. 
To help with the additional transformation and to better manage their IT portfolio, customers over the medium to long term are looking to enable hybrid cloud architecture. The challenge of the hybrid cloud is that it is a series of isolated and incompatible data silos. Every cloud provider has a different way to manage data, making it difficult for customers to move and share data across clouds. Our customers are looking for a consistent way to secure and manage data regardless of location, and our focus on data management enables customers to utilize cloud resources, while leveraging existing investments and maintaining control of their data. 
Our hybrid cloud solutions are important in positioning us ahead of the market, but did not contribute meaningfully to revenue today. The products included in our hybrid cloud solutions portfolio are NetApp Private Storage for cloud, Cloud ONTAP, StorageGRID Webscale and AltaVault. Of these, NetApp Private Storage represents the largest opportunity. It enables customers to take advantage of the elastic compute resources of multiple clouds for cloud bursting or data analytics, while maintaining complete control of their data. Cloud ONTAP is a rent-by-the-hour version of clustered Data ONTAP, available on Amazon Web Services for use cases such as agile software development. The number of hours of usage continues to grow nicely, with hours of usage more than doubling from last quarter. 
AltaVault is the most recent addition to this part of our portfolio. It helps customers preserve the investment in their existing backup software, while enabling them to take advantage of low-cost cl storage as a long-term backup and archival target. In Q1, we announced new AltaVault Solutions, an extended service offerings. 
Our hybrid cloud portfolio is delivering strategic wins. We had several NetApp Private Storage wins at companies with strong cloud mandates, because it enables them to leverage cloud resources while avoiding data governance risk and data mobility challenges. We gained a foothold in a new financial services customer with AltaVault, displacing our leading competitors legacy backup solutions because of our ability to unlock the economics of cloud for backup. With StorageGRID Webscale, we beat established and emerging vendors at a photo-sharing cloud provider, because it enabled the customer to leverage their existing infrastructure while moving to object storage for data management at webscale. 
Finally, customers are looking for pre-integrated converged solutions. Today, NetApp offers the highly successful FlexPod converged system in conjunction with Cisco. You can expect to see exciting innovations on FlexPod this year. We recently began shipping NetApp integrated EVO:RAIL solutions, bringing the proven benefits of NetApp storage for VMware to a hyperconverged form factor. We will continue to monitor the evolution of hyperconverged infrastructure. 
As we move to better address the growth areas of the storage market, our confidence in our direction comes from our customers. Our strategy and technology portfolio resonate with enterprises and service providers, positioning us as a strategic adviser to assist them through their IT and digital transformation. As I have said, elements of our technology portfolio are growing rapidly. We are shifting investments in our go-to-market teams to accelerate that growth and those actions are showing early signs of success. We added incremental sales headcount in Q4 of last year and the beginning of this year, and they already driving meaningful expansion to our pipeline. We also took action to regain traction in our channel. We added a global channel chief, a worldwide channel leadership team and made investments and channel marketing programs, all by reallocating resources within our operating expense envelope. I personally have met with partners in the Americas and EMEA and have seen the excitement over the opportunity with NetApp. Be clear that we have a sense of urgency and a high level of focus to ensure that our investments continued to translate into productive sales conversations and ultimately pipeline and bookings growth. We expect that investments in clustered ONTAP transition, sales capacity and general traction, combined with our shift to better address the industry trends, will deliver improving results over the course of this fiscal year, and we are committed to returning to our target operating model in the second half. We continue to work through to declines in the mature part of our business, but are encouraged by the many areas of growth. 
Before I hand it over to Nick to go over the quarter in more detail, I'd like to summarize by saying our strategy is to assist our customers' IT transformation with a unique and differentiated efficient for data management. We plan to deliver against discussion by actively pivoting the company to execute against the industry trends of Scale-Out, software-defined storage, flash, converged infrastructure and hybrid cloud data management. And at the same time, we have an intense focus on disciplined cost management and cost structure. We are confident that we are on the right path, but clearly have more work to do. 
I will focus on driving disciplined portfolio management, streamline decision-making for efficiency, alignment and accountability, and instill more rigorous inspection and corrective action for high-performance execution. As I continue my rigorous analysis of the business, these, plus understanding our customers' plans to consume technology, are all considerations that I will take into account as we position the company for success and increase shareholder value. On our next quarterly earnings call, I will have more details to share with you. 
I'm excited for the future. The feedback from our customers on our technology strategic direction has been strongly positive. Partners feel confident that our portfolio provides a unique value proposition for them and their customers and by raising the bar on our execution and actively addressing the industry trend, we will emerge from this transition a stronger, more focused and disciplined company. 
I'll now pass it over to Nick."

NetApp delivered Q1 results that were generally on track and in line with our expectations. As George highlighted, the storage industry is in transition as customers drive IT transformations to take advantage of new technologies and architectures, while planning their journey to the hybrid cloud. As you know, this industry transition has impacted our business as well. We have embarked in a new chapter and we are aggressively shifting our efforts to better position ourselves for the future. 
We saw progress on many fronts in Q1, but we still have a lot of work ahead. For the first half of fiscal year 2016, we are raising the bar on execution across all aspects of the business. For the second half of the year, you can expect us to deliver against our plan and return to our target operating margins. Beyond fiscal 2016, we will do a much better job demonstrating our broad value proposition to customers and translating that to financial results, top and bottom line, and increased shareholder value. 
Please note that I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers of today's presentation, unless otherwise indicated. 
Fiscal Q1 net revenues were $1.34 billion, down about 13% sequentially and down 10% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact of about 4 points on the year-over-year comparison. We estimate that the extra week in Q1, which occurs every 6 years to realign fiscal and calendar months, added approximately $40 million of revenue to the quarter. Product revenue was $664 million in the first quarter, down 27% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year product revenue comparison by about 5 points. The decline on product revenue due largely to the decline in ONTAP 7-Mode sales was in line with our expectations and prior guidance. 
The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues primarily comprised of existing, new and renewed service contracts, was $671 million in the first quarter, up 7% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. The increase reflects the continued growth of our installed base and short-term renewals from existing customers as well as the benefit from the extra week in Q1. Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs was 77% of Q1 net revenues compared to 78% in Q4 and 76% in Q1 of last year. 
Gross margin of 63.6% was down just under a point from Q1 last year and was negatively impacted by about a point from FX, consistent with our prior expectations. Product gross margin was 51.2% reflecting a decline of about 6 points year-over-year. Roughly half of this decline was due to FX headwinds with the remainder from lower volume, unfavorable product mix and some higher discounting. Software maintenance, gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services margin was up just over 1.5 points, reflecting increased revenue and leverage of existing infrastructure investments and the benefit of the 14th week. 
Operating expenses of $746 million were up 3% year-over-year. FX reduced operating expenses by about 4 points on a year-over-year basis. And consistent with my comments last quarter, the 14th week contributed about $41 million of sequential growth. Operating margin of 7.7% was above our previous guidance range, driven by lower spending and the benefit of our previously announced realignment actions on largely in-line revenues and gross margins. Our realignment actions, resulting in a headcount reduction of approximately 3% and 8 a GAAP charge of approximately $27 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter and for projected rate for the year was 17%, up 0.5 points from Q1 last year due to greater investment in income in our foreign subsidiaries, tax and U.S. rates. 
Q1 weighted average diluted share count of 308 million shares decreased by approximately 5 million shares sequentially due to share repurchase activity in the quarter. EPS was $0.29, $0.04 over the higher end of our prior guidance range driven by higher operating margin and lower diluted share count. 
Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed Q1 with $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately 8% of which was held by our domestic entity. Inventory turns decreased to 10 due in part to our factory move, which is now complete. I anticipate inventory turns returning to a normalized mid to high teens level in Q2, and in fact, much of the additional inventory we built up during Q1 has already been shipped. 
Q1 day sales outstanding decreased to 30 days due to invoicing occurring earlier in the quarter ended extra week of collections from the 14th week. 
Deferred revenue decreased by $131 million in Q1 versus Q4 and decreased $10 million from Q1 last year. We expect that the decline, about $40 million of which was due to the 14th week and the remainder commensurate with a decline in product revenue. 
Q1 cash from operations was approximately $129 million versus $216 million in Q1 a year ago. at 7% of revenue, free cash flow was down as expected due to lower net income resulting from the year-over-year revenue decline. 
We repurchased approximately $430 million of our stock and paid $54 million in cash dividends during the quarter. As you may recall, our Board of Directors authorized $2.5 billion of repurchases by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. Today, we announced our next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on October 21, 2015. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance. As I discussed earlier, fiscal year 2016 is one of transition. We are aggressively focused on our top priorities, rebuilding pipeline and momentum in the first half of the year and executing against our plan to return to our targeted operating model for the second half of the year. We have a strong portfolio of technologies that can do a better job of fully monetizing it. With George at the helm, we are doing a deeper dive to understand our business and market opportunity beyond this fiscal year. You can expect to hear from us on our next quarterly earnings call with a further update on how we expect to evolve the business to deliver greater value to customers and shareholders. 
For fiscal 2016, we now expect revenue to be down about 5%, with impact from FX headwinds and limited top line predictability in the first half of the year, easing in the second half. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down cost, we expect fiscal 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about 1 point from fiscal 2015. We expect operating margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about 2 points for the year, with a challenging first half and a return to our 18% to 20% target operating margin range for the second half. Although off to a strong start in the first quarter, we expect a year of continued cash flow generation, with free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for the year in the mid-teen. 
Finally, we remain committed to driving shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends. Based on current stock prices, we expect to reduce share count in fiscal 2016 by approximately 5%. And between dividends and share repurchases, we will again return over 100% of free cash flow generated to shareholders in fiscal 2016. 
For Q2, we expect continued FX headwinds and limited top line predictability as we rebuild pipeline and momentum. As such, we expect revenues for Q2 to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which at the midpoint implies a sequential increase of approximately 9% and a 6% decrease year-over-year. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5%, and operating margins of approximately 14% to 50%. Based in our share repurchase in Q1 and in the first 10 days of Q2, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to the approximately 303 million shares, and earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.55 to $0.60 per share. 
In summary, we are confident in our differentiated strategy for data management and hybrid cloud. We are shifting our investments and efforts to accelerate growth in the areas of our portfolio that address our customers' most pressing IT imperatives. FY '16 is a year of transition as we rebuild our pipeline, help customers through their IT transition and return the business to our targeted operating model. The positive feedback we've received from customers and partners reinforce our confidence and our direction. 
Last but not least, I am excited about the change that George brings as the CEO of NetApp. I believe his focus on portfolio management, execution and shareholder value, combined with his perspective and frank assessment of the entirety of our business, will yield positive results for partners, customers and shareholders. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Kris to open it up for questions and answers. Kris?"

So you're seeing that FX really hitting the product side of the fence versus the deferred side of the fence. In addition to that, it's a combination of volume and mix, what you would expect given the rebuild of the pipeline and some discounting. So we talked about discounting last quarter, we talked about, again, discounting this quarter. I indicated that I would talk about that to the degree that it changes on the year-over-year basis, so you can imagine with a lower pipeline and the need to rebuild, those are the types of things we have to work through. Over the course of the year, in terms of product gross margin, we're going to expect that FX certainly stayed in the back half of the year. I wish it didn't have -- assuming there is not another dramatic change out there, we shouldn't have the type of compares we have. So we'll be back to the typical, which is looking at the mix of business. We'll be looking at the combination of pricing, discounting and fading out of the supply chain to really  look at the gross margin there. So that's probably the good perspective for you."

Remember, the first half of the issue was about pipeline retail. We're talking about pipeline regards from a perspective of rebuilding sales capacity, of channel investments, of transition programs, and we're seeing the beginning of those things. So in terms of the back half of the year, what we expect it to have and then what we're seeing in early, the green shoots on, if you will, are those metrics are coming into they are starting to build, and we expect to monetize some of that in the second half. Is it a dramatic shift of product revenue from the second quarter, let's say, to the third or the fourth? I wouldn't call it a dramatic shift. Certainly, the first [ph] quarter was impaired and we knew that coming into the first [ph] quarter. The maintenance streams in the company, we can look at those year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, and that's reflective of that installed base. The installed base, as we indicated, continues to grow. It's a combination of new, renewal and we see that -- sometimes we see that in short term, sometimes we see that in longer-term basis. So is there a dramatic shift from the second quarter to the second half of the year? I wouldn't say it's a dramatic shift. Obviously, we expect some uptick in terms of product revenue. We will no longer hopefully have the FX pressure on product revenue. But certainly, Q1 was a low point and Q1 was reflective of what happened to the pipeline and Q1 is really the area where we're going to be the lowest."

This is my first earnings call as NetApp's CEO, and it's an honor to be here. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our prior guidance, with gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above our previous guidance ranges. We did what we said we would, but we are clear that we have a lot more work to do. We're committed to helping our customers navigate their IT transformations, to improving our own execution and to enhancing value for our shareholders. We are making progress against our plan, adding new customers and expanding the adoption of our portfolio by aggressively pivoting towards modern architectures such as scale-out, software defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, all while planning to return to our operating model in the second half of this fiscal year.
This is my first time addressing many of you, and what you will hear from me today is a focus on portfolio management, execution and enhancing shareholder value. I want to start by sharing my views on how I think about managing our business and how we are shaping our strategy to respond to the transformation in the IT industry, to increase efficiency and to deliver strong financial returns. Then I will provide an update on our business in the quarter and hand it over to Nick to cover our financial results before we open the call for Q&A.
In my first day as the CEO, I spent time to ensure that we had a well-articulated view of the industry transition and a clear understanding of customers' IT transformation priorities. But this alone is not enough. To maximize results from our strong portfolio of technologies, we need to operate the business with a greater level of discipline and to align resources against our most important priorities. In addition to improving alignment and inspection, you can expect from me highly disciplined portfolio management across all aspects of the business: technology, customers and go-to-market. We must manage the business to drive efficiency and profitability from the mature parts of our portfolio so we can afford investment in emerging high-growth areas, to deliver innovation ahead of the market, drive increased awareness and expand our footprint. You can expect to hear about the results of this rigorous portfolio management as we come back over successive quarters.
The requirement for digital capabilities and cloud-based solutions is driving fundamental change across the IT industry. Enterprises must transform in order to survive, and data management is at the heart of the transition they need to make. Whether it's dealing with data growth efficiently, drawing real-time insight from data or integrating data across their globally-distributed value chain, managing data is of great importance to our customers. This is aware NetApp has a profoundly important role to play. We are the only company that can help customers manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures and provide the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth generated by the digital world. This is what I see as our big opportunity.
To accelerate this transformation, customers are seeking to take advantage of new applications and modern data center storage and data management architectures. This implies a reduced opportunity in the traditional storage market, but at the same time, growth in new areas such as scale-out storage, software defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud. We are and will continue to actively drive a shift within our product and go-to-market portfolio to meet the changing demands of our customers. And you will see me drive a more disciplined approach around managing this portfolio, both to increase focus on the growth in emerging parts of our business and to drive efficiency in the mature parts.
As customers transform their IT environment, they are reducing their spend on traditional storage, which has put pressure on our ONTAP 7-Mode business. The 7-Mode storage operating system was shipped in only 35% of FAS units in the quarter, down from roughly 75% a year ago. Customers are also slowing investment in the capacity expansion of their traditional storage environment. Both of these dynamics, lowered new unit shipments of and lower incremental capacity in ONTAP 7-Mode systems, put downward pressure on our product revenue despite strong growth in other parts of our business. We have a heightened sense of urgency in working with our customers to enable their move to the modern architectures delivered by our portfolio.
As customers replace their traditional storage architectures and transform their data centers, they want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality to both manage data growth efficiently and deliver service provider like flexibility. Clustered Data ONTAP provides this through a highly efficient, multitenant, nonstop shared storage infrastructure to replace legacy stovepipe architectures for enterprise applications like databases, virtualization, VDI and e-commerce. Clustered ONTAP also enables customers to seamlessly manage their applications and data across flash disk and cloud footprints. And as customers plan their hybrid cloud architectures, the software-defined architecture of clustered ONTAP provides a consistent way to manage data across private and public clouds, regardless of underlying hardware.
Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 65% of the FAS systems shipped in Q1, up from roughly 25% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems grew by approximately 115%, the 13th consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. The value proposition of clustered ONTAP for the next-generation data center is strong, as evidenced by continued rapid customer adoption. We are migrating our installed base customers to clustered ONTAP and gaining new customers in competitive environments. The number of customers using clustered ONTAP grew by more than 130% in Q1 from Q1 a year ago. The fastest growth was in new to NetApp customers, which group 225%.
Let me give you some examples to illustrate why new customers are choosing NetApp. We won the business of a midsized Internet radio provider, who had moved off a leading hyperscale cloud service provider due to cost and onto a solution from one of the startups. Ultimately, that infrastructure could not scale to meet the customer's needs, so they turned to clustered ONTAP for its ability to spread the load across multiple controllers and for its virtual storage-sharing capability, which efficiently prioritizes workload.
At a multibillion dollar construction services company, we replaced an established vendor. Clustered ONTAP was able to solve their problem with less hardware and greater flexibility. In addition to buying new systems from us, the customer is also using our FlexArray software to run clustered ONTAP on the underappreciated hardware assets from their now legacy vendor.
We told you last quarter that we would make investments to accelerate the migration of our customer's ONTAP 7-Mode installed base to clustered ONTAP, and we have. Our transition programs offer customers and certified partners with transition support, temporary gear and financial incentives. Just formalized in Q1, this program is already showing early results. A large semiconductor manufacturer in Asia Pacific, building its private cloud on clustered ONTAP, leveraged the program to deploy a cluster of all-flash FAS systems, beating out flash offerings from established and emerging vendors. And they plan to migrate additional 7-Mode systems in the future to clustered ONTAP.
A U.S.-based multicampus university is replacing its existing storage silos systems from NetApp and multiple competitors. They will standardize on clustered ONTAP and on OnCommand Insight to provide services for all of their campuses and medical centers. Only NetApp could fulfill their performance, archive and reporting needs. Over the course of fiscal '16, we will continue to refine and expand our transition programs.
Customers are seeking to gain competitive advantage and economic benefits from accelerating business transactions, processes and their supporting enterprise applications. To do so, they're deploying high-performance enterprise-grade flash technology. Our all-flash FAS products offer built-in data protection, multiprotocol support, scale-out performance and seamless data movement from flash to disk to cloud. These benefits have driven rapid customer adoption of our all-flash FAS solutions with unit shipments growing almost 140% year-on-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. In Q1, we launched new lower-cost all-flash FAS products with Flash Essentials innovations to improve performance and efficiency. Customer reception to this launch has been tremendous, and we saw a strong uptick in all-flash FAS sales momentum during the quarter.
We had significant and growing numbers of competitive wins against established and emerging flash-only vendors. For example, at a major software-as-a-service provider, designing their next-generation infrastructure to migrate from a traditional database architecture to an in-memory architecture, all-flash FAS beat solutions from both established and emerging flash-only and hybrid flash competitors. At a leading online retail financial services company with demanding mission-critical applications that monitor and analyze trading data throughout the day, the EF-Series all-flash array easily outperformed all of the leading competitors.
To improve business insight and decision-making, customers are also deploying new webscale and analytic applications like Hadoop and Splunk as well as increasing the amount of data that they retain online. To support the performance, availability and cost requirements of these applications, customers are using our E-Series platforms. As we aggressively target this part of the market, we see continued growth of the E-Series platforms with unit shipments up almost 50% from Q1 last year.
To help with the additional transformation and to better manage their IT portfolio, customers over the medium to long term are looking to enable hybrid cloud architecture. The challenge of the hybrid cloud is that it is a series of isolated and incompatible data silos. Every cloud provider has a different way to manage data, making it difficult for customers to move and share data across clouds. Our customers are looking for a consistent way to secure and manage data regardless of location. And our focus on data management enables customers to utilize cloud resources while leveraging existing investments and maintaining control of their data. 
Our hybrid cloud solutions are important in positioning us ahead of the market but did not contribute meaningfully to revenue today. The products included in our hybrid cloud solution portfolio are NetApp Private Storage for Cloud, Cloud ONTAP, StorageGRID Webscale and AltaVault. Of these, NetApp Private Storage represents the largest opportunity. It enables customers to take advantage of the elastic compute resources of multiple clouds for cloud bursting or data analytics while maintaining complete control of their data. Cloud ONTAP is a rent-by-the-hour version of clustered Data ONTAP available on Amazon Web Services for use cases such as agile software development. The number of hours of usage continues to grow nicely with hours of usage more than doubling from last quarter.
AltaVault is the most recent addition to this part of our portfolio. It helps customers preserve the investments in their existing backup software while enabling them to take advantage of low-cost cloud storage as a long-term backup and archival target. In Q1, we announced new AltaVault Solutions and extended service offerings.
Our hybrid cloud portfolio is delivering strategic wins. We've had several NetApp Private Storage wins at companies with strong cloud mandates because it enables them to leverage cloud resources while avoiding data governance risk and data mobility challenges. We gained a foothold in a new financial services customer with AltaVault, displacing our leading competitor's legacy backup solution because of our ability to unlock the economics of cloud for backup. With StorageGRID Webscale, we beat established and emerging vendors at a photo-sharing cloud provider because it enabled the customer to leverage their existing infrastructure while moving to object storage for data management at webscale.
Finally, customers are looking for pre-integrated converged solutions. Today, NetApp offers the highly successful FlexPod converged system in conjunction with Cisco. You can expect to see exciting innovations on FlexPod this year. We recently began shipping NetApp integrated EVO:RAIL solutions, bringing the proven benefits of NetApp storage for VMware to a hyperconverged form factor. We will continue to monitor the evolution of hyperconverged infrastructure.
As we move to better address the growth areas of the storage market, our confidence in our direction comes from our customers. Our strategy and technology portfolio resonate with enterprises and service providers, positioning us as a strategic adviser to assist them through their IT and digital transformation. As I have said, the elements of our technology portfolio are growing rapidly. We are shifting investments in our go-to-market teams to accelerate that growth, and those actions are showing early signs of success. We added incremental sales headcount in Q4 of last year and the beginning of this year, and they are already driving meaningful expansion to our pipeline. We also took action to regain traction in our channel. We added a global channel chief, a worldwide channel leadership team and made investments in channel marketing programs, all by reallocating resources within our operating expense envelope.
I personally have met with partners in the Americas and EMEA and have seen their excitement over the opportunity with NetApp. Be clear that we have a sense of urgency and a high level of focus to ensure that our investments continue to translate into productive sales conversations and ultimately pipeline and bookings growth. We expect that investments in clustered ONTAP transition, sales capacity and channel traction, combined with our shift to better address the industry trends, will deliver improving results over the course of this fiscal year. And we are committed to returning to our target operating model in the second half. We continue to work through to the declines in the mature part of our business but are encouraged by the many areas of growth.
Before I hand it over to Nick to go over the quarter in more detail, I'd like to summarize by saying our strategy is to assist our customers' IT transformation with a unique and differentiated vision for data management. We plan to deliver against this vision by actively pivoting the company to execute against the industry trends of scale-out, software-defined storage, flash, converged infrastructure and hybrid cloud data management. And at the same time, we have an intense focus on disciplined cost management and cost structure. We are confident that we are on the right path but clearly have more work to do.
I will focus on driving disciplined portfolio management, streamline decision-making for efficiency, alignment and accountability, and instill more rigorous inspection and corrective action for high-performance execution. As I continue my rigorous analysis of the business, these, plus understanding our customers' plans to consume technology, are all considerations that I will take into account as we position the company for success and increase shareholder value. On our next quarterly earnings call, I will have more details to share with you.
I'm excited for the future. The feedback from our customers on our technology and strategic direction has been strongly positive. Partners feel confident that our portfolio provides a unique value proposition for them and their customers. And by raising the bar on our execution and actively addressing the industry trends, we will emerge from this transition a stronger, more focused and disciplined company.
I'll now pass it over to Nick."

NetApp delivered Q1 results that were generally on track and in line with our expectations. As George highlighted, the storage industry is in transition as customers drive IT transformations to take advantage of new technologies and architectures while planning their journey to the hybrid cloud. As you know, this industry transition has impacted our business as well. We have embarked in a new chapter, and we are aggressively shifting our efforts to better position ourselves for the future.
We saw progress on many fronts in Q1, but we still have a lot of work ahead. For the first half of fiscal year 2016, we are raising the bar on execution across all aspects of the business. For the second half of the year, you can expect us to deliver against our plan and return to our target operating margins. Beyond fiscal 2016, we will do a much better job demonstrating our broad value proposition to customers and translating that to financial results, top and bottom line, and increased shareholder value.
Please note that I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation, unless otherwise indicated.
Fiscal Q1 net revenues were $1.34 billion, down about 13% sequentially and down 10% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact of about 4 points on the year-over-year comparison. We estimate that the extra week in Q1, which occurs every 6 years to realign fiscal and calendar months, added approximately $40 million of revenue to the quarter. Product revenue was $664 million in the first quarter, down 27% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year product revenue comparison by about 5 points. The decline in product revenue due largely to the decline in ONTAP 7-Mode sales was in line with our expectations and prior guidance.
The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues, primarily comprised of existing, new and renewed service contracts, was $671 million in the first quarter, up 7% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. The increase reflects the continued growth of our installed base and short-term renewals from existing customers as well as the benefit from the extra week in Q1. Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs was 77% of Q1 net revenues compared to 78% in Q4 and 76% in Q1 of last year.
Gross margin of 63.6% was down just under a point from Q1 last year and was negatively impacted by about a point from FX, consistent with our prior expectations. Product gross margin was 51.2%, reflecting a decline of about 6 points year-over-year. Roughly half of this decline was due to FX headwinds with the remainder from lower volume, unfavorable product mix and some higher discounting. Software maintenance, gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up just over 1.5 points, reflecting increased revenue and leverage of existing infrastructure investments and the benefit of the 14th week.
Operating expenses of $746 million were up 3% year-over-year. FX reduced operating expenses by about 4 points on a year-over-year basis. And consistent with my comments last quarter, the 14th week contributed about $41 million of sequential growth. Operating margin of 7.7% was above our previous guidance range, driven by lower spending and the benefit of our previously announced realignment action on largely in-line revenues and gross margins. Our realignment action resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 3% and a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $27 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter and projected rate for the year was 17%, up 0.5 points from Q1 last year due to greater investment income in our foreign subsidiaries taxed at U.S. rates. 
Q1 weighted average diluted share count of 308 million shares decreased by approximately 5 million shares sequentially due to share repurchase activity in the quarter. EPS was $0.29, $0.04 over the high end of our prior guidance range driven by higher operating margin and lower diluted share count.
Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed Q1 with $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately 8% of which was held by our domestic entity. Inventory turns decreased to 10 due in part to our factory move, which is now complete. I anticipate inventory turns returning to a normalized mid to high teens level in Q2, and in fact, much of the additional inventory we built up during Q1 has already been shipped.
Q1 day sales outstanding decreased to 30 days due to invoicing occurring earlier in the quarter and an extra week of collections from the 14th week.
Deferred revenue decreased by $131 million in Q1 versus Q4 and decreased $10 million from Q1 last year. We expected the decline, about $40 million of which was due to the 14th week and the remainder commensurate with the decline in product revenue.
Q1 cash from operations was approximately $129 million versus $216 million in Q1 a year ago. At 7% of revenue, free cash flow was down as expected due to lower net income resulting from the year-over-year revenue decline.
We repurchased approximately $430 million of our stock and paid $54 million in cash dividends during the quarter. As you may recall, our Board of Directors authorized $2.5 billion of repurchases by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. Today, we announced our next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on October 21, 2015.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance. As I discussed earlier, fiscal year 2016 is one of transition. We are aggressively focused on our top priorities, rebuilding pipeline and momentum in the first half of the year and executing against our plan to return to our targeted operating model for the second half of the year. We have a strong portfolio of technologies but can do a better job of fully monetizing it. With George at the helm, we are doing a deeper dive to understand our business and market opportunity beyond this fiscal year. You can expect to hear from us on our next quarterly earnings call with a further update on how we expect to evolve the business to deliver greater value to customers and shareholders.
For fiscal 2016, we now expect revenue to be down about 5% with impact from FX headwinds and limited top line predictability in the first half of the year easing in the second half. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, we expect fiscal 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about 1 point from fiscal 2015. We expect operating margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about 2 points for the year with a challenging first half and a return to our 18% to 20% target operating margin range for the second half. Although off to a slow start in the first quarter, we expect a year of continued cash flow generation with free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for the year in the mid-teen.
Finally, we remain committed to driving shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends. Based on current stock prices, we expect to reduce share count in fiscal 2016 by approximately 5%. And between dividends and share repurchases, we will again return over 100% of free cash flow generated to shareholders in fiscal 2016.
For Q2, we expect continued FX headwinds and limited top line predictability as we rebuild pipeline and momentum. As such, we expect net revenues for Q2 to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which at the midpoint implies a sequential increase of approximately 9% and a 6% decrease year-over-year. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5%, and operating margins of approximately 14% to 15%. Based on our share repurchases in Q1 and in the first 10 days of Q2, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to the approximately 303 million shares and earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.55 to $0.60 per share.
In summary, we are confident in our differentiated strategy for data management in hybrid cloud. We are shifting our investments and efforts to accelerate growth in the areas of our portfolio that address our customers' most pressing IT imperatives. FY '16 is a year of transition as we rebuild our pipeline, help customers through their IT transition and return the business to our targeted operating model. The positive feedback we've received from customers and partners reinforce our confidence and our direction.
Last but not least, I am excited about the change that George brings as the CEO of NetApp. I believe his focus on portfolio management, execution and shareholder value, combined with his perspective and frank assessment of the entirety of our business, will yield positive results for partners, customers and shareholders.

So you can imagine with a lower pipeline and the need to rebuild, those are the types of things we have to work through. Over the course of the year, in terms of product gross margin, we're going to expect that FX certainly stayed in the back half of the year. But we shouldn't have. Assuming there is not another dramatic change out there, we shouldn't have the type of compares we had. So we'll be back to the typical, which is looking at the mix of business.

Is it a dramatic shift of product revenue from the second quarter, let's say, to the third or the fourth? I wouldn't call it a dramatic shift. Certainly, the first quarter was impaired, and we knew that coming into the first quarter. The maintenance streams of the company, we can look at those year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, and that's reflective of that installed base. The installed base, as we indicated, continues to grow. It's a combination of new, renewal and that -- we see that -- sometimes we see that in short term. Sometimes we see that in longer-term thesis. So is there a dramatic shift from the second quarter to the second half of the year? I wouldn't say it's a dramatic shift. Obviously, we expect some uptick in terms of product revenue. We will no longer hopefully have the FX pressure on product revenue. But certainly, Q1 was a low point, and Q1 was reflective of what happened to the pipeline, and Q1 is really the area where we're going to be the lowest."

This is my first earnings call as NetApp's CEO, and it's an honor to be here. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our prior guidance, with gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above our previous guidance ranges. We did what we said we would, but we are clear that we have a lot more work to do. We're committed to helping our customers navigate their IT transformations, to improving our own execution and to enhancing value for our shareholders. We are making progress against our plan, adding new customers and expanding the adoption of our portfolio by aggressively pivoting towards modern architectures such as scale-out, software defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, all while planning to return to our operating model in the second half of this fiscal year.
This is my first time addressing many of you, and what you will hear from me today is a focus on portfolio management, execution and enhancing shareholder value. I want to start by sharing my views on how I think about managing our business and how we are shaping our strategy to respond to the transformation in the IT industry, to increase efficiency and to deliver strong financial returns. Then I will provide an update on our business in the quarter and hand it over to Nick to cover our financial results before we open the call for Q&A.
In my first day as the CEO, I spent time to ensure that we had a well-articulated view of the industry transition and a clear understanding of customers' IT transformation priorities. But this alone is not enough. To maximize results from our strong portfolio of technologies, we need to operate the business with a greater level of discipline and to align resources against our most important priorities. In addition to improving alignment and inspection, you can expect from me highly disciplined portfolio management across all aspects of the business: technology, customers and go-to-market. We must manage the business to drive efficiency and profitability from the mature parts of our portfolio so we can afford investment in emerging high-growth areas, to deliver innovation ahead of the market, drive increased awareness and expand our footprint. You can expect to hear about the results of this rigorous portfolio management as we come back over successive quarters.
The requirement for digital capabilities and cloud-based solutions is driving fundamental change across the IT industry. Enterprises must transform in order to survive, and data management is at the heart of the transition they need to make. Whether it's dealing with data growth efficiently, drawing real-time insight from data or integrating data across their globally-distributed value chain, managing data is of great importance to our customers. This is aware NetApp has a profoundly important role to play. We are the only company that can help customers manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures and provide the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth generated by the digital world. This is what I see as our big opportunity.
To accelerate this transformation, customers are seeking to take advantage of new applications and modern data center storage and data management architectures. This implies a reduced opportunity in the traditional storage market, but at the same time, growth in new areas such as scale-out storage, software defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud. We are and will continue to actively drive a shift within our product and go-to-market portfolio to meet the changing demands of our customers. And you will see me drive a more disciplined approach around managing this portfolio, both to increase focus on the growth in emerging parts of our business and to drive efficiency in the mature parts.
As customers transform their IT environment, they are reducing their spend on traditional storage, which has put pressure on our ONTAP 7-Mode business. The 7-Mode storage operating system was shipped in only 35% of FAS units in the quarter, down from roughly 75% a year ago. Customers are also slowing investment in the capacity expansion of their traditional storage environment. Both of these dynamics, lowered new unit shipments of and lower incremental capacity in ONTAP 7-Mode systems, put downward pressure on our product revenue despite strong growth in other parts of our business. We have a heightened sense of urgency in working with our customers to enable their move to the modern architectures delivered by our portfolio.
As customers replace their traditional storage architectures and transform their data centers, they want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality to both manage data growth efficiently and deliver service provider like flexibility. Clustered Data ONTAP provides this through a highly efficient, multitenant, nonstop shared storage infrastructure to replace legacy stovepipe architectures for enterprise applications like databases, virtualization, VDI and e-commerce. Clustered ONTAP also enables customers to seamlessly manage their applications and data across flash disk and cloud footprints. And as customers plan their hybrid cloud architectures, the software-defined architecture of clustered ONTAP provides a consistent way to manage data across private and public clouds, regardless of underlying hardware.
Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 65% of the FAS systems shipped in Q1, up from roughly 25% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems grew by approximately 115%, the 13th consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. The value proposition of clustered ONTAP for the next-generation data center is strong, as evidenced by continued rapid customer adoption. We are migrating our installed base customers to clustered ONTAP and gaining new customers in competitive environments. The number of customers using clustered ONTAP grew by more than 130% in Q1 from Q1 a year ago. The fastest growth was in new to NetApp customers, which group 225%.
Let me give you some examples to illustrate why new customers are choosing NetApp. We won the business of a midsized Internet radio provider, who had moved off a leading hyperscale cloud service provider due to cost and onto a solution from one of the startups. Ultimately, that infrastructure could not scale to meet the customer's needs, so they turned to clustered ONTAP for its ability to spread the load across multiple controllers and for its virtual storage-sharing capability, which efficiently prioritizes workload.
At a multibillion dollar construction services company, we replaced an established vendor. Clustered ONTAP was able to solve their problem with less hardware and greater flexibility. In addition to buying new systems from us, the customer is also using our FlexArray software to run clustered ONTAP on the underappreciated hardware assets from their now legacy vendor.
We told you last quarter that we would make investments to accelerate the migration of our customer's ONTAP 7-Mode installed base to clustered ONTAP, and we have. Our transition programs offer customers and certified partners with transition support, temporary gear and financial incentives. Just formalized in Q1, this program is already showing early results. A large semiconductor manufacturer in Asia Pacific, building its private cloud on clustered ONTAP, leveraged the program to deploy a cluster of all-flash FAS systems, beating out flash offerings from established and emerging vendors. And they plan to migrate additional 7-Mode systems in the future to clustered ONTAP.
A U.S.-based multicampus university is replacing its existing storage silos systems from NetApp and multiple competitors. They will standardize on clustered ONTAP and on OnCommand Insight to provide services for all of their campuses and medical centers. Only NetApp could fulfill their performance, archive and reporting needs. Over the course of fiscal '16, we will continue to refine and expand our transition programs.
Customers are seeking to gain competitive advantage and economic benefits from accelerating business transactions, processes and their supporting enterprise applications. To do so, they're deploying high-performance enterprise-grade flash technology. Our all-flash FAS products offer built-in data protection, multiprotocol support, scale-out performance and seamless data movement from flash to disk to cloud. These benefits have driven rapid customer adoption of our all-flash FAS solutions with unit shipments growing almost 140% year-on-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. In Q1, we launched new lower-cost all-flash FAS products with Flash Essentials innovations to improve performance and efficiency. Customer reception to this launch has been tremendous, and we saw a strong uptick in all-flash FAS sales momentum during the quarter.
We had significant and growing numbers of competitive wins against established and emerging flash-only vendors. For example, at a major software-as-a-service provider, designing their next-generation infrastructure to migrate from a traditional database architecture to an in-memory architecture, all-flash FAS beat solutions from both established and emerging flash-only and hybrid flash competitors. At a leading online retail financial services company with demanding mission-critical applications that monitor and analyze trading data throughout the day, the EF-Series all-flash array easily outperformed all of the leading competitors.
To improve business insight and decision-making, customers are also deploying new webscale and analytic applications like Hadoop and Splunk as well as increasing the amount of data that they retain online. To support the performance, availability and cost requirements of these applications, customers are using our E-Series platforms. As we aggressively target this part of the market, we see continued growth of the E-Series platforms with unit shipments up almost 50% from Q1 last year.
To help with the additional transformation and to better manage their IT portfolio, customers over the medium to long term are looking to enable hybrid cloud architecture. The challenge of the hybrid cloud is that it is a series of isolated and incompatible data silos. Every cloud provider has a different way to manage data, making it difficult for customers to move and share data across clouds. Our customers are looking for a consistent way to secure and manage data regardless of location. And our focus on data management enables customers to utilize cloud resources while leveraging existing investments and maintaining control of their data. 
Our hybrid cloud solutions are important in positioning us ahead of the market but do not contribute meaningfully to revenue today. The products included in our hybrid cloud solution portfolio are NetApp Private Storage for Cloud, Cloud ONTAP, StorageGRID Webscale and AltaVault. Of these, NetApp Private Storage represents the largest opportunity. It enables customers to take advantage of the elastic compute resources of multiple clouds for cloud bursting or data analytics while maintaining complete control of their data. Cloud ONTAP is a rent-by-the-hour version of clustered Data ONTAP available on Amazon Web Services for use cases such as agile software development. The number of hours of usage continues to grow nicely with hours of usage more than doubling from last quarter.
AltaVault is the most recent addition to this part of our portfolio. It helps customers preserve the investments in their existing backup software while enabling them to take advantage of low-cost cloud storage as a long-term backup and archival target. In Q1, we announced new AltaVault Solutions and extended service offerings.
Our hybrid cloud portfolio is delivering strategic wins. We've had several NetApp Private Storage wins at companies with strong cloud mandates because it enables them to leverage cloud resources while avoiding data governance risk and data mobility challenges. We gained a foothold in a new financial services customer with AltaVault, displacing our leading competitor's legacy backup solution because of our ability to unlock the economics of cloud for backup. With StorageGRID Webscale, we beat established and emerging vendors at a photo-sharing cloud provider because it enabled the customer to leverage their existing infrastructure while moving to object storage for data management at webscale.
Finally, customers are looking for pre-integrated converged solutions. Today, NetApp offers the highly successful FlexPod converged system in conjunction with Cisco. You can expect to see exciting innovations on FlexPod this year. We recently began shipping NetApp integrated EVO:RAIL solutions, bringing the proven benefits of NetApp storage for VMware to a hyperconverged form factor. We will continue to monitor the evolution of hyperconverged infrastructure.
As we move to better address the growth areas of the storage market, our confidence in our direction comes from our customers. Our strategy and technology portfolio resonate with enterprises and service providers, positioning us as a strategic adviser to assist them through their IT and digital transformations. As I have said, the elements of our technology portfolio are growing rapidly. We are shifting investments in our go-to-market teams to accelerate that growth, and those actions are showing early signs of success. We added incremental sales headcount in Q4 of last year and the beginning of this year, and they are already driving meaningful expansion to our pipeline. We also took action to regain traction in our channel. We added a global channel chief, a worldwide channel leadership team and made investments in channel marketing programs, all by reallocating resources within our operating expense envelope.
I personally have met with partners in the Americas and EMEA and have seen their excitement over the opportunity with NetApp. Be clear that we have a sense of urgency and a high level of focus to ensure that our investments continue to translate into productive sales conversations and ultimately pipeline and bookings growth. We expect that investments in clustered ONTAP transition, sales capacity and channel traction, combined with our shift to better address the industry trends, will deliver improving results over the course of this fiscal year. And we are committed to returning to our target operating model in the second half. We continue to work through to the declines in the mature part of our business but are encouraged by the many areas of growth.
Before I hand it over to Nick to go over the quarter in more detail, I'd like to summarize by saying our strategy is to assist our customers' IT transformation with a unique and differentiated vision for data management. We plan to deliver against this vision by actively pivoting the company to execute against the industry trends of scale-out, software-defined storage, flash, converged infrastructure and hybrid cloud data management. And at the same time, we have an intense focus on disciplined cost management and cost structure. We are confident that we are on the right path but clearly have more work to do.
I will focus on driving disciplined portfolio management, streamline decision-making for efficiency, alignment and accountability, and instill more rigorous inspection and corrective action for high-performance execution. As I continue my rigorous analysis of the business, these, plus understanding our customers' plans to consume technology, are all considerations that I will take into account as we position the company for success and increase shareholder value. On our next quarterly earnings call, I will have more details to share with you.
I'm excited for the future. The feedback from our customers on our technology and strategic direction has been strongly positive. Partners feel confident that our portfolio provides a unique value proposition for them and their customers. And by raising the bar on our execution and actively addressing the industry trends, we will emerge from this transition a stronger, more focused and disciplined company.
I'll now pass it over to Nick."

NetApp delivered Q1 results that were generally on track and in line with our expectations. As George highlighted, the storage industry is in transition as customers drive IT transformations to take advantage of new technologies and architectures while planning their journey to the hybrid cloud. As you know, this industry transition has impacted our business as well. We have embarked in a new chapter, and we are aggressively shifting our efforts to better position ourselves for the future.
We saw progress on many fronts in Q1, but we still have a lot of work ahead. For the first half of fiscal year 2016, we are raising the bar on execution across all aspects of the business. For the second half of the year, you can expect us to deliver against our plan and return to our target operating margins. Beyond fiscal 2016, we will do a much better job demonstrating our broad value proposition to customers and translating that to financial results, top and bottom line, and increased shareholder value.
Please note that I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation, unless otherwise indicated.
Fiscal Q1 net revenues were $1.34 billion, down about 13% sequentially and down 10% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact of about 4 points on the year-over-year comparison. We estimate that the extra week in Q1, which occurs every 6 years to realign fiscal and calendar months, added approximately $40 million of revenue to the quarter. Product revenue was $664 million in the first quarter, down 27% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year product revenue comparison by about 5 points. The decline in product revenue due largely to the decline in ONTAP 7-Mode sales was in line with our expectations and prior guidance.
The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues, primarily comprised of existing, new and renewed service contracts, was $671 million in the first quarter, up 7% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. The increase reflects the continued growth of our installed base and short-term renewals from existing customers as well as the benefit from the extra week in Q1. Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs was 77% of Q1 net revenues compared to 78% in Q4 and 76% in Q1 of last year.
Gross margin of 63.6% was down just under a point from Q1 last year and was negatively impacted by about a point from FX, consistent with our prior expectations. Product gross margin was 51.2%, reflecting a decline of about 6 points year-over-year. Roughly half of this decline was due to FX headwinds with the remainder from lower volume, unfavorable product mix and some higher discounting. Software maintenance, gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up just over 1.5 points, reflecting increased revenue and leverage of existing infrastructure investments and the benefit of the 14th week.
Operating expenses of $746 million were up 3% year-over-year. FX reduced operating expenses by about 4 points on a year-over-year basis. And consistent with my comments last quarter, the 14th week contributed about $41 million of sequential growth. Operating margin of 7.7% was above our previous guidance range, driven by lower spending and the benefit of our previously announced realignment action on largely in-line revenues and gross margins. Our realignment action resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 3% and a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $27 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter and projected rate for the year was 17%, up 0.5 points from Q1 last year due to greater investment income in our foreign subsidiaries taxed at U.S. rates. 
Q1 weighted average diluted share count of 308 million shares decreased by approximately 5 million shares sequentially due to share repurchase activity in the quarter. EPS was $0.29, $0.04 over the high end of our prior guidance range driven by higher operating margin and lower diluted share count.
Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed Q1 with $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately 8% of which was held by our domestic entity. Inventory turns decreased to 10 due in part to our factory move, which is now complete. I anticipate inventory turns returning to a normalized mid to high teens level in Q2, and in fact, much of the additional inventory we built up during Q1 has already been shipped.
Q1 day sales outstanding decreased to 30 days due to invoicing occurring earlier in the quarter and an extra week of collections from the 14th week.
Deferred revenue decreased by $131 million in Q1 versus Q4 and decreased $10 million from Q1 last year. We expected the decline, about $40 million of which was due to the 14th week and the remainder commensurate with the decline in product revenue.
Q1 cash from operations was approximately $129 million versus $216 million in Q1 a year ago. At 7% of revenue, free cash flow was down as expected due to lower net income resulting from the year-over-year revenue decline.
We repurchased approximately $430 million of our stock and paid $54 million in cash dividends during the quarter. As you may recall, our Board of Directors authorized $2.5 billion of repurchases by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. Today, we announced our next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on October 21, 2015.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance. As I discussed earlier, fiscal year 2016 is one of transition. We are aggressively focused on our top priorities, rebuilding pipeline and momentum in the first half of the year and executing against our plan to return to our targeted operating model for the second half of the year. We have a strong portfolio of technologies but can do a better job of fully monetizing it. With George at the helm, we are doing a deeper dive to understand our business and market opportunity beyond this fiscal year. You can expect to hear from us on our next quarterly earnings call with a further update on how we expect to evolve the business to deliver greater value to customers and shareholders.
For fiscal 2016, we now expect revenue to be down about 5% with impact from FX headwinds and limited top line predictability in the first half of the year easing in the second half. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, we expect fiscal 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about 1 point from fiscal 2015. We expect operating margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about 2 points for the year with a challenging first half and a return to our 18% to 20% target operating margin range for the second half. Although off to a slow start in the first quarter, we expect a year of continued cash flow generation with free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for the year in the mid-teen.
Finally, we remain committed to driving shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends. Based on current stock prices, we expect to reduce share count in fiscal 2016 by approximately 5%. And between dividends and share repurchases, we will again return over 100% of free cash flow generated to shareholders in fiscal 2016.
For Q2, we expect continued FX headwinds and limited top line predictability as we rebuild pipeline and momentum. As such, we expect net revenues for Q2 to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which at the midpoint implies a sequential increase of approximately 9% and a 6% decrease year-over-year. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5%, and operating margins of approximately 14% to 15%. Based on our share repurchases in Q1 and in the first 10 days of Q2, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 303 million shares and earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.55 to $0.60 per share.
In summary, we are confident in our differentiated strategy for data management in hybrid cloud. We are shifting our investments and efforts to accelerate growth in the areas of our portfolio that address our customers' most pressing IT imperatives. FY '16 is a year of transition as we rebuild our pipeline, help customers through their IT transition and return the business to our targeted operating model. The positive feedback we've received from customers and partners reinforce our confidence and our direction.
Last but not least, I am excited about the change that George brings as the CEO of NetApp. I believe his focus on portfolio management, execution and shareholder value, combined with his perspective and frank assessment of the entirety of our business, will yield positive results for partners, customers and shareholders.

So you're seeing that FX really hitting the product side of the fence versus the deferred side of the fence. In addition to that, it's a combination of volume and mix that you would expect given the rebuild of the pipeline and some discounting. So we talked about discounting last quarter. We talked about, again, discounting this quarter. I indicated that I would talk about that to the degree that it changes on a year-over-year basis. So you can imagine with a lower pipeline and the need to rebuild, those are the types of things we have to work through. Over the course of the year, in terms of product gross margin, we're going to expect that FX certainly stayed in the back half of the year. But we shouldn't have -- assuming there is not another dramatic change out there, we shouldn't have the type of compares we had. So we'll be back to the typical, which is looking at the mix of business. We'll be looking at the combination of pricing, discounting and savings out of the supply chain to really look at the gross margins there. So that's probably the good perspective for you."

Is it a dramatic shift of product revenue from the second quarter, let's say, to the third or the fourth? I wouldn't call it a dramatic shift. Certainly, the first quarter was impaired, and we knew that coming into the first quarter. The maintenance streams of the company, we can look at those year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, and that's reflective of that installed base. The installed base, as we indicated, continues to grow. It's a combination of new, renewal and that -- we see that -- sometimes we see that in short term. Sometimes we see that in longer-term thesis. So is there a dramatic shift from the second quarter to the second half of the year? I wouldn't say it's a dramatic shift. Obviously, we expect some uptick in terms of product revenue. We will no longer hopefully have the FX pressure on product revenue. But certainly, Q1 was a low point, and Q1 was reflective of what happened to the pipeline, and Q1 is really the area where we're going to be the lowest."

But really, the $40 million of the 14th week was in software and was in the service revenue line. So it's all there, and in fact, you can see it on the deferred revenue side of the fence. So deferred revenue was down pretty substantially in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, and we haven't seen that kind of decline, really, in quite some time. If you take $40 million out of that, which is the deferred component, you get back to a number that we're not thrilled about, but that's a lot closer to those types of sequential decline we've seen before. So what we expect to happen is obviously, that 14th week doesn't occur again in Q2. We go back to a 13th week. We won't talk about 14th week again for 6 more years from now. So we're going to look at those pieces. It obviously means that the amount of revenue of 40 was shared between software and hardware, and the share was 18 and 25, respectively.

On the product revenue side -- and I think the real question is what's going to happen with product revenue. On a sequential basis, expected a pretty reasonable increase in product revenue. Why is that? That is because by the time we came to the end of Q4, we did not have a pipeline on the product revenue side of the fence and we had to rebuild that pipeline. What we're seeing and what we're doing as we build up the guidance for Q2 is that we're going to see some return on the product revenue side, and that's reflected in the guidance that we pulled out there.

Our Q2 fiscal year '16 financial results were generally as expected. We continue to make progress as we pivot towards growing parts of the market, scale out, software-defined flash, converged and hybrid cloud. Our key investment areas of sales capacity, channel traction and acceleration of the transition of our installed base to clustered Data ONTAP continue to show early results. Our focus remains on enabling our customers' success as they navigate their IT transformations to leverage modern architectures and deploy hybrid cloud solutions. Over the course of our second quarter, I continue to rigorously analyze our business. I traveled around the world and participated in our Insight user conference, 
 with thousands of customers and partners. The feedback I heard was overwhelmingly positive and reaffirmed my conviction that our data fabric strategy resonates with and is aligned to our customer's strategic technical direction underpinning our confidence in the opportunity ahead. We've made progress, but we still have more work to do to become more efficient and agile, so that we can best take advantage of our long-term growth opportunities. An increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shift in the market and an aggressive pricing environment have a slightly tempered our fiscal year 2016 outlook. By coupling the strength of our data fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers with a more efficient and agile business, we can generate value for customers, partners, employees and shareholders over time. I have tremendous confidence in our opportunity for success. 
That said, parts of our business are working well, some parts need improvement, and other parts we must manage through declines. The IT spending environment continues to be constrained, and the expectation for growth of the overall storage market has decreased to low single digits. At the same time, customers are seeking to take advantage of new applications and modern data center storage and data management architectures. Based on our analysis, this has resulted in the traditional standalone hybrid storage market declining at approximately 9%, while at the same time, the parts of the market address by our scale-out, software-defined, flash converged and hybrid cloud solutions are growing at a rate of roughly 20%. 
Highly disciplined portfolio management is required to address the different growth rates of our markets. We must be more efficient in the parts of our business that aren't growing in order to generate sufficient profits that can be returned to shareholders and leveraged for investment in areas of growth to deliver innovation ahead of the market. We have already sized our investments in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode commensurate with opportunity. And I've recently consolidated all of our hardware platform engineering teams into a single group for further efficiency. IT spending will remain under pressure as customers evaluate cloud and modern architectures. We are growing our install base and have made investments in growth areas that are showing results, although they are not yet in enough to offset the decline in our traditional business. 
The decline in standalone hybrid storage most notably impacts our traditional ONTAP 7-Mode business. The 7-Mode storage operating system was shipped on about 30% of FAS units in the quarter, down from roughly 65% a year ago. ONTAP 7-Mode unit shipments were down almost 60% [ph] year-over-year, and Q2 marked the first time that we did not exceed this growth in the 7-Mode installed base. 
As a subset of our customers, the normal hardware refresh cycle has been slowed as they plan for the move to clustered ONTAP. We've continued to work to smooth this transition to our customers, and at our Insight user conference last month, we announced support for ONTAP 7-Mode through 2020. Customers are also slowing investment in the capacity expansion of their traditional 7-Mode storage environments. The dynamics of our 7-Mode and OEM businesses continue to put downward pressure on product revenue despite strong growth in other parts of our business. 
As a part of their IT modernization efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for efficient management of data growth and cloud service provider-like flexibility. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless data management across the flash, disk and cloud footprints for enterprise applications like databases, virtualization and e-commerce. The software-defined architecture of clustered ONTAP provides a consistent way to manage data across public and private clouds regardless of underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on approximately 70% of FAS systems shipped in Q2, up from 35% a year ago. And unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems grew over 95% year-over-year, demonstrating continued strong customer demand. 
At the beginning of the fiscal year, we created a set of clustered ONTAP transition programs to accelerate the migration of installed base customers, who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. These programs offer customers and certified partners transition support, temporary gear and financial incentives. We saw strong uptick in Q2, almost all of which was done with the tremendous support of our channel partners. While these programs have migration-ready customers move, migrations themselves are projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers. The low growth of overall IT spending has an impact on the pace of migration. As we have stated before, we anticipate that the transition of the installed base will happen over the course of years. [ph] The clustered ONTAP installed base continues to grow and now represents 17% of total installed FAS systems and almost 30% of installed FAS capacity. The number of customers who purchased clustered ONTAP systems in Q2 grew by 85% from Q2 last year. And in that same period, the number of new-to-NetApp customers who purchased clustered ONTAP in Q2 grew by 95%. 
Customers are deploying high-performance flash technology to gain advantages from accelerating business transactions, processes and their supporting enterprise applications. Our all-flash FAS products offer enterprise-grade flash technology, combining built-in data protection, multiprotocol support, scale-out performance and seamless data movement from flash to disk to cloud. After introducing Flash Essentials with optimized read performance, in-line compression and in-line zero-based duplication in Q1, we improved both the list price and form factor for our all-flash FAS by 40% as well as announced a controller upgrade program, a 7-year extended warranty and a 3x performance guaranty. These enhancements garnered positive feedback in the channel and drove rapid adoption of our all-flash FAS products, with unit shipments accelerating 445% year-over-year, the sixth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. To meet the requirements of ultrahigh performance, low-latency applications, customers opt for our ES products. Units of the ES series grew 65% from Q2 a year ago. 
In order to achieve the performance, availability and cost requirements of new webscale and analytic applications like Hadoop and Splunk, and the increase in the amount of data retail online for business insight and cyber security, customers are deploying our E-Series platform. For customers who are increasing their cyber security defenses with real-time analysis, the E-Series' capability to store hot and cold data under the same data management architecture substantially improves the efficiency and flexibility of their environments. We are aggressively targeting this part of the market and continue to see growth of the E-Series with unit shipments up over 20% from Q2 last year. 
Our hybrid cloud solutions comprised NetApp Private Storage for cloud, Cloud ONTAP, StorageGRID Webscale and AltaVault. While these solutions do not contribute materially to revenue today, they are important in positioning us for leading-edge hybrid cloud deployments. A large European manufacturing company chose NetApp for our cloud integration coupled with converged and all-flash solutions and the ability to manage it all under a single framework and clustered ONTAP. Similarly, we had wins at a global law firm, a large global security vendor, a U.S.-based software management company and many others, because of our ability to deliver highly competitive storage solutions and have a broader strategic discussion encompassing cloud-ready integration and enablement with the world's leading cloud service providers. This is the power of the data fabric at work. 
For customers looking for pre-integrated converged solutions, NetApp offers FlexPod in conjunction with Cisco. NetApp and Cisco introduced flex pod 5 years ago and have generated $5.6 billion in shared revenue, delivered by more than 1,100 partners to more than 6,300 customers worldwide. In Q2, we announced a Cisco-validated design for all-flash FAS FlexPod with Cisco's application-centric infrastructure ACI. You will continue to see exciting innovations from our strong partnership with Cisco. 
Our customers are transforming themselves using digital technology, connected with pervasive broadband networks and cloud computing to improve the efficiency of their businesses, build global business systems and better serve their customers. Data is at the heart of that transformation. At the same time, they are scrutinizing the value that they have gained from past investments in IT, reducing IT budgets and rethinking how they consume IT. This evaluation is creating caution on traditional storage system transactional spending and is diverting spending towards transformational projects and modern architectures like scale-out, software-defined, flash-converged and hybrid cloud, where our data fabric strategy gives us an advantage over the competition. NetApp is the only company that can help customers manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures and provide the scale and modern architectures needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital era. 
NetApp is changing to position the company for long-term growth. We expect to gain share in the traditional part of the market, but that alone won't be sufficient to overcome the decline of that market and drive overall growth for NetApp. We will continue our pivot towards modern architectures such as scale-out, software-defined, flash-converged and hybrid cloud. The growth in this part of our business is strong and encouraging. Customer and partner feedback drives strong conviction that our industry-leading portfolio and differentiated data fabric strategy will expand our opportunity and drive long-term growth. However, this transition will take time as the growth is coming off a smaller base than our traditional ONTAP 7-Mode footprint. We are investing to accelerate growth and are taking action on the cost structure of the business to ensure value creation for customers and shareholders through the duration of this transition. In fact, we're conducting a fundamental assessment of every aspect of our business, structure, portfolio and process to reduce complexity and drive efficiency, while improving our velocity and investing for long-term growth. This will require making some important decisions about topics crucial to our business, from our product portfolio to our go-to-market approach and our supporting functions. We must both invest for the long-term growth of our business and preserve our current growth initiatives that are showing early results, while streamlining and improving the efficiency of our business. We will lower the cost structure of the company, but we'll not take actions that improve our short-term results at the expense of our long-term strength. There is growth to be had in this industry, and we believe we have the right strategy and technology to capture that growth in the long-term and deliver increased shareholder value over time. NetApp has the innovation, scale and open ecosystem needed to solve the data management challenges for the enterprise. The changes to larger players in the market create opportunity for us. NetApp is the only company able to spend flash to disk to cloud and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on-premises today. Many elements of our portfolio are growing strongly and we need to capitalize on them by maintaining our sales capacity, continuing our channel efforts to make it easier for our installed base to migrate to clustered ONTAP. Customer wins and partner feedback indicated they are the right path. We have a portfolio of differentiated IT and a growing installed base. We are delivering tremendous value to customers in their strategic IT transformations. It is critical that we build a stronger, more efficient company that solves customer challenges while delivering profitability and earnings growth in a moderated IT spending and storage market. You can expect tangible results from this process over the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond. 
Before turning the call over to Nick, I'd like to thank the entire NetApp team for their hard work and dedication as we evolve our great company for future growth and sustained success. And I would like to extend this special thank you to Rob Simon, President, who after 22 years, announced his intent to retire from NetApp at the end of the fiscal year. We appreciate all he's done for the company and his work to ensure a smooth transition. 
I will now turn it over to Nick."

Before we get started, as a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's discussion unless otherwise indicated. Overall, we are pleased with our Q2 financial results and the progress we are",1199,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get started, as a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's discussion unless otherwise indicated. Overall, we are pleased with our Q2 financial results and the progress we are making related to our key investments in sales capacity, in the channel and in accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP. 
Starting with revenues. Net revenues for the second quarter were $1.45 billion, up about 8% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year comparison by about 4 points. As George indicated, the overall IT spending environment is pressured. This, coupled with the uncertain macroeconomic environment, has affected us in different ways across our geographies. For example, our U.S. Public Sector business declined 22% year-over-year in Q2, while at the same time, excluding impact from foreign exchange, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were up 8% and 3% year-over-year, respectively. 
Product revenue of $815 million was up 23% sequentially, in line with expectations, but was down 12% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects favorable clustered ONTAP momentum, which was more than offset by about 5 points of FX headwinds and declines in ONTAP 7-Mode revenue, which we expected,that as well as OEM revenue due to the changing business dynamics of our OEM customers. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues primarily derived from existing new and renewed service contracts, was up 3% year-over-year, but down 6% sequentially, reflecting the return to a 13-week quarter. As a reminder, we had an extra week in Q1, which resulted in about a $40 [ph] million increase to Q1 maintenance revenue. Indirect revenue accounted for 77% of net revenues similar to Q1. 
Gross margin of 62.5% was down about 2.5 points year-over-year and about 0.5 points below our prior guidance range. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact of about 1 point year-over-year. Product gross margin of 51.8% was up about 0.5 points sequentially and was down about 6.5 points year-over-year, driven by about 2.5 points of FX and roughly equal impacts from higher discounting and unfavorable product mix. On a year-over-year basis, software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up 2 points, reflecting a favorable mix shift towards hardware maintenance as well as infrastructure cost efficiencies. 
Q2 operating expenses totaled $684 million and were down 8% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflects a combination of a return to a 13-week quarter and prudent expense management. Operating margin for the second quarter of 15.2% was 7.5 points higher than last quarter and was just above our previous guidance range. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17% as expected. Weighted average diluted share count of 296 [ph] million shares decreased by approximately 12 million shares sequentially and 8% year-over-year due to share repurchase activity. 
Q2 EPS of $0.61 was $0.01 above the high end of our prior guidance range. 
Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed Q2 with $4.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, 14% of which was held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue decreased by $20 million in Q2 versus Q1 and was flat year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 17, [ph] in line with our expectations and days sales outstanding normalized to 37 days from 30 days in Q1, reflecting the return to a 13-week quarter. 
Q2 cash flow from operations was approximately $145 million versus $381 million in Q2 a year ago. Free cash flow of $99 million was about 7% of net revenues, down substantially from Q2 a year ago due to lower net income and a return to normal levels of DSL and accrued compensation, net of improved inventory turns related to the 14th week in Q1. 
Finally, we repurchased approximately $183 million of stock and paid $53 [ph] million in cash dividends during the quarter. Consistent with our previous guidance, we remain on track to complete our share repurchase program by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion [ph] of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. 
Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on January 20, 2016. 
Now turning to our business outlook. We remain confident in our strategy and long-term growth potential. As I discussed last quarter, fiscal year 2016 is one of transition. We are realizing results from our investments in sales capacity, actions to regain traction in the channel and programs to accelerate the migration to clustered ONTAP. Coming into the year, we anticipated that top line predictability would improve in the back half, but the uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shift in our market and aggressive pricing environment, have resulted in continued limited visibility. While we have made progress in rebuilding our pipeline, these factors have slightly tempered our outlook. As a result, we expect revenue for fiscal 2016 to be down just over 5%. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth in our continued actions to drive down cost, given the environment, we now estimate fiscal 2016 gross margin to be down 1 to 2 points from fiscal 2015 and operating margin to be down about 2 points for the year. We expect second half operating margin of approximately 18%, the low end of our target operating margin range. Although off to a slow start in the first half, we expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for the second half of the year to be in the mid-teens. 
Finally, we expect to reduce share count in fiscal 2016 by approximately 6%. And between dividends and share repurchases, we will again return over 100% of free cash flow generated in the fiscal year to shareholders. 
As George discussed, we are assessing every aspect of our business to drive efficiency and velocity. We will lower our cost structure, including cost reduction actions, in the second half of fiscal 2016. We will drive greater efficiency across the business, and at the same time, make investments in growth areas leading to increased profitability, longer-term growth and increased shareholder value. For Q3, 
we expect net revenues to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which at the midpoint, implies flat revenues versus Q2 and a 7% decrease year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margin of approximately 61.5% [ph] and operating margin of approximately 17%. Based on our share repurchases in Q2 and in the first 10 days of Q3, we expect our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 297 million shares and earnings per share for Q3 to range from approximately $0.66 to $0.71 per share. 
In summary, we are confident opportunity ahead of us. Customer wins and feedback from partners indicate that our data fabric strategy is differentiated and well-aligned with their most critical IT imperatives. We must improve our efficiency and agility to take full advantage of those opportunities and to set NetApp on a path for increased profitability, long-term growth and increased shareholder value.

So certainly, if you look at the gross margins and specifically tease product gross margins for the quarter, on a year-over-year basis, we have a 2.5-point impact alone from foreign exchange. We don't expect that type of thing and, in fact, that will start to mitigate as we get certainly to Q4. We do have higher discounting. I made that clear. Last quarter and actually in Q4, I talked about higher discounting. It's about 2-points impact on a year-over-year basis to product gross margin this quarter. That we have to work through. That is the aggressive pricing actions going on in the industry right now. We have to work it. That said, over time, we've shown that we can move margins year and, in fact, over several years, we did exactly that. Finally, I would say that on the services side of our business, the team has done a really good job in terms of leveraging the cost base and services vendor must install base of customers that we have. So I think it's a combination of items. Certainly, the aggressive pricing environment is something that we have to be reflective of. The portfolio is something we spent a lot of time working on and thinking about and the uptake of clustered ONTAP with customers and those actions on the hybrid cloud portfolio over time, we expect to benefit the margins of the company."

In the long term, the absence of a compelling story around the IT architecture of the future will make their customer value proposition something that we can debate and capitalize on.

So the linearity, I think, is pretty normal in terms of overall what has happened year-on-year.

Our Q2 fiscal year '16 financial results were generally as expected. We continue to make progress as we pivot towards growing parts of the market, scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud.
Our key investment areas of sales capacity, channel traction and acceleration of the transition of our installed base to Clustered Data ONTAP continue to show early results. Our focus remains on enabling our customers' success as they navigate their IT transformations to leverage modern architectures and deploy hybrid cloud solutions. 
Over the course of our second quarter, I continue to rigorously analyze our business. I traveled around the world and participated in our Insight user conference, meeting with thousands of customers and partners. The feedback I heard was overwhelmingly positive and reaffirmed my conviction that our Data Fabric strategy resonates with and is aligned to our customers' strategic technical direction, underpinning our confidence in the opportunity ahead. We've made progress, but we still have more work to do to become more efficient and agile so that we can best take advantage of our long-term growth opportunities.
An increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in the market and an aggressive pricing environment have a slightly tempered our fiscal year 2016 outlook. By coupling the strength of our Data Fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers with a more efficient and agile business, we can generate value for customers, partners, employees and shareholders over time. I have tremendous confidence in our opportunity for success.
That said, parts of our business are working well. Some parts need improvement, and other parts we must manage through declines. The IT spending environment continues to be constrained, and the expectation for growth of the overall storage market has decreased to low single digits. At the same time, customers are seeking to take advantage of new applications and modern data center storage and data management architectures. Based on our analysis, this has resulted in the traditional standalone hybrid storage market declining at approximately 9%, while at the same time, the parts of the market addressed by our scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud solutions are growing at a rate of roughly 20%.
Highly disciplined portfolio management is required to address the different growth rates of our markets. We must be more efficient in the parts of our business that aren't growing in order to generate sufficient profits that can be returned to shareholders and leveraged for investment in areas of growth to deliver innovation ahead of the market. We have already sized our investments in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode commensurate with opportunity. And I've recently consolidated all of our hardware platform engineering teams into a single group for further efficiency. IT spending will remain under pressure as customers evaluate cloud and modern architectures. We are growing our installed base and have made investments in growth areas that are showing results, although they are not yet in enough to offset the decline in our traditional business.
The decline in standalone hybrid storage most notably impacts our traditional ONTAP 7-Mode business. The 7-Mode storage operating system was shipped on about 30% of FAS units in the quarter, down from roughly 65% a year ago. ONTAP 7-Mode unit shipments were down almost 60% year-over-year, and Q2 marked the first time that we did not experience growth in the 7-Mode installed base.
At a subset of our customers, the normal hardware refresh cycle has been slowed as they plan for the move to clustered ONTAP. We've continued to work to smooth this transition to our customers, and at our Insight user conference last month, we announced support for ONTAP 7-Mode through 2020. Customers are also slowing investment in the capacity expansion of their traditional 7-Mode storage environments. The dynamics of our 7-Mode and OEM businesses continue to put downward pressure on product revenue despite strong growth in other parts of our business.
As a part of their IT modernization efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for efficient management of data growth and cloud service provider-like flexibility. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless data management across flash, disk and cloud footprints for enterprise applications like databases, virtualization and e-commerce. The software-defined architecture of clustered ONTAP provides a consistent way to manage data across public and private clouds regardless of underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on approximately 70% of FAS systems shipped in Q2, up from 35% a year ago. And unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems grew over 95% year-over-year, demonstrating continued strong customer demand.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, we created a set of clustered ONTAP transition programs to accelerate the migration of installed base customers who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. These programs offer customers and certified partners transition support, temporary gear and financial incentives. We saw strong uptake in Q2, almost all of which was done with the tremendous support of our channel partners. While these programs have migration-ready customers move, migrations themselves are projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers. The low growth of overall IT spending has an impact on the pace of migration. As we have stated before, we anticipate that the transition of the installed base will happen over the course of years.
The clustered ONTAP installed base continues to grow and now represents 17% of total installed FAS systems and almost 30% of installed FAS capacity. The number of customers who purchased clustered ONTAP systems in Q2 grew by 85% from Q2 last year. And in that same period, the number of new-to-NetApp customers who purchased clustered ONTAP in Q2 grew by 95%.
Customers are deploying high-performance flash technology to gain advantages from accelerating business transactions, processes and their supporting enterprise applications. Our all-flash FAS products offer enterprise-grade flash technology, combining built-in data protection, multiprotocol support, scale-out performance and seamless data movement from flash to disk to cloud. After introducing Flash Essentials with optimized read performance, in-line compression and in-line 0-based de-duplication in Q1, we improved both the list price and form factor for our all-flash FAS by 40% as well as announced a controller upgrade program, a 7-year extended warranty and a 3x performance guarantee. These enhancements garnered positive feedback in the channel and drove rapid adoption of our all-flash FAS products, with unit shipments accelerating 445% year-over-year, the sixth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. To meet the requirements of ultrahigh performance, low-latency applications, customers opt for our EF products. Units of the EF-Series grew 65% from Q2 a year ago.
In order to achieve the performance, availability and cost requirements of new webscale and analytic applications like Hadoop and Splunk and the increase in the amount of data retail online for business insight and cyber security, customers are deploying our E-Series platform. For customers who are increasing their cyber security defenses with real-time analysis, the E-Series capability to store hot and cold data under the same data management architecture substantially improves the efficiency and flexibility of their environments. We are aggressively targeting this part of the market and continue to see growth of the E-Series with unit shipments up over 20% from Q2 last year.
Our hybrid cloud solutions comprised NetApp Private Storage for Cloud, Cloud ONTAP, StorageGRID Webscale and AltaVault. While these solutions do not contribute materially to revenue today, they are important in positioning us for leading-edge hybrid cloud deployments. A large European manufacturing company chose NetApp for our cloud integration coupled with converged and all-flash solutions and the ability to manage it all under a single framework in clustered ONTAP. Similarly, we had wins at a global law firm, a large global security vendor, a U.S.-based software management company and many others because of our ability to deliver highly competitive storage solutions and have a broader strategic discussion encompassing cloud-ready integration and enablement with the world's leading cloud service providers. This is the power of the Data Fabric at work.
For customers looking for pre-integrated converged solutions, NetApp offers FlexPod in conjunction with Cisco. NetApp and Cisco introduced FlexPod 5 years ago and have generated $5.6 billion in shared revenue, delivered by more than 1,100 partners to more than 6,300 customers worldwide. In Q2, we announced a Cisco-validated design for all-flash FAS FlexPod with Cisco's application-centric infrastructure ACI. You will continue to see exciting innovations from our strong partnership with Cisco.
Our customers are transforming themselves using digital technology connected with pervasive broadband networks and cloud computing to improve the efficiency of their businesses, build global business systems and better serve their customers. Data is at the heart of that transformation. At the same time, they are scrutinizing the value that they have gained from past investments in IT, reducing IT budgets and rethinking how they consume IT. This evaluation is creating caution on traditional storage system transactional spending and is diverting spending towards transformational projects and modern architectures like scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud where our Data Fabric strategy gives us an advantage over the competition. NetApp is the only company that can help customers manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures and provide the scale and modern architectures needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital era.
NetApp is changing to position the company for long-term growth. We expect to gain share in the traditional part of the market, but that alone won't be sufficient to overcome the decline of that market and drive overall growth for NetApp. We will continue our pivot towards modern architectures such as scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud. The growth in this part of our business is strong and encouraging. Customer and partner feedback drives strong conviction that our industry-leading portfolio and differentiated Data Fabric strategy will expand our opportunity and drive long-term growth. However, this transition will take time as the growth is coming off a smaller base than our traditional ONTAP 7-Mode footprint.
We are investing to accelerate growth and are taking action on the cost structure of the business to ensure value creation for customers and shareholders through the duration of this transition. In fact, we're conducting a fundamental assessment of every aspect of our business, structure, portfolio and process to reduce complexity and drive efficiency while improving our velocity and investing for long-term growth. This will require making some important decisions about topics crucial to our business, from our product portfolio to our go-to-market approach and our supporting functions. We must both invest for the long-term growth of our business and preserve our current growth initiatives that are showing early results while streamlining and improving the efficiency of our business. We will lower the cost structure of the company, but we'll not take actions that improve our short-term results at the expense of our long-term strength. There is growth to be had in this industry, and we believe we have the right strategy and technology to capture that growth in the long term and deliver increased shareholder value over time.
NetApp has the innovation, scale and open ecosystem needed to solve the data management challenges for the enterprise. The changes to larger players in the market create opportunity for us. NetApp is the only company able to spend flash to disk to cloud and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on-premises today. Many elements of our portfolio are growing strongly, and we need to capitalize on them by maintaining our sales capacity, continuing our channel efforts and making it easier for our installed base to migrate to clustered ONTAP. 
Customer wins and partner feedback indicate that they are on the right path. We have a portfolio of differentiated IT and a growing installed base. We are delivering tremendous value to customers in their strategic IT transformations. It is critical that we build a stronger, more efficient company that solves customer challenges while delivering profitability and earnings growth in a moderated IT spending and storage market. You can expect tangible results from this process over the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond.
Before turning the call over to Nick, I'd like to thank the entire NetApp team for their hard work and dedication as we evolve our great company for future growth and sustained success. And I would like to extend this special thank you to Rob Salmon, President, who after 22 years, announced his intent to retire from NetApp at the end of the fiscal year. We appreciate all he's done for the company and his work to ensure a smooth transition.
I'll now turn it over to Nick."

Before we get started, as a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's discussion unless otherwise indicated. Overall, we are pleased with our Q2 financial results and the progress we are",1198,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get started, as a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's discussion unless otherwise indicated. Overall, we are pleased with our Q2 financial results and the progress we are making related to our key investments in sales capacity, in the channel and in accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP.
Starting with revenues. Net revenues for the second quarter were $1.45 billion, up about 8% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year comparison by about 4 points. As George indicated, the overall IT spending environment is pressured. This, coupled with the uncertain macroeconomic environment, has affected us in different ways across our geographies. For example, our U.S. Public Sector business declined 22% year-over-year in Q2, while at the same time, excluding impacts from foreign exchange, EMEA and Asia Pacific were up 8% and 3% year-over-year, respectively.
Product revenue of $815 million was up 23% sequentially, in line with expectations but was down 12% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects favorable clustered ONTAP momentum, which was more than offset by about 5 points of FX headwinds and declines in ONTAP 7-Mode revenue, which we expected, as well as OEM revenue due to the changing business dynamics of our OEM customers. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues primarily derived from existing, new and renewed service contracts was up 3% year-over-year but down 6% sequentially, reflecting the return to a 13-week quarter. As a reminder, we had an extra week in Q1, which resulted in about a $40 million increase to Q1 maintenance revenue. Indirect revenue accounted for 77% of net revenues similar to Q1.
Gross margin of 62.5% was down about 2.5 points year-over-year and about 0.5 points below our prior guidance range. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact of about 1 point year-over-year. Product gross margin of 51.8% was up about 0.5 points sequentially and was down about 6.5 points year-over-year driven by about 2.5 points of FX and roughly equal impacts from higher discounting and unfavorable product mix. On a year-over-year basis, software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up 2 points, reflecting a favorable mix shift towards hardware maintenance as well as infrastructure cost efficiencies.
Q2 operating expenses totaled $684 million and were down 8% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflects a combination of a return to a 13-week quarter and prudent expense management. Operating margin for the second quarter of 15.2% was 7.5 points higher than last quarter and was just above our previous guidance range.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17%, as expected. Weighted average diluted share count of 296 million shares decreased by approximately 12 million shares sequentially and 8% year-over-year due to share repurchase activity. Q2 EPS of $0.61 was $0.01 above the high end of our prior guidance range.
Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed Q2 with $4.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, 14% of which was held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue decreased by $20 million in Q2 versus Q1 and was flat year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 17, in line with our expectations. And days sales outstanding normalized to 37 days from 30 days in Q1, reflecting the return to a 13-week quarter.
Q2 cash flow from operations was approximately $145 million versus $381 million in Q2 a year ago. Free cash flow of $99 million was about 7% of net revenues, down substantially from Q2 a year ago due to lower net income and a return to normal levels of DSO and accrued compensation net of improved inventory turns related to the 14th week in Q1.
Finally, we repurchased approximately $183 million of stock and paid $53 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Consistent with our previous guidance, we remain on track to complete our share repurchase program by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on January 20, 2016.
Now turning to our business outlook. We remain confident in our strategy and long-term growth potential. As I discussed last quarter, fiscal year 2016 is one of transition. We are realizing results from our investments in sales capacity, actions to regain traction in the channel and programs to accelerate the migration to clustered ONTAP. Coming into the year, we anticipated that top line predictability would improve in the back half, but the uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in our market and an aggressive pricing environment have resulted in continued limited visibility. While we have made progress in rebuilding our pipeline, these factors have slightly tempered our outlook.
As a result, we expect revenue for fiscal 2016 to be down just over 5%. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, given the environment, we now estimate fiscal 2016 gross margin to be down 1 to 2 points from fiscal 2015 and operating margin to be down about 2 points for the year. We expect second half operating margin of approximately 18%, the low end of our target operating margin range. Although off to a slow start in the first half, we expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for the second half of the year to be in the mid-teens. 
Finally, we expect to reduce share count in fiscal 2016 by approximately 6%. And between dividends and share repurchases, we will again return over 100% of free cash flow generated in the fiscal year to shareholders.
As George discussed, we are assessing every aspect of our business to drive efficiency and velocity. We will lower our cost structure, including cost reduction actions in the second half of fiscal 2016. We will drive greater efficiency across the business, and at the same time, make investments in growth areas leading to increased profitability, longer-term growth and increased shareholder value.
For Q3, we expect net revenues to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which at the midpoint implies flat revenues versus Q2 and a 7% decrease year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margin of approximately 61.5% and operating margin of approximately 17%. Based on our share repurchases in Q2 and in the first 10 days of Q3, we expect our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 297 million shares and earnings per share for Q3 to range from approximately $0.66 to $0.71 per share.
In summary, we are confident in the opportunity ahead of us. Customer wins and feedback from partners indicate that our Data Fabric strategy is differentiated and well aligned with their most critical IT imperatives. We must improve our efficiency and agility to take full advantage of those opportunities and to set NetApp on a path for increased profitability, long-term growth and increased shareholder value.

And what I mean by that is efficiency around all aspects of our business, structure, portfolio, business process, so that customers find it easier to do business with us as well as partners. In terms of velocity, we feel that having accomplished the efficiency aspects of the program, we will be able to transition our business more quickly in response to changing market landscapes. We'll just be a leaner, more efficient company that can be more agile in response to the changing market environment. You will hear more from me over the next -- over the second half of this fiscal year and over the next few quarters beyond that as we go through the program. Stay tuned. It is a fundamental reassessment of all aspects of our company."

The second point would be that as we look at the second half, our view is that we're going to be the mid-teens in terms of cash flow as a percentage of revenue in the second half.

Last quarter and actually in Q4, I talked about higher discounting. It's about 2 points impact on a year-over-year basis to product gross margin this quarter. That we have to work through. That is the aggressive pricing actions going on in the industry right now. We have to work it. That said, over time, we've shown that we can move margins here, and in fact, over several years, we did exactly that. Finally, I would say that on the services side of our business, the team has done a really good job in terms of leveraging the cost base and servicing the enormous installed base of customers that we have. So I think it's a combination of items. Certainly, the aggressive pricing environment is something that we have to be reflective of.

Our Q2 fiscal year '16 financial results were generally as expected. We continue to make progress as we pivot towards growing parts of the market, scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud.
Our key investment areas of sales capacity, channel traction and acceleration of the transition of our installed base to Clustered Data ONTAP continue to show early results. Our focus remains on enabling our customers' success as they navigate their IT transformations to leverage modern architectures and deploy hybrid cloud solutions. 
Over the course of our second quarter, I continue to rigorously analyze our business. I traveled around the world and participated in our Insight user conference, meeting with thousands of customers and partners. The feedback I heard was overwhelmingly positive and reaffirmed my conviction that our Data Fabric strategy resonates with and is aligned to our customers' strategic technical direction, underpinning our confidence in the opportunity ahead. We've made progress, but we still have more work to do to become more efficient and agile so that we can best take advantage of our long-term growth opportunities.
An increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in the market and an aggressive pricing environment have a slightly tempered our fiscal year 2016 outlook. By coupling the strength of our Data Fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers with a more efficient and agile business, we can generate value for customers, partners, employees and shareholders over time. I have tremendous confidence in our opportunity for success.
That said, parts of our business are working well. Some parts need improvement, and other parts we must manage through declines. The IT spending environment continues to be constrained, and the expectation for growth of the overall storage market has decreased to low single digits. At the same time, customers are seeking to take advantage of new applications and modern data center storage and data management architectures. Based on our analysis, this has resulted in the traditional standalone hybrid storage market declining at approximately 9%, while at the same time, the parts of the market addressed by our scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud solutions are growing at a rate of roughly 20%.
Highly disciplined portfolio management is required to address the different growth rates of our markets. We must be more efficient in the parts of our business that aren't growing in order to generate sufficient profits that can be returned to shareholders and leveraged for investment in areas of growth to deliver innovation ahead of the market. We have already sized our investments in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode commensurate with opportunity. And I've recently consolidated all of our hardware platform engineering teams into a single group for further efficiency. IT spending will remain under pressure as customers evaluate cloud and modern architectures. We are growing our installed base and have made investments in growth areas that are showing results, although they are not yet in enough to offset the decline in our traditional business.
The decline in standalone hybrid storage most notably impacts our traditional ONTAP 7-Mode business. The 7-Mode storage operating system was shipped on about 30% of FAS units in the quarter, down from roughly 65% a year ago. ONTAP 7-Mode unit shipments were down almost 60% year-over-year, and Q2 marked the first time that we did not experience growth in the 7-Mode installed base.
At a subset of our customers, the normal hardware refresh cycle has been slowed as they plan for the move to clustered ONTAP. We've continued to work to smooth this transition to our customers, and at our Insight user conference last month, we announced support for ONTAP 7-Mode through 2020. Customers are also slowing investment in the capacity expansion of their traditional 7-Mode storage environments. The dynamics of our 7-Mode and OEM businesses continue to put downward pressure on product revenue despite strong growth in other parts of our business.
As a part of their IT modernization efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for efficient management of data growth and cloud service provider-like flexibility. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless data management across flash, disk and cloud footprints for enterprise applications like databases, virtualization and e-commerce. The software-defined architecture of clustered ONTAP provides a consistent way to manage data across public and private clouds regardless of underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on approximately 70% of FAS systems shipped in Q2, up from 35% a year ago. And unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems grew over 95% year-over-year, demonstrating continued strong customer demand.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, we created a set of clustered ONTAP transition programs to accelerate the migration of installed base customers who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. These programs offer customers and certified partners transition support, temporary gear and financial incentives. We saw strong uptake in Q2, almost all of which was done with the tremendous support of our channel partners. While these programs help migration-ready customers move, migrations themselves are projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers. The low growth of overall IT spending has an impact on the pace of migration. As we have stated before, we anticipate that the transition of the installed base will happen over the course of years.
The clustered ONTAP installed base continues to grow and now represents 17% of total installed FAS systems and almost 30% of installed FAS capacity. The number of customers who purchased clustered ONTAP systems in Q2 grew by 85% from Q2 last year. And in that same period, the number of new-to-NetApp customers who purchased clustered ONTAP in Q2 grew by 95%.
Customers are deploying high-performance flash technology to gain advantages from accelerating business transactions, processes and their supporting enterprise applications. Our all-flash FAS products offer enterprise-grade flash technology, combining built-in data protection, multiprotocol support, scale-out performance and seamless data movement from flash to disk to cloud. After introducing Flash Essentials with optimized read performance, in-line compression and in-line 0-based de-duplication in Q1, we improved both the list price and form factor for our all-flash FAS by 40% as well as announced a controller upgrade program, a 7-year extended warranty and a 3x performance guarantee. These enhancements garnered positive feedback in the channel and drove rapid adoption of our all-flash FAS products, with unit shipments accelerating 445% year-over-year, the sixth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. To meet the requirements of ultrahigh performance, low-latency applications, customers opt for our EF products. Units of the EF-Series grew 65% from Q2 a year ago.
In order to achieve the performance, availability and cost requirements of new webscale and analytic applications like Hadoop and Splunk and the increase in the amount of data retail online for business insight and cyber security, customers are deploying our E-Series platform. For customers who are increasing their cyber security defenses with real-time analysis, the E-Series capability to store hot and cold data under the same data management architecture substantially improves the efficiency and flexibility of their environments. We are aggressively targeting this part of the market and continue to see growth of the E-Series with unit shipments up over 20% from Q2 last year.
Our hybrid cloud solutions comprised NetApp Private Storage for Cloud, Cloud ONTAP, StorageGRID Webscale and AltaVault. While these solutions do not contribute materially to revenue today, they are important in positioning us for leading-edge hybrid cloud deployments. A large European manufacturing company chose NetApp for our cloud integration coupled with converged and all-flash solutions and the ability to manage it all under a single framework in clustered ONTAP. Similarly, we had wins at a global law firm, a large global security vendor, a U.S.-based software management company and many others because of our ability to deliver highly competitive storage solutions and have a broader strategic discussion encompassing cloud-ready integration and enablement with the world's leading cloud service providers. This is the power of the Data Fabric at work.
For customers looking for pre-integrated converged solutions, NetApp offers FlexPod in conjunction with Cisco. NetApp and Cisco introduced FlexPod 5 years ago and have generated $5.6 billion in shared revenue, delivered by more than 1,100 partners to more than 6,300 customers worldwide. In Q2, we announced a Cisco-validated design for all-flash FAS FlexPod with Cisco's application-centric infrastructure ACI. You will continue to see exciting innovations from our strong partnership with Cisco.
Our customers are transforming themselves using digital technology connected with pervasive broadband networks and cloud computing to improve the efficiency of their businesses, build global business systems and better serve their customers. Data is at the heart of that transformation. At the same time, they are scrutinizing the value that they have gained from past investments in IT, reducing IT budgets and rethinking how they consume IT. This evaluation is creating caution on traditional storage system transactional spending and is diverting spending towards transformational projects and modern architectures like scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud where our Data Fabric strategy gives us an advantage over the competition. NetApp is the only company that can help customers manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures and provide the scale and modern architectures needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital era.
NetApp is changing to position the company for long-term growth. We expect to gain share in the traditional part of the market, but that alone won't be sufficient to overcome the decline of that market and drive overall growth for NetApp. We will continue our pivot towards modern architectures such as scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud. The growth in this part of our business is strong and encouraging. Customer and partner feedback drives strong conviction that our industry-leading portfolio and differentiated Data Fabric strategy will expand our opportunity and drive long-term growth. However, this transition will take time as the growth is coming off a smaller base than our traditional ONTAP 7-Mode footprint.
We are investing to accelerate growth and are taking action on the cost structure of the business to ensure value creation for customers and shareholders through the duration of this transition. In fact, we're conducting a fundamental assessment of every aspect of our business, structure, portfolio and process to reduce complexity and drive efficiency while improving our velocity and investing for long-term growth. This will require making some important decisions about topics crucial to our business, from our product portfolio to our go-to-market approach and our supporting functions. We must both invest for the long-term growth of our business and preserve our current growth initiatives that are showing early results while streamlining and improving the efficiency of our business. We will lower the cost structure of the company, but we'll not take actions that improve our short-term results at the expense of our long-term strength. There is growth to be had in this industry, and we believe we have the right strategy and technology to capture that growth in the long term and deliver increased shareholder value over time.
NetApp has the innovation, scale and open ecosystem needed to solve the data management challenges for the enterprise. The changes to larger players in the market create opportunity for us. NetApp is the only company able to span flash to disk to cloud and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on-premises today. Many elements of our portfolio are growing strongly, and we need to capitalize on them by maintaining our sales capacity, continuing our channel efforts and making it easier for our installed base to migrate to clustered ONTAP. 
Customer wins and partner feedback indicate that we are on the right path. We have a portfolio of differentiated IT and a growing installed base. We are delivering tremendous value to customers in their strategic IT transformations. It is critical that we build a stronger, more efficient company that solves customer challenges while delivering profitability and earnings growth in a moderated IT spending and storage market. You can expect tangible results from this process over the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond.
Before turning the call over to Nick, I'd like to thank the entire NetApp team for their hard work and dedication as we evolve our great company for future growth and sustained success. And I would like to extend this special thank you to Rob Salmon, President, who after 22 years, announced his intent to retire from NetApp at the end of the fiscal year. We appreciate all he's done for the company and his work to ensure a smooth transition.
I'll now turn it over to Nick."

Before we get started, as a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's discussion unless otherwise indicated. Overall, we are pleased with our Q2 financial results and the progress we are",1198,"Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get started, as a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's discussion unless otherwise indicated. Overall, we are pleased with our Q2 financial results and the progress we are making related to our key investments in sales capacity, in the channel and in accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP.
Starting with revenues. Net revenues for the second quarter were $1.45 billion, up about 8% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year comparison by about 4 points. As George indicated, the overall IT spending environment is pressured. This, coupled with the uncertain macroeconomic environment, has affected us in different ways across our geographies. For example, our U.S. Public Sector business declined 22% year-over-year in Q2, while at the same time, excluding impacts from foreign exchange, EMEA and Asia Pacific were up 8% and 3% year-over-year, respectively.
Product revenue of $815 million was up 23% sequentially, in line with expectations but was down 12% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects favorable clustered ONTAP momentum, which was more than offset by about 5 points of FX headwinds and declines in ONTAP 7-Mode revenue, which we expected, as well as OEM revenue due to the changing business dynamics of our OEM customers. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues primarily derived from existing, new and renewed service contracts was up 3% year-over-year but down 6% sequentially, reflecting the return to a 13-week quarter. As a reminder, we had an extra week in Q1, which resulted in about a $40 million increase to Q1 maintenance revenue. Indirect revenue accounted for 77% of net revenues similar to Q1.
Gross margin of 62.5% was down about 2.5 points year-over-year and about 0.5 points below our prior guidance range. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact of about 1 point year-over-year. Product gross margin of 51.8% was up about 0.5 points sequentially and was down about 6.5 points year-over-year driven by about 2.5 points of FX and roughly equal impacts from higher discounting and unfavorable product mix. On a year-over-year basis, software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up 2 points, reflecting a favorable mix shift towards hardware maintenance as well as infrastructure cost efficiencies.
Q2 operating expenses totaled $684 million and were down 8% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflects a combination of a return to a 13-week quarter and prudent expense management. Operating margin for the second quarter of 15.2% was 7.5 points higher than last quarter and was just above our previous guidance range.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17%, as expected. Weighted average diluted share count of 296 million shares decreased by approximately 12 million shares sequentially and 8% year-over-year due to share repurchase activity. Q2 EPS of $0.61 was $0.01 above the high end of our prior guidance range.
Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed Q2 with $4.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, 14% of which was held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue decreased by $20 million in Q2 versus Q1 and was flat year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 17, in line with our expectations. And days sales outstanding normalized to 37 days from 30 days in Q1, reflecting the return to a 13-week quarter.
Q2 cash flow from operations was approximately $145 million versus $381 million in Q2 a year ago. Free cash flow of $99 million was about 7% of net revenues, down substantially from Q2 a year ago due to lower net income and a return to normal levels of DSO and accrued compensation net of improved inventory turns related to the 14th week in Q1.
Finally, we repurchased approximately $183 million of stock and paid $53 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Consistent with our previous guidance, we remain on track to complete our share repurchase program by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on January 20, 2016.
Now turning to our business outlook. We remain confident in our strategy and long-term growth potential. As I discussed last quarter, fiscal year 2016 is one of transition. We are realizing results from our investments in sales capacity, actions to regain traction in the channel and programs to accelerate the migration to clustered ONTAP. Coming into the year, we anticipated that top line predictability would improve in the back half, but the uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in our market and an aggressive pricing environment have resulted in continued limited visibility. While we have made progress in rebuilding our pipeline, these factors have slightly tempered our outlook.
As a result, we expect revenue for fiscal 2016 to be down just over 5%. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, given the environment, we now estimate fiscal 2016 gross margin to be down 1 to 2 points from fiscal 2015 and operating margin to be down about 2 points for the year. We expect second half operating margin of approximately 18%, the low end of our target operating margin range. Although off to a slow start in the first half, we expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for the second half of the year to be in the mid-teens. 
Finally, we expect to reduce share count in fiscal 2016 by approximately 6%. And between dividends and share repurchases, we will again return over 100% of free cash flow generated in the fiscal year to shareholders.
As George discussed, we are assessing every aspect of our business to drive efficiency and velocity. We will lower our cost structure, including cost reduction actions in the second half of fiscal 2016. We will drive greater efficiency across the business, and at the same time, make investments in growth areas leading to increased profitability, longer-term growth and increased shareholder value.
For Q3, we expect net revenues to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which at the midpoint implies flat revenues versus Q2 and a 7% decrease year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margin of approximately 61.5% and operating margin of approximately 17%. Based on our share repurchases in Q2 and in the first 10 days of Q3, we expect our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 297 million shares and earnings per share for Q3 to range from approximately $0.66 to $0.71 per share.
In summary, we are confident in the opportunity ahead of us. Customer wins and feedback from partners indicate that our Data Fabric strategy is differentiated and well aligned with their most critical IT imperatives. We must improve our efficiency and agility to take full advantage of those opportunities and to set NetApp on a path for increased profitability, long-term growth and increased shareholder value.

A majority of the transitions have been done through the partners, and there had been strong uptake and good feedback from the partners. In the second quarter of this year, the number of partners that participated in the clustered ONTAP acceleration program expanded substantially from Q1 across all of the geographies in the world as well as the number of customer transactions also expanded substantially from Q1.

Last quarter and actually in Q4, I talked about higher discounting. It's about 2 points impact on a year-over-year basis to product gross margin this quarter. That we have to work through. That is the aggressive pricing actions going on in the industry right now. We have to work it. That said, over time, we've shown that we can move margins here, and in fact, over several years, we did exactly that. Finally, I would say that on the services side of our business, the team has done a really good job in terms of leveraging the cost base and servicing the enormous installed base of customers that we have.

The clustered ONTAP operating system is also part of the data center of the future, combining scale-out, software-defined and all-flash architectures to enable customers to operate their environments like cloud service providers. So traditional storage, we were referring to more particularly around the 7-Mode and OEM."

Product gross margin was down, I think, in part due to higher discounting. But then your DSO has also spiked up, which seems to imply the quarter may have been a little bit back-end loaded. And your guidance for the January quarter was a bit lower than The Street was expecting. So I guess when you look at those 3 metrics together, it seems like you may have pulled in some revenue into the October quarter. So just wondering if you can provide any color on that dynamic and whether the sales pipeline for the January quarter is up on a year-over-year basis."

Part of the first half activity, as we talked about it back in May and then again in August on our calls, was to rebuild pipeline. And the team has been doing a really important effort around just that, putting sales capacity in, rebuilding channel partner relationships, et cetera. So I think the work continues to go on there. That's not something that's going to end. It's going to be something that continues. In terms of linearity in the quarter, the second quarter is a quarter that encompasses both the federal year-end in September and then our quarter-end in October. When I look at our position at the end of the quarter, end of the quarter versus sort of the end of the quarter a year ago, there's not much difference there. So the linearity, I think, is pretty normal in terms of overall what has happened year-on-year. I realize the pieces. There is anomalies -- or I should say there are anomalies in this 14-week quarter from Q1, which we see every 6 years. So hopefully, we will not have that type of thing to talk about for another 6 years. But other than that, the linearity is really consistent with what we expected, and our position going into Q3 consistent with what we had going into Q3 even last year."

So we're not -- we don't see that as a slowdown. We see this as a constant sort of trajectory of customer environments transitioning from 7 to cDOT as well as new shipments getting deployed in our installed base. When a new shipment gets sold by NetApp to the customer, it usually takes a little while before it actually shows up in our installed base measuring system because of the time it takes for the customer to get it ready and deploy it. So sometimes, the quarter boundary is not the perfect answer. And so we see this as part of our ongoing trajectory. In terms of capacity deployed and capacity managed, we don't break out those numbers. They are essentially a measurement of the value of Clustered Data ONTAP in terms of being able to consolidate multiple systems and provide for large-scale data management in a very efficient fashion for customers. So we're pleased with that statistic as well."

The first is I want to thank our European sales leadership team. We have a deep experienced, well-executing sales leadership team and a group of loyal channel partners who we've enabled with our technology sets. And that has driven consistency in terms of the execution of the European organization. It is also translating our investments in the channel as well as the capacity investments we've made in the field into results. The second is we have introduced capabilities that were specific to the European market. So for example, Clustered Data ONTAP, there's a high-availability configuration of it called MetroCluster that is built with European data centers in mind, and that gives us a far superior solution for Europe than any other competitor in the market. So it's both technology as well as great execution on the ground."

I believe last quarter, you talked about 15% free cash flow relative to revenue.

So over 100% redeployed to shareholders. When I look at our forecast today, they are moderately south of that, but we're not talking about material numbers. So it is -- mid-teens is the expectation for the second half of the year. There's obviously been some pressure here in the first half. There's been some noise in terms of Q1 versus Q2, but overall for the year, we should be generating a cash from ops range in the $800 million to $900 million range.

I'd like to conclude by saying we continue to make progress as we pivot towards growing parts of the market, scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud. Our key investment areas of sales capacity, channel traction and the acceleration of the transition of our installed base to clustered ONTAP are showing early results. Clustered ONTAP, flash and other emerging pieces of our portfolio are growing strongly although not yet enough to offset the decline in our ONTAP 7-Mode business. Our customers are transforming themselves using digital technology connected with pervasive broadband networks and cloud computing to improve the efficiency of their business, build global business systems and better serve their customers. Data is at the heart of that transformation and where NetApp has a unique and valuable role to play. Feedback from customers and partners is overwhelmingly positive and reaffirms my strong convictions that our Data Fabric strategy is aligned to our customers' strategic technical direction for IT. NetApp is the only company that can help enterprises manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures with the scale and modern system architectures needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital era. NetApp is changing to position the company for long-term growth. We are conducting a fundamental assessment of every aspect of our business, structure, portfolio and process to reduce complexity and drive efficiency while improving our overall velocity. We will build a stronger, more efficient company that solves customer challenges while delivering profitability and earnings growth in a moderated IT spending and storage market.
