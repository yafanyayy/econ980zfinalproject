AMETEK had a strong fourth quarter to complete another excellent year in the quarter on an adjusted basis, we established records for operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash",1903,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a strong fourth quarter to complete another excellent year in the quarter on an adjusted basis, we established records for operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we incurred additional Zygo integration costs of approximately $0.01 per diluted share. Including the costs from the third quarter, total Zygo integration cost in 2014 are approximately $0.05 per diluted share. The additional fourth quarter integration costs increases the expected Zygo synergy benefit from $15 million to $20 million. All financial results and commentary on the call today will be on an adjusted basis, excluding these integration costs. 
Now on to the full year and fourth quarter results. For the full year 2014, we established records for essentially all key financial metrics, including orders, sales, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. Sales were up 12% for the year, orders were up 13%, operating income was up 13%, operating margins were 22.8% and diluted earnings per share ended at $2.42, a 15% increase over 2013's diluted EPS. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 9% to $1.02 billion. Organic growth was up 2% against the very difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of 2013 while acquisitions added 9% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. Organic growth in the fourth quarter was excellent, with broad-based strength across our businesses. Overall orders were up 10% and organic sales were very strong, up 7% on orders. Operating income for the fourth quarter was very strong. It increased 10% to a record $232.3 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was also very strong at 22.7%, a 40 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013. Net income was up 14% to $155.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were up 15% over last year's fourth quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. Operating cash flow was $213.3 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, cash flow was $726 million, up 10% over 2013. Free cash flow was excellent at 125% of net income in the fourth quarter and 112% of net income for the full year. And working capital is also very good at 17.1% of sales in the quarter. Included in our fourth quarter results is approximately $0.02 per diluted share of realignment costs, which will contribute an approximate $0.04 per diluted share benefit in 2015 and $0.06 per diluted share benefit in 2016. Considering these realignment costs, the quality of earnings in the fourth quarter was excellent. 
Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very strong fourth quarter and an excellent year. For the quarter, sales were up 14% to $644.4 million, driven by strong growth in our Aerospace business plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions. Internal growth was up 1% on a very difficult comparison, while acquisitions added 14% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. EIG's operating income increased 11% to $168.1 million and operating margins were 26.1% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of the recent acquisitions, EIG operating margins were up 70 basis points over last year's fourth quarter. The Electromechanical Group also had a very good quarter. Sales were up 1% to $379.8 million on strong growth in our Precision Motion Control and Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging businesses. Organic sales were up 3% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. EMG's operating income increased 9% to $77 million and operating margins were very strong at 20.3% in the quarter, up 150 basis points from the previous year. 
Now turning to our Four Growth Strategies of Operational Excellence, Global and Market Expansion, New Product Developments and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. We have a very active year, acquiring 5 businesses, including [ph], VTI Instruments, AMETEK's, Zygo and AMPTEK. We deployed approximately $575 million in capital and acquired roughly $285 million in revenue in 2014. 
Over the last 18 months, we acquired 8 businesses, deployed nearly $1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $460 million in annual revenue. The integration of these acquired businesses is going very well. In addition to driving operational improvements and efficiencies, through leveraging our global capabilities, we are focused on achieving sales, market and technology synergies between the acquired businesses and our existing businesses. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us during 2015 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We have a financial managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our balance sheet, cash flow and financial facilities provide us with ample liquidity also to pursue this strategy. 
Now turning to Global and Market Expansion. Global and market expansion continues to be an important contributor to our growth as we are increasingly expanding our presence in attractive, higher growth market segments and geographies. International sales represented 54% of our total sales in the fourth quarter and 55% of our total sales for the full year. We continued to make investments globally to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities in these international markets. Providing customers with high-quality service capabilities is increasingly being viewed as a key differentiator for our product sales, especially in China, India and Southeast Asia. These investments are yielding strong results. In 2014, we saw excellent growth across the BRIC regions, with overall growth of 17% and organic growth up 10%. China was a key driver of this growth, up 13% organically in 2014. 
Now moving to New Products. New product development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long term health and growth. We have consistently grown our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2014, we spent approximately $210 million on RD&E, which was up 17% from 2013 and in 2015, we expect to spend approximately $220 million. 
I'll now talk about some new product introductions that we've recently done. AMETEK instruments business recently launched our software recovery analyzer, the model 888 field gas analyzer. AMETEK is the clear market leader in sulfur recovery analysis, with over 1,000 analyzers installed worldwide with more than 100 million hours of run time. With the introduction of the new model 888 analyzer, we have taken sulfur recovery analysis to the next level. Our third generation analyzer offers advanced, predictive diagnostics, remote PC Web-enabled interface and enhanced safety features. 
In addition it automatically detects and takes immediate corrective action in response to commonly encountered external failure modes in the sulfur recovery process. 
AMETEK's research business introduced its new micro C series high-speed digital video cameras at the North America and Automotive Testing Expo in late 2014. These compact of the deal cameras feature a ruggedized design with the ability to withstand shocks up to 170 Gs. This makes it the ideal choice for any number of extreme applications, including onboard automotive crash testing. Digital high-speed video serves us 1 of the most valuable tools researchers have in conducting crash test analysis and the new myriad C-Series offers performance and image quality unsurpassed by our competition. Lastly, AMETEK industry recently launched their first about in Incorporated key technology acquired as part of the recent AMPTEK acquisition. AMPTEK, which we acquired in 2014, provides x-ray and gamma ray detectors used to identify the composition of materials. Utilizing AMPTEK's fast silicon drip detector technology, this new elemental analysis system delivers a compact and lightweight product that provides the level of measurements performance, including resolution and output rates that aligns extremely well with many industry applications. This new product is targeted at the industrial energy dispersive spectral analysis market and the tabletop scanning electron microscope market, both target markets for expansion. 
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was excellent at 25% of sales in the quarter and 23% for the full year. This reflects the tremendous work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. 
Lastly, I will touch on Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK, our focus on cost and asset management remains a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. We continue to see tremendous results from our Operational Excellence initiatives as is evidenced by our record operating performance, strong operating margins and excellent working capital levels. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continual operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the Operational Excellence tools we have in place throughout the company. OpEx include Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, Design for Six Sigma in our New Product Development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, movement of production to low-cost locales and value engineering. Overall, we realized approximately $100 million in savings in 2014 through our various Operational Excellence initiatives. The largest contributor to this was our global sourcing office and strategic procurement activities where we recognized $19 million in savings in the fourth quarter and over $70 million in savings for all of 2014. 
For 2015, we expect approximately $110 million in total savings through our Operational Excellence initiatives, including $70 million in savings through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. Included in this overall 2015 savings amount is approximately $13.5 million of savings from the realignment costs included in our fourth quarter results. 
Turning now to the outlook for 2015. We expect our businesses overall to show solid growth during 2015, with balanced organic growth across both operating groups. We anticipate 2015 revenue to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Organic growth is expected to be up low- to mid-single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over 2014, reflecting the leverage impact of core growth, our Operational Excellence initiatives and the benefit of contributions from recent acquisitions. First quarter 2015 sales are expected to be up mid-single digits from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.61 to $0.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 11% over last year's first quarter. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven Operational Excellence capabilities and a successful focus on Strategic Acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2015. 
So in summary, our overall businesses performed very well in the fourth quarter and in 2014, producing records for essentially all key financial metrics on an adjusted basis. Our team did an excellent job navigating the modest worldwide growth environment. We are able to deliver exceptional operating results through our focus on executing our growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong and our significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. We remain committed to making sizable investments in New Product Development, as well as, Global and Market Expansion to position ourselves for future growth. We really look forward to another successful year in 2015. Bob will now cover some of the financial details and then we'll be very glad to answer your questions."

As Frank noted, we had an excellent fourth quarter with strong operating performance and an excellent quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, organic selling expenses were up less than organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were up 8% over last year's fourth quarter, driven by a contribution to the AMETEK charitable foundation in the fourth quarter. 
As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales, in line with last year's fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, total other expenses were down approximately $4.5 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013. This $0.01 per diluted share benefit was more than offset by realignment costs of $0.02 per diluted share taken in the fourth quarter resulting in a high-quality of earnings. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1%, essentially in line with last year's fourth quarter of 27.2%. We are very pleased with the success of our ongoing international and state tax planning initiatives. For 2015, we estimate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically be it positively or negatively on this full year rate. Overall, our quality of earnings was excellent in the quarter. 
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was a very strong 17.1% of sales in the fourth quarter and 17.6% for the full year. We remain 1 of the top performers in our peer group and our working capital performance is a direct reflection of the tremendous drives our business units have taken in driving towards operating excellence. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital spending is $24 million for the quarter and $71 million for the full year. Full year 2014 capital expenditures were 1.8% of sales. 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. Depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the quarter and $139 million for the full year. 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. 
Our cash flow was excellent in the quarter and for the full year. Operating cash flow for the quarter and full year were records. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $213 million and free cash flow was $189 million, representing 125% of net income. Full year operating cash flow was $726 million, up 10% over 2013. And full year free cash flow was $65 million or 112% of net income. Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy, where we expended approximately $575 million on transactions in 2014. 
In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of stocks for approximately $243 million. These repurchases were in line with our stated strategy to offset the dilutive impact of our benefit plans with opportunistic share repurchases. 
Total debt was $1.71 billion at December 31, up approximately $300 million from 2013 year end, driven largely by acquisitions and share repurchases. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $378 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at December 31 of 29.2%. At December 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash at existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, we had an outstanding 2014, establishing records for essentially all of the key financial metrics. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions with a strong balance sheet and cash flow."

In essence, we have included in our estimates what we believe is going to be the impact of oil prices falling to the levels that they're at, which is obviously a very depressed level. If you look at our business, we have about $125 million of our business that is focused on Upstream oil and gas. And in total, if you look at the amount of business when you include the downstream and the midstream piece, it's about $400 million. We've done a rollout, we estimate that the impact on our business is going to be about $40 million in sales. As I mentioned, that's included in our estimates. The majority of that is in that $125 million Upstream part of the business. So we believe we have the impacts covered. There will be a counter effect that's positive that is difficult to predict in terms of the fact what the magnitude will be but there should obviously be a positive impact on the U.S. economy that should result from this reduction in oil prices. But we haven't assumed any of that in our estimates."

We have rolled up in a very detailed manner the budget for 2015. And although our margins are very good and very high, we do expect that we can continue to expand margins and we're estimating a 30 to 40 basis point improvement in margins for 2015 over 2013 or '14. And the drivers for that are really 2 things. 1, is the fact that we expect organic growth in 2015 to basically have a very high contribution margin going to the bottom line. As you've heard us speak before, our contribution margins are very good. In 2014, the actual contribution margin for the company was actually greater than 40%. We have told you to estimate 35% for our contribution margins, but we tend to outperform that so you take that organic growth and that will go to the bottom line through that contribution margin and thus, that will be a lift on the margin performance of the company. The second thing is our very aggressive cost reduction activities. You heard in my opening comments that we're I would say conservatively expecting $110 million of cost improvements going through the P&L in 2014. We've been aggressive on the cost side. You heard the $0.02 of realignment cost that we put in the fourth quarter. As we saw the price of oil go down and we saw some of the FX impacts, we decided to take a bit aggressive stance in terms of additional cost reductions. So we're pretty confident in that $110 million of savings. And you sum those 2, and that leads to basically the 30 to 40 basis points of margin improvement."

So there is no precedent tenet to do some type of major buyback. Also implied in your question is do we have the flexibility if we wanted to some buybacks along with doing acquisitions? Absolutely. I mean the cash flow of the company is superlative. As Bob mentioned, there's a significant amount of capital that we have available to us. So we are not capital constrained. And if we got to a point where there weren't as many deals on the table as we would like, we would surely consider it. But it's not our present thought process."

You know our history, Scott, we typically come out with a number and then as our operating units perform and we have confidence that they're going to do more, we will raise that as the year goes on. So I personally would be disappointed if we didn't end up well above that $110 million number but we'll update you in each quarter. Okay, I'll give you an update on the various businesses as Scott asked. I'll start with EIG. EIG Aerospace had really a super fourth quarter, with organic sales and orders both up low double digits, reflecting excellent growth in our regional and business jet business and the continued strong growth in our Commercial Aerospace business. As we look ahead to 2015, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up in the mid single-digit region and that's going to be driven by the continued ramp-up of our key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets. Our Process businesses had a solid fourth quarter to complete really an excellent year. In the fourth quarter, overall sales were up low double digits on a percentage basis. Organic sales were flat but it was against a very difficult comparison from the prior year. Overall growth was driven by contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were Creaform, VTI Instruments, Zygo and AMPTEK. And we're already seeing the benefits, as I mentioned, in my opening talk from the AMPTEK acquisition, with the introduction of a new product, using AMPTEK's detector technology. Also the introduction of a number of New Products at Creaform has been very well-received by their customers. So in mid-2015, we're optimistic. We expect our Process businesses to grow mid- to high single digits overall, with mid-single-digit organic growth. And the third part of EIG is Power & Industrial. Power & Industrial businesses had a strong fourth quarter. Overall sales were up approximately 24% with the growth driven by the contributions from and power, these 2 acquisitions that and we're very pleased with the success of those acquisitions, both of those businesses are performing quite well and are actually exceeding the models we put in place for them. And for 2015, we expect both overall and organic sales for Power & Industrial to be up low- to mid-single digits. So if you sum those 3 parts of EIG -- for all of EIG for 2015, we're expecting overall sales to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, with organic growth up low- to mid-single digits. 
Moving on to EMG. Our differentiated businesses had a great fourth quarter, with strong sales and order performance. Sales were up mid-single digits, driven by strong growth in our Precision Motion Control and our Engineered Materials in our Interconnects and Packaging businesses. Orders were were really strong. They were up 10% organically again. For 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up mid-single digits overall and organically. And the last part of the company, our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business. That -- the sales in that business were down mid-single digits organically in the fourth quarter and that was against a very difficult comparison from the prior year. And for 2015, we expect sales for this business to be up low-single digits organically. And if you sum those 2 parts of EMG for all of EMG, we expect both overall on on an organic growth of low- to mid-single digits on a percentage basis and that's how we then roll up the company so that as a whole, we're expecting the mid-single digits sales growth overall with organic growth up in the low- to mid-single digits region."

And for every one of our operations, we ask them to identify growth projects in terms of how they're going to grow the top line. We ask them to look at pricing. We look very intently at inflation and then we look at cost improvements that they need to put in the business so that they get a good return for shareholders. And it's a very detailed analysis in each of those parts of the business. So every business has a cost improvement target that they are not only focused on but there's also an element of compensation, which is related to it. And what Bob does is rolls that up throughout the entire company. And that provides a number to us, and quite frankly, we give that a bit of a haircut because not every business unit is going to make their exact target. Some are going to to over perform, some are going to underperform. And therefore when we first come out and talk with you, we give you a conservative number and then as we go through the year, we will look to see how the overall company's doing, and we tend to raise it and there'll also be dynamics in businesses, where they'll get into the year and they'll say -- some businesses will say the year looks a little tougher and we're going to go a little bit more in this area. And then their number goes up so it's a flexible type things. We look at it very closely. And it's not just a swag, it's analytically driven."

But actually it was driven by the FX effect on the backlog. So if you take that out, the book-to-bill was actually up pretty much in line. So it's hard as you mentioned, we that type of businesses we have to focus on that backlog number. But we feel pretty good about it it's $1.2 billion, it's up a nice amount from the end of the previous year.

And in fact, in the fourth quarter, our military business was up mid-single digits. And we really scrubbed this number but for 2015, we're expecting it to be up mid-single digits as well. Now that's being driven by a couple of things. It's not as much driven by the U.S. Military market as it is the international business. We've got a good amount of content in military in Europe and that business is doing quite well. So there's a fair amount of confidence. And actually, when you look across all of Aerospace or the company for next year, we're looking at mid single-digit growth in essentially all the parts of Aerospace. Now it might end up a little bit stronger in commercial than what we're calling for right now because obviously, there's some key drivers going on there with new platforms. But overall, Aerospace is a good picture for us right now."

AMETEK had a strong fourth quarter to complete another excellent year. In the quarter, on an adjusted basis, we established records for operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. 
In the fourth quarter, we incurred additional Zygo integration cost of approximately $0.01 per diluted share. Including the cost from the third quarter, total Zygo integration cost in 2014 are approximately $0.05 per diluted share. The additional fourth quarter integration cost increases the expected Zygo synergy benefit from $15 million to $20 million. All financial results and commentary on the call today will be on an adjusted basis, excluding these integration costs. 
Now on to the full year and fourth quarter results. For the full year 2014, we established records for essentially all key financial metrics, including orders, sales, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. Sales were up 12% for the year, orders were up 13%, operating income was up 13%, operating margins were 22.8% and diluted earnings per share ended at $2.42, a 15% increase over 2013's diluted EPS. 
In the fourth quarter, sales increased 9% to $1.02 billion. Organic growth was up 2% against a very difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of 2013 while acquisitions added 9% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. Organic growth in the fourth quarter was excellent with broad-based strength across our businesses. Overall orders were up 10% and organic sales were very strong, up 7% on orders. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter was very strong. It increased 10% to a record $232.3 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was also very strong at 22.7%, a 40 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013. Net income was up 14% to $155.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were up 15% over last year's fourth quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. 
Operating cash flow was $213.3 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, cash flow was $726 million, up 10% over 2013. Free cash flow was excellent at 125% of net income in the fourth quarter and 112% of net income for the full year. And working capital is also very good at 17.1% of sales in the quarter. 
Included in our fourth quarter results is approximately $0.02 per diluted share of realignment costs, which will contribute an approximate $0.04 per diluted share benefit in 2015 and $0.06 per diluted share benefit in 2016. Considering these realignment costs, the quality of earnings in the fourth quarter was excellent. 
Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very strong fourth quarter and an excellent year. For the quarter, sales were up 14% to $644.4 million, driven by strong growth in our Aerospace business plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions. Internal growth was up 1% on a very difficult comparison while acquisitions added 14% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. EIG's operating income increased 11% to $168.1 million and operating margins were 26.1% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of the recent acquisitions, EIG operating margins were up 70 basis points over last year's fourth quarter. 
The Electromechanical Group also had a very good quarter. Sales were up 1% to $379.8 million on strong growth in our Precision Motion Control and Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging businesses. Organic sales were up 3% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. EMG's operating income increased 9% to $77 million and operating margins were very strong at 20.3% in the quarter, up 150 basis points from the previous year. 
Now turning to our Four Growth Strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. We had a very active year, acquiring 5 businesses, including Teseq, VTI Instruments, Luphos, Zygo and AMPTEK. We deployed approximately $575 million in capital and acquired roughly $285 million in revenue in 2014. Over the last 18 months, we acquired 8 businesses, deployed nearly $1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $460 million in annual revenue. 
The integration of these acquired businesses is going very well. In addition to driving operational improvements and efficiencies through leveraging our global capabilities, we are focused on achieving sales, market and technology synergies between the acquired businesses and our existing businesses. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us during 2015 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our balance sheet, cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity also to pursue this strategy. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion continues to be an important contributor to our growth as we are increasingly expanding our presence in attractive, higher-growth market segments and geographies. International sales represented 54% of our total sales in the fourth quarter and 55% of our total sales for the full year. We continue to make investments globally to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities in these international markets. 
Providing customers with high-quality service capabilities is increasingly being viewed as a key differentiator for our product sales, especially in China, India and Southeast Asia. These investments are yielding strong results. In 2014, we saw excellent growth across the BRIC regions with overall growth up 17% and organic growth up 10%. China was a key driver of this growth, up 13% organically in 2014. 
Now moving to New Products. New Product Development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently grown our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2014, we spent approximately $210 million on RD&E, which was up 17% from 2013. And in 2015, we expect to spend approximately $220 million. 
I'll now talk about some new product introductions that we've recently done. AMETEK Process Instruments business recently launched our latest sulfur recovery analyzer, the Model 888 Tail Gas Analyzer. AMETEK is the clear market leader in sulfur recovery analysis with over 1,000 analyzers installed worldwide with more than 100 million hours of run time. With the introduction of the new Model 888 analyzer, we have taken sulfur recovery analysis to the next level. Our third-generation analyzer offers advanced predictive diagnostics, remote PC Web-enabled interface and enhanced safety features. In addition, it automatically detects and takes immediate corrective action in response to commonly encountered external failure modes in the sulfur recovery process. 
AMETEK's Vision Research business introduced its new Phantom Miro C-Series high-speed digital video cameras at the North American Automotive Testing Expo in late 2014. These compact video cameras feature a ruggedized design with the ability to withstand shocks up to 170Gs. This makes it the ideal choice for any number of extreme applications, including onboard automotive crash testing. Digital high-speed video serves as one of the most valuable tools researchers have in conducting crash test analysis. And the new Miro C-Series offers performance and image quality unsurpassed by our competition. 
Lastly, AMETEK EDAX recently launched their first product incorporating key technology acquired as part of the recent AMPTEK acquisition. AMPTEK, which we acquired in 2014, provides x-ray and gamma ray detectors used to identify composition of materials. Utilizing AMPTEK's fast Silicon Drift Detector technology, this new elemental analysis system delivers a compact and lightweight product that provides a level of measurements performance, including resolution and output count rates, that aligns extremely well with many industry applications. This new product is targeted at the industrial energy-dispersive spectral analysis market and the tabletop scanning electron microscope market, both target markets for EDAX expansion. 
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was excellent at 25% of sales in the quarter and 23% for the full year. This reflects the tremendous work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. 
Lastly, I will touch on Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. Our focus on cost and asset management remains a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. We continue to see tremendous results from our Operational Excellence initiatives as is evidenced by our record operating performance, strong operating margins and excellent working capital levels. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continual operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the Operational Excellence tools we have in place throughout the company. 
OPEX include Lean Manufacturing Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, Design for Six Sigma in our New Product Development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, movement of production to low-cost locales and value engineering. Overall, we realized approximately $100 million in savings in 2014 through our various Operational Excellence initiatives. The largest contributor to this was our global sourcing office and strategic procurement activities, where we recognized $19 million in savings in the fourth quarter and over $70 million in savings for all of 2014. 
For 2015, we expect approximately $110 million in total savings through our Operational Excellence initiatives, including $70 million in savings through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. Included in this overall 2015 savings amount is approximately $13.5 million of savings from the realignment costs included in our fourth quarter results. 
Turning now to the outlook for 2015. We expect our businesses overall to show solid growth during 2015 with balanced organic growth across both operating groups. We anticipate 2015 revenue to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid-single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over 2014, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our Operational Excellence initiatives and the benefit of contributions from recent acquisitions. First quarter 2015 sales are expected to be up mid-single digits from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.61 to $0.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 11% over last year's first quarter. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven Operational Excellence capabilities and a successful focus on Strategic Acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2015. 
So in summary, our overall businesses performed very well in the fourth quarter and in 2014, producing records for essentially all key financial metrics on an adjusted basis. Our team did an excellent job navigating the modest worldwide growth environment. We were able to deliver exceptional operating results through a focus on executing our growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong and our significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. We remain committed to making sizable investments in New Product Development as well as Global & Market Expansion to position ourselves for future growth. We really look forward to another successful year in 2015. 
Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be very glad to answer your questions."

As Frank noted, we had an excellent fourth quarter with strong operating performance and an excellent quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, organic selling expenses were up less than organic sales on",591,"Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had an excellent fourth quarter with strong operating performance and an excellent quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. 
In the quarter, organic selling expenses were up less than organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were up 8% over last year's fourth quarter, driven by a contribution to the AMETEK charitable foundation in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales, in line with last year's fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, total other expenses were down approximately $4.5 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013. This $0.01 per diluted share benefit was more than offset by realignment costs of $0.02 per diluted share taken in the fourth quarter, resulting in a high quality of earnings. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1%, essentially in line with last year's fourth quarter of 27.2%. We're very pleased with the success of our ongoing international and state tax planning initiatives. For 2015, we estimate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. Overall, our quality of earnings was excellent in the quarter. 
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was a very strong 17.1% of sales in the fourth quarter and 17.6% for the full year. We remain one of the top performers in our peer group and our working capital performance is a direct reflection of the tremendous drives our business units have taken in driving towards operating excellence. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. 
Capital spending was $24 million for the quarter and $71 million for the full year. Full year 2014 capital expenditures were 1.8% of sales. 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. Depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the quarter and $139 million for the full year. 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. 
Our cash flow was excellent in the quarter and for the full year. Operating cash flow for the quarter and full year were records. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $213 million and free cash flow was $189 million, representing 125% of net income. Full year operating cash flow was $726 million, up 10% over 2013. And full year free cash flow was $65 million or 112% of net income. Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy, where we expended approximately $575 million on transactions in 2014. 
In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of stocks for approximately $243 million. These repurchases were in line with our stated strategy to offset the dilutive impact of our benefit plans with opportunistic share repurchases. 
Total debt was $1.71 billion at December 31, up approximately $300 million from 2013 year end, driven largely by acquisitions and share repurchases. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $378 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at December 31 of 29.2%. At December 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, we had an outstanding 2014, establishing records for essentially all of the key financial metrics. We are well positioned for further growth both organically and through acquisitions with a strong balance sheet and cash flow."

In essence, we have included in our estimates what we believe is going to be the impact of oil prices falling to the levels that they're at, which is obviously a very depressed level. If you look at our business, we have about $125 million of our business that is focused on upstream oil and gas. And in total, if you look at the amount of business, when you include the downstream and the midstream piece, it's about $400 million. We've done a roll-up. We estimate that the impact on our business is going to be about $40 million in sales. As I mentioned, that's included in our estimates. The majority of that is in that $125 million upstream part of the business. So we believe we have the impacts covered. There will be a countereffect that's positive that is difficult to predict in terms of exactly what the magnitude will be. But there should obviously be a positive impact on the U.S. economy that should result from this reduction in oil prices. But we haven't assumed any of that in our estimates."

And although our margins are very good and very high, we do expect that we can continue to expand margins. And we're estimating a 30 to 40 basis point improvement in margins for 2015 over 2013 -- or '14. And the drivers for that are really 2 things. One is the fact that we expect organic growth in 2015 to basically have a very high contribution margin going to the bottom line. As you've heard us speak before, our contribution margins are very good. In 2014, the actual contribution margin for the company was actually greater than 40%. We have told you to estimate 35% for our contribution margins, but we tend to outperform that. So you take that organic growth and that will go to the bottom line through that contribution margin. And thus, that will be a lift on the margin performance of the company. The second thing is our very aggressive cost-reduction activities. You heard in my opening comments that we're, I would say, conservatively expecting $110 million of cost improvements going through the P&L in 2014. We've been aggressive on the cost side. You heard the $0.02 of realignment cost that we put in the fourth quarter. As we saw the price of oil go down and we saw some of the FX impacts, we decided to take a bit aggressive stance in terms of additional cost reductions. So we're pretty confident in that $110 million of savings. And you sum those 2, and that leads to basically the 30 to 40 basis points of margin improvement."

We typically come out with a number, and then as our operating units perform and we have confidence that they're going to do more, we will raise that as the year goes on. So I personally would be disappointed if we didn't end up well above that $110 million number. But we'll update you in each quarter. Okay, I'll give you an update on the various businesses as Scott asked. I'll start with EIG. EIG Aerospace had really a super fourth quarter with organic sales and orders both up low double digits, reflecting excellent growth in our regional and business jet business and a continued strong growth in our commercial Aerospace business. As we look ahead to 2015, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up in the mid-single-digit region. And that's going to be driven by the continued ramp-up of our key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets. Our Process businesses had a solid fourth quarter to complete really an excellent year. In the fourth quarter, overall sales were up low double digits on a percentage basis. Organic sales were flat, but it was against a very difficult comparison from the prior year. Overall growth was driven by contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were Creaform, VTI Instruments, Luphos, Zygo and AMPTEK. And we're already seeing the benefits, as I mentioned in my opening talk, from the AMPTEK acquisition with the introduction of a new product at EDAX using AMPTEK's detector technology. Also the introduction of a number of new products at Creaform has been very well-received by their customers. So in mid-2015, we're optimistic. We expect our Process businesses to grow mid- to high single digits overall with mid-single-digit organic growth. And the third part of EIG is Power & Industrial. Power & Industrial businesses had a strong fourth quarter. Overall sales were up approximately 24% with the growth driven by the contributions from Teseq and Powervar, these 2 acquisitions that [indiscernible]. And we're very pleased with the success of those acquisitions. Both of those businesses are performing quite well and are actually exceeding the models we put in place for them. And for 2015, we expect both overall and organic sales for Power & Industrial to be up low to mid-single digits. So if you sum those 3 parts of EIG, for all of EIG for 2015, we're expecting overall sales to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. Moving on to EMG, our differentiated businesses had a great fourth quarter with strong sales and order performance. Sales were up mid-single digits, driven by strong growth in our Precision Motion Control and our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses. Orders were really strong. They were up 10% organically. And for 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up mid-single digits overall and organically. And the last part of the company, our Floorcare &Specialty Motors business, that -- the sales in that business were down mid-single digits organically in the quarter. And that was against a very difficult comparison from the prior year. And for 2015, we expect sales for this business to be up low single digits organically. And if you sum those 2 parts of EMG, for all of EMG, we expect both overall an organic growth of low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis. And that's how we then roll up the company so that as a whole, we're expecting the mid-single-digit sales growth overall with organic growth up in this low to mid-single-digit region."

We ask them to look at pricing. We look very intently at inflation, and then we look at cost improvements that they need to put in the business so that they get a good return for shareholders. And it's a very detailed analysis in each of those parts of the business. So every business has a cost improvement target that they are not only focused on, but there's also an element of their compensation, which is related to it. And what Bob does is rolls that up throughout the entire company and that provides a number to us. And quite frankly, we give that a bit of a haircut because not every business unit is going to make their exact target as some are going to overperform, some are going to underperform. And therefore, when we first come out and talk with you, we give you a conservative number. And then as we go through the year, we will look to see how the overall company is doing and we tend to raise it.

So it's hard, as you mentioned, with the type of businesses we have to focus on that backlog number. But we feel pretty good about it. It's $1.2 billion. It's up a nice amount from the end of the previous year. And very importantly, the organic growth in orders in Q4 was very strong. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, it was up 7%, so a very, very good number. Actually, the organic growth in orders for all of 2014 was up 4%, so a fairly healthy number in this environment."

And we're calling for mid-single digits in that part of the business. So we expect it to be reasonably good. The surprise is military. And we all expected that military was going to be a real drag on the business. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, our military business was up mid-single digits. And we really scrubbed this number. But for 2015, we're expecting it to be up mid-single digits as well. Now that's being driven by a couple of things. It's not as much driven by the U.S. military market as it is the international business. We've got a good amount of content in military in Europe, and that business is doing quite well. So there's a fair amount of confidence. And actually, when you look across all of Aerospace or the company for next year, we're looking at mid-single-digit growth in essentially all the parts of Aerospace. Now it might end up a little bit stronger in commercial than what we're calling for right now because obviously, there's some key drivers going on there with new platforms. But overall, Aerospace is a good picture for us right now."

AMETEK had a strong fourth quarter to complete another excellent year. In the quarter, on an adjusted basis, we established records for operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. 
In the fourth quarter, we incurred additional Zygo integration costs of approximately $0.01 per diluted share. Including the costs from the third quarter, total Zygo integration costs in 2014 are approximately $0.05 per diluted share. The additional fourth quarter integration cost increases the expected Zygo synergy benefit from $15 million to $20 million. All financial results and commentary on the call today will be on an adjusted basis, excluding these integration costs. 
Now on to the full year and fourth quarter results. For the full year 2014, we established records for essentially all key financial metrics, including orders, sales, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. Sales were up 12% for the year, orders were up 13%, operating income was up 13%, operating margins were 22.8% and diluted earnings per share ended at $2.42, a 15% increase over 2013's diluted EPS. 
In the fourth quarter, sales increased 9% to $1.02 billion. Organic growth was up 2% against a very difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of 2013 while acquisitions added 9% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. Organic growth in the fourth quarter was excellent with broad-based strength across our businesses. Overall orders were up 10%, and organic sales were very strong, up 7% on orders. 
Operating income for the fourth quarter was very strong. It increased 10% to a record $232.3 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was also very strong at 22.7%, a 40 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013. Net income was up 14% to $155.2 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were up 15% over last year's fourth quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. 
Operating cash flow was $213.3 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, cash flow was $726 million, up 10% over 2013. Free cash flow was excellent at 125% of net income in the fourth quarter and 112% of net income for the full year. And working capital was also very good at 17.1% of sales in the quarter. 
Included in our fourth quarter results is approximately $0.02 per diluted share of realignment costs, which will contribute an approximate $0.04 per diluted share benefit in 2015 and $0.06 per diluted share benefit in 2016. Considering these realignment costs, the quality of earnings in the fourth quarter was excellent. 
Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very strong fourth quarter and an excellent year. For the quarter, sales were up 14% to $644.4 million driven by strong growth in our Aerospace business plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions. Internal growth was up 1% on a very difficult comparison while acquisitions added 14%, and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. EIG's operating income increased 11% to $168.1 million, and operating margins were 26.1% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, EIG operating margins were up 70 basis points over last year's fourth quarter. 
The Electromechanical Group also had a very good quarter. Sales were up 1% to $379.8 million on strong growth in our Precision Motion Control and Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging businesses. Organic sales were up 3%, and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. EMG's operating income increased 9% to $77 million, and operating margins were very strong at 20.3% in the quarter, up 150 basis points from the previous year. 
Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. We had a very active year, acquiring 5 businesses, including Teseq, VTI Instruments, Luphos, Zygo and AMPTEK. We deployed approximately $575 million in capital and acquired roughly $285 million in revenue in 2014. Over the last 18 months, we acquired 8 businesses, deployed nearly $1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $460 million in annual revenue. 
The integration of these acquired businesses is going very well. In addition to driving operational improvements and efficiencies through leveraging our global capabilities, we are focused on achieving sales, market and technology synergies between the acquired businesses and our existing businesses. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us during 2015, as we see this strategy as a key driver for the creation of shareholder value. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our balance sheet, cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity also to pursue this strategy. 
Now turning to global and market expansion. Global and market expansion continues to be an important contributor to our growth, as we are increasingly expanding our presence in attractive, higher-growth market segments and geographies. International sales represented 54% of our total sales in the fourth quarter and 55% of our total sales for the full year. We continue to make investments globally to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities in these international markets. 
Providing customers with high-quality service capabilities is increasingly being viewed as a key differentiator for our product sales, especially in China, India and Southeast Asia. These investments are yielding strong results. In 2014, we saw excellent growth across the BRIC regions with overall growth up 17% and organic growth up 10%. China was a key driver of this growth, up 13% organically in 2014. 
Now moving to new products. New product development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently grown our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2014, we spent approximately $210 million on RD&E, which was up 17% from 2013. And in 2015, we expect to spend approximately $220 million. 
I'll now talk about some new product introductions that we've recently done. AMETEK Process Instruments business recently launched our latest sulfur recovery analyzer, the Model 888 Tail Gas Analyzer. AMETEK is the clear market leader in sulfur recovery analysis with over 1,000 analyzers installed worldwide with more than 100 million hours of run time. With the introduction of the new Model 888 analyzer, we have taken sulfur recovery analysis to the next level. Our third-generation analyzer offers advanced predictive diagnostics, remote PC web-enabled interface and enhanced safety features. In addition, it automatically detects and takes immediate corrective action in response to commonly encountered external failure modes in the sulfur recovery process. 
AMETEK's Vision Research business introduced its new Phantom Miro C-Series high-speed digital video cameras at the North American Automotive Testing Expo in late 2014. These compact video cameras feature a ruggedized design with the ability to withstand shocks up to 170Gs. This makes it the ideal choice for any number of extreme applications, including onboard automotive crash testing. Digital high-speed video serves as one of the most valuable tools researchers have in conducting crash-test analysis. And the new Miro C-Series offers performance and image quality unsurpassed by our competition. 
Lastly, AMETEK EDAX recently launched their first product incorporating key technology acquired as part of the recent AMPTEK acquisition. AMPTEK, which we acquired in 2014, provides x-ray and gamma ray detectors used to identify the composition of materials. Utilizing AMPTEK's fast Silicon Drift Detector technology, this new elemental analysis system delivers a compact and lightweight product that provides a level of measurement performance, including resolution and output count rates, that aligns extremely well with many industry applications. This new product is targeted at the industrial energy-dispersive spectral analysis market and the tabletop scanning electron microscope market, both target markets for EDAX expansion. 
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was excellent at 25% of sales in the quarter and 23% for the full year. This reflects the tremendous work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. 
Lastly, I will touch on operational excellence. Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. Our focus on cost and asset management remains a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. We continue to see tremendous results from our operational excellence initiatives as is evidenced by our record operating performance, strong operating margins and excellent working capital levels. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continual operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the operational excellence tools we have in place throughout the company. 
OPEX includes Lean Manufacturing Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, Design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, movement of production to low-cost locales and value engineering. Overall, we realized approximately $100 million in savings in 2014 through our various operational excellence initiatives. The largest contributor to this was our global sourcing office and strategic procurement activities, where we recognized $19 million in savings in the fourth quarter and over $70 million in savings for all of 2014. 
For 2015, we expect approximately $110 million in total savings through our operational excellence initiatives, including $70 million in savings through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. Included in this overall 2015 savings amount is approximately $13.5 million of savings from the realignment costs included in our fourth quarter results. 
Turning now to the outlook for 2015. We expect our businesses overall to show solid growth during 2015 with balanced organic growth across both operating groups. We anticipate 2015 revenue to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid-single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over 2014, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our operational excellence initiatives and the benefit of contributions from recent acquisitions. First quarter 2015 sales are expected to be up mid-single digits from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.61 to $0.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 11% over last year's first quarter. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2015. 
So in summary, our overall businesses performed very well in the fourth quarter and in 2014, producing records for essentially all key financial metrics on an adjusted basis. Our team did an excellent job navigating the modest worldwide growth environment. We were able to deliver exceptional operating results through a focus on executing our growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. We remain committed to making sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. We really look forward to another successful year in 2015. 
Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be very glad to answer your questions."

As Frank noted, we had an excellent fourth quarter with strong operating performance and an excellent quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. 
In the quarter, organic selling expenses were up less than organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were up 8% over last year's fourth quarter driven by a contribution to the AMETEK charitable foundation in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales, in line with last year's fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, total other expenses were down approximately $4.5 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013. This $0.01 per diluted share benefit was more than offset by realignment costs of $0.02 per diluted share taken in the fourth quarter resulting in a high quality of earnings. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1%, essentially in line with last year's fourth quarter of 27.2%. We are very pleased with the success of our ongoing international and state tax planning initiatives. For 2015, we estimate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. Overall, our quality of earnings was excellent in the quarter. 
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was a very strong 17.1% of sales in the fourth quarter and 17.6% for the full year. We remain one of the top performers in our peer group, and our working capital performance is a direct reflection of the tremendous strides our business units have taken in driving towards operating excellence. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. 
Capital spending was $24 million for the quarter and $71 million for the full year. Full year 2014 capital expenditures were 1.8% of sales. 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. Depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the quarter and $139 million for the full year. 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. 
Our cash flow was excellent in the quarter and for the full year. Operating cash flow for the quarter and full year were records. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $213 million and free cash flow was $189 million representing 125% of net income. Full year operating cash flow was $726 million, up 10% over 2013. And full year free cash flow was $65 million or 112% of net income. Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy where we expended approximately $575 million on transactions in 2014. 
In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of stock for approximately $243 million. These repurchases were in line with our stated strategy to offset the dilutive impact of our benefit plans with opportunistic share repurchases. 
Total debt was $1.71 billion at December 31, up approximately $300 million from 2013 year end driven largely by acquisitions and share repurchases. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $378 million, resulting in a net-debt-to-capital ratio at December 31 of 29.2%. At December 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, we had an outstanding 2014 establishing records for essentially all of the key financial metrics. We are well positioned for further growth both organically and through acquisitions with a strong balance sheet and cash flow."

We estimate that the impact on our business is going to be about $40 million in sales. As I mentioned, that's included in our estimates. The majority of that is in that $125 million upstream part of the business. So we believe we have the impacts covered. There will be a countereffect that's positive that is difficult to predict in terms of exactly what the magnitude will be. But there should obviously be a positive impact on the U.S. economy that should result from this reduction in oil prices. But we haven't assumed any of that in our estimates."

And although our margins are very good and very high, we do expect that we can continue to expand margins. And we're estimating a 30 to 40 basis point improvement in margins for 2015 over 2013 -- or '14. And the drivers for that are really 2 things. One is the fact that we expect organic growth in 2015 to basically have a very high contribution margin going to the bottom line. As you've heard us speak before, our contribution margins are very good. In 2014, the actual contribution margin for the company was actually greater than 40%. We have told you to estimate 35% for our contribution margins, but we tend to outperform that. So you take that organic growth and that will go to the bottom line through that contribution margin. And thus, that will be a lift on the margin performance of the company. The second thing is our very aggressive cost-reduction activities. You heard in my opening comments that we're, I would say, conservatively expecting $110 million of cost improvements going through the P&L in 2014. We've been aggressive on the cost side. You heard the $0.02 of realignment cost that we put in the fourth quarter. As we saw the price of oil go down and we saw some of the FX impacts, we decided to take a bit aggressive stance in terms of additional cost reductions. So we're pretty confident in that $110 million of savings. And you sum those 2, and that leads to basically the 30 to 40 basis points of margin improvement."

Overall growth was driven by contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were Creaform, VTI Instruments, Luphos, Zygo and AMPTEK. And we're already seeing the benefits, as I mentioned in my opening talk, from the AMPTEK acquisition with the introduction of a new product at EDAX using AMPTEK's detector technology. Also, the introduction of a number of new products at Creaform has been very well received by their customers. So in mid-2015, we're optimistic. We expect our Process businesses to grow mid to high single digits overall with mid-single-digit organic growth. And the third part of EIG is Power & Industrial. Power & Industrial businesses had a strong fourth quarter. Overall sales were up approximately 24% with the growth driven by the contributions from Teseq and Powervar, these 2 acquisitions that [indiscernible]. And we're very pleased with the success of those acquisitions. Both of those businesses are performing quite well and are actually exceeding the models we put in place for them. And for 2015, we expect both overall and organic sales for Power & Industrial to be up low to mid-single digits. So if you sum those 3 parts of EIG, for all of EIG for 2015, we're expecting overall sales to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. Moving on to EMG, our differentiated businesses had a great fourth quarter with strong sales and order performance. Sales were up mid-single digits driven by strong growth in our Precision Motion Control and our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses. Orders were really strong. They were up 10% organically. And for 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up mid-single digits overall and organically. And the last part of the company, our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business, that -- the sales in that business were down mid-single digits organically in the quarter. And that was against a very difficult comparison from the prior year. And for 2015, we expect sales for this business to be up low single digits organically. And if you sum those 2 parts of EMG, for all of EMG, we expect both overall an organic growth of low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis. And that's how we then roll up the company so that as a whole, we're expecting the mid-single-digit sales growth overall with organic growth up in this low- to mid-single-digit region."

We do a very extensive process as we go through the budgets for 2015. And for every one of our operations, we ask them to identify growth projects in terms of how they're going to grow the top line. We ask them to look at pricing. We look very intently at inflation, and then we look at cost improvements that they need to put in the business so that they get a good return for shareholders. And it's a very detailed analysis in each of those parts of the business. So every business has a cost-improvement target that they are not only focused on, but there's also an element of their compensation which is related to it. And what Bob does is rolls that up from throughout the entire company, and that provides a number to us. And quite frankly, we give that a bit of a haircut because not every business unit is going to make their exact target as some are going to overperform, some are going to underperform. And therefore, when we first come out and talk with you, we give you a conservative number. And then as we go through the year, we will look to see how the overall company is doing, and we tend to raise it. And there'll also be dynamics in businesses where they'll get into the year and they'll say -- some businesses will say, the year looks a little tougher, and we're going to do a little bit more in this area. And then their number goes up. So it's a flexible type thing. But we look at it very closely. And it's not just a swag. It's analytically driven."

So we're going to continue to put those investments in and focus on the distribution system, both outside the U.S. and inside the U.S. And actually, that book-to-bill that you're talking about, it was 0.99 in the fourth quarter. But actually, it was driven by the FX effect on backlog. So if you take that out, the book-to-bill was actually pretty much in line. So it's hard, as you mentioned, with the type of businesses we have to focus on that backlog number. But we feel pretty good about it. It's $1.2 billion. It's up a nice amount from the end of the previous year. So -- and very importantly, the organic growth in orders in Q4 was very strong, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. It was up 7%, so a very, very good number. Actually, the organic growth in orders for all of 2014 was up 4%, so a fairly healthy number in this environment."

And we all expected that military was going to be a real drag on the business. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, our military business was up mid-single digits. And we really scrubbed this number. But for 2015, we're expecting it to be up mid-single digits as well. Now that's being driven by a couple of things. It's not as much driven by the U.S. military market as it is the international business. We've got a good amount of content in military in Europe, and that business is doing quite well. So there's a fair amount of confidence. And actually, when you look across all of Aerospace for the company for next year, we're looking at mid-single-digit growth in essentially all the parts of Aerospace. Now it might end up a little bit stronger in commercial than what we're calling for right now because, obviously, there's some key drivers going on there with new platforms.

AMETEK had a very good start to 2015, with double-digit earnings growth and excellent operating performance.Since we are seeing the effects of the continued strong U.S. dollar and a sluggish global economy,",1470,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a very good start to 2015, with double-digit earnings growth and excellent operating performance.
Since we are seeing the effects of the continued strong U.S. dollar and a sluggish global economy, we proactively took actions in the first quarter to mitigate these effects. These actions position us to deliver earnings in line with our initial guidance. The realignment cost in the quarter totaled $15.9 million or approximately $0.04 per diluted share. The savings resulting from this realignment is about $40 million in 2015, and $55 million on an annualized basis. We were very selective in these actions so our future growth will not be impacted.
All financial results and commentary on the call today will be on an adjusted basis, excluding these realignment costs. 
Now on to the financial results.
In the first quarter, sales increased 1% to $984.1 million. Organic growth was also up 1%, while acquisitions added 4%, and foreign currency was a larger than anticipated 4% headwind in the quarter.
Operating income for the first quarter increased 7% to a record $236.9 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was superb at a record 24.1%, a 140-basis-point improvement over the first quarter 2014.
Net income was up 9% to $152.9 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were up 11% over last year's first quarter than at the high-end of our guidance range.
Operating working capital was 18.2% of sales in the quarter.
Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very good first quarter. For the quarter, sales were up 4% to $593.8 million, driven by solid organic growth in our Aerospace, Power & Industrial businesses, plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Zygo and AMPTEK. Internal growth was flat, while acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency was a 3% headwind.
EIG's operating income increased 7% to $160.5 million. And operating margins were 27% in the quarter, up 70 basis points from last year's first quarter.
The Electromechanical Group also performed extremely well in the quarter. Overall sales were down 3% to $390.3 million as a result of a 5% foreign currency headwind. Organic sales were up 2%. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $88.5 million. And operating margins were superb at a record 22.7% in the quarter, up 190 basis points from the previous year.
Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of operational excellence, global & market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions. The solid and balanced execution of these growth strategies by our employees is the principal reason for our ongoing success. Each of these strategies will continue to play a key role in driving our growth. 
First, I will touch on operational excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. We continue to focus on operational improvements to help drive both our competitive and financial success.
Our results this quarter reflect the tremendous impact of our Operational Excellence initiatives as we were able to expand operating margins 140 basis points to a record 24.1%.
Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continual operational improvements and efficiencies through their businesses by leveraging the Operational Excellence tools we have put in place throughout the company.
One such initiative is our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities, where we continue to deliver exceptional results. For all of 2015, we anticipate approximately $70 million in savings from our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives.
Overall, we now anticipate approximately $145 million of total Operational Excellence savings in 2015, up from our initial estimate of $105 million of total savings.
This $40 million increase in Operational Excellence savings is driven by the realignment actions we've started in the first quarter.
Now moving to New Products. New product development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently increased our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2015, we expect to spend about $210 million on RD&E or approximately 5% of total sales. We're excited about some recent New Product introductions.
The new Talysurf i-Series surface and contour measurement tool from our Taylor Hobson business has been very well-received since its recent launch. This high-resolution device offers automated simultaneous surface and contour inspection. It features powerful software capabilities for the analysis of surface, finish and form, and a unique temperature compensation system that ensures consistent performance regardless of the operating environment.
Our TMC business recently introduced their latest new product, the Stage-Base 450. This product represents the latest generation of vibration and motion cancellation technology from TMC. The Stage-Base 450 was designed specifically to be the primary vibration cancellation system for high-precision semiconductor tools, an attractive high-growth market. It incorporates technical advances to compensate for building floor vibration, while increasing semiconductor wafer processing throughput.
Lastly, our Electronic Components and Packaging business, a leading provider of electronic and electromechanical packages for harsh environment applications, unveiled its most recent design breakthrough for microelectronic packaging. This design is a patent S-Bend Feedthrough that provides high fidelity for radiofrequency signals. The innovative design satisfies the need for higher frequencies and greater bandwidth in optical communications with capability greater than 80 gigahertz. The market feedback on this new design has been very strong.
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was strong at 22% of sales in the quarter, and that's up from 20% of sales in last year's first quarter.
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion remains an important part of our long-term growth as we look to expand our presence in attractive higher growth market segments and geographies. We are making investments globally to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities in these international markets.
International sales represent 52% of our total sales in the quarter. And we continue to see strong growth in China, where first quarter organic growth was up mid-teens.
Also as part of our acquisition integration process, we identify opportunities for acquired businesses to leverage AMETEK's global infrastructure to help them quickly and efficiently expand globally. Acquired businesses have had tremendous success in expanding their global manufacturing sales and service capabilities to penetrate new markets.
One recent example is AMPTEK, which we acquired last August. AMPTEK is opening up a new service center in our in Asus facility in Shanghai. This expanded capability has already led to 3 large orders for their x-ray fluorescent detectors from Chinese OEMs.
Lastly, let me touch on acquisitions. Over the last 21 months, we have completed 8 acquisitions, deployed nearly $1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $460 million in sales.
Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us during 2015 as we see this strategy as a key driver for the creation of shareholder value. It remains the primary focus of our strong cash flow. Our pipeline remains strong. We have the managerial and financial capacity, and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus.
Our balance sheet, cash flow and financing facilities provide as with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. We will continue to capitalize on our strong core competency of acquiring and integrating high-quality businesses that allows us to expand our presence in attractive market segments.
Turning to the outlook now for 2015. As a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, and a continued slow macro growth environment, we now anticipate overall 2015 revenue to be down slightly on a percentage basis from 2014. We expect organic growth to increase low single digits on a percentage basis which is at the low end of our initial guidance range. Currency is expected to be approximately a 4% headwind. We continue to expect earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over last year's adjusted earnings per share.
Overall, second quarter 2015 sales are expected to be flat versus the second quarter of 2014. We expect our earnings to be approximately $0.63 to $0.64 per diluted share in the quarter, up 3% to 5% over last year's second quarter.
Our solid backlog, strong portfolio businesses, proven operational excellence capability and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2015.
So in summary, I'm very pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter despite a number of macro headwinds. We are very confident in our ability to execute our growth strategies and continue to deliver a strong earnings growth.
Bob will now cover some of the financial details. And then we'll be very glad to answer your questions. Bob?"

As Frank noted, we had a good first quarter with very strong operating performance. I'll provide some further details.
In the quarter, some of the expenses were down slightly versus the last year's first quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales in the quarter, down from last year's first quarter level of 1.3%.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 29.3%, and in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter was a result of ongoing international tax planning activities.
For 2015, we estimate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate.
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 18.2% of sales in the first quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $14 million for the quarter. The full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million.
Depreciation and amortization was $35 million for the quarter. 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $145 million.
In the first quarter, we made a $50 million contribution to our U.S. defined-benefit pension plan to offset lower discount rates and a change in the mortality tables. Excluding this contribution, operating cash flow was $172 million in the quarter, up 7% over last year's first quarter. And free cash flow was $158 million or 111% of net income.
For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income.
Total debt was $1.67 billion at March 31, down slightly from the 2014 year-end.
Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $407 million. Resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at March 31 of 27.9%. At March 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives.
Our highest [indiscernible] per capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had a very good first quarter and we are well positioned for 2015.
Our ample financing capability and strong cash flows will continue to support our growth investments, both organically and through acquisitions."

But it's offset by really better performance or good performance in the midstream and downstream of sector. Interesting this morning, the BP and Total introduced their earnings and their oil and gas business were down sizably. But less than what estimates analyst had expected. And the reason was the same thing that their midstream, downstream businesses were very strong. So I think we're parallel in the market. And it shows the diversification of AMETEK's portfolio, where any single part of the portfolio, when it goes in decline, is not going to have that significant an impact on the overall business.

So how does that kind of inform, kind of your -- the bid ask around what you're trying to do in terms of acquiring some of these companies? Because clearly, even if you think your own core oil and gas exposure is manageable, you're going to, in terms of the rhetoric, in terms of getting deals on the go line, you're going to be fairly adamant about giving companies with oil and gas exposure, a bit of a haircut in terms of the valuation.

And we're very good at actually putting cycles in our models. We don't assume wherever a business is that that's going to be exactly what's going to happen in the future. So in oil and gas, we value these, take into account their cyclicality and some companies need to sell. So they're going to sell it at a point that maybe isn't desirable for them since the pricing could be a bit lower. But obviously, it's an opportunity for us. So I'm not shy about doing an acquisition in oil and gas, you just had to be clear in terms of what the projected earnings of that company is going to be. But I would say, just to reiterate, looking at our portfolio of acquisitions and some of the ones we're working on now, there's -- one of them, there's no oil and gas exposure, other one, there's a little bit.

I really don't want to use the word restructuring because this isn't what I would call a major restructuring, it's a realignment. The return on this investment is absolutely incredible.

I think what I will say is that, when we looked at all of the macro environment issues that are going on right now that most companies are reporting. Most companies took down their guidance. And I look at this that when I give a guidance range, there is a commitment from us to make those estimates. And that's really embodied in the culture and the approach that AMETEK has taken for many, many years. So as we saw the growth prospects coming down by a few points, we just didn't loiter around. We're going to take actions and we're going to realign. And I can sit here, and with confidence, tell you that our earnings are going to occur within the range that I talked about, and hopefully above that range. So I mean that's the sort of the top line premise. We looked at our businesses in light of where we were seeing the change in organic growth from our initial estimates. And obviously, we've already talked about the Process businesses, so we took some actions there. We took some actions in EMG, but the way we looked at it is, where are the businesses that are looking at a lower growth than what they originally had talked about. So your comment about this is different, I guess from the viewpoint that we haven't done it since 2008 or '09, it's probably correct. But if you look at the Zygo acquisition, we did, and are doing a lot of realignment there. And if you go back in history, we just have a very strong commitment to making the earnings numbers. And when we see an issue, we deal with it. And you just don't let the issue get behind you. In essence, you get in front of it. And that's what we did. And so I hope that helps with your question."

I'd be glad to do that. So if we start with EIG in Aerospace, EIG Aerospace had a very good first quarter with organic sales up mid-single-digits, reflecting strong growth in our regional and business by business, and the continued solid growth in our commercial OEM business. Organic orders were also very strong in the quarter, up low double digits, and we're very pleased with the continued strong performance in EIG Aerospace. This business is well-positioned to continue to drive strong growth. Given key wins on a number of next-generation commercial aircraft, including the A350, the 787 and the C919 as well as a number of business and regional jet platforms, including Honda Jet, Global Express and Agusta. For all of 2015, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up mid-single-digits, driven by the continued ramp-up of these key commercial OEM platforms, and solid growth in business and regional jets. We've already talked a bit about our Process businesses. Organic sales in the Process businesses were down low single digits in the quarter. That was against the difficult prior-year comparison. In 2015, we expect organic sales to be up low single digits over 2014. And as I've mentioned, we've reduced our full year growth estimates for the process businesses as a result of the impacts of the stronger U.S. dollar, and a slow global macro environment. Power & Industrial had a good first quarter. Organic sales were up mid-single-digits with solid growth across both our Power & Industrial businesses. And for 2015, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be up low single digits. So if you look at all of EIG then, we expect organic sales for the year to be up low single digits on a percentage basis. Scott, moving to the other part of AMETEK, EMG, our differentiated EMG businesses had a good first quarter. Organic sales were up low single digits, driven by solid growth in our Precision Motion Control and Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging businesses. And for 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up low single digits organically. And last part of our company, our legacy businesses, the Floorcare & Specialty Motors. Organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors businesses were flat in the first quarter for all of 2015, we expect this business to be up low single digits organically. And I'd like to mention that the management team in particular in the Floorcare & Specialty Motors is really doing an excellent job in this business. So if you sum those 2 parts of EMG, Scott, for all of 2015 for EMG, we expect organic growth of low single digits on a percentage basis. And then lastly, if you take EIG and EMG, as I mentioned in my opening comments for all of AMETEK, we expect low single-digit organic growth for the year conservatively, I would say."

The difference is that, this -- we were reporting overall for Asia growth numbers that we're extremely high for the last couple of years. And now, they're going to be more modest. You look at the GDP in China and points were running 10%, 11%, now they're forecasting 7%. So you compare that 7% GDP with the U.S. and Europe, it's still the fastest-growing part of the world.

AMETEK had a very good start to 2015 with double-digit earnings growth and excellent operating performance. Since we are seeing the effects of the continued strong U.S. dollar and a sluggish global economy, we proactively took actions in the first quarter to mitigate these effects. These actions position us to deliver earnings in line with our initial guidance. The realignment cost in the quarter totaled $15.9 million or approximately $0.04 per diluted share. The savings resulting from this realignment is about $40 million in 2015 and $55 million on an annualized basis. We were very selective in these actions, so our future growth will not be impacted. All financial results and commentary on the call today will be on an adjusted basis, excluding these realignment costs.
Now on to the financial results. In the first quarter, sales increased 1% to $984.1 million. Organic growth was also up 1%, while acquisitions added 4%, and foreign currency was a larger-than-anticipated 4% headwind in the quarter. Operating income for the first quarter increased 7% to a record $236.9 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was superb at a record 24.1%, a 140 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2014. Net income was up 9% to $152.9 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were up 11% over last year's first quarter and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating working capital was 18.2% of sales in the quarter.
Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very good first quarter. For the quarter, sales were up 4% to $593.8 million, driven by solid organic growth in our Aerospace, Power & Industrial businesses, plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Zygo and AMPTEK. Internal growth was flat, while acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. EIG's operating income increased 7% to $160.5 million, and operating margins were 27% in the quarter, up 70 basis points from last year's first quarter.
The Electromechanical Group also performed extremely well in the quarter. Overall sales were down 3% to $390.3 million as a result of a 5% foreign currency headwind. Organic sales were up 2%. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $88.5 million, and operating margins were superb at a record 22.7% in the quarter, up 190 basis points from the previous year.
Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. The solid and balanced execution of these growth strategies by our employees is the principal reason for our ongoing success. Each of these strategies will continue to play a key role in driving our growth.
First, I will touch on Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. We continued to focus on operational improvements to help drive both our competitive and financial success. Our results this quarter reflect the tremendous impact of our Operational Excellence initiatives as we were able to expand operating margins 140 basis points to a record 24.1%. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continual operational improvements and efficiencies through their businesses by leveraging the Operational Excellence tools we have put in place throughout the company.
One such initiative is our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities, where we continue to deliver exceptional results. For all of 2015, we anticipate approximately $70 million in savings from our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. Overall, we now anticipate approximately $145 million of total Operational Excellence savings in 2015, up from our initial estimate of $105 million of total savings. This $40 million increase in Operational Excellence savings is driven by the realignment actions we started in the first quarter.
Now moving to New Products. New Product Development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently increased our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2015, we expect to spend about $210 million on RD&E or approximately 5% of total sales. We're excited about some recent New Product introductions. The new Talysurf i-Series surface and contour measurement tool from our Taylor Hobson business has been very well-received since its recent launch. This high-resolution device offers automated simultaneous surface and contour inspection. It features powerful software capabilities for the analysis of surface, finish and form and a unique temperature compensation system that ensures consistent performance regardless of the operating environment.
Our TMC business recently introduced their latest new product, the Stage-Base 450. This product represents the latest generation of vibration and motion cancellation technology from TMC. The Stage-Base 450 was designed specifically to be the primary vibration cancellation system for high-precision semiconductor tools, an attractive high-growth market. It incorporates technical advances to compensate for building floor vibration, while increasing semiconductor wafer processing throughput.
Lastly, our Electronic Components and Packaging business, a leading provider of electronic and electromechanical packages for harsh environment applications, unveiled its most recent design breakthrough for microelectronic packaging. This design is a patent-pending S-Bend Feedthrough that provides high fidelity for radio frequency signals. The innovative design satisfies the need for higher frequencies and greater bandwidth in optical communications with capability greater than 80 gigahertz. The market feedback on this new design has been very strong. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was strong at 22% of sales in the quarter, and that's up from 20% of sales in last year's first quarter.
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion remains an important part of our long-term growth as we look to expand our presence in attractive higher-growth market segments and geographies. We are making investments globally to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities in these international markets. International sales represent 52% of our total sales in the quarter, and we continued to see strong growth in China, where first quarter organic growth was up mid-teens.
Also, as part of our acquisition integration process, we identify opportunities for acquired businesses to leverage AMETEK's global infrastructure to help them quickly and efficiently expand globally. Acquired businesses have had tremendous success in expanding their global manufacturing sales and service capabilities to penetrate new markets. One recent example is AMPTEK, which we acquired last August. AMPTEK is opening up a new service center in our Asus facility in Shanghai. This expanded capability has already led to 3 large orders for their x-ray fluorescent detectors from Chinese OEMs.
Lastly, let me touch on acquisitions. Over the last 21 months, we have completed 8 acquisitions, deployed nearly $1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $460 million in sales. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us during 2015 as we see this strategy as a key driver for the creation of shareholder value. It remains the primary focus of our strong cash flow. Our pipeline remains strong. We have the managerial and financial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our balance sheet, cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. We will continue to capitalize on our strong core competency of acquiring and integrating high-quality businesses that allows us to expand our presence in attractive market segments.
Turning to the outlook now for 2015. As a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar and a continued slow macro growth environment, we now anticipate overall 2015 revenue to be down slightly on a percentage basis from 2014. We expect organic growth to increase low single digits on a percentage basis, which is at the low end of our initial guidance range. Currency is expected to be approximately a 4% headwind. We continue to expect earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over last year's adjusted earnings per share.
Overall second quarter 2015 sales are expected to be flat versus the second quarter of 2014. We expect our earnings to be approximately $0.63 to $0.64 per diluted share in the quarter, up 3% to 5% over last year's second quarter. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven Operational Excellence capability and a successful focus on Strategic Acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2015.
So in summary, I'm very pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter. Despite a number of macro headwinds, we are very confident in our ability to execute our growth strategies and continue to deliver strong earnings growth.
Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be very glad to answer your questions. Bob?"

As Frank noted, we had a good first quarter with very strong operating performance. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, selling expenses were down slightly versus the last year's first quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales in the quarter, down from last year's first quarter level of 1.3%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 29.3% and in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter was a result of an ongoing international tax planning activities.
For 2015, we estimate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 18.2% of sales in the first quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $14 million for the quarter. The full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. Depreciation and amortization was $35 million for the quarter. 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $145 million.
In the first quarter, we made a $50 million contribution to our U.S.-defined benefit pension plan to offset lower discount rates and a change in the mortality tables. Excluding this contribution, operating cash flow was $172 million in the quarter, up 7% over last year's first quarter. And free cash flow was $158 million or 111% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income.
Total debt was $1.67 billion at March 31, down slightly from the 2014 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $407 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at March 31 of 27.9%. At March 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, we had very good first quarter, and we are well positioned for 2015. Our ample financing capability and strong cash flows will continue to support our growth investments, both organically and through acquisitions."

Well, in terms of oil and gas, we had given you an estimate at the beginning of the year that we thought we were going to be impacted about $40 million in our overall sales as a result of the oil and gas downturn. And in fact, that estimate is holding. It's roughly what we're seeing from the oil and gas downturn. The effect is obviously significant on the upstream part of our business. But it's offset by really better performance -- or good performance in the midstream and downstream sector. Interesting this morning that BP and Total introduced their earnings, and their oil and gas business were down sizably, but less than what estimates analyst's had expected. And the reason was the same thing, that their midstream and downstream businesses were very strong. So I think we're parallelling the market, and it shows the diversification of AMETEK's portfolio, where any single part of the portfolio, when it goes in decline, is not going to have that significant an impact on the overall business. So that's how I would characterize the oil and gas segment for us."

So that question is a great one. If you look at the realignment that we did, we focused it on the operating side of the company, I mean, our factories and those parts of the business that will be impacted by a bit of a slower growth environment than what we had originally intended. So we have done some employment reductions. We have done some belt-tightening.

I mean, if you look across our businesses and take a look at EIG, for instance, our Aerospace and Power & Industrial businesses performed very well in the quarter, but our Process businesses were the ones that weakened and what caused us to take a more conservative view on the organic growth. And obviously, the oil and gas impact that I talked about is in that Process segment. But in addition, when we look at the weakened U.S. economy -- or excuse me, Europe economy and the weakened or slowing Asia economy, that has, across our businesses, the most significant effect on our Process businesses. So that was the key factor in why our organic growth in the EIG part of the business was a bit down from where we thought it was going to be at the end of the first quarter. So I think, if you focus on the Process businesses, you focus on the global part of the Process businesses because a major part of those businesses in terms of percentage is higher than our other businesses outside the U.S., that is a predominant area in the company that took the impact."

So how does that kind of inform kind of your -- the bid ask around what you're trying to do in terms of acquiring some of these companies? Because clearly, even if you think your own core oil and gas exposure is manageable, you're going to -- in terms of the rhetoric, in terms of just getting deals on the goal line, you're going to be fairly adamant about giving companies with oil and gas exposure a bit of a haircut in terms of the valuation.

I mean, if you specifically take the question on oil and gas, again, as I mentioned, the oil and gas exposure for AMETEK is not that significant. And so when we look at our portfolio of deals, many of the deals we're looking at do not have oil and gas exposure. Having said that, I view it as an opportunity with companies that have oil and gas exposure and that we're going to pay a multiple based on their earnings and the expectations that we see. And we're very good at actually putting cycles in our models. We don't assume wherever a business is that that's going to be exactly what's going to happen in the future. So in oil and gas, we value these, take into account their cyclicality. And some companies need to sell, so they're going to settle at a point that maybe isn't desirable for them since the pricing could be a bit lower. But obviously, it's an opportunity for us. So I'm not shy about doing an acquisition in oil and gas. You just have to be clear in terms of what the projected earnings of that company is going to be. But I would say, just to reiterate, looking at our portfolio of acquisitions and some of the ones we're working on now, there's -- one of them, there's no oil and gas exposure.

And I look at this that when I give a guidance range, there is a commitment from us to make those estimates, and that's really embodied in the culture and the approach that AMETEK has taken for many, many years. So as we saw the growth prospects coming down by a few points, we just didn't wait around. We're going to take actions, and we're going to realign. And I can sit here and, with confidence, tell you that our earnings are going to occur within the range that I talked about and, hopefully, above that range. So I mean, that's the sort of the top line premise. We looked at our businesses in light of where we were seeing the change in organic growth from our initial estimates. And obviously, we've already talked about the Process businesses, so we took some actions there. We took some actions in EMG, but the way we looked at it is where are the businesses that are looking at a lower growth than what they originally had talked about. So your comment about this is different. I guess, from the viewpoint that we haven't done it since 2008 or '09, it's probably correct. But if you look at the Zygo acquisition we did and are doing a lot of realignment there and if you go back in history, we just have a very strong commitment to making the earnings numbers. And when we see an issue, we deal with it. And you just don't let the issue get behind you, in essence, you get in front of it. And that's what we did. And so I hope that helps with your question."

So if we start with EIG in Aerospace, EIG Aerospace had a very good first quarter with organic sales up mid-single digits, reflecting strong growth in our regional and business -- geo business and the continued solid growth in our commercial OEM business. Organic orders were also very strong in the quarter, up low double digits, and we're very pleased with the continued strong performance in EIG Aerospace. This business is well-positioned to continue to drive strong growth, given key wins on a number of next-generation commercial aircraft, including the A350, the 787 and the C919 as well as a number of business and regional jet platforms, including HondaJet, Global Express and Agusta. For all of 2015, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up mid-single digits, driven by the continued ramp-up of these key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets. We've already talked a bit about our Process businesses. Organic sales in the Process businesses were down low single digits in the quarter. That was against the difficult prior year comparison. In 2015, we expect organic sales to be up low single digits over 2014. And as I've mentioned, we've reduced our full year growth estimates for the Process businesses as a result of the impacts of the stronger U.S. dollar and a slow global macro environment. Power & Industrial had a good first quarter. Organic sales were up mid-single digits with solid growth across both our Power & Industrial businesses. And for 2015, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be up low single digits. So if you look at all of EIG then, we expect organic sales for the year to be up low single digits on a percentage basis. Scott, moving to the other part of AMETEK, EMG, our differentiated EMG businesses had a good first quarter. Organic sales were up low single digits, driven by solid growth in our Precision Motion Control and Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging businesses. And for 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up low single digits organically. And the last part of our company, our legacy businesses of Floorcare & Specialty Motors, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors businesses were flat in the first quarter. For all of 2015, we expect this business to be up low single digits organically. And I'd like to mention that the management team, in particular, in Floorcare & Specialty Motors is really doing an excellent job in this business. So if you sum those 2 parts of EMG, Scott, for all of 2015 for EMG, we expect organic growth of low single digits on a percentage basis.

AMETEK had a very good start to 2015 with double-digit earnings growth and excellent operating performance.

AMETEK had a very good start to 2015 with double-digit earnings growth and excellent operating performance. Since we are seeing the effects of a continued strong U.S. dollar and a sluggish global economy, we proactively took actions in the first quarter to mitigate these effects. These actions position us to deliver earnings in line with our initial guidance. The realignment cost in the quarter totaled $15.9 million or approximately $0.04 per diluted share. The savings resulting from this realignment is about $40 million in 2015 and $55 million on an annualized basis. We were very selective in these actions, so our future growth will not be impacted. All financial results and commentary on the call today will be on an adjusted basis, excluding these realignment costs.
Now on to the financial results. In the first quarter, sales increased 1% to $984.1 million. Organic growth was also up 1%, while acquisitions added 4%, and foreign currency was a larger-than-anticipated 4% headwind in the quarter. Operating income for the first quarter increased 7% to a record $236.9 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was superb at a record 24.1%, a 140 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2014. Net income was up 9% to $152.9 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were up 11% over last year's first quarter and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating working capital was 18.2% of sales in the quarter.
Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very good first quarter. For the quarter, sales were up 4% to $593.8 million, driven by solid organic growth in our Aerospace, Power & Industrial businesses, plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Zygo and AMPTEK. Internal growth was flat, while acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. EIG's operating income increased 7% to $160.5 million, and operating margins were 27% in the quarter, up 70 basis points from last year's first quarter.
The Electromechanical Group also performed extremely well in the quarter. Overall sales were down 3% to $390.3 million as a result of a 5% foreign currency headwind. Organic sales were up 2%. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $88.5 million, and operating margins were superb at a record 22.7% in the quarter, up 190 basis points from the previous year.
Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. The solid and balanced execution of these growth strategies by our employees is the principal reason for our ongoing success. Each of these strategies will continue to play a key role in driving our growth.
First, I will touch on Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. We continue to focus on operational improvements that help drive both our competitive and financial success. Our results this quarter reflect the tremendous impact of our Operational Excellence initiatives as we were able to expand operating margins 140 basis points to a record 24.1%. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continual operational improvements and efficiencies through their businesses by leveraging the Operational Excellence tools we have put in place throughout the company.
One such initiative is our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities, where we continue to deliver exceptional results. For all of 2015, we anticipate approximately $70 million in savings from our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. Overall, we now anticipate approximately $145 million of total Operational Excellence savings in 2015, up from our initial estimate of $105 million of total savings. This $40 million increase in Operational Excellence savings is driven by the realignment actions we started in the first quarter.
Now moving to New Products. New Product Development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently increased our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2015, we expect to spend about $210 million on RD&E or approximately 5% of total sales. We're excited about some recent New Product introductions. The new Talysurf i-Series surface and contour measurement tool from our Taylor Hobson business has been very well received since its recent launch. This high-resolution device offers automated simultaneous surface and contour inspection. It features powerful software capabilities for the analysis of surface, finish and form and a unique temperature compensation system that ensures consistent performance regardless of the operating environment.
Our TMC business recently introduced their latest new product, the Stage-Base 450. This product represents the latest generation of vibration and motion cancellation technology from TMC. The Stage-Base 450 was designed specifically to be the primary vibration cancellation system for high-precision semiconductor tools, an attractive high-growth market. It incorporates technical advances to compensate for building floor vibration while increasing semiconductor wafer processing throughput.
Lastly, our Electronic Components and Packaging business, a leading provider of electronic and electromechanical packages for harsh environment applications, unveiled its most recent design breakthrough for microelectronic packaging. This design is a patent-pending S-Bend Feedthrough that provides high fidelity for radio frequency signals. The innovative design satisfies the need for higher frequencies and greater bandwidth in optical communications with capability greater than 80 gigahertz. The market feedback on this new design has been very strong. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was strong at 22% of sales in the quarter, and that's up from 20% of sales in last year's first quarter.
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion remains an important part of our long-term growth as we look to expand our presence in attractive higher-growth market segments and geographies. We are making investments globally to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities in these international markets. International sales represent 52% of our total sales in the quarter, and we continue to see strong growth in China, where first quarter organic growth was up mid-teens.
Also, as part of our acquisition integration process, we identify opportunities for acquired businesses to leverage AMETEK's global infrastructure to help them quickly and efficiently expand globally. Acquired businesses have had tremendous success in expanding their global manufacturing, sales and service capabilities to penetrate new markets. One recent example is AMPTEK, which we acquired last August. AMPTEK is opening up a new service center in our Asus facility in Shanghai. This expanded capability has already led to 3 large orders for their x-ray fluorescent detectors from Chinese OEMs.
Lastly, let me touch on acquisitions. Over the last 21 months, we have completed 8 acquisitions, deployed nearly $1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $460 million in sales. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us during 2015, as we see this strategy as a key driver for the creation of shareholder value. It remains the primary focus of our strong cash flow. Our pipeline remains strong. We have the managerial and financial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our balance sheet, cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. We will continue to capitalize on our strong core competency of acquiring and integrating high-quality businesses that allows us to expand our presence in attractive market segments.
Turning to the outlook now for 2015. As a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar and a continued slow macro growth environment, we now anticipate overall 2015 revenue to be down slightly on a percentage basis from 2014. We expect organic growth to increase low single digits on a percentage basis, which is at the low end of our initial guidance range. Currency is expected to be approximately a 4% headwind. We continue to expect earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over last year's adjusted earnings per share.
Overall second quarter 2015 sales are expected to be flat versus the second quarter of 2014. We expect our earnings to be approximately $0.63 to $0.64 per diluted share in the quarter, up 3% to 5% over last year's second quarter. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven Operational Excellence capability and a successful focus on Strategic Acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2015.
So in summary, I'm very pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter. Despite a number of macro headwinds, we are very confident in our ability to execute our growth strategies and continue to deliver strong earnings growth.
Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be very glad to answer your questions. Bob?"

As Frank noted, we had a good first quarter with very strong operating performance. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, selling expenses were down slightly versus the last year's first quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales in the quarter, down from last year's first quarter level of 1.3%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 29.3% and in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of an ongoing international tax planning activities.
For 2015, we estimate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 18.2% of sales in the first quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $14 million for the quarter. The full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. Depreciation and amortization was $35 million for the quarter. 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $145 million.
In the first quarter, we made a $50 million contribution to our U.S.-defined benefit pension plan to offset lower discount rates and a change in the mortality tables. Excluding this contribution, operating cash flow was $172 million in the quarter, up 7% over last year's first quarter. And free cash flow was $158 million or 111% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income.
Total debt was $1.67 billion at March 31, down slightly from the 2014 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $407 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at March 31 of 27.9%. At March 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, we had a very good first quarter, and we are well positioned for 2015. Our ample financing capability and strong cash flows will continue to support our growth investments, both organically and through acquisitions."

Well, in terms of oil and gas, we had given you an estimate at the beginning of the year that we thought we were going to be impacted about $40 million in our overall sales as a result of the oil and gas downturn. And in fact, that estimate is holding. It's roughly what we're seeing from the oil and gas downturn. The effect is obviously significant on the upstream part of our business. But it's offset by really better performance -- or good performance in the midstream and downstream sector. Interesting this morning that BP and Total introduced their earnings, and their oil and gas business were down sizably, but less than what estimates -- analysts had expected. And the reason was the same thing, that their midstream and downstream businesses were very strong. So I think we're parallelling the market, and it shows the diversification of AMETEK's portfolio, where any single part of the portfolio, when it goes in decline, is not going to have that significant an impact on the overall business. So that's how I would characterize the oil and gas segment for us."

But in addition, when we look at the weakened U.S. economy -- or excuse me, Europe economy and the weakened or slowing Asia economy, that has, across our businesses, the most significant effect on our Process businesses.

Because clearly, even if you think your own core oil and gas exposure is manageable, you're going to -- in terms of the rhetoric, in terms of getting deals on the goal line, you're going to be fairly adamant about giving companies with oil and gas exposure a bit of a haircut in terms of the valuation.

Having said that, I view it as an opportunity with companies that have oil and gas exposure and that we're going to pay a multiple based on their earnings and the expectations that we see. And we're very good at actually putting cycles in our models. We don't assume wherever a business is that that's going to be exactly what's going to happen in the future. So in oil and gas, we value these, take into account their cyclicality. And some companies need to sell, so they're going to settle at a point that maybe isn't desirable for them since the pricing could be a bit lower, but obviously, is an opportunity for us. So I'm not shy about doing an acquisition in oil and gas. You just have to be clear in terms of what the projected earnings of that company is going to be. But I would say, just to reiterate, looking at our portfolio of acquisitions and some of the ones we're working on now, there's -- one of them, there's no oil and gas exposure.

And I look at this that when I give a guidance range, there is a commitment from us to make those estimates, and that's really embodied in the culture and the approach that AMETEK has taken for many, many years. So as we saw the growth prospects coming down by a few points, we just didn't wait around. We're going to take actions, and we're going to realign. And I can sit here and, with confidence, tell you that our earnings are going to occur within the range that I talked about and, hopefully, above that range. So I mean, that's the sort of the top line premise. We looked at our businesses in light of where we were seeing the change in organic growth from our initial estimates. And obviously, we've already talked about the Process businesses, so we took some actions there. We took some actions in EMG, but the way we looked at it is where are the businesses that are looking at a lower growth than what they originally had talked about. So your comment about this is different, I guess from the viewpoint that we haven't done it since 2008 or '09, it's probably correct. But if you look at the Zygo acquisition we did and are doing a lot of realignment there and if you go back in history, we just have a very strong commitment to making the earnings numbers. And when we see an issue, we deal with it. And you just don't let the issue get behind you, in essence, you get in front of it. And that's what we did. And so I hope that helps with your question."

So if we start with EIG in Aerospace, EIG Aerospace had a very good first quarter with organic sales up mid-single digits, reflecting strong growth in our regional and business jet business and the continued solid growth",486,"Yes, sure, I'd be glad to do that. So if we start with EIG in Aerospace, EIG Aerospace had a very good first quarter with organic sales up mid-single digits, reflecting strong growth in our regional and business jet business and the continued solid growth in our commercial OEM business. Organic orders were also very strong in the quarter, up low double digits, and we're very pleased with the continued strong performance in EIG Aerospace. This business is well positioned to continue to drive strong growth, given key wins on a number of next-generation commercial aircraft, including the A350, the 787 and the C919 as well as a number of business and regional jet platforms, including HondaJet, Global Express and Agusta. For all of 2015, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up mid-single digits, driven by the continued ramp-up of these key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets. We've already talked a bit about our Process businesses. Organic sales in the Process businesses were down low single digits in the quarter. That was against a difficult prior year comparison. In 2015, we expect organic sales to be up low single digits over 2014. And as I've mentioned, we've reduced our full year growth estimates for the Process businesses as a result of the impacts of the stronger U.S. dollar and the slow global macro environment. Power & Industrial had a good first quarter. Organic sales were up mid-single digits with solid growth across both our Power & Industrial businesses. And for 2015, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be up low single digits. So if you look at all of EIG then, we expect organic sales for the year to be up low single digits on a percentage basis. Scott, moving to the other part of AMETEK, EMG, our differentiated EMG businesses had a good first quarter. Organic sales were up low single digits, driven by solid growth in our Precision Motion Control and Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging businesses. And for 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up low single digits organically. And the last part of our company, our legacy businesses of Floorcare & Specialty Motors, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors businesses were flat in the first quarter. For all of 2015, we expect this business to be up low single digits organically. And I'd like to mention that the management team, in particular, in Floorcare & Specialty Motors is really doing an excellent job in this business. So if you sum those 2 parts of EMG, Scott, for all of 2015 for EMG, we expect organic growth of low single digits on a percentage basis. And then lastly, if you take EIG and EMG, as I mentioned in my opening comments, for all of AMETEK, we expect low single-digit organic growth for the year conservatively, I would say."

The difference is that this -- we were reporting, overall for Asia, growth numbers that were extremely high for the last couple years. And now they're going to be more modest. You look at the GDP in China, at points was running 10%, 11%. Now they're forecasting 7%.

AMETEK had a strong second quarter with excellent operating performance. We delivered a record level of earnings at the high end of our guidance range despite what remains a slow global growth environment. We also continue to be very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we acquired Global Tubes, a leading manufacturer of high-precision, small diameter metal tubing and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed the acquisition of the surface inspection systems division of Cognex Corporation. 
I will provide some further details in our continued strong acquisition activity in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 1% to $1 billion. Organic sales were flat, while acquisitions added 5% and currency was a 4% headwind. Operating income for the quarter was very strong. It increased 4% to a record $240.3 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.9%, a 50 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2015. 
Net income rose 4% to $155.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.64, up 5% over last year's second quarter, both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was up 5% to $163 million. 
Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group ha a very strong quarter. Sales were up 4% to $596.5 million and strengthened our Aerospace business plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Zygo and Amptek in our process business. 
Organic sales were up 1%, acquisitions added 7% and foreign currency was a 4% headwind. EIG's operating performance was outstanding. Operating income increased 8% to $164 million and operating margins were 27.5%, up 110 basis points from last year's second quarter. 
The Electromechanical Group also had a good quarter with strong operating performance. Overall sales were down 2% to $407.3 million. The lower sales were driven largely by currency headwinds with the contribution from the acquisition of Global Tubes, a partial offset. Organic sales were down 2%, driven by continued weak global macro conditions. Foreign currency was a 5-point headwind and acquisitions contributed 4 points. 
EMG's operating income declined 3% to $89.3 million, while operating margins were very solid at 21.9%. 
Now turning to our Four Growth Strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. We continue to remain very active acquiring 2 excellent businesses since our last earnings call. Thus far, in 2015, we have deployed approximately $360 million in capital and acquired approximately $180 million in revenue on these 2 acquisitions. 
Over the last 24 months, we've acquired 10 businesses, deployed over $1.3 billion in capital and acquired nearly $650 million in revenue. Our acquisition pipeline remains very strong. 
Now let me provide some highlights on the 2 recent acquisitions. First, Global Tubes. Global Tubes manufactures high-position, small diameter metal tubing from stainless steel, nickel alloys, zirconium alloys and titanium for very specialized applications. These highly specialized products are manufactured of very tight tolerances and customer specifications for demanding applications within the aerospace, medical, nuclear and oil and gas markets. 
Global Tubes is a really good strategic with our specialty metals business. It allows us to expand our product offering into a number of attractive market segments, while also expanding our specialty metals presence within Europe. Global Tubes is comprised of 2 businesses: Superior Tube based in Collegeville, Pennsylvania; and Fine Tubes based in the U.K. Global Tubes has annual sales of approximately $120 million. 
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of the surface inspection systems division of Cognex Corporation. The surface infections division or SISD develops and manufactures software enabled vision systems used to inspect surfaces of continuously processed materials for flaws and defects. SISD is proprietary high-speed defect recognition technology, detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. This business is also an excellent strategic acquisition for AMETEK as it expands our presence in the nondestructive process inspection market. 
In addition, SISD will be able to leverage a number of AMETEK's complementary technologies and products within these vision systems. SISD is headquartered in Hayward, California and has annual sales of about $60 million. 
Now turning to global and market expansion. Global market expansion continues to be an important driver for our growth to the expansion of our presence in attractive higher with market segments and geographic regions. In the second quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities. For Example, we continue to make sizable investments in both India and Serbia to drive our global and market expansion initiatives. 
In India, our business continues to add sales and service capabilities to support increased demand for our products and technology. Additionally, we've been very pleased with the tremendous success of our engineering center of excellence in India. As a result, we continue to expand and broaden our RD&E capabilities and infrastructure in that region. In Serbia, we have a low-cost manufacturing facility, which was acquired as part of the Dunkermotoren acquisition in 2012. This facility primarily serves our precision motion control customers in Europe and the Middle East. As other AMETEK businesses identify incremental growth opportunities in Europe and especially the Middle East, we are expanding our presence within Serbia to adequately support their growth. 
Now turning to new product development. We continue to see excellent results from our new product development efforts. Our businesses are doing a great job developing new products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets or applications. We will continue to make sizable investments in RD&E to ensure we are developing the right products to serve our customers and target markets. 
In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E or approximately 5% of sales. We've made a number of recent new product introductions. Spectra [ph] Analytic Instruments, global leader in instruments for advanced elemental analysis, introduced their new portable spectral scale, x-ray fluorescence spectrometer designed for outline use. This durable and compact x-ray analyzer delivers reliable, precise and fast laboratory quality elemental composition monitoring and quality control testing for the field or manufacturing floor. The new Spectra scalp delivers results on-site, eliminating the need to transport samples back to a quality control laboratory. 
Zygo, a leader in optical metrology solutions, high-precision optics and optical assemblies, released its verifier high-precision large aperture for zoom interferometer. It is the latest addition to Zygo's industry-leading line of phase shifting laser parameters and is designed to measure large planal surfaces such as mirrors, semiconductor wafers and wafer chucks. The product is a compact, cost effective and complete turnkey solution for the highly accurate characterization of flat surfaces up to 12 inches in diameter. To further increase precision and reliability, this new Zygo product incorporates a vibration isolation platform from another AMETEK business, our TMC business. 
Lastly, Solidstate Controls, a recognized leader in highly customized uninterruptible power supplies, has released its DSE UPS System. This new DSE System is an industry first. It combines the robust design of resonant transformer with the enhance digital communications, monitoring and diagnostic capabilities of a pulse lift modulation UPS system. It is a true online, double conversion UPS system that provides highly reliable, clean and regulated power for critical AC loads and demanding process control applications. 
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 24% of sales in the second quarter, up from 22% in last year's second quarter. So very high number, which we're very proud of. 
Lastly, I would touch on operational excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. We continue to see tremendous results from our various operational excellence initiatives. Our teams continue to do an excellent job driving operation improvements in their business by leveraging the numerous operational excellence tools we have in place throughout the company. In low-growth environment, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance. So we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. 
Overall, in 2015, we anticipate approximately $145 million of total operational excellence savings and we believe that's a conservative number. The largest contributor to this savings is our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, where we expect approximately $70 million in savings in 2015. 
Turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. We anticipate 2015 revenue to be up low-single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Organic growth is expected to be roughly flat for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. We continue to expect adjusted earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over last year's adjusted earnings per share. 
Third quarter 2015 sales are expected to be approximately flat versus the third quarter of 2014. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.64 to $0.65 per diluted share in the third quarter, up 3% to 5% over last year's third quarter. 
So in summary, we delivered strong results in the second quarter with record earnings. While global growth remains challenging, we are very confident in our ability to execute on our growth strategies and deliver excellent earnings growth. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. 
Bob will now cover some of the financial details and then we'll be glad to take your questions."

As Frank noted, we have a good second quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. 
In the quarter, selling expenses were down slightly versus last year's second quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales, slightly above last year's second quarter level of 1.2%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.7%, down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 28%. for 2015, we expect our tax rate to be between 28% and 28.5%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from its full year rate. 
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.1% of sales in the second quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital expenditures were $12 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $37 million for the quarter and 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. 
Operating cash flow was $163 million in the second quarter, up 5% over last year second quarter. The free cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 8% over last year's second quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 115% of net income. Total debt was $1.67 billion at June 30, down slightly from the 2014 year end. This amount reflects the second funding from the private placement agreement we entered into last September. This funding of $50 million was perceived on June 15 and was used to pay down revolver debt. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $327 million, resulting in the net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 27.9%. 
At June 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. During the second quarter, we acquired Global Tubes. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired the surface inspection systems division of Cognex Corporation, bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2015 to approximately $360 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, we had a very strong second quarter and delivered solid operating results. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows."

We saw s",548,"Scott, I'll be glad to go through my normal discussion of the various subparts of the 2 groups. And I'll start with EIG. EIG Aerospace had a very solid second quarter. Overall growth was up low single-digits against the very difficult comparison. We saw strong growth in our regional and business jet business and continued solid growth in our Commercial business. EIG Aerospace continues to gain additional content on a number of attractive platforms, really as a result of their strong technology and service capabilities. Very importantly, thus far, in 2015, we have won over $400 million in new life program awards on over 20 different platforms, including the Rolls-Royce Trans 7000 Engine on the Airbus 330 Neo. Our team in this business has really done an excellent job. For all of 2015, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up mid-single digits, driven by the continued ramp up of key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets. The second part of EIG is our process businesses. Overall, process sales were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Overall growth benefited from the acquisitions that we did in process. They were Zygo and Amptek and from solid growth in our Material Analysis and Ultraprecision Technologies businesses. Organic sales were flat as a result of weakness in our upstream oil and gas business. The weakness know we've seen in oil and gas is in line with our original expectations at the start of the year. In 2015, we expect organic sales growth to be down slightly versus 2014. 
And the last part of EIG is Power and Industrial. Our Power and Industrial businesses had a very good second quarter. Organic sales were up mid-single digits with solid growth across both our Power and Industrial businesses. And in 2015, for the whole year, we expect organic sales for industrial to be up low single-digits. So if you take the sum of those 3 for all of EIG, we're expecting organic sales to be approximately flat for 2015. 
Moving to EMG. Starting with the differentiated part of EMG. Overall sales were down low single-digits on a percentage basis in the quarter, as foreign currency headwinds were only partially offset by the contribution from the Global Tubes acquisition. Organically, we saw solid growth in our Precision Motion Control business, but weakness in our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging business due to continued soft macro environment. for 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be approximately flat organically. And the last part of the company, our Floor Care and Specialty Motors business. Organic sales in our Floor Care and Specialty Motors business were flat in the second quarter and for 2015, we expect sales for this business to be up low single-digits organically. So in 2015, for all of EMG, thus, we expect roughly flat organic sales growth on a percentage basis. So sort of that -- the bottom line here is with organic growth, very difficult for just about every industrial company. The focus really becomes cost. And we've done an excellent job, as typical of AMETEK, in terms of reducing our cost structure and obviously, getting record earnings and record performance as a result. So Scott, that's sort of a recap of what you asked for."

If we look at our Power business and you break it down, there's really 3 parts to the Power business. There's a Test & Measurement piece of the power business. There's a battery backup piece of the Power business. And then there's instrumentation for the generation transmission and distribution part of our Power business.

It's a great question. Fortunately, AMETEK is relatively balanced on revenues and costs around the world, but the strong dollar just cause competitive situations and we're niche markets, we're leaders in niche markets and largely, what we see is that the delay of projects, when people can't get the U.S. dollars necessary to go forward with the project, those are usually delayed 3, 6 months to go back and get the money. This has happened before and certainly we're seeing some of that. Because we're at the top our niches and technology, we're not seeing a lot of negative impacts but certainly anytime their currency changes, there are some businesses that are impacted by the stronger dollar. In cases where we're manufacturing in the U.S, and we have competitors in Europe or Japan, the environment is tougher. Conversely, AMETEK does manufacture in Europe and Asia and we have to take advantage of that to our competitive advantage. So it's certainly an issue, but I think we're managing it well. We've done an analysis business by business, every business unit and the company. And we have plans in place to relocate to lower-cost regions. We have, as Frank mentioned, we have 24% of sales from new products. We're really emphasizing new product development to enhance our competitive advantage. So it's an issue for every company. There is a competitive issue with it, but we're managing it well."

So that it's just difficult to find a time to build some of the projects. So I doubt very much that we're going to spend the full $75 million. In terms of free cash flow, usually in the first part of the year, we always run below net income. But we you look at the full year and actually extract that $50 million in pension contributions that you mentioned, we actually expect free cash flow to net income to be about 115% of sales. And that's probably a conservative number. I mean, we're just throwing off significant cash and it's sort of a hallmark of AMETEK and the second half will be very strong in terms of cash generation."

So from the viewpoint of the customer, he's getting a highly specialized motor, whereas we don't have to do a lot of engineering in order to make that happen. So this is, as you point out, very diverse. And what this business has recently done is expanded globally. They were predominantly a U.S. business. And with the acquisition of Dunkermotoren in Germany and real focus on growing in Asia, this company has diversified its global reach and it's basically looking at the stronger parts of the industrial market and being able to serve them well. So to me, this is an example of really strong management in a sort of difficult global macro environment that is actually taking advantage of their approach to the market and therefore the organic growth has been very good."

My view of it is that we're sort of bouncing along bottom and I think what you're hearing from other companies is that there's a little bit of an uptick and then it comes back down. So you're sort of on that cycle of bouncing along bottom. Our growth here is purely not market driven. It's from ew product wins. We have major wins on Honda Jet, for instance. We have major wins on other platforms like the Global Express, like Gulfstream Aircraft. And you sum those and actually in the second quarter, our business -- regional jet business was up organically, the most AMETEK. It was up low double digits.

And it really depends on how significant a downturn would be. We have sized the company as we think is appropriate for the guidance that we provided to you, both in terms of overall sales, organic sales and what we're expecting for the second half. You use the term rollover. If we're talking about a slight degradation, we'll be able to handle that. You just look, for instance, at the price of oil in the last few days, where it has gone a little bit lower than actually when we put our presentation together here. But when we looked at it, we said, it's not going to be significant to us. It could be a little bit slower than what we expect and we'll deal with it. But if there's a major downturn, this is sort of the hallmark of AMETEK that there are always substantial things that you can do in the cost structure of the company. And our approach to our businesses were we're highly diversified with lots of manufacturing facilities. There are still opportunities for us to do more. We can do additional consolidation of facilities. We could be even more aggressive on our material cost reductions. We could move more production to low-cost locales. And we got in a major downturn, we would shift some of our focus, which as Dave mentioned and I mentioned, is more right now in RD&E and the acquisition front, we would move even more of the to the cost side of the business. And if I could just look back historically, during the 2008, 2009 downturn, our margins at the operating level were down just a little over 100 basis points. We were top of class. You go to the recession before that, our profit margins were actually up in the downturn. So this is sort of the core competency of our company and the basic answer to your question is, if things get worse, we will do more and look at the cost structure aligned with the revenue. I hope you don't have to that, so we'll be able to do it."

The issue is even when you roll through the acquisitions we've done, they're not a major part of the company. And some of that growth is also being muted by just the general macro conditions that we have talked a lot about on this call and most industrial companies are talking about. So I actually believe the organic growth of the companies that we acquired is higher than the base organic growth of sort of the core business. And if we take the last one, the Cognex deal -- Dave, do you remember what it was, organic growth, before we acquired it, 5%, 6%, 7%?  It was 6%. 6% was the number. So that's a good number in this environment. That's just an example of the last one though we did."

If you look at this, we parse the deals that we look at because you're absolutely right. Some deals are just going for a ridiculous multiples and when you look at the paying 15x or 17x, trailing, to get return on invested capital that meets a reasonable criteria and in particular, our criteria, is it's virtually impossible unless you've got super growth with the business and or almost unbelievable types of cost synergies. So we will parse those deals and we will not even spend a time on them, because we're not going to get a return on invested capital that we target. Now having said that, our acquisition program has really been fruitful. We put a solid team in place. They're doing a super job and a lot of the deals that are coming to our attention are coming up on a proprietary basis. And as a result of that, we're able to pay reasonable multiples. And I can remember like the last 2 deals we bought, they were 9x kind of deals. And we can say that's reasonable in an environment where some companies are going for 15x, but on the other hand, 9x is probably a point more than we've historically paid. So there's just -- you have to be cautious in terms of not overpaying for a business. And again, this speaks to the quality of our acquisition program and our backlog is good right now. The free cash flow of the company this year is going to be on the order of $740 million. And my objective is to spread spend that free cash flow on acquisitions and we're pretty much right on target. If you look at what we've done in sort of the first half of the year, as Bob mentioned, we did $360 million. So right on target to spend that. And that's the best utilization of that capital. We can take the free cash flow of the company, invest in businesses and then make them matter. It's sort of a no-brainer from an economic analysis viewpoint. So no, I'm not overly worried about it. One good metric I like to focus on is to total average capital. And if you look at this and although you probably shouldn't look at it on a quarter basis, but in the second quarter, that number was just under 14%. So if you look at our cost of capital, which depending on how you value cost of capital, a reasonable number for us would probably be 8%. So you take 8% and you get to total capital of 14%, we're creating sizable value. And that's the name of the game, is you got to create value. So I hope that helps."

AMETEK had a strong second quarter with excellent operating performance.

AMETEK had a strong second quarter with excellent operating performance. We delivered a record level of earnings at the high end of our guidance range despite what remains a slow global growth environment. We also continue to be very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we acquired Global Tubes, a leading manufacturer of high-precision, small diameter metal tubing; and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed the acquisition of the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation. 
I will provide some further details in our continued strong acquisition activity in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter. 
Sales in the quarter were up 1% to $1 billion. Organic sales were flat, while acquisitions added 5% and currency was a 4% headwind. Operating income for the quarter was very strong. It increased 4% to a record $240.3 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.9%, a 50 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2014.  Net income rose 4% to $155.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.64, up 5% over last year's second quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was up 5% to $163 million. 
Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very strong quarter. Sales were up 4% to $596.5 million on strength in our Aerospace business plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Zygo and AMPTEK in our process business.  Organic sales were up 1%, acquisitions added 7% and foreign currency was a 4% headwind. 
EIG's operating performance was outstanding. Operating income increased 8% to $164 million and operating margins were 27.5%, up 110 basis points from last year's second quarter. 
The Electromechanical Group also had a good quarter with strong operating performance. Overall sales were down 2% to $407.3 million. The lower sales were driven largely by currency headwinds with the contribution from the acquisition of Global Tubes, a partial offset. Organic sales were down 2%, driven by continued weak global macro conditions. Foreign currency was a 5-point headwind and acquisitions contributed 4 points.  EMG's operating income declined 3% to $89.3 million, while operating margins were very solid at 21.9%. 
Now turning to our 4 global strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. 
First, I will touch on acquisitions. We continue to remain very active, acquiring 2 excellent businesses since our last earnings call. Thus far, in 2015, we have deployed approximately $360 million in capital and acquired approximately $180 million in revenue on these 2 acquisitions. 
Over the last 24 months, we've acquired 10 businesses, deployed over $1.3 billion in capital and acquired nearly $650 million in revenue. Our acquisition pipeline remains very strong. 
Now let me provide some highlights on the 2 recent acquisitions. First, Global Tubes. Global Tubes manufactures high-precision, small diameter metal tubing from stainless steel, nickel alloys, zirconium alloys and titanium for very specialized applications. These highly specialized products are manufactured over very tight tolerances and customer specifications for demanding applications within the aerospace, medical, nuclear and oil and gas markets.  Global Tubes is a really good strategic fit with our specialty metals business. It allows us to expand our product offering into a number of attractive market segments, while also expanding our specialty metals presence within Europe. 
Global Tubes is comprised of 2 businesses: Superior Tube based in Collegeville, Pennsylvania; and Fine Tubes, based in the U.K. Global Tubes has annual sales of approximately $120 million. 
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation. The Surface Infections Systems Division, or SISD, develops and manufacture a software-enabled vision systems used to inspect surfaces of continuously processed materials for flaws and defects. SISD's proprietary high-speed defect recognition technology, detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. This business is also an excellent strategic acquisition for AMETEK as it expands our presence in the nondestructive process inspection market.  In addition, SISD will be able to leverage a number of AMETEK's complementary technologies and products within its vision systems. SISD is headquartered in Hayward, California and has annual sales of about $60 million. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion continues to be an important driver for our growth to the expansion of our presence in attractive higher-growth market segments and geographic regions. In the second quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities. For example, we continue to make sizable investments in both India and Serbia to drive our Global & Market Expansion initiatives. 
In India, our business continues to add sales and service capabilities to support increased demand for our products and technology. Additionally, we've been very pleased with the tremendous success of our engineering center of excellence in India. As a result, we continue to expand and broaden our RD&E capabilities and infrastructure in that region. 
In Serbia, we have a low-cost manufacturing facility, which was acquired as part of the Dunkermotoren acquisition in 2012. This facility primarily serves our Precision Motion Control customers in Europe and the Middle East. As other AMETEK businesses identify incremental growth opportunities in Europe and especially the Middle East, we are expanding our presence within Serbia to adequately support their growth. 
Now turning to New Product Development. We continue to see excellent results from our New Product Development efforts. Our businesses are doing a great job developing new products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets or applications. We will continue to make sizable investments in RD&E to ensure we are developing the right products to serve our customers and target markets.  In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E or approximately 5% of sales. 
We've made a number of recent new product introductions. Spectro Analytical Instruments, a global leader in instruments for advanced elemental analysis, introduced their new portable SPECTROSCOUT X-ray fluorescence spectrometer designed for at-line use. This durable and compact XRF analyzer delivers reliable, precise and fast laboratory quality elemental composition monitoring and quality control testing for the field or manufacturing floor. The new SPECTROSCOUT delivers results on-site, eliminating the need to transport samples back to a quality control laboratory. 
Zygo, a leader in optical metrology solutions, high-precision optics and optical assemblies, released its Verifire XL high-precision large aperture Fizeau interferometer. It is the latest addition to Zygo's industry-leading line of phase-shifting laser interferometers and is designed to measure large planal surfaces such as mirrors, semiconductor wafers and wafer chucks. The product is a compact, cost-effective and complete turnkey solution for the highly accurate characterization of flat surfaces up to 12 inches in diameter. To further increase precision and reliability, this new Zygo product incorporates a vibration isolation platform from another AMETEK business, our TMC business. 
Lastly, Solidstate Controls, a recognized leader in highly-customized uninterruptible power supplies, has released its DSE UPS System. This new DSE System is an industry first. It combines the robust design of a ferroresonant transformer with the enhanced digital communications, monitoring and diagnostic capabilities of a pulse width modulation UPS system. It is a true online, double conversion UPS system that provides highly reliable, clean and regulated power for critical AC loads in demanding process control applications. 
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 24% of sales in the second quarter, up from 22% in last year's second quarter. It's a very high number, which we're very proud of. 
Lastly, I will touch on Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. We continue to see tremendous results from our various Operational Excellence initiatives. Our teams continue to do an excellent job driving operational improvements in their business by leveraging the numerous Operational Excellence tools we have in place throughout the company. 
In low-growth environments, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance, so we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion, while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. 
Overall, in 2015, we anticipate approximately $145 million of total Operational Excellence savings, and we believe that's a conservative number. The largest contributor to this savings is our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, where we expect approximately $70 million in savings in 2015. 
Turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. We anticipate 2015 revenue to be up low-single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Organic growth is expected to be roughly flat for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. We continue to expect adjusted earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over last year's adjusted earnings per share. 
Third quarter 2015 sales are expected to be approximately flat versus the third quarter of 2014. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.64 to $0.65 per diluted share in the third quarter, up 3% to 5% over last year's third quarter. 
So in summary, we delivered strong results in the second quarter with record earnings. While global growth remains challenging, we are very confident in our ability to execute on our growth strategies and to deliver excellent earnings growth. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. 
Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions."

As Frank noted, we had a good second quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. 
In the quarter, selling expenses were down slightly versus last year's second quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales, slightly above last year's second quarter level of 1.2%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.7%, down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 28%. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be between 28% and 28.5%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from its full year rate. 
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.1% of sales in the second quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital expenditures were $12 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $37 million for the quarter. And 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. 
Operating cash flow was $163 million in the second quarter, up 5% over last year's second quarter. The free cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 8% over last year's second quarter. 
For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 115% of net income. Total debt was $1.67 billion at June 30, down slightly from the 2014 year-end. This amount reflects the second funding from the private placement agreement we entered into last September. This funding of $50 million was perceived on June 15 and was used to pay down revolver debt. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $327 million, resulting in the net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 27.9%. 
At June 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. 
During the second quarter, we acquired Global Tubes. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation, bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2015 to approximately $360 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, we had a very strong second quarter and delivered solid operating results. We are well-positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows."

And I can add that the total inflation across the company was such that the net of pricing minus inflation was 0.6%. Okay.   So sure, Scott, I'll be glad to go through my normal discussion of the various subparts of the 2 groups.",575,"Yes. Pricing was up 1.5%. And I can add that the total inflation across the company was such that the net of pricing minus inflation was 0.6%. Okay.   So sure, Scott, I'll be glad to go through my normal discussion of the various subparts of the 2 groups. And I'll start with EIG. EIG Aerospace had a very solid second quarter. Overall growth was up low-single digits against a very difficult comparison. We saw strong growth in our regional and business jet business and continued solid growth in our Commercial business. EIG Aerospace continues to gain additional content on a number of attractive platforms, really as a result of their strong technology and service capabilities. Very importantly, thus far, in 2015, we have won over $400 million in new life program awards on over 20 different platforms, including the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 Engine on the Airbus 330 Neo. Our team in this business has really done an excellent job. For all of 2015, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up mid-single digits, driven by the continued ramp up of key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets. The second part of EIG is our process businesses. Overall, process sales were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Overall growth benefited from the acquisitions that we did in process, they were Zygo and AMPTEK, and from solid growth in our Materials Analysis and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses. Organic sales were flat as a result of weakness in our upstream oil and gas business. The weakness that we've seen in oil and gas is in line with our original expectations at the start of the year. In 2015, we expect organic sales growth to be down slightly versus 2014.  And the last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. Our Power & Industrial businesses had a very good second quarter. Organic sales were up mid-single digits with solid growth across both our Power & Industrial businesses. And in 2015, for the whole year, we expect organic sales for Industrial to be up low-single digits. So if you take the sum of those 3, for all of EIG, we're expecting organic sales to be approximately flat for 2015.  Moving to EMG, starting with the differentiated part of EMG. Overall sales were down low-single digits on a percentage basis in the quarter, as foreign currency headwinds were only partially offset by the contribution from the Global Tubes acquisition. Organically, we saw solid growth in our Precision Motion Control business, but weakness in our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business due to continued soft macro environment. For 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be approximately flat organically. And the last part of the company, our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. Organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were flat in the second quarter. And for 2015, we expect sales for this business to be up low-single digits organically. So in 2015, for all of EMG, thus, we expect roughly flat organic sales growth on a percentage basis. So sort of the bottom line here is with organic growth, very difficult for just about every industrial company. The focus really becomes cost. And we've done an excellent job, as typical of AMETEK, in terms of reducing our cost structure and, obviously, getting record earnings and record performance as a result. So Scott, that's sort of a recap of what you asked for."

It's a great question. Fortunately, AMETEK is relatively balanced on revenues and costs around the world, but the strong dollar just cause some competitive situations in -- we're in niche markets, we're leaders in niche markets, and largely, what we see is the delay of projects when people can't get the U.S. dollars necessary to go forward with projects. Those are usually delayed 3, 6 months to go back and get the money. This has happened before, and certainly, we're seeing some of that. Because we're at the top our niches and technology, we're not seeing a lot of negative impacts but certainly anytime the currency changes, there are some businesses that are impacted by the stronger dollar. In cases where we're manufacturing in the U.S. and we have competitors in Europe or Japan, the environment is tougher. Conversely, AMETEK does manufacture in Europe and Asia and we have to take advantage of that to our competitive advantage. So it's certainly an issue, but I think we're managing it well. We've done an analysis business by business, every business unit in the company. And we have plans in place to relocate to lower-cost regions. We have -- as Frank mentioned, we have 24% of sales from new products really emphasizing New Product Development to enhance our competitive advantage. So it's an issue for every company.

So from the viewpoint of the customer, he's getting a highly specialized motor, whereas we don't have to do a lot of engineering in order to make that happen. So this is, as you point out, very diverse. And what this business has recently done is expanded globally. They were predominantly a U.S. business. And with the acquisition of Dunkermotoren in Germany and a real focus on growing in Asia, this company has diversified its global reach and it's basically looking at the stronger parts of the industrial market and being able to serve them well.

And it really depends on how significant a downturn would be. We have sized the company, as we think is appropriate, for the guidance that we've provided to you, both in terms of overall sales, organic sales and what we're expecting for the second half. You used the term rollover. If we're talking about a slight degradation, we'll be able to handle that. You just look, for instance, at the price of oil in the last few days, where it has gone a little bit lower than actually when we put our presentation together here. But when we looked at it, we said, it's not going to be significant to us. It could be a little bit slower than what we expect, and we'll deal with it. But if there's a major downturn, this is sort of the hallmark of AMETEK, that there are always substantial things that you can do in the cost structure of the company. And our approach to our businesses where we're highly diversified with lots of manufacturing facilities, there are still opportunities for us to do more. We can do additional consolidation of facilities. We could be even more aggressive on our material cost reductions. We could move more production to low-cost locales. And we got in a major downturn, we would shift some of our focus, which as Dave mentioned and I mentioned, is more right now in RD&E and the acquisition front, we would move even more of it to the cost side of the business. And if I can just look back historically, during the 2008 and 2009 downturn, our margins at the operating level were down just a little over 100 basis points. We were top of class. You go to the recession before that, our profit margins were actually up in the downturn. So this is sort of the core competency of our company. And the basic answer to your question is, if things get worse, we will do more and we'll get the cost structure aligned with the revenue. I hope you don't have to that, but we'll be able to do it."

The second question is around acquisitions in association with -- you highlighted your kind of track record over the past 2 years in terms of the acquired revenues and how much capital you deployed. In terms of doing the postmortem of these acquisitions, have you seen a superior organic growth rate from those acquisitions versus the core portfolio? And you are a harsh creator of yourself internally, but I mean, how would you kind of give yourself a grade in terms of the acquisition that have kind of come through the past 2 years? And do you think there's a problem of in terms of your acquisition selection in terms of organic growth."

We specifically have a focus on acquiring companies that are very high up the differentiation curve. And in general, the higher up the differentiation curve, the higher the organic growth of those companies. The issue is even when you roll through the acquisitions we've done, they're not a major part of the company. And some of that growth is also being muted by just the general macro conditions that we have talked a lot about on this call and most industrial companies are talking about. So I actually believe the organic growth of the companies that we acquired is higher than the base organic growth of the sort of the core business. And if we take the last one, the Cognex deal, Dave, do you remember what it was, organic growth before we acquired it, 5%, 6%, 7%?  6% -- it was 6%, okay. 6% was the number. So that's a good number in this environment. And that's just an example of the last one that we did."

I mean, you look at some of the public multiples being paid right now for some of these businesses as companies kind of search for growth and wrestle with the kind of portfolio transformation, clearly, companies of slightly larger decile than yourself. But there are some very healthy multiples being paid. Are you nervous given the fact that you've executed some reasonable deals in terms of EBITDA and the specter of  slower growth that there could be a bid-ask issue in you being able to get deals done in the back half and -- because you're probably walking away from -- because seller expectation's going to have to be moderated, I guess, is my point."

If you look at this, we parse the deals that we look at because, you're absolutely right, some deals are just going for ridiculous multiples.

If you look at this, we parse the deals that we look at because, you're absolutely right, some deals are just going for ridiculous multiples. And when you look at the paying 15x or 17x trailing, to get a return on invested capital that meets a reasonable criteria, and in particular, our criteria, is it's virtually impossible unless you've got super growth with the business and/or almost unbelievable types of cost synergies. So we will parse those deals and we will not even spend any time on them, because we're not going to get the return on invested capital that we target. Now having said that, our acquisition program has really been fruitful. We put a solid team in place. They're doing a super job. And a lot of the deals that are coming to our attention are coming up on a proprietary basis. And as a result of that, we're able to pay reasonable multiples. And I can remember, like the last 2 deals we bought, they were 9x kind of deals. And we can say that's reasonable in an environment where some companies are going for 15x. But on the other hand, 9x is probably a point more than we've historically paid. So there's just -- you have to be cautious in terms of not overpaying for a business. And again, this speaks to the quality of our acquisition program. And our backlog is good right now. The free cash flow of the company this year is going to be on the order of $740 million. And my objective is to spread -- spend that free cash flow on acquisitions, and we're pretty much right on target. If you look at the -- what we've done in sort of the first half of the year, as Bob mentioned, we did $360 million. So we're right on target to spend that, and that's the best utilization of that capital. We can take the free cash flow of the company, invest in businesses and then make them better. It's sort of a no-brainer from an economic analysis viewpoint. So no, I'm not overly worried about it. One good metric I like to focus on is no pack to total average capital. And if you look at this and although you probably shouldn't look at it on a quarter basis, but in the second quarter, that number was just under 14%. So if you look at our cost of capital, which depending on how you value cost of capital, a reasonable number for us would probably be 8%. So you take 8% and you get no pack to total  a capital of 14%, we're creating sizable value. And that's the name of the game, is you got to create value. So I hope that helps."

AMETEK had a strong second quarter with excellent operating performance.

AMETEK had a strong second quarter with excellent operating performance. We delivered a record level of earnings at the high end of our guidance range despite what remains a slow global growth environment. We also continue to be very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we acquired Global Tubes, a leading manufacturer of high-precision, small diameter metal tubing; and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed the acquisition of the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation. 
I will provide some further details on our continued strong acquisition activity in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter. 
Sales in the quarter were up 1% to $1 billion. Organic sales were flat, while acquisitions added 5% and currency was a 4% headwind. Operating income for the quarter was very strong. It increased 4% to a record $240.3 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.9%, a 50 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2014.  Net income rose 4% to $155.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.64, up 5% over last year's second quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was up 5% to $163 million. 
Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very strong quarter. Sales were up 4% to $596.5 million on strength in our Aerospace business plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Zygo and AMPTEK in our process business.  Organic sales were up 1%, acquisitions added 7% and foreign currency was a 4% headwind. 
EIG's operating performance was outstanding. Operating income increased 8% to $164 million and operating margins were 27.5%, up 110 basis points from last year's second quarter. 
The Electromechanical Group also had a good quarter with strong operating performance. Overall sales were down 2% to $407.3 million. The lower sales were driven largely by currency headwinds with the contribution from the acquisition of Global Tubes, a partial offset. Organic sales were down 2%, driven by continued weak global macro conditions. Foreign currency was a 5-point headwind and acquisitions contributed 4 points.  EMG's operating income declined 3% to $89.3 million, while operating margins were very solid at 21.9%. 
Now turning to our 4 global strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. 
First, I will touch on acquisitions. We continue to remain very active, acquiring 2 excellent businesses since our last earnings call. Thus far, in 2015, we have deployed approximately $360 million in capital and acquired approximately $180 million in revenue on these 2 acquisitions. 
Over the last 24 months, we've acquired 10 businesses, deployed over $1.3 billion in capital and acquired nearly $650 million in revenue. Our acquisition pipeline remains very strong. 
Now let me provide some highlights on the 2 recent acquisitions. First, Global Tubes. Global Tubes manufactures high-precision, small diameter metal tubing from stainless steel, nickel alloys, zirconium alloys and titanium for very specialized applications. These highly specialized products are manufactured over very tight tolerances and customer specifications for demanding applications within the aerospace, medical, nuclear and oil and gas markets.  Global Tubes is a really good strategic fit with our specialty metals business. It allows us to expand our product offering into a number of attractive market segments, while also expanding our specialty metals presence within Europe. 
Global Tubes is comprised of 2 businesses: Superior Tube based in Collegeville, Pennsylvania; and Fine Tubes, based in the U.K. Global Tubes has annual sales of approximately $120 million. 
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation. The Surface Inspections Systems Division, or SISD, develops and manufactures a software-enabled vision systems used to inspect surfaces of continuously processed materials for flaws and defects. SISD's proprietary high-speed defect recognition technology, detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. This business is also an excellent strategic acquisition for AMETEK as it expands our presence in the nondestructive process inspection market.  In addition, SISD will be able to leverage a number of AMETEK's complementary technologies and products within its vision systems. SISD is headquartered in Hayward, California and has annual sales of about $60 million. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion continues to be an important driver for our growth through the expansion of our presence in attractive higher-growth market segments and geographic regions. In the second quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities. For example, we continue to make sizable investments in both India and Serbia to drive our Global & Market Expansion initiatives. 
In India, our business continues to add sales and service capabilities to support increased demand for our products and technology. Additionally, we've been very pleased with the tremendous success of our engineering center of excellence in India. As a result, we continue to expand and broaden our RD&E capabilities and infrastructure in that region. 
In Serbia, we have a low-cost manufacturing facility, which was acquired as part of the Dunkermotoren acquisition in 2012. This facility primarily serves our Precision Motion Control customers in Europe and the Middle East. As other AMETEK businesses identify incremental growth opportunities in Europe and especially the Middle East, we are expanding our presence within Serbia to adequately support their growth. 
Now turning to New Product Development. We continue to see excellent results from our New Product Development efforts. Our businesses are doing a great job developing new products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets or applications. We will continue to make sizable investments in RD&E to ensure we are developing the right products to serve our customers and target markets.  In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E or approximately 5% of sales. 
We've made a number of recent new product introductions. Spectro Analytical Instruments, a global leader in instruments for advanced elemental analysis, introduced their new portable SPECTROSCOUT X-ray fluorescence spectrometer designed for at-line use. This durable and compact XRF analyzer delivers reliable, precise and fast laboratory quality elemental composition monitoring and quality control testing for the field or manufacturing floor. The new SPECTROSCOUT delivers results on-site, eliminating the need to transport samples back to a quality control laboratory. 
Zygo, a leader in optical metrology solutions, high-precision optics and optical assemblies, released its Verifire XL high-precision large aperture Fizeau interferometer. It is the latest addition to Zygo's industry-leading line of phase-shifting laser interferometers and is designed to measure large planal surfaces such as mirrors, semiconductor wafers and wafer chucks. The product is a compact, cost-effective and complete turnkey solution for the highly accurate characterization of flat surfaces up to 12 inches in diameter. To further increase precision and reliability, this new Zygo product incorporates a vibration isolation platform from another AMETEK business, our TMC business. 
Lastly, Solidstate Controls, a recognized leader in highly-customized uninterruptible power supplies, has released its DSE UPS System. This new DSE System is an industry first. It combines the robust design of a ferroresonant transformer with the enhanced digital communications, monitoring and diagnostic capabilities of a pulse width modulation UPS system. It is a true online, double conversion UPS system that provides highly reliable, clean and regulated power for critical AC loads in demanding process control applications. 
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 24% of sales in the second quarter, up from 22% in last year's second quarter. It's a very high number, which we're very proud of. 
Lastly, I will touch on Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. We continue to see tremendous results from our various Operational Excellence initiatives. Our teams continue to do an excellent job driving operational improvements in their business by leveraging the numerous Operational Excellence tools we have in place throughout the company. 
In low-growth environments, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance, so we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion, while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. 
Overall, in 2015, we anticipate approximately $145 million of total Operational Excellence savings, and we believe that's a conservative number. The largest contributor to this savings is our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, where we expect approximately $70 million in savings in 2015. 
Turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. We anticipate 2015 revenue to be up low-single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Organic growth is expected to be roughly flat for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. We continue to expect adjusted earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over last year's adjusted earnings per share. 
Third quarter 2015 sales are expected to be approximately flat versus the third quarter of 2014. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.64 to $0.65 per diluted share in the third quarter, up 3% to 5% over last year's third quarter. 
So in summary, we delivered strong results in the second quarter with record earnings. While global growth remains challenging, we are very confident in our ability to execute on our growth strategies and to deliver excellent earnings growth. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. 
Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions."

As Frank noted, we had a good second quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. 
In the quarter, selling expenses were down slightly versus last year's second quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales, slightly above last year's second quarter level of 1.2%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.7%, down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 28%. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be between 28% and 28.5%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from its full year rate. 
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.1% of sales in the second quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital expenditures were $12 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $37 million for the quarter. And 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. 
Operating cash flow was $163 million in the second quarter, up 5% over last year's second quarter. The free cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 8% over last year's second quarter. 
For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 115% of net income. Total debt was $1.67 billion at June 30, down slightly from the 2014 year-end. This amount reflects the second funding from the private placement agreement we entered into last September. This funding of $50 million was received on June 15 and was used to pay down revolver debt. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $327 million, resulting in the net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 27.9%. 
At June 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. 
During the second quarter, we acquired Global Tubes. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation, bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2015 to approximately $360 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. 
In summary, we had a very strong second quarter and delivered solid operating results. We are well-positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows."

And I can add that the total inflation across the company was such that the net of pricing minus inflation was 0.6%. Okay.   So sure, Scott, I'd be glad to go through my normal discussion of the various subparts of the 2 groups. And I'll start with EIG. EIG Aerospace had a very solid second quarter. Overall growth was up low-single digits against a very difficult comparison. We saw strong growth in our regional and business jet business and continued solid growth in our Commercial business. EIG Aerospace continues to gain additional content on a number of attractive platforms, really as a result of their strong technology and service capabilities. Very importantly, thus far, in 2015, we have won over $400 million in new life or program awards on over 20 different platforms, including the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engine on the Airbus 330neo. Our team in this business has really done an excellent job. For all of 2015, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up mid-single digits, driven by the continued ramp up of key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets. The second part of EIG is our Process businesses. Overall, Process sales were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Overall growth benefited from the acquisitions that we did in Process, they were Zygo and AMPTEK, and from solid growth in our Materials Analysis and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses. Organic sales were flat as a result of weakness in our upstream oil and gas business. The weakness that we've seen in oil and gas is in line with our original expectations at the start of the year. In 2015, we expect organic sales growth to be down slightly versus 2014.  And the last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. Our Power & Industrial businesses had a very good second quarter. Organic sales were up mid-single digits with solid growth across both our Power and Industrial businesses. And in 2015, for the whole year, we expect organic sales for Industrial to be up low-single digits. So if you take the sum of those 3, for all of EIG, we're expecting organic sales to be approximately flat for 2015.  Moving to EMG, starting with the differentiated part of EMG. Overall sales were down low-single digits on a percentage basis in the quarter, as foreign currency headwinds were only partially offset by the contribution from the Global Tubes acquisition. Organically, we saw solid growth in our Precision Motion Control business, but weakness in our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business due to continued soft macro environment. For 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be approximately flat organically. And the last part of the company, our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. Organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were flat in the second quarter. And for 2015, we expect sales for this business to be up low-single digits organically. So in 2015, for all of EMG, thus, we expect roughly flat organic sales growth on a percentage basis. So sort of the bottom line here is with organic growth, very difficult for just about every industrial company. The focus really becomes cost. And we've done an excellent job, as typical of AMETEK, in terms of reducing our cost structure and, obviously, getting record earnings and record performance as a result. So Scott, that's sort of a recap of what you asked for."

In the Industrial side, although a small part of overall AMETEK, the heavy vehicle business continues to do very well. And it triggered very good growth in the Industrial piece. If you look at North American heavy truck sales, it's estimated this year to be about 325,000 trucks, which is up about 10% over last year. So we are enjoying that. If we look at our Power business and you break it down, there's really 3 parts to the Power business. There's a test and measurement piece of the Power business, there's a battery backup piece of the Power business, and then there's instrumentation for the generation, transmission and distribution part of our Power business. And the latter 2 of those had good growth in the quarter. And that business is performing quite well for us and their earnings were excellent in the quarter. And so we're very pleased. We got really good management in that business and they're doing an excellent job and is now becoming a sizable part of AMETEK with over $0.5 billion in sales on an annual basis."

It's a great question. Fortunately, AMETEK is relatively balanced on revenues and costs around the world, but the strong dollar does cause some competitive situations in -- we're in niche markets, we're leaders in niche markets, and largely, what we see is the delay of projects when people can't get the U.S. dollars necessary to go forward with projects. Those are usually delayed 3, 6 months to go back and get the money. This has happened before, and certainly, we're seeing some of that. Because we're at the top our niches and technology, we're not seeing a lot of negative impacts but certainly anytime the currency changes, there are some businesses that are impacted by the stronger dollar. In cases where we're manufacturing in the U.S. and we have competitors in Europe or Japan, the environment is tougher. Conversely, AMETEK does manufacture in Europe and Asia and we have to take advantage of that to our competitive advantage. So it's certainly an issue, but I think we're managing it well. We've done an analysis business by business, every business unit in the company. And we have plans in place to relocate to lower-cost regions. We have -- as Frank mentioned, we have 24% of sales from new products really emphasizing New Product Development to enhance our competitive advantage. So it's an issue for every company. There is a competitive issue with it, but we're managing it well."

So that it's just difficult to find a time to do some of the projects. So I doubt very much that we're going to spend the full $75 million. In terms of free cash flow, usually in the first part of the year, we always run below net income. But if we look at the full year and actually extract that $50 million in pension contributions that you mentioned, we actually expect free cash flow to net income to be about 115% of sales. And that's probably a conservative number.

So from the viewpoint of the customer, he's getting a highly specialized motor, whereas we don't have to do a lot of engineering in order to make that happen. So this is, as you point out, very diverse. And what this business has recently done is expanded globally. They were predominantly a U.S. business. And with the acquisition of Dunkermotoren in Germany and a real focus on growing in Asia, this company has diversified its global reach and it's basically looking at the stronger parts of the industrial market and being able to serve them well. So to me, this is an example of really strong management in a sort of difficult global macro environment that is actually taking advantage of their approach to the market, and therefore, their organic growth has been very good."

And I think what you're hearing from other companies is that there's a little bit of an uptick and then it comes back down, so you're sort of on that cycle of bouncing along bottom. Our growth here is purely not market-driven. It's from new product wins. We have major wins on HondaJet, for instance. We have major wins on other platforms like the Global Express, like Gulfstream Aircraft. And you sum those -- and actually, in the second quarter, our business -- regional jet business was up organically, the most in AMETEK. It was up low-double digits.

And it really depends on how significant a downturn would be. We have sized the company, as we think is appropriate, for the guidance that we've provided to you, both in terms of overall sales, organic sales and what we're expecting for the second half. You used the term rollover. If we're talking about a slight degradation, we'll be able to handle that. You just look, for instance, at the price of oil in the last few days, where it has gone a little bit lower than actually when we put our presentation together here. But when we looked at it, we said, it's not going to be significant to us. It could be a little bit slower than what we expect, and we'll deal with it. But if there's a major downturn, this is sort of the hallmark of AMETEK, that there are always substantial things that you can do in the cost structure of the company. And our approach to our businesses where we're highly diversified with lots of manufacturing facilities, there are still opportunities for us to do more. We can do additional consolidation of facilities. We could be even more aggressive on our material cost reductions. We could move more production to low-cost locales. And if we got in a major downturn, we would shift some of our focus, which as Dave mentioned and I mentioned, is more right now in RD&E and the acquisition front, we would move even more of it to the cost side of the business. And if I can just look back historically, during the 2008 and 2009 downturn, our margins at the operating level were down just a little over 100 basis points. We were top of class. You go to the recession before that, our profit margins were actually up in the downturn. So this is sort of the core competency of our company. And the basic answer to your question is, if things get worse, we will do more and we'll get the cost structure aligned with the revenue. I hope we don't have to that, but we'll be able to do it."

In terms of doing the postmortem of these acquisitions, have you seen a superior organic growth rate from those acquisitions versus the core portfolio? And you are a harsh grader of yourself internally, but I mean, how would you kind of give yourself a grade in terms of the acquisition that have kind of come through the past 2 years? And do you think there's a problem of in terms of your acquisition selection in terms of organic growth."

We specifically have a focus on acquiring companies that are very high up the differentiation curve. And in general, the higher up the differentiation curve, the higher the organic growth of those companies. The issue is even when you roll through the acquisitions we've done, they're not a major part of the company. And some of that growth is also being muted by just the general macro conditions that we have talked a lot about on this call and most industrial companies are talking about. So I actually believe the organic growth of the companies that we acquired is higher than the base organic growth of the sort of the core business. And if we take the last one, the Cognex deal, Dave, do you remember what it was, organic growth before we acquired it, 5%, 6%, 7%?  6% -- it was 6%, okay. 6% was the number. So that's a good number in this environment. And that's just an example of the last one that we did."

If you look at this, we parse the deals that we look at because, you're absolutely right, some deals are just going for ridiculous multiples. And when you look at the paying 15x or 17x trailing, to get a return on invested capital that meets a reasonable criteria, and in particular, our criteria, is it's virtually impossible unless you've got super growth with the business and/or almost unbelievable types of cost synergies. So we will parse those deals and we will not even spend any time on them, because we're not going to get the return on invested capital that we target. Now having said that, our acquisition program has really been fruitful. We put a solid team in place. They're doing a super job. And a lot of the deals that are coming to our attention are coming up on a proprietary basis. And as a result of that, we're able to pay reasonable multiples. And I can remember, like the last 2 deals we bought, they were 9x kind of deals. And we can say that's reasonable in an environment where some companies are going for 15x. But on the other hand, 9x is probably a point more than we've historically paid. So there's just -- you have to be cautious in terms of not overpaying for a business. And again, this speaks to the quality of our acquisition program. And our backlog is good right now. The free cash flow of the company this year is going to be on the order of $740 million. And my objective is to spread -- spend that free cash flow on acquisitions, and we're pretty much right on target. If you look at the -- what we've done in sort of the first half of the year, as Bob mentioned, we did $360 million. So we're right on target to spend that, and that's the best utilization of that capital. We can take the free cash flow of the company, invest in businesses and then make them better. It's sort of a no-brainer from an economic analysis viewpoint. So no, I'm not overly worried about it. One good metric I like to focus on is NOPAT to total average capital. And if you look at this and although you probably shouldn't look at it on a quarter basis, but in the second quarter, that number was just under 14%. So if you look at our cost of capital, which depending on how you value cost of capital, a reasonable number for us would probably be 8%. So you take 8% and you get NOPAT to total  a capital of 14%, we're creating sizable value. And that's the name of the game, is you got to create value. So I hope that helps."

AMETEK had a solid third quarter with strong operating performance and earnings growth.

Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references to 2014 financial results will be on unadjusted [ph] basis, including -- excluding the Zygo integration cost from the third and fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now onto the results. Sales in the quarter were $998.5 million, down 3% from last year's third quarter. Organic sales declined 2%, foreign currency was at 4-point headwind and acquisitions added 2%. Operating income for the third quarter increased 3% to $237.6 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.8%, up 130 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net income increased 3% to a record $156.4 million and diluted earnings per share were up 5% over last year's third quarter to a record $0.65 per diluted share. 
Turning to our individual operating groups. The electronic instruments group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. Sales were $598.5 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's third quarter. The lower sales were driven by a 3% foreign currency headwinds. Organic sales declined 2% as a result of the as expected weakness in the upstream oil and gas business. EIG's operating income was $162.5 million, up slightly from last year's third quarter. Operating margins were very strong, up 160 basis points to 27.2%. The electromechanical group also had a good quarter with excellent operating performance. Sales were flat for the quarter at $400 million as strong core growth in our Aerospace businesses and the contributions from the acquisition of Global Tubes were offset by foreign currency headwinds and weakness within our engineered materials interconnect and packaging business. Organic sales were down 2%. Foreign currency was a 4% headwind and acquisitions added 6%. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $86.7 million and operating margins were very strong at 21.7%, up 120 basis points from last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to our Four Growth Strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on New Product Development. We continue to see great results from our new product development efforts. Our businesses are doing a tremendous job developing new, highly differentiated products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets. We are consistently growing our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are effectively and efficiently developing the right products to serve our customers. One example of this investment is within our India R&D Center of Excellence, which we developed a number of years ago to help our businesses globalized our R&D efforts and capitalize on the strong engineering talent within India. The success and growth of this effort has been tremendous. We now have over 120 talented engineers in India with more than half of our business units having local R&D talent there. We expect continued expansion of these R&D efforts. 
Overall, in 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million or about 5% of our sales on RD&E. And some new product introductions, I'll start on our business unit, leader in microanalysis and micro XRF systems, had added its update of the art media system offering with the introduction of the next-generation octane elite series. The next-gen octane elite offers new to the world differentiated features that benefit our customers, including thermal corrosion and shock resistance, increased sensitivity to x-rays and high-speed x-ray data processing capabilities in a much smaller footprint. Our programmable Power business, the global leader in programmable AC and DC Power test solutions, expanded its line with standalone photovoltaic stimulators with their newest product the embedded terraces. The terraces was specifically developed to test solar energy micro-grids by mimicking the behavior of ground-based solar energy arrays. The new simulator allows for a 50% increase in output power over our existing offering and now spends a range from 5 kilowatts to 15 kilowatts of power, and you can put multiple simulators together parallelled up to support solar array installations up to 500 kilowatts of power. So very high-power capability. 
And lastly, on our record technology business, a pioneer in leader in the development of vision diagnostic devices, launched its most advanced ocular response analyzer, the G3, during the quarter. The new analyzer is the only the number capable of measuring cornea [indiscernible], which is a strong predictor of glaucoma progression and also provides a better indication of true eye pressure than other methods of tonometry. The analyzer was designed to provide a more streamlined product and better user experience. 
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was very strong at 24% of sales in the quarter, up from 23% in last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. We will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long-term growth opportunities. In the third quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We saw a very strong growth in our Aerospace businesses in both Europe and Asia during the quarter. Combined, our Aerospace business is grew double digits organically in international markets as a result of strong shipments to support the production ramp up of the A320 Neo and A350 commercial aircraft, as well as the joint strike fighter military aircraft. 
Now turning to acquisitions. We continue to see great success with our acquisition strategy. Thus far in 2015, we've completed 2 deals deploying approximately $360 million of capital and we acquired nearly $180 million in revenue. Over the last 24 months, we've completed 9 acquisitions, deployed approximately $1.2 billion in capital and acquired approximately $600 million in revenue. Our most recent acquisition, Surface Vision, was completed in the third quarter. Surface Vision develops and manufactures a software-enabled vision on systems to inspect the surfaces of continuously processed materials for flaws and defects. The businesses proprietary high-speed defect recognition technology detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. The business is an excellent strategic acquisition for Ametek as it expands our presence in the nondestructive process inspection market and Surface Vision will be able to leverage a number of Ametek's complementary technologies and products within its Vision's systems. Surface Vision is headquartered in Hayward, California and have annual sales of approximately $60 million and integration of this particular deal is going well, and we're very excited to have this Surface Vision team now as part of AMETEK. 
Our business units and M&A teams continue to manage a very active pipeline of attractive opportunities and acquisitions will continue to be a focus for AMETEK and the primary use of our strong cash flow. 
I'll touch on our last strategy, Operational Excellence. Our team continues to deliver excellent operating performance through the use of our various Operational Excellence tools. In low-growth environments, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance, so we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion, while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall in 2015, we now anticipate approximately $150 million of Operational Excellence savings with the largest contributor to this savings being our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, which we expect approximately $75 million in savings in 2015. 
Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. As noted, the global environment remains challenging. We're seeing sluggish conditions across many of our markets and geographies, and we expect the sluggishness to continue for the remainder of the year. Therefore, for all of 2015, we expect both overall and organic sales to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be approximately $2.55, up 5% over 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 sales are expected to be let down low single digits on a percentage basis from last year's fourth quarter, with organic growth down low single-digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.63 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. 
So on summary, I'm pleased with our results this quarter given the difficult market conditions. We delivered excellent operating performance and record earnings, while continuing to make long-term investments across each of our growth strategies. I'd like to take this time to acknowledge the great work by all AMETEK employees in helping drive these strong results and for their commitment to driving each of AMETEK's growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong. We generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions."

As Frank noted, we have solid third quarter with good operating results. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were down more than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost-containment. Genera",459,"Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we have solid third quarter with good operating results. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were down more than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost-containment. General and administrative expenses were 1.1% of sales in the quarter, down from last year's third quarter level of 1.2% of sales. Other expense in the quarter was lower in comparison to last year's third quarter as a result of higher expense due to a one-time insurance write-off in last year's third quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.1%, up from 25.1% in last year's quarter. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 27.5% as a result of our ongoing international and state tax planning. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. 
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.2% of sales in the third quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $19 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $38 million for the quarter. In 2015, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. 
Operating cash flow was $188 million in the third quarter, and free cash flow was $168 million, or 108% of net income in the quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 110% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $160 million for the acquisition of Surface Vision. Year-to-date, we've deployed approximately $360 million on acquisitions. And over the last 24 months, we have deployed $1.2 billion of capital. 
In addition, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of stock for approximately $250 million. Total debt was $1.92 billion at September 30, up $200 million from the 2014 year-end. This amount reflects the third funding from private placement agreement we entered into the September. This funding was $150 million, which received on August 14 and was used to pay down term debt, which matured in the quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $328 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at September 30 of 32.4%. At September 30, we had approximately $950 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. In summary, we had a strong third quarter. We are well positioned for future growth, for the strong balance sheet and cash flow."

As we go into next year, which really was the key part of your question, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business and 1 advantage of our mid-strategy is that there are a lot of actions that we can take to basically improve the operating performance by putting various manufacturing facilities together, being more aggressive in the materials side of the business, which as you know, we put tremendous infrastructure in place that we can continue to drive good earnings growth there.

AMETEK had a solid third quarter with strong operating performance and earnings growth. We delivered a record level of earnings at the high end our guidance range despite what remains a challenging and slow growth global environment. 
Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references to 2014 financial results will be on an adjusted basis, including -- excluding the Zygo integration costs from the third and fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now onto the results. Sales in the quarter were $998.5 million, down 3% from last year's third quarter. Organic sales declined 2%, foreign currency was at 4-point headwind and acquisitions added 2%. 
Operating income for the third quarter increased 3% to $237.6 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.8%, up 130 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net income increased 3% to a record $156.4 million and diluted earnings per share were up 5% over last year's third quarter to a record $0.65 per diluted share. 
Turning to our individual operating groups. The electronic instruments group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. Sales were $598.5 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's third quarter. The lower sales were driven by a 3% foreign currency headwind. Organic sales declined 2% as a result of the as expected weakness in our upstream oil and gas business. 
EIG's operating income was $162.5 million, up slightly from last year's third quarter. Operating margins were very strong, up 160 basis points to 27.2%. 
The Electromechanical Group also had a good quarter with excellent operating performance. Sales were flat for the quarter at $400 million, as strong core growth in our Aerospace businesses and the contributions from the acquisition of Global Tubes were offset by foreign currency headwinds and weakness within our engineered materials interconnect and packaging business. Organic sales were down 2%. Foreign currency was a 4% headwind and acquisitions added 6%. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $86.7 million and operating margins were very strong at 21.7%, up 120 basis points from last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to our four growth strategies of Operational Excellence: Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on New Product Development. We continue to see great results from our new product development efforts. Our businesses are doing a tremendous job developing new, highly differentiated products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets. We are consistently growing our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are effectively and efficiently developing the right products to serve our customers. One example of this investment is within our Indian R&D Center of Excellence, which we developed a number of years ago to help our businesses globalize our R&D efforts and capitalize on the strong engineering talent within India. The success and growth of this effort has been tremendous. We now have over 120 talented engineers in India with more than half of our business units having local R&D talent there. We expect continued expansion of these R&D efforts. Overall, in 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million or about 5% of our sales on RD&E. 
And some new product introductions. I'll start our EDAX business unit, leader in microanalysis and micro-XRF systems, has added its state-of-the-art EDS system offering with the introduction of the next-generation Octane Elite series. The next-gen  Octane Elite offers new to the world differentiated features that benefit our customers, including thermal corrosion and shock resistance, increased sensitivity to x-rays and high-speed x-ray data processing capabilities in a much smaller footprint. Our programmable power business, the global leader in programmable AC and DC power test solutions, expanded its line with stand-alone photovoltaic simulators with their newest product, the Embedded TerraSAS. The TerraSAS was specifically developed to test solar energy microgrids by mimicking the behavior of ground-based solar energy arrays. The new simulator allows for a 50% increase in output power over our existing offering and now spans a range from 5 kilowatts to 15 kilowatts of power, and you can put multiple simulators together parallelled up to support solar array installations up to 500 kilowatts of power. So very high power capability. 
And lastly, on our  Reichert Technologies business, a pioneer and leader in the development of vision diagnostic devices, launched its most advanced Ocular Response Analyzer, the G3, during the quarter. The new analyzer is the only tonometer capable of measuring cornea hysteresis, which is a strong predictor of glaucoma progression and also provides a better indication of true eye pressure than other methods of tonometry. The analyzer was designed to provide a more streamlined product and better user experience. 
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was very strong at 24% of sales in the quarter, up from 23% in last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. We will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channel, service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long-term growth opportunities. In the third quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We saw a very strong growth in our Aerospace businesses in both Europe and Asia during the quarter. Combined, our Aerospace businesses grew double digits organically in international markets, as a result of strong shipments to support the production ramp up of the A320neo and A350 commercial aircraft as well as the Joint Strike Fighter military aircraft. 
Now turning to acquisitions. We continue to see great success with our acquisition strategy. Thus far, in 2015, we've completed 2 deals, deploying approximately $360 million of capital and we acquired nearly $180 million in revenue. Over the last 24 months, we've completed 9 acquisitions, deployed approximately $1.2 billion in capital and acquired approximately $600 million in revenue. Our most recent acquisition, Surface Vision, was completed in the third quarter. Surface Vision develops and manufactures software-enabled vision systems to inspect the surfaces of continuously processed materials for flaws and defects. The businesses proprietary high-speed defect recognition technology detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. The business is an excellent strategic acquisition for AMETEK, as it expands our presence in the nondestructive process inspection market. And in addition, Surface Vision will be able to leverage a number of AMETEK's complementary technologies and products within its Vision's systems. Surface Vision is headquartered in Hayward, California, and have annual sales of approximately $60 million. And the integration of this particular deal is going well, and we're very excited to have the Surface Vision team now as part of AMETEK. 
Our business unit and M&A teams continue to manage a very active pipeline of attractive opportunities and acquisitions will continue to be a focus for AMETEK and the primary use of our strong cash flow. 
I'll touch on our last strategy, Operational Excellence. Our team continues to deliver excellent operating performance through the use of our various Operational Excellence tools. In low-growth environments, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance, so we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion, while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall, in 2015, we now anticipate approximately $150 million of Operational Excellence savings with the largest contributor to this savings being our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, which we expect approximately $75 million in savings in 2015. 
Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. As noted, the global environment remains challenging. We're seeing sluggish conditions across many of our markets and geographies, and we expect the sluggishness to continue for the remainder of the year. Therefore, for all of 2015, we expect both overall and organic sales to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be approximately $2.55, up 5% over 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 sales are expected to be let down low single digits on a percentage basis from last year's fourth quarter, with organic growth down low single digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.63 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. 
So in summary, I'm pleased with our results this quarter given the difficult market conditions. We delivered excellent operating performance and record earnings, while continuing to make long-term investments across each of our growth strategies. I'd like to take this time to acknowledge the great work by all AMETEK employees in helping drive these strong results and for their commitment to driving each of AMETEK's growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong. We generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. 
Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions."

As Frank noted, we had a solid third quarter with good operating results. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were down more than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost-containment. Gen",461,"Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid third quarter with good operating results. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were down more than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost-containment. 
General and administrative expenses were 1.1% of sales in the quarter, down from last year's third quarter level of 1.2% of sales. Other expense in the quarter was lower in comparison to last year's third quarter as a result of higher expense due to a one-time insurance write-off in last year's third quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.1%, up from 25.1% in last year's quarter. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 27.5% as a result of our ongoing international and state tax planning. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. 
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.2% of sales in the third quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $19 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $38 million for the quarter. In 2015, depreciation and amortization was expected to be approximately $150 million. 
Operating cash flow was $188 million in the third quarter, and free cash flow was $168 million, or 108% of net income in the quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 110% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $160 million for the acquisition of Surface Vision. Year-to-date, we've deployed approximately $360 million on acquisitions. And over the last 24 months, we have deployed $1.2 billion in capital. 
In addition, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of stock for approximately $250 million. Total debt was $1.92 billion at September 30, up $200 million from the 2014 year-end. This amount reflects the third funding from the private placement agreement we entered into last September. This funding was $150 million, which received on August 14 and was used to pay down term debt, which matured in the quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $328 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at September 30 of 32.4%. At September 30, we had approximately $950 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. 
In summary, we had a strong third quarter. We are well positioned for future growth, for the strong balance sheet and cash flow."

Putting that aside, we are in due diligence right now on other deals. We feel good about it. As we mentioned, it's the primary use of our cash flow.

The difference was there is obviously a global macro condition here that is having impact on a number of businesses. But when you really isolate the change in EMG, it did come down to our Aerospace businesses, which did very well being offset by weakness in our Engineered Materials, Interconnect & Packaging business. And when we look at that Engineered Material, Interconnect & Packaging business, it is really a global macro that is driving that. It's not a specific item, et cetera.

So I guess my question is, obviously, you guys know -- you know what you're doing in terms of the cost measurement, but as we look at this sort of slow growth going forward, is -- can you continue to get margin expansion or is -- does the shift focus to more just sustaining where you're at kind of in this industrial recession-type environment?"

So as a result, our guidance has been in the 100-basis-point arena, and that's what we're expecting for the entire year that we're going to be up about 100 basis points. As we go into next year, which really was the key part of your question, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business and one advantage of our mid-strategy is that there are a lot of actions that we can take to basically improve the operating performance by putting various manufacturing facilities together, being more aggressive in the materials side of the business, which as you know, we put tremendous infrastructure in place that we can continue to drive good earnings growth there. We've got value analysis and value engineering, which is picking up steam in the company. So we are in the process right now of putting our budgets together for next year. I'm not prepared to give you an exact number. We will do that in January or, I guess, maybe early February call, whenever we're going to have it in the beginning of the year.

And then we've been very careful as we've made the cost reductions in the company to focus on the operations side of the business, not on our engineering and sales and distribution side of the business, and that's -- you heard me in my opening remarks, talked substantially to that. So we're going to continue. And with those engineering efforts, we are hoping that we'll be able to offset some of the effects of the global macro. So the basic answer to your question is to get better organic growth and do deals, that's the key. And we'll continue as we always have. It's sort of the hallmark of AMETEK to continue to do cost improvements across the business. So those are the drivers, and that's why, as I mentioned to Joe's question, I think we're going to see margin improvement, and you're not seeing many industrial companies right now showing double-digit EPS growth."

Typically, the fourth quarter is your best EPS quarter of the year. Are you really just trying to derisk that going to 63?

So as you say, you've known us for many, many years, and we definitely did derisk it. The order numbers, overall orders were down about 2% in the quarter. Organically, they were actually down 5%. But that number is not a fair representation of the business, and the reason is that last year in that quarter, we had some very large one-off orders. So I think if you normalize that out, the organic growth was in line with -- or lack thereof, was in line with the sales growth.

If you look at the PMI in China, I was just reading a report, actually, last night, the latest PMI came out at 47% for China when it was running at close to 60%. So there just has been a change in the industrial environment in China. So I don't think it's a major change sort of sequentially in Asia. But clearly, it is a major driver in our organic growth.

AMETEK had a solid third quarter with strong operating performance and earnings growth.

Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references to 2014 financial results will be on an adjusted basis, including -- excluding the Zygo integration costs from the third and fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now onto the results. Sales in the quarter were $998.5 million, down 3% from last year's third quarter. Organic sales declined 2%, foreign currency was at 4-point headwind and acquisitions added 2%. 
Operating income for the third quarter increased 3% to $237.6 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.8%, up 130 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net income increased 3% to a record $156.4 million and diluted earnings per share were up 5% over last year's third quarter to a record $0.65 per diluted share. 
Turning to our individual operating groups. The electronic instruments group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. Sales were $598.5 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's third quarter. The lower sales were driven by a 3% foreign currency headwind. Organic sales declined 2% as a result of the as expected weakness in our upstream oil and gas business. 
EIG's operating income was $162.5 million, up slightly from last year's third quarter. Operating margins were very strong, up 160 basis points to 27.2%. 
The Electromechanical Group also had a good quarter with excellent operating performance. Sales were flat for the quarter at $400 million, as strong core growth in our Aerospace businesses and the contributions from the acquisition of Global Tubes were offset by foreign currency headwinds and weakness within our engineered materials interconnect and packaging business. Organic sales were down 2%. Foreign currency was a 4% headwind and acquisitions added 6%. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $86.7 million and operating margins were very strong at 21.7%, up 120 basis points from last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to our four growth strategies of Operational Excellence: Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on New Product Development. We continue to see great results from our new product development efforts. Our businesses are doing a tremendous job developing new, highly differentiated products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets. We are consistently growing our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are effectively and efficiently developing the right products to serve our customers. One example of this investment is within our Indian R&D Center of Excellence, which we developed a number of years ago to help our businesses globalize their R&D efforts and capitalize on the strong engineering talent within India. The success and growth of this effort has been tremendous. We now have over 120 talented engineers in India with more than half of our business units having local R&D talent there. We expect continued expansion of these R&D efforts. Overall, in 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million or about 5% of our sales on RD&E. 
And some new product introductions. I'll start -- our EDAX business unit, a leader in microanalysis and micro-XRF systems, has added its state-of-the-art EDS system offering with the introduction of the next-generation Octane Elite series. The next-gen  Octane Elite offers new to the world differentiated features that benefit our customers, including thermal corrosion and shock resistance, increased sensitivity to x-rays and high-speed x-ray data processing capabilities in a much smaller footprint. Our programmable power business, the global leader in programmable AC and DC power test solutions, expanded its line of stand-alone photovoltaic simulators with their newest product, the Embedded TerraSAS. The TerraSAS was specifically developed to test solar energy microgrids by mimicking the behavior of ground-based solar energy arrays. The new simulator allows for a 50% increase in output power over our existing offering and now spans a range from 5 kilowatts to 15 kilowatts of power, and you can put multiple simulators together paralleled up to support solar array installations up to 500 kilowatts of power. So very high power capability. 
And lastly, on our  Reichert Technologies business, a pioneer and leader in the development of vision diagnostic devices, launched its most advanced Ocular Response Analyzer, the G3, during the quarter. The new analyzer is the only tonometer capable of measuring cornea hysteresis, which is a strong predictor of glaucoma progression and also provides a better indication of true eye pressure than other methods of tonometry. The analyzer was designed to provide a more streamlined product and better user experience. 
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was very strong at 24% of sales in the quarter, up from 23% in last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. We will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channel, service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long-term growth opportunities. In the third quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We saw a very strong growth in our Aerospace businesses in both Europe and Asia during the quarter. Combined, our Aerospace businesses grew double digits organically in international markets, as a result of strong shipments to support the production ramp up of the A320neo and A350 commercial aircraft as well as the Joint Strike Fighter military aircraft. 
Now turning to acquisitions. We continue to see great success with our acquisition strategy. Thus far, in 2015, we've completed 2 deals, deploying approximately $360 million of capital and we acquired nearly $180 million in revenue. Over the last 24 months, we've completed 9 acquisitions, deployed approximately $1.2 billion in capital and acquired approximately $600 million in revenue. Our most recent acquisition, Surface Vision, was completed in the third quarter. Surface Vision develops and manufactures software-enabled vision systems to inspect the surfaces of continuously processed materials for flaws and defects. The business's proprietary high-speed defect recognition technology detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. The business is an excellent strategic acquisition for AMETEK, as it expands our presence in the nondestructive process inspection market. And in addition, Surface Vision will be able to leverage a number of AMETEK's complementary technologies and products within its Vision's systems. Surface Vision is headquartered in Hayward, California, and have annual sales of approximately $60 million. And the integration of this particular deal is going well, and we're very excited to have the Surface Vision team now as part of AMETEK. 
Our business unit and M&A teams continue to manage a very active pipeline of attractive opportunities and acquisitions will continue to be a focus for AMETEK and the primary use of our strong cash flow. 
I'll touch on our last strategy, Operational Excellence. Our team continues to deliver excellent operating performance through the use of our various Operational Excellence tools. In low-growth environments, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance, so we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion, while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall, in 2015, we now anticipate approximately $150 million of Operational Excellence savings with the largest contributor to this savings being our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, which we expect approximately $75 million in savings in 2015. 
Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. As noted, the global environment remains challenging. We're seeing sluggish conditions across many of our markets and geographies, and we expect the sluggishness to continue for the remainder of the year. Therefore, for all of 2015, we expect both overall and organic sales to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be approximately $2.55, up 5% over 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 sales are expected to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from last year's fourth quarter, with organic growth down low single digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.63 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. 
So in summary, I'm pleased with our results this quarter given the difficult market conditions. We delivered excellent operating performance and record earnings, while continuing to make long-term investments across each of our growth strategies. I'd like to take this time to acknowledge the great work by all AMETEK employees in helping drive these strong results and for their commitment to driving each of AMETEK's growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong. We generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. 
Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions."

As Frank noted, we had a solid third quarter with good operating results. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were down more than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost-containment. Gen",461,"Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid third quarter with good operating results. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were down more than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost-containment. 
General and administrative expenses were 1.1% of sales in the quarter, down from last year's third quarter level of 1.2% of sales. Other expense in the quarter was lower in comparison to last year's third quarter as a result of higher expense due to a one-time insurance write-off in last year's third quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.1%, up from 25.1% in last year's quarter. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 27.5% as a result of our ongoing international and state tax planning. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. 
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.2% of sales in the third quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $19 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $38 million for the quarter. In 2015, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. 
Operating cash flow was $188 million in the third quarter, and free cash flow was $168 million, or 108% of net income in the quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 110% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $160 million for the acquisition of Surface Vision. Year-to-date, we've deployed approximately $360 million on acquisitions. And over the last 24 months, we have deployed $1.2 billion in capital. 
In addition, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of stock for approximately $250 million. Total debt was $1.92 billion at September 30, up $200 million from the 2014 year-end. This amount reflects the third funding from the private placement agreement we entered into last September. This funding was $150 million, was received on August 14 and was used to pay down term debt, which matured in the quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $328 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at September 30 of 32.4%. At September 30, we had approximately $950 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. 
In summary, we had a strong third quarter. We are well positioned for future growth, for the strong balance sheet and cash flow."

And the net of that ended up with -- in the third quarter, a minus 2% organic growth for EMG. And we believe that, that is going to continue in the fourth quarter. So we are seeing the result of the, I'll call it, industrial recession, that's being talked about substantially now. And we decided, as a result, that the fourth quarter, which also was very strong from the viewpoint of expectation, needed to be lowered a bit."

As we go into next year, which really was the key part of your question, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business and one advantage of our mid-strategy is that there are a lot of actions that we can take to basically improve the operating performance by putting various manufacturing facilities together, being more aggressive in the materials side of the business, which as you know, we put tremendous infrastructure in place that we can continue to drive good earnings growth there. We've got value analysis and value engineering, which is picking up steam in the company. So we are in the process right now of putting our budgets together for next year. I'm not prepared to give you an exact number. We will do that in January or, I guess, maybe early February call, whenever we're going to have it in the beginning of the year.

But it's a small part of that overall operation. So that when you see the reduction and put that across the entire EMG, basically all of Aerospace, not just in EMIP but all of Aerospace in that differentiated part of EMG was basically more than compensated for by the shortfall in EMIP and, therefore, the total organic growth was down this 1% or 2%.

AMETEK had a solid third quarter with strong operating performance and earnings growth. We delivered a record level of earnings at the high end our guidance range despite what remains a challenging and slow growth global environment. 
Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references to 2014 financial results will be on an adjusted basis, including -- excluding the Zygo integration costs from the third and fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now onto the results. Sales in the quarter were $998.5 million, down 3% from last year's third quarter. Organic sales declined 2%, foreign currency was at 4-point headwind and acquisitions added 2%. 
Operating income for the third quarter increased 3% to $237.6 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.8%, up 130 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net income increased 3% to a record $156.4 million and diluted earnings per share were up 5% over last year's third quarter to a record $0.65 per diluted share. 
Turning to our individual operating groups. The electronic instruments group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. Sales were $598.5 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's third quarter. The lower sales were driven by a 3% foreign currency headwind. Organic sales declined 2% as a result of the as expected weakness in our upstream oil and gas business. 
EIG's operating income was $162.5 million, up slightly from last year's third quarter. Operating margins were very strong, up 160 basis points to 27.2%. 
The Electromechanical Group also had a good quarter with excellent operating performance. Sales were flat for the quarter at $400 million, as strong core growth in our Aerospace businesses and the contributions from the acquisition of Global Tubes were offset by foreign currency headwinds and weakness within our engineered materials interconnect and packaging business. Organic sales were down 2%. Foreign currency was a 4% headwind and acquisitions added 6%. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $86.7 million and operating margins were very strong at 21.7%, up 120 basis points from last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence: Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on New Product Development. We continue to see great results from our new product development efforts. Our businesses are doing a tremendous job developing new, highly differentiated products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets. We are consistently growing our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are effectively and efficiently developing the right products to serve our customers. One example of this investment is within our Indian R&D Center of Excellence, which we developed a number of years ago to help our businesses globalize their R&D efforts and capitalize on the strong engineering talent within India. The success and growth of this effort has been tremendous. We now have over 120 talented engineers in India with more than half of our business units having local R&D talent there. We expect continued expansion of these R&D efforts. Overall, in 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million or about 5% of our sales on RD&E. 
And some new product introductions. I'll start -- our EDAX business unit, a leader in microanalysis and micro-XRF systems, has added its state-of-the-art EDS system offering with the introduction of the next-generation Octane Elite series. The next-gen Octane Elite offers new to the world differentiated features that benefit our customers, including thermal corrosion and shock resistance, increased sensitivity to x-rays and high-speed x-ray data processing capabilities in a much smaller footprint. Our programmable power business, the global leader in programmable AC and DC power test solutions, expanded its line of stand-alone photovoltaic simulators with their newest product, the Embedded TerraSAS. The TerraSAS was specifically developed to test solar energy microgrids by mimicking the behavior of ground-based solar energy arrays. The new simulator allows for a 50% increase in output power over our existing offering and now spans a range from 5 kilowatts to 15 kilowatts of power, and you can put multiple simulators together paralleled up to support solar array installations up to 500 kilowatts of power. So very high power capability. 
And lastly, on our Reichert Technologies business, a pioneer and leader in the development of vision diagnostic devices, launched its most advanced Ocular Response Analyzer, the G3, during the quarter. The new analyzer is the only tonometer capable of measuring cornea hysteresis, which is a strong predictor of glaucoma progression and also provides a better indication of true eye pressure than other methods of tonometry. The analyzer was designed to provide a more streamlined product and better user experience. 
From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was very strong at 24% of sales in the quarter, up from 23% in last year's third quarter. 
Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. We will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channel, service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long-term growth opportunities. In the third quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We saw a very strong growth in our Aerospace businesses in both Europe and Asia during the quarter. Combined, our Aerospace businesses grew double digits organically in international markets, as a result of strong shipments to support the production ramp up of the A320neo and A350 commercial aircraft as well as the Joint Strike Fighter military aircraft. 
Now turning to acquisitions. We continue to see great success with our acquisition strategy. Thus far, in 2015, we've completed 2 deals, deploying approximately $360 million of capital and we acquired nearly $180 million in revenue. Over the last 24 months, we've completed 9 acquisitions, deployed approximately $1.2 billion in capital and acquired approximately $600 million in revenue. Our most recent acquisition, Surface Vision, was completed in the third quarter. Surface Vision develops and manufactures software-enabled vision systems to inspect the surfaces of continuously processed materials for flaws and defects. The business's proprietary high-speed defect recognition technology detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. The business is an excellent strategic acquisition for AMETEK, as it expands our presence in the nondestructive process inspection market. And in addition, Surface Vision will be able to leverage a number of AMETEK's complementary technologies and products within its Vision's systems. Surface Vision is headquartered in Hayward, California, and have annual sales of approximately $60 million. And the integration of this particular deal is going well, and we're very excited to have the Surface Vision team now as part of AMETEK. 
Our business unit and M&A teams continue to manage a very active pipeline of attractive opportunities and acquisitions will continue to be a focus for AMETEK and the primary use of our strong cash flow. 
I'll touch on our last strategy, Operational Excellence. Our team continues to deliver excellent operating performance through the use of our various Operational Excellence tools. In low-growth environments, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance, so we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion, while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall, in 2015, we now anticipate approximately $150 million of Operational Excellence savings with the largest contributor to this savings being our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, which we expect approximately $75 million in savings in 2015. 
Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. As noted, the global environment remains challenging. We're seeing sluggish conditions across many of our markets and geographies, and we expect the sluggishness to continue for the remainder of the year. Therefore, for all of 2015, we expect both overall and organic sales to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be approximately $2.55, up 5% over 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 sales are expected to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from last year's fourth quarter, with organic growth down low single digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.63 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. 
So in summary, I'm pleased with our results this quarter given the difficult market conditions. We delivered excellent operating performance and record earnings, while continuing to make long-term investments across each of our growth strategies. I'd like to take this time to acknowledge the great work by all AMETEK employees in helping drive these strong results and for their commitment to driving each of AMETEK's growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong. We generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. 
Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions."

As Frank noted, we had a solid third quarter with good operating results. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were down more than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost-containment. Gen",461,"Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid third quarter with good operating results. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were down more than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost-containment. 
General and administrative expenses were 1.1% of sales in the quarter, down from last year's third quarter level of 1.2% of sales. Other expense in the quarter was lower in comparison to last year's third quarter as a result of higher expense due to a one-time insurance write-off in last year's third quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.1%, up from 25.1% in last year's quarter. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 27.5% as a result of our ongoing international and state tax planning. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. 
On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.2% of sales in the third quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $19 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $38 million for the quarter. In 2015, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. 
Operating cash flow was $188 million in the third quarter, and free cash flow was $168 million, or 108% of net income in the quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 110% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $160 million for the acquisition of Surface Vision. Year-to-date, we've deployed approximately $360 million on acquisitions. And over the last 24 months, we have deployed $1.2 billion in capital. 
In addition, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of stock for approximately $250 million. Total debt was $1.92 billion at September 30, up $200 million from the 2014 year-end. This amount reflects the third funding from the private placement agreement we entered into last September. This funding was $150 million, was received on August 14 and was used to pay down term debt, which matured in the quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $328 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at September 30 of 32.4%. At September 30, we had approximately $950 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. 
In summary, we had a strong third quarter. We are well positioned for future growth, for the strong balance sheet and cash flow."

So we are seeing the result of the, I'll call it, industrial recession, that's being talked about substantially now. And we decided, as a result, that the fourth quarter, which also was very strong from the viewpoint of expectation, needed to be lowered a bit."

Putting that aside, we are in due diligence right now on other deals. We feel good about it. As we mentioned, it's the primary use of our cash flow. It's difficult to predict when deals will close, but you're going to be hearing from us either this quarter or surely in the first quarter of next year with additional deals."

The difference was there is obviously a global macro condition here that is having impact on a number of businesses. But when you really isolate the change in EMG, it did come down to our Aerospace businesses, which did very well, being offset by weakness in our Engineered Materials, Interconnect & Packaging business. And when we look at that Engineered Material, Interconnect & Packaging business, it is really a global macro that is driving that. It's not a specific item, et cetera.

So I guess my question is, obviously, you guys know -- you know what you're doing in terms of the cost measurement, but as we look at this sort of slow growth going forward, is -- can you continue to get margin expansion or is -- does the shift focus to more just sustaining where you're at kind of in this industrial recession-type environment?"

So as a result, our guidance has been in the 100-basis-point arena, and that's what we're expecting for the entire year, that we're going to be up about 100 basis points. As we go into next year, which really was the key part of your question, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business and one advantage of our mid-strategy is that there are a lot of actions that we can take to basically improve the operating performance by putting various manufacturing facilities together, being more aggressive in the materials side of the business, which as you know, we put tremendous infrastructure in place that we can continue to drive good earnings growth there. We've got value analysis and value engineering, which is picking up steam in the company. So we are in the process right now of putting our budgets together for next year. I'm not prepared to give you an exact number. We will do that in January or, I guess, maybe early February call, whenever we're going to have it in the beginning of the year.

And then we've been very careful as we've made the cost reductions in the company to focus on the operations side of the business, not on our engineering and sales and distribution side of the business, and that's -- you heard me in my opening remarks, talked substantially to that. So we're going to continue. And with those engineering efforts, we are hoping that we'll be able to offset some of the effects of the global macro. So the basic answer to your question is to get better organic growth and do deals, that's the key. And we'll continue as we always have. It's sort of the hallmark of AMETEK to continue to do cost improvements across the business. So those are the drivers, and that's why, as I mentioned to Joe's question, that I think we're going to see margin improvement, and you're not seeing many industrial companies right now showing double-digit EPS growth."

Typically, the fourth quarter is your best EPS quarter of the year. Are you really just trying to derisk that going to $0.63?

We just felt with the global macro that we're seeing and the changes that I've already talked about that we just decided to essentially derisk it, and we're going to obviously concentrate in Q4 on getting good results for the following year. So as you say, you've known us for many, many years, and we definitely did derisk it. The order numbers, overall orders were down about 2% in the quarter. Organically, they were actually down 5%. But that number is not a fair representation of the business, and the reason is that last year in that quarter, we had some very large one-off orders. So I think if you normalize that out, the organic growth was in line with -- or lack thereof, was in line with the sales growth.

If you look at the PMI in China, I was just reading a report, actually, last night, the latest PMI came out at 47% for China when it was running at close to 60%. So there just has been a change in the industrial environment in China. So I don't think it's a major change sort of sequentially in Asia. But clearly, it is a major driver in our organic growth. The other thing, I said minus 7% and minus 5%, those numbers were for all of Asia, okay? The minus 12% in China was offset by strong performance in Japan, actually last quarter and this quarter.
