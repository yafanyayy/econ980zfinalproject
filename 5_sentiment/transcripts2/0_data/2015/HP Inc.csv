With the first quarter of fiscal 2015 now behind us, I would say that overall, we're on track with our turnaround and executing well in our separation. In Q1, we delivered solid performance on our business operations. We achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92, which was at the high end of our outlook range.
We continue to improve profitability, growing operating profit margins across all our major business segments. We increased investment in innovation to drive the future of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., and executed well across key areas of our portfolio, including Industry Standard Servers, Converged Storage, private and managed cloud, Personal Systems and Graphics. While we have more work to do to improve performance in other parts of the business, we're about where we expected to be at this point in our turnaround journey.
Now, there a couple of factors that have an impact on our first quarter financial results and how we think about the rest of the year, and I want to address these. Let me talk for a moment about the global environment with a particular focus on unfavorable currency movements, and I also want to address cash flow. We're all aware that the global environment and currency movements have been a challenge for U.S.-based companies. For HP, the challenge is particularly acute, with 65% of our revenue is coming from outside United States and over half of that from EMEA. This all impacts HP in multiple ways. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue. Our revenue declined approximately 5% year-over-year as reported but only 2% in constant currency. In addition, the recent currency movements have disruptive the competitive pricing landscape and impacted customer demand. Aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the Printing business, given the weakness of the yen, was a continued challenge.
We were able to manage these impacts in the quarter and deliver earnings as expected, but given the specific hedges we had in place and the significant currency movement that took place in January, we anticipate the impact on the remainder of FY '15 will be greater than what we saw in Q1. We're working hard to offset these impacts through repricing and productivity, but let me be very clear, fully mitigating currency movements of this size would require reducing investments in areas like innovation, key systems and tools and placement of printer units. That simply would not be the right thing to do.
When we discussed the impact of currency in revenue in November, we estimated our headwind for fiscal 2015 to be approximately 2 points year-over-year. We now expect that headwind to be approximately 6 points assuming today's rates. That difference equates to approximately $3.3 billion in revenue, $1.5 billion in operating profit or $0.60 in earnings per share. We believe will be able to manage half of that through repricing and cost actions, but estimate a negative earnings impact of approximately $0.30 per share entirely due to currency. While we had taken down our full year earnings outlook, we remain on track to deliver flat revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Cathie will share more details on how we manage currency movements across the portfolio.
Now turning to cash flow. Q1 results were below our expectations, impacted primarily by an increase in our cash conversion cycle and by timing issues. The cash conversion cycle was higher than expected as a result of higher day sales outstanding. Also, we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than we expected, and outperformed on HP Financial Services volume which negatively impact cash year-on-year. However, except for the currency impact and separation payments, we would have expected cash flow for the full year to be in line with our original outlook of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. Cathie will have more to say about this in a moment.
Now let's talk about business performance and innovation, and as I said at the beginning of the call, we continue to make progress in our operating performance. In Personal Systems, the team is executing well. We outgrew the market and gained share across all our regions. We saw particular strength in notebooks, where we regained our #1 share position worldwide. Commercial remains a key focus for us and at Discover in December, we announced the industry's thinnest and lightest business-class notebook, enabling our customers to be more productive in more places. 
In Printing, profitability remains strong but we continue to face top line challenges. Hardware and supplies revenue declined. And going forward, we are going to be more aggressive in placing units to support long-term supplies growth. I'm looking forward to some of the exciting new products Dion and his team are planning to launch in the coming months.
The other products group performed well with 9% growth in constant currency in Industry Standard Servers, led by strong Gen 9 adoption and improved strong sales execution. HP's end-to-end compute strategy led by the Gen9 portfolio has redefined the broader portfolio and improvement in sales execution are paying off. We also saw improved performance in Business Critical Systems and our new products are gaining traction with customers. During the quarter, we expanded our server portfolio with HP Integrity Superdome X and HP Integrity Nonstop X. These platforms run our customers' more demanding mission-critical workloads on x86 architectures with higher levels of performance, scalability, availability and efficiency.
In Storage, we returned to growth in constant currency and we anticipate a fourth quarter of external disk market share expansion based on calendar Q4 results. We continue to see an industry shift to the midrange, which is our sweet spot. And at Discover, we announced a refreshed portfolio of mid-range and flash-optimized HP 3PAR storage systems, and it's becoming clear around the industry that our HP Converged storage portfolio is the best in the market. Just this month, HP 3PAR won the 2014 Search Storage Product of the Year Gold Award.
However, in Networking, results were disappointing after many quarters of growth. We had execution issues in the U.S. and in China, which we are working to address. We made leadership changes in China in the quarter which we believe will strengthen our ability to compete effectively in what remains a tough market. And in the U.S., we are realigning sales incentives to increase focus.
We continue to bring new Networking solutions to market. Just last week, we announced a new line of open network switches providing web scale customers choice, agility and scalability in their data center networks. We are focused on winning in this business and you will continue to see us make aggressive moves over the coming quarters.
Technology Services was consistent with recent quarters with strong and predictable profitability. The team continued to execute while improving efficiency across the organization while driving order growth in constant currency. We were pleased with the continued momentum in our portfolio office like Proactive Care and Data center Care.
In Cloud, our HP Helion portfolio continues to gain traction worldwide, capturing market share in open hybrid cloud. During the quarter, we announced HP Helion wins with Alcatel Lucent, Halfords, Telecom Italian and Symantec, and we've seen strong pull through of HP products and services by new customers of HP Helion.
Last month, HP Helion was recognized as a leader by Forrester Research in their inaugural Forrester Wave for private cloud in China earning the highest ranking for strategy. And early in the quarter, IDC recognized HP as a leader in U.S. government private cloud.
In Enterprise Services, revenue continue to be impacted by key account run off, softness in EMEA and currency headwinds. However, profitability improved year-over-year in line with our expectations and sales metrics are reflecting the go-to-market transformation underway in this business.
Among recent new logo wins, HP Enterprise Services was selected by TNT or the world's largest express delivery companies, to help future proof the business by consolidating and virtualizing its IT infrastructure and moving some functions to an HP Helion managed virtual private cloud environment.
And just today, we announced a major multibillion-dollar customer win with Deutsche Bank. With this partnership, HP will help Deutsche Bank meet its long-term business objectives through a transformation of its IT infrastructure, including a customize HP Helion solution that will enable them to focus on creating and delivering new services for their clients. This was a hard-fought win for HP, and I'm very pleased with the outcome.
In Software, we continue to shift our phone and operating model to SaaS and subscription-based offerings. Customer consumption behavior and the need to adjust sale motions accordingly created a near-term revenue headwind. Total revenue was down. However, we saw growth in security and our recent acquisition of Voltage [ph] Security strengthens our portfolio in data encryption. During the quarter, we also unveiled HP HAVEn on-demand, an important milestone in our Big Data strategy that gives organizations cloud-based structures to our HAVEn analytics platform. Overall, we continue to see strength across the different businesses, while other areas still need more work. Operationally, we get stronger with each passing month. And just as important, our innovation engine continues to hum, and I expect that the pace of innovation will accelerate through the rest of the year.
With that, let me turn it over to Cathie to take a deeper look at the financial performance and our outlook."

Overall, we delivered revenue of $26.8 billion, down 5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. Despite currency headwinds and even as we continued to increase our R&D investments, we improved profitability year-over-year.Gross marg",2658,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, we delivered revenue of $26.8 billion, down 5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. Despite currency headwinds and even as we continued to increase our R&D investments, we improved profitability year-over-year.
Gross margin was 23.4%, up 0.6 points year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter gross margin was down 1.2 points in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.8%, up 0.3 points year-over-year.
We are nearing the completion of our 2012 restructuring plan. In Q1, about 2,800 people exited the company, making the total reduction to date approximately 44,000. We are on track to complete this existing program with a total of 55,000 people expected to exit by the end of fiscal '15.
However, we do anticipate incremental opportunities for operational improvements identified through the separation process. Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.92 primarily excludes pretax charges of $222 million for amortization of intangible assets, $146 million for restructuring and $80 million associated with the separation. Including these charges, GAAP diluted net EPS earnings per share for Q1 were $0.73, in line with our previously provided outlook of $0.72 to $0.76 per share.
Turning to the business performance. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 3% in constant currency or flat as reported. We outgrew the market and gained share across all regions while increasing profitability year-over-year to 3.7%. We saw particular strength in notebooks and continue to rollout exciting products. While commercial revenue was up only 1% in constant currency following the XP migration, we saw an increase in consumer momentum with 4% revenue growth in constant currency.
In Printing, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency or 5% as reported, with some challenges in both hardware and supplies and particular weakness in Russia. Profitability remains strong at 19.2%. Declines in low end homes and single function mono laser hardware units drove overall units down 4% year-over-year. While it will take some time to turn the corner, we continue to make progress in our strategy of improving the quality of our installed base. Our unit mix improved with solid growth in key high usage product like OfficeJet Pro X and value multifunction printers. Graphics performance remains strong with our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The increase in scale had contributed to a year-over-year increase in operating profit. Also, in managed print services, we saw double-digit total contract value growth year-over-year.
Although we still saw declines in overall supplies revenue, we continue to improve with the revenue trajectory at Ink, while managing ink and toner channel inventory within desired ranges. Overall, supplies revenue mix was 65% of total print revenue. 
The Enterprise Group performed well with revenue up 3% in constant currency or flat as reported, with strong profitability of 15.6%. ISS revenue grew 9% in constant currency or 7% as reported, with growth across all regions and strength in core rack and [indiscernible] categories. We also saw some recovery and Business Critical Systems with revenue down only 7% in constant currency or 9% as reported.
In Storage, performance improved in Q1 with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency or flat as reported. Converged storage was up 21%, now making up 50% of total Storage revenue. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 12% year-over-year. All flash 3PAR revenue accelerated now making up 20% of total 3PAR midrange portfolio.
Also, we expect to be the only scale vendor to gain external dish share year-over-year for the last 4 quarters.
In Networking, revenue was down 9% year-over-year in constant currency or down 11% as reported. However, we continue to see positive momentum in our data center switching business, which grew for the fifth consecutive quarter. And while we had execution issues in the U.S. and China, we delivered solid revenue growth in the rest of the world.
Technology Services revenue was down 2% year-over-year in constant currency or down 5% as reported. Orders grew in constant currency driven by support in EMEA and strong renewals.
Enterprise Services revenue was down 8% year-over-year in constant currency or down 11% as reported. Application and business Services and IT outsourcing were each down 11%, as key account run-offs and weaknesses in EMEA offset the because were seeing it strategic Enterprise Services or Services for the New Style of IT. Profitability improved year-over-year to 3%, up 1.9 points, driven primarily by productivity actions and improved margins in underperforming accounts.
Also, the sales team increased efficiency with improved win rates and reduced field selling costs. Total contract value was up with double-digit growth in renewables, in new logos and in SES signings, with particular strength in key areas including cloud and Big Data.
Software revenue was down 3% year-over-year in constant currency or down 5% as reported, as we faced execution challenges and headwinds from our shift to SaaS. Profitability was 18%, up 2.2 points year-over-year as we effectively managed costs while increasing R&D investment in strategic areas such as big data and security.
Finally, in HP Financial Services, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency or down 8% as reported due to an early contract termination in the prior year period, making for a tough compare for revenue and operating profit. However, we experienced double digit new volume growth and record high attach rate to HP's products and services. ROE was just over 17% and HP Financial Services continues to be a key differentiator for HP.
Before we get to the outlook, I want to spend a bit more time helping you understand how currency impacts our business. With 2/3 of our revenue coming from outside of the U.S., the impact from currency movements is significant. As Meg said, we have taken down our full year non-GAAP earnings outlook and this is entirely due to the currency challenges she described. We continue to offset currency movements as much is possible through hedging strategy. We have rolling hedging program, which is designed to minimize the volatility of result by dampening large fluctuation. However, significant sustained currency moves cannot be managed by hedges alone. We also use repricing as a lever when possible considering competitive market dynamics. The hedging programs vary by business depending upon these factors.
As an example, Personal Systems and our EEG hardware businesses have very little in natural hedges, as our component contracts are typically in U.S. dollars. As a result, these businesses are disproportionately impacted by currency movements. However, we do have some ability to increase pricing in response to currency movements, while being mindful of competition and potential negative impacts to customer demand.
In Printing, we have a lot of moving parts with currency impacting our business both directly and indirectly. Like the other segments, the Printing business is negatively impacted by the strength of the dollar on the top and bottom line. The weaker yen helps the cost side of our business, but it also allows our Japanese competitors to price much more aggressively. In addition, Printing specifically the laser business, is overweight in Russia which adds yet another dimension to currency impact.
Services had more natural hedges since revenue and expenses are more closely matched in the same currency, but due to the nature of the contracts, where pricing in response to currency movements is less of a lever. Across all of our businesses, we will continue to manage the currency challenge while also making the right trade-offs to support our strategy for long-term success.
We discussed the currency impact for the P&L, but now let me talk about the balance sheet. As we discussed last quarter, we hedge our balance sheet based on anticipated net monetary assets and liabilities. Any hedge gains or losses are reported within the other assets and liabilities section, and not to specific cash flow line item. Across the specific line items in Q1, we saw the largest impact from currency on working capital and financing receivables. The change to our cash conversion cycle would suggest that working capital headwind year-over-year of approximately $750 million. But the actual headwind is approximately $1.1 billion when including the hedge gain that is reported in other assets and liabilities. Similarly, the cash headwind from reporting financing receivable appears in the statement of cash flows to be approximately $100 million, but it is actually closer to $250 million when including this adjustment. The offset means that the headwind of approximately $1.3 billion in other assets and liabilities is actually a lower headwind of about $800 million. Making this distinction is important so we can focus on the true drivers of cash flow.
Next, I want to discuss cash flow and capital allocation. In Q1, cash flow from operations was $744 million and free cash flow was negative $73 million. We have several factors impacting our operating and free cash flow in Q1. Remember, Q1 is typically the lowest cash flow quarter for HP and we did expect this to be true again in fiscal '15. Having said that, the cash flow results were down year-over-year and somewhat below our expectations, and I want to take minutes to explain.
First, we had a working capital impact. The cash conversion cycle increased sequentially in Q1 '15 but declined sequentially in Q1 '14, which created a headwind of about $1.1 billion net of hedging. While we anticipated a lot of this, day sales outstanding was higher than expected largely due to nonrecurring operational issues in the quarter, intra-month linearity in January and other smaller factors. Some of these smaller factors may continue and are captured in our outlook.
We still expect the cash conversion cycle to be 10 to 12 days by year-end as we continue to make the right trade-offs between the use of cash and P&L optimization. As an example, we may decide to ship finished goods by boat versus by plane, which increases inventory but reduces cost of sales. Similarly, taking advantage of early pay discounts from suppliers reduces cost but decreases accounts payable. We do a full cost-benefit analysis to make sure these decisions drive economic value.
Next, we had a tough compare. Q1 '14 including proceeds from a large real estate sale, which drove an increase in net CapEx year-over-year in Q1 '15. Finally, there were several other unfavorable movement in Q1 '15. We had double-digit capital lease volume growth, which obviously is great for our business, but this is a greater use of cash of this year than last. We also ended the quarter with higher receivables from vendor rebates and contract manufacturers, as well as lower litigation reserves. And we've made restructuring payments earlier in the year than expected. I wanted to reemphasize that while Q1 cash flow was down year-over-year, we remain confident in our ability to generate cash as we've demonstrated over many quarters. We are providing an provided outlook today to our free cash flow, but the reductions in our $6.5 billion to $7 billion outlook last quarter is only due to currency and separation impacts we have announced today.
Turning to capital allocation. In Q1, we repurchased 41.1 million shares and paid $304 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $1.9 billion. This makes up for the $750 million shortfall from our fiscal 2014 commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Turning to the separation. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we will incur incremental separation costs and foreign tax expenses in both fiscal 2015 and 2016, associated with separating into 2 companies. The scale of this separation is unprecedented in its size and complexity. Over the past few months, we defined and quantified the expected charges related to the separation. These charges include finance, IT, consulting and legal fees, real estate and other items that are incremental and one-time in nature and not reflective of our operational performance. In addition, we've estimated our incremental foreign tax expenses related to the extent separation of foreign legal entities. The charges and taxes associated with this separation are excluded from our non-GAAP earnings.
The Q1 GAAP charge associated with the separation was $80 million and we expect the Q2 GAAP charge to be approximately $250 million. Full year fiscal '15 charges are expected to be $1.3 billion and the FY '16 estimate is $500 million. While these are large numbers, they represent less than 2% of our annual operating cost and are necessary to realize the potential of the separation into 2 world-class companies.
Separation-related capital spend this year is expected to be approximately $300 million. The incremental growth foreign tax expenses are estimated to be about $950 million in fiscal 2015. We do expect more than half of the tax expenses to be offset by foreign tax credits. In fiscal '15, we anticipate a credit of about $200 million and the rest over the next few years. We will continue to provide updates on our separation on our quarterly calls.
Turning to the outlook for Q2 and the remainder of fiscal 2015. From a macro perspective, we have already talked about the impact associated with currency shifts. Additionally, we see continued challenges across certain geographies including China where we anticipate increasing competitiveness from local vendors, and Russia, where political and economic concerns our ongoing. These challenges are being offset to some degree by strengthening of the U.S. economy.
By business. In Personal Systems, while the PC market is expected to continue to contract, we plan to leverage our brand, channel, scale and strong product lineup to continue to gain share profitably. We will take advantage of the momentum in consumer and continue our strategic focus on commercial, including commercial mobility.
In Printing, we're planning to be more aggressive in placing hardware units with continued focus on high-value units. We will manage supply channel inventory closely, while driving further stability in supplies revenue in fiscal '15.
In Enterprise Group, we expect server momentum to continue with the Gen9 lineup and server refresh cycle. We expect Storage particularly 3PAR to outperform key competitors, especially in the midrange.
In Networking, we expect continued challenges in the near term but are making adjustments to improve execution.
In Enterprise Services, we expect continued improvement in profitability, making progress towards our long-term goal of 7% to 9% operating profit. And remain confident in our full year operating margin outlook of 4% to 6%. Given the current revenue trajectory and the expectation that currency will continue to be a headwind, we are providing a new Enterprise Services full year revenue outlook. Because of the currency volatility, going forward, we will provide this on a constant currency basis. We now expect full year revenue to decline 4% to 6%. We expect year-over-year revenue performance improvement in the second half of fiscal '15.
In Software, we plan to continue to shift our go-to-market focus and further align our product portfolio to best capture the growing SaaS opportunity. We also have much more work to do to drive consistent sales execution across the organization.
Overall for fiscal '15, we remain optimistic about the market opportunity and our competitive positioning. However, the currency headwind at currency rates cannot be fully absorbed. We've done detailed modeling using exchange rates and assumptions for pricing and productivity. With all that in mind, we're updating fiscal '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook to be $3.53 to $3.73, which is lower by $0.30 due to currency headwinds. Fiscal '15 GAAP diluted earnings per share out in the range of $2.03 to $2.23. Q2 fiscal '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is expected to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88, which includes $0.09 of currency pressure. Q2 fiscal '15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.57 to $0.61. Given the updated our earnings outlook for currency and the introduction of cash-related separation activities, we're updating our fiscal '15 free cash flow outlook to be approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And I believe the reason the reason that we won is we have the best technical solution for what Deutsche Bank needed, which was to reduce cost, reduce cost significantly by the way, increase agility and migrate to a new world order of CIDC DevOps in a cloud-based environment. So I think we showed up with the best team, with the best technical solution and a competitive price. As you know, this is a long sales cycle business. I think we first engaged with the Deutsche Bank over 18 months ago, maybe even closer to 2 years. So these are long-standing deals. But we're very excited because everyone in the industry wanted this business. It was a hallmark or lighthouse account and we did it is not my terms, so we feel pretty good about it. I would say Helion was a big part of the differentiated solution. I think our ability to provide global support at an unprecedented scale was an important part of the win. And our ability to advise and transform. The key risk in these deals is how do you get from where you are to where you need to be, and I think we were judged to be the safest pair of hands."

You're right, we had 2 execution challenges, one in China and one in the U.S. and I think we touched on those. The strategy here is exactly the same strategy in many ways that we've deployed with servers, which is a market-segmentation strategy. What kind of customers want to buy what kind of gear and then we need to have that for them. So for example, in servers, we have high-performance compute, and we have terrific data center switches and wired and wireless LAN products. But we also benefited from having a hyperscale offering to our joint venture with Foxconn in the server business which led to the pieces we should have a bright box strategy for our Networking business because this a lot of people for whom that is a solution that they prefer, and better for us to offer it and surround with other HP product and services than walk away from that market segment entirely. We're very clear that we'll be played businesses in which we can grow profitably. We have no interest in losing money in any business. And we believe in this new opportunity that we announced that will make money there. So it is a market segmentation-based strategy where we have to have the right product, with the right services attached that allows us to make money and gain share.

We believe that PCs will be in small decline, but there are pockets of growth across the segment in some segments including mobility, accessories and services. We've seen and expect the slowdown in the commercial segment following the XP refresh that fueled high-growth last year. However, we've seen to counterbalance that the momentum in the consumer side of the business as consumers refresh of their older PCs. So looking forward, the market remains competitive. We believe we can continue to gain share in the areas where we choose to play, as the market consolidates, specifically, we're sort of focused on profitable growth in 3 areas. Firstly, we're investing in key growth areas of convertibles, commercial mobility, accessories and services with in the markets.

So the biggest headwind to free cash flow this year over last year is the cash conversion cycle, basically going to back to 10 to 12 days.

That's what is driving the 10 to 12 days. But once we get to that 10 to 12 days, they year on year compare for '16 and that headwind is significantly reduced. So that's one of the big kind of tailwinds to cash flow. You're absolutely right with a the separation costs are going to come down. So the separation costs are anticipated to be $1.3 billion in fiscal '15 and about $500 million in fiscal '16. We don't think there's separation CapEx. The foreign taxes return to credit.

With the first quarter of fiscal 2015 now behind us, I would say that overall, we're on track with our turnaround and executing well on our separation. In Q1, we delivered solid performance on our business operations. We achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92, which was at the high end of our outlook range.
We continue to improve profitability, growing operating profit margins across all our major business segments. We increased investment in innovation to drive the future of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., and we executed well across key areas of our portfolio, including Industry Standard Servers, Converged Storage, private and managed cloud, Personal Systems and Graphics. While we have more work to do to improve performance in other parts of the business, we're about where we expected to be at this point in our turnaround journey.
Now there a couple of factors that had an impact on our first quarter financial results and how we think about the rest of the year, and I want to address these. Let me talk for a moment about the global environment with a particular focus on unfavorable currency movements, and I also want to address cash flow. We're all aware that the global environment and currency movements have been a challenge for U.S.-based companies. For HP, the challenge is particularly acute, with 65% of our revenue coming from outside the United States and over half of that from EMEA. This all impacts HP in multiple ways. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue. Our revenue declined approximately 5% year-over-year as reported but only 2% in constant currency. In addition, the recent currency movements have disrupted the competitive pricing landscape and impacted customer demand. Aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the Printing business, given the weakness of the yen, was a continued challenge.
We were able to manage these impacts in the quarter and deliver earnings as expected, but given the specific hedges we had in place and the significant currency movement that took place in January, we anticipate the impact on the remainder of FY '15 will be greater than what we saw in Q1. We're working hard to offset these impacts through repricing and productivity, but let me be very clear. Fully mitigating currency movements of this size would require reducing investments in areas like innovation, key systems and tools and placement of printer units. That simply would not be the right thing to do.
When we discussed the impact of currency on revenue in November, we estimated our headwind for fiscal 2015 to be approximately 2 points year-over-year. We now expect that headwind to be approximately 6 points assuming today's rates. That difference equates to approximately $3.3 billion in revenue, $1.5 billion in operating profit or $0.60 in earnings per share. We believe will be able to manage half of that through repricing and cost actions but estimate a negative earnings impact of approximately $0.30 per share entirely due to currency. While we have taken down our full year earnings outlook, we remain on track to deliver flat revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Cathie will share more details on how we manage currency movements across the portfolio.
Now turning to cash flow. Q1 results were below our expectations, impacted primarily by an increase in our cash conversion cycle and by timing issues. The cash conversion cycle was higher than expected as a result of higher day sales outstanding. Also, we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than we expected and outperformed on HP Financial Services volume, which negatively impact cash year-on-year. However, except for the currency impact and separation payments, we would have expected cash flow for the full year to be in line with our original outlook of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. Cathie will have more to say about this in a moment.
Now let's talk about business performance and innovation. And as I said at the beginning of the call, we continue to make progress in our operating performance. In Personal Systems, the team is executing well. We outgrew the market and gained share across all regions. We saw particular strength in notebooks, where we regained our #1 share position worldwide. Commercial remains a key focus for us. And at Discover in December, we announced the industry's thinnest and lightest business-class notebook, enabling our customers to be more productive in more places. 
In Printing, profitability remained strong, but we continue to face top line challenges. Hardware and supplies revenue declined. And going forward, we are going to be more aggressive in placing units to support long-term supplies growth. I'm looking forward to some of the exciting new products Dion and his team are planning to launch in the coming months.
The Enterprise Group performed well with 9% growth in constant currency in Industry Standard Servers, led by strong Gen9 adoption and improved sales execution. HP's end-to-end compute strategy led by the Gen9 portfolio has redefined the broader server industry, and improvements in sales execution are paying off. We also saw improved performance in Business Critical Systems, and our new products are gaining traction with customers. During the quarter, we expanded our server portfolio with HP Integrity Superdome X and HP Integrity NonStop X. These platforms run our customers' most demanding, mission-critical workloads on x86 architectures with higher levels of performance, scalability, availability and efficiency.
In Storage, we returned to growth in constant currency, and we anticipate a fourth quarter of external disk market share expansion based on calendar Q4 results. We continue to see an industry shift to the midrange, which is our sweet spot. And at Discover, we announced a refreshed portfolio of midrange and flash-optimized HP 3PAR StoreServ systems, and it's becoming clear around the industry that our HP Converged Storage portfolio is the best in the market. Just this month, HP 3PAR won the 2014 Search Storage Product of the Year gold award.
However, in Networking, results were disappointing after many quarters of growth. We had execution issues in the U.S. and in China, which we are working to address. We made leadership changes in China in the quarter, which we believe will strengthen our ability to compete effectively in what remains a tough market. And in the U.S., we are realigning sales incentives to increase focus. We continue to bring new Networking solutions to market. Just last week, we announced a new line of open network switches, providing web scale customers choice, agility and scalability in their data center networks. We are focused on winning in this business, and you will continue to see us make aggressive moves over the coming quarters.
Technology Services was consistent with recent quarters with strong and predictable profitability. The team continued to execute well, improving efficiency across the organization while driving order growth in constant currency. We were pleased with the continued momentum in newer portfolio offerings like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care.
In Cloud, our HP Helion portfolio continues to gain traction worldwide, capturing market share in open hybrid cloud. During the quarter, we announced HP Helion wins with Alcatel-Lucent, Halfords, Telecom Italia and Symantec, and we've seen strong pull-through of HP products and services by new customers of HP Helion. Last month, HP Helion was recognized as a leader by Forrester Research in their inaugural Forrester Wave for private cloud in China, earning the highest ranking for strategy. And early in the quarter, IDC recognized HP as a leader in U.S. government private cloud.
In Enterprise Services, revenue continued to be impacted by key account runoff, softness in EMEA and currency headwinds. However, profitability improved year-over-year, in line with our expectations. And sales metrics are reflecting the go-to-market transformation underway in this business. Among recent new logo wins, HP Enterprise Services was selected by TNT, one of the world's largest express delivery companies, to help future-proof the business by consolidating and virtualizing its IT infrastructure and moving some functions to an HP Helion-managed virtual private cloud environment. And just today, we announced a major multibillion-dollar customer win with Deutsche Bank. With this partnership, HP will help Deutsche Bank meet its long-term business objectives through a transformation of its IT infrastructure, including a customized HP Helion solution that will enable them to focus on creating and delivering new services for their clients. This was a hard-fought win for HP, and I'm very pleased with the outcome.
In Software, we continue to shift our portfolio and operating model to SaaS and subscription-based offerings. Customer consumption behavior and the need to adjust sales motions accordingly created a near-term revenue headwind. Total revenue was down. However, we saw growth in security, and our recent acquisition of Voltage Security strengthens our portfolio in data encryption. During the quarter, we also unveiled HP HAVEn OnDemand, an important milestone in our Big Data strategy that gives organizations cloud-based access to key components of our HAVEn analytics platform. 
Overall, we continue to see strength across many of our businesses while other areas still need more work. Operationally, we get stronger with each passing month. And just as important, our innovation engine continues to hum, and I expect that the pace of innovation will accelerate through the rest of the year.
With that, let me turn it over to Cathie to take a deeper look at the financial performance and our outlook."

Overall, we delivered revenue of $26.8 billion, down 5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. Despite currency headwinds and even as we continued to increase our R&D investments, we improved profitability year-over-year. Gross margin was 23.4%, up 0.6 points year-over-year. And quarter-over-quarter gross margin was down 1.2 points, in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.8%, up 0.3 points year-over-year.  
We are nearing the completion of our 2012 restructuring plan. In Q1, about 2,800 people exited the company, making the total reduction to date approximately 44,000. We are on track to complete this existing program with a total of 55,000 people expected to exit by the end of fiscal '15. However, we do anticipate incremental opportunities for operational improvements identified through the separation process. 
Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.92 primarily excludes pretax charges of $222 million for amortization of intangible assets, $146 million for restructuring and $80 million associated with the separation. Including these charges, GAAP diluted net earnings per share for Q1 was $0.73, in line with our previously provided outlook of $0.72 to $0.76 per share.
Turning to the business performance. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 3% in constant currency or flat as reported. We outgrew the market and gained share across all regions while increasing profitability year-over-year to 3.7%. We saw particular strength in notebooks and continued to rollout exciting products. While commercial revenue was up only 1% in constant currency following the XP migration, we saw an increase in consumer momentum with 4% revenue growth in constant currency.
In Printing, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency or 5% as reported, with some challenges in both hardware and supplies and particular weakness in Russia. Profitability remains strong at 19.2%. Declines in low-end home and single-function mono laser hardware units drove overall units down 4% year-over-year. While it will take some time to turn the corner, we continue to make progress in our strategy of improving the quality of our installed base. Our unit mix improved with solid growth in key high-usage products like Officejet Pro X and value multifunction printers. 
Graphics performance remains strong with our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The increase in scale has contributed to a year-over-year increase in operating profit. Also, in Managed Print Services, we saw double-digit total contract value growth year-over-year. Although we still saw declines in overall supplies revenue, we continue to improve the revenue trajectory in ink while managing ink and toner channel inventory within desired ranges. Overall, supplies revenue mix was 65% of total print revenue. 
The Enterprise Group performed well with revenue up 3% in constant currency or flat as reported, with strong profitability of 15.6%. ISS revenue grew 9% in constant currency or 7% as reported, with growth across all regions and strength in core rack and blades categories. We also saw some recovery in Business Critical Systems with revenue down only 7% in constant currency or 9% as reported.
In Storage, performance improved in Q1, with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency or flat as reported. Converged Storage was up 21%, now making up 50% of total Storage revenue. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 12% year-over-year. All-flash 3PAR revenue accelerated, now making up 20% of total 3PAR midrange portfolio. Also, we expect to be the only scaled vendor to gain external disk share year-over-year for the last 4 quarters.
In Networking, revenue was down 9% year-over-year in constant currency or down 11% as reported. However, we continue to see positive momentum in our data center switching business, which grew for the fifth consecutive quarter. And while we had execution issues in the U.S. and China, we delivered solid revenue growth in the rest of the world.
Technology Services revenue was down 2% year-over-year in constant currency or down 5% as reported. Orders grew in constant currency, driven by support in EMEA and strong renewals.
Enterprise Services revenue was down 8% year-over-year in constant currency or down 11% as reported. Application and business services and IT outsourcing were each down 11% as key account runoff and weaknesses in EMEA offset the momentum we're seeing in strategic Enterprise Services or services for the New Style of IT. Profitability improved year-over-year to 3%, up 1.9 points, driven primarily by productivity actions and improved margins in underperforming accounts. Also, the sales team increased efficiency with improved win rates and reduced field selling costs. Total contract value was up with double-digit growth in renewals, in new logos and in SCS signings, with particular strength in key areas including cloud and Big Data.
Software revenue was down 3% year-over-year in constant currency or down 5% as reported as we faced execution challenges and headwinds from our shift to SaaS. Profitability was 18%, up 2.2 points year-over-year, as we effectively managed costs while increasing R&D investment in strategic areas such as Big Data and security.
Finally, in HP Financial Services, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency or down 8% as reported due to an early contract termination in the prior year period, making for a tough compare for revenue and operating profit. However, we experienced double-digit new volume growth and record-high attach rate to HP's products and services. ROE was just over 17%, and HP Financial Services continues to be a key differentiator for HP.
Before we get to the outlook, I want to spend a bit more time helping you understand how currency impacts our business. With 2/3 of our revenue coming from outside of the U.S., the impact from currency movements is significant. As Meg said, we have taken down our full year non-GAAP earnings outlook and this is entirely due to the currency challenges she described. We continue to offset currency movements as much as possible through hedging strategy. We have rolling hedging program, which is designed to minimize the volatility of results by dampening large fluctuation. However, significant and sustained currency moves cannot be managed by hedges alone. We also use repricing as a lever when possible considering competitive market dynamics. The hedging programs vary by business depending upon these factors.
As an example, Personal Systems and our EG hardware businesses have very little and natural hedges as our component contracts are typically in U.S. dollars. As a result, these businesses are disproportionately impacted by currency movements. However, we do have some ability to increase pricing in response to currency movements while being mindful of competition and potential negative impacts to customer demand.
In Printing, we have a lot of moving parts with currency impacting our business both directly and indirectly. Like the other segments, the Printing business is negatively impacted by the strength of the dollar on the top and bottom line. The weaker yen helps the cost side of our business, but it also allows our Japanese competitors to price much more aggressively. In addition, Printing, specifically the laser business, is overweight in Russia, which adds yet another dimension to currency impact.
Services have more natural hedges since revenue and expenses are more closely matched in the same currency, but due to the nature of the contracts, repricing in response to currency movements is less of a lever. Across all of our businesses, we will continue to manage the currency challenge while also making the right trade-offs to support our strategy for long-term success.
We discussed the currency impacts to the P&L, but now let me talk about the balance sheet. As we discussed last quarter, we hedge our balance sheet based on anticipated net monetary assets and liabilities. Any hedge gains or losses are reported within the other assets and liabilities section and not the specific cash flow line item. Across the specific line items in Q1, we saw the largest impact from currency on working capital and financing receivables. The change to our cash conversion cycle would suggest a working capital headwind year-over-year of approximately $750 million. But the actual headwind is approximately $1.1 billion when including the hedge gain that is reported in other assets and liabilities. Similarly, the cash headwind from reported financing receivables appears in the statement of cash flows to be approximately $100 million but is actually closer to $250 million when including this adjustment. The offset means that the headwind of approximately $1.3 billion in other assets and liabilities is actually a lower headwind of about $800 million. Making this distinction is important so we can focus on the true drivers of cash flow.
Next, I want to discuss cash flow and capital allocation. In Q1, cash flow from operations was $744 million and free cash flow was negative $73 million. We have several factors impacting our operating and free cash flow in Q1. Remember, Q1 is typically the lowest cash flow quarter for HP and we did expect this to be true again in fiscal '15. Having said that, the cash flow results were down year-over-year and somewhat below our expectations. And I want to take minutes to explain.
First, we had a working capital impact. The cash conversion cycle increased sequentially in Q1 '15 but declined sequentially in Q1 '14, which created a headwind of about $1.1 billion net of hedging. While we anticipated a lot of this, day sales outstanding was higher than expected largely due to nonrecurring operational issues in the quarter, intra-month linearity in January and other smaller factors. Some of these smaller factors may continue and are captured in our outlook. 
We still expect the cash conversion cycle to be 10 to 12 days by year-end as we continue to make the right trade-offs between the use of cash and P&L optimization. As an example, we may decide to ship finished goods by boat versus by plane, which increases inventory but reduces cost of sales. Similarly, taking advantage of early pay discounts from suppliers reduces cost but decreases accounts payable. We do a full cost-benefit analysis to make sure these decisions drive economic value.
Next, we had a tough compare. Q1 '14 included proceeds from a large real estate sale, which drove an increase in net CapEx year-over-year in Q1 '15. 
Finally, there were several other unfavorable movements in Q1 '15. We had double-digit capital lease volume growth, which obviously is great for our business, but this was a greater use of cash of this year than last. We also ended the quarter with higher receivables from vendor rebates and contract manufacturers as well as lower litigation reserves. And we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than expected. I want to reemphasize that while Q1 cash flow was down year-over-year, we remain confident in our ability to generate cash as we've demonstrated over many quarters. We are providing an updated outlook today to our free cash flow, but the reduction from our $6.5 billion to $7 billion outlook last quarter is only due to currency and separation impacts we've announced today.
Turning to capital allocation. In Q1, we repurchased 41.1 million shares and paid $304 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $1.9 billion. This makes up for the $750 million shortfall from our fiscal 2014 commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Turning to the separation. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we will incur incremental separation costs and foreign tax expenses in both fiscal 2015 and 2016 associated with separating into 2 companies. The scale of this separation is unprecedented in its size and complexity. Over the past few months, we defined and quantified the expected charges related to the separation. These charges include finance, IT, consulting and legal fees, real estate and other items that are incremental and onetime in nature and not reflective of our operational performance. In addition, we've estimated our incremental foreign tax expenses related to the separation of foreign legal entities. The charges and taxes associated with this separation are excluded from our non-GAAP earnings.
The Q1 GAAP charge associated with the separation was $80 million, and we expect the Q2 GAAP charge to be approximately $250 million. Full year fiscal '15 charges are expected to be $1.3 billion and the FY '16 estimate is $500 million. While these are large numbers, they represent less than 2% of our annual operating cost and are necessary to realize the potential of the separation into 2 world-class companies.
Separation-related capital spend this year is expected to be approximately $300 million. The incremental gross foreign tax expenses are estimated to be about $950 million in fiscal 2015. We do expect more than half of the tax expenses to be offset by foreign tax credits. In fiscal '15, we anticipate a credit of about $200 million and the rest over the next few years. We will continue to provide updates on our separation on our quarterly calls.
Turning to the outlook for Q2 and the remainder of fiscal 2015. From a macro perspective, we've already talked about the impact associated with currency shifts. Additionally, we see continued challenges across certain geographies, including China, where we anticipate increasing competitiveness from local vendors, and Russia, where political and economic concerns are ongoing. These challenges are being offset to some degree by strengthening of the U.S. economy.
By business. In Personal Systems, while the PC market is expected to continue to contract, we plan to leverage our brand, channel, scale and strong product lineup to continue to gain share profitably. We will take advantage of the momentum in consumer and continue our strategic focus on commercial, including commercial mobility.
In Printing, we're planning to be more aggressive in placing hardware units with continued focus on high-value units. We will manage supplies channel inventory closely while driving further stability in supplies revenue in fiscal '15.
In Enterprise Group, we expect server momentum to continue with the Gen9 lineup and server refresh cycle. We expect Storage, particularly 3PAR, to outperform key competitors, especially in the midrange.
In Networking, we expect continued challenges in the near term but are making adjustments to improve execution.
In Enterprise Services, we expect continued improvement in profitability, making progress towards our long-term goal of 7% to 9% operating profit and remain confident in our full year operating margin outlook of 4% to 6%. Given the current revenue trajectory and the expectation that currency will continue to be a headwind, we are providing a new Enterprise Services full year revenue outlook. Because of the currency volatility, going forward, we will provide this on a constant currency basis. We now expect full year revenue to decline 4% to 6%. We expect year-over-year revenue performance improvement in the second half of fiscal '15.
In Software, we plan to continue to shift our go-to-market focus and further align our product portfolio to best capture the growing SaaS opportunity. We also have much more work to do to drive consistent sales execution across the organization.
Overall for fiscal '15, we remain optimistic about the market opportunity and our competitive positioning. However, the currency headwind at current rates cannot be fully absorbed. We've done detailed modeling using current exchange rates and assumptions for repricing and productivity. With all that in mind, we're updating fiscal '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook to be $3.53 to $3.73, which is lower by $0.30 due to currency headwinds. Fiscal '15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $2.03 to $2.23. Q2 fiscal '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is expected to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88, which includes $0.09 of currency pressure. Q2 fiscal '15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.57 to $0.61. Given the updated our earnings outlook for currency and the introduction of cash-related separation activities, we are updating our fiscal '15 free cash flow outlook to be approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

We've got a dedicated team focusing on the separation, and the rest of the company is focused on delivering for customers. And I feel very good about that. And also, the feedback from partners and customers has been terrific. So lots and lots of work ahead, but I feel good about where we are. It has surfaced lots of opportunities for continued cost savings and the ability to operate more efficiently. And when you tear apart a company that's been built up over many years through acquisition, through different systems being merged together, it's remarkable what you find. And whether it is single owners or end-to-end cost structure, the ability to benchmark versus our competitors on how many spans and layers we have, the ability to make small changes in the portfolio that we want to go forward with, lots and lots of opportunities that's going to make us much stronger as we go forward as 2 independent companies. So we're pretty excited about it.

So I think we showed up with the best team, with the best technical solution and a competitive price. As you know, this is a long sales cycle business. I think we first engaged with Deutsche Bank over 18 months ago, maybe even closer to 2 years. So these are long-standing deals. But we're very excited because everyone in the industry wanted this business. It was a hallmark or a lighthouse account and we did it is not my terms. So we feel pretty good about it. I would say Helion was a big part of the differentiated solution. I think our ability to provide global support on an unprecedented scale was an important part of the win and our ability to advise and transform.

So for example, in servers, we have high-performance compute, and we have terrific data center switches and wired and wireless LAN products. But we also have benefited by having a hyperscale offering through our joint venture with Foxconn in the server business, which led to the thesis we should have a white box strategy for our Networking business because there's a lot of people for whom that is the solution that they prefer and better for us to offer it and surround with other HP product and services than walk away from that market segment entirely. We're very clear that we only play in businesses in which we can grow profitably. We have no interest in losing money in any business. And we believe in this new opportunity that we announced that we will make money there.

So this notion of where to play, what countries, what market segments, what products and where not to play because we can't do it profitably has been a very good discipline. And actually Dion Weisler has led the way in Printing and Personal Systems. And then once you determine where you're going to play, how to win. And that is through a combination of where you're going to excel versus competitors. And it's actually been of a really good common framework that we can apply across HP. It's easily understandable and actually forces the tough trade-offs.

So in order for us to maintain competitiveness, we need to invest some of these savings and we'll do that really in 3 ways. Firstly, we'll be more aggressive in placing more units with a keen focus on placing high-value units that will drive future supplies growth. Secondly, we'll continue to expand our print sales specialist team to continue to drive growth in our managed print services business. And then finally, we'll invest in new technologies like PageWide array that fuels everything from the Officejet Pro X all the way through being the underpinning and underlying technology behind Multi Jet Fusion, which is, of course, the engine behind our 3D printers.

Great. Well, thank you very much. I think we're out of time. Thank you very much for joining us. I think we feel very strongly that the turnaround is on track. There's progress. You can see it in terms of margin expansion across all the major lines of business. You can see it in growth in areas of the company that I think people were not sure we would turn around like Industry Standard Servers and PCs. So lots of progress, lots more work to do. And obviously, the macroeconomic environment, largely currency, is a headwind that disproportionately affects HP. But overall, we feel really good about the operational execution of the company.

With the first quarter of fiscal 2015 now behind us, I would say that, overall, we're on track with our turnaround and executing well on our separation. In Q1, we delivered solid performance in our business operations. We achieved non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.92, which was at the high end of our outlook range.
We continue to improve profitability, growing operating profit margins across all our major business segments. We increased investment in innovation to drive the future of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., and we executed well across key areas of our portfolio, including Industry Standard Servers, Converged Storage, private and managed Cloud, Personal Systems and Graphics. While we have more work to do to improve performance in other parts of the business, we're about where we expected to be at this point in our turnaround journey.
Now there a couple of factors that had an impact on our first quarter financial results and how we think about the rest of the year, and I want to address these. Let me talk for a moment about the global environment with a particular focus on unfavorable currency movements, and I also want to address cash flow. We're all aware that the global environment and currency movements have been a challenge for U.S.-based companies. For HP, the challenge is particularly acute, with 65% of our revenue coming from outside the United States and over half of that from EMEA. This all impacts HP in multiple ways. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue. Our revenue declined approximately 5% year-over-year as reported but only 2% in constant currency. In addition, the recent currency movements have disrupted the competitive pricing landscape and impacted customer demand. Aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the Printing business, given the weakness of the yen, was a continued challenge.
We were able to manage these impacts in the quarter and deliver earnings as expected, but given the specific hedges we had in place and the significant currency movement that took place in January, we anticipate the impact on the remainder of FY '15 will be greater than what we saw in Q1. We're working hard to offset these impacts through repricing and productivity, but let me be very clear. Fully mitigating currency movements of this size would require reducing investments in areas like innovation, key systems and tools and placement of printer units. That simply would not be the right thing to do.
When we discussed the impact of currency on revenue in November, we estimated our headwind for fiscal 2015 to be approximately 2 points year-over-year. We now expect that headwind to be approximately 6 points assuming today's rates. That difference equates to approximately $3.3 billion in revenue, $1.5 billion in operating profit or $0.60 in earnings per share. We believe will be able to manage half of that through repricing and cost actions, but estimate a negative earnings impact of approximately $0.30 per share entirely due to currency. While we have taken down our full year earnings outlook, we remain on track to deliver flat revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Cathie will share more details on how we manage currency movements across the portfolio.
Now turning to cash flow. Q1 results were below our expectations, impacted primarily by an increase in our cash conversion cycle and by timing issues. The cash conversion cycle was higher than expected as a result of higher days sales outstanding. Also, we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than we expected and outperformed on HP Financial Services volume, which negatively impact cash year-on-year. However, except for the currency impact and separation payments, we would have expected cash flow for the full year to be in line with our original outlook of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. Cathie will have more to say about this in a moment.
Now let's talk about business performance and innovation. And as I said at the beginning of the call, we continue to make progress in our operating performance. In Personal Systems, the team is executing well. We outgrew the market and gained share across all regions. We saw particular strength in notebooks, where we regained our #1 share position worldwide. Commercial remains a key focus for us. And at Discover in December, we announced the industry's thinnest and lightest business-class notebook, enabling our customers to be more productive in more places. 
In Printing, profitability remained strong, but we continue to face top line challenges. Hardware and supplies revenue declined. And going forward, we are going to be more aggressive in placing units to support long-term supplies growth. I'm looking forward to some of the exciting new products Dion and his team are planning to launch in the coming months.
The Enterprise Group performed well with 9% growth in constant currency in Industry Standard Servers, led by strong Gen9 adoption and improved sales execution. HP's end-to-end compute strategy led by the Gen9 portfolio has redefined the broader server industry, and improvements in sales execution are paying off. We also saw improved performance in Business Critical Systems, and our new products are gaining traction with customers. During the quarter, we expanded our server portfolio with HP Integrity Superdome X and HP Integrity NonStop X. These platforms run our customers' most demanding, mission-critical workloads on x86 architectures with higher levels of performance, scalability, availability and efficiency.
In Storage, we returned to growth in constant currency, and we anticipate a fourth quarter of external disk market share expansion based on calendar Q4 results. We continue to see an industry shift to the midrange, which is our sweet spot. And at Discover, we announced a refreshed portfolio of midrange and flash-optimized HP 3PAR StoreServ systems. And it's becoming clear around the industry that our HP Converged Storage portfolio is the best in the market. Just this month, HP 3PAR won the 2014 Search Storage Product of the Year gold award.
However, in Networking, results were disappointing after many quarters of growth. We had execution issues in the U.S. and in China, which we are working to address. We made leadership changes in China in the quarter, which we believe will strengthen our ability to compete effectively in what remains a tough market. And in the U.S., we are realigning sales incentives to increase focus. We continue to bring new Networking solutions to market. Just last week, we announced a new line of open network switches, providing web-scale customers choice, agility and scalability in their data center networks. We are focused on winning in this business, and you will continue to see us make aggressive moves over the coming quarters.
Technology Services was consistent with recent quarters with strong and predictable profitability. The team continued to execute well, improving efficiency across the organization while driving order growth in constant currency. We were pleased with the continued momentum in newer portfolio offerings like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care.
In Cloud, our HP Helion portfolio continues to gain traction worldwide, capturing market share in open hybrid cloud. During the quarter, we announced HP Helion wins with Alcatel-Lucent, Halfords, Telecom Italia and Symantec, and we've seen strong pull-through of HP products and services by new customers of HP Helion. Last month, HP Helion was recognized as a leader by Forrester Research in their inaugural Forrester Wave for private cloud in China, earning the highest ranking for strategy. And early in the quarter, IDC recognized HP as a leader in U.S. government private cloud.
In Enterprise Services, revenue continued to be impacted by key account runoff, softness in EMEA and currency headwinds. However, profitability improved year-over-year, in line with our expectations. And sales metrics are reflecting the go-to-market transformation underway in this business. Among recent new logo wins, HP Enterprise Services was selected by TNT, one of the world's largest express delivery companies, to help future-proof the business by consolidating and virtualizing its IT infrastructure and moving some functions to an HP Helion-managed virtual private cloud environment. And just today, we announced a major multibillion-dollar customer win with Deutsche Bank. With this partnership, HP will help Deutsche Bank meet its long-term business objectives through a transformation of its IT infrastructure, including a customized HP Helion solution that will enable them to focus on creating and delivering new services for their clients. This was a hard-fought win for HP, and I'm very pleased with the outcome.
In Software, we continue to shift our portfolio and operating model to SaaS and subscription-based offerings. Customer consumption behavior and the need to adjust sales motions accordingly created a near-term revenue headwind. Total revenue was down. However, we saw growth in security, and our recent acquisition of Voltage Security strengthens our portfolio in data encryption. During the quarter, we also unveiled HP HAVEn OnDemand, an important milestone in our Big Data strategy that gives organizations cloud-based access to key components of our HAVEn analytics platform. 
Overall, we continue to see strength across many of our businesses while other areas still need more work. Operationally, we get stronger with each passing month. And just as important, our innovation engine continues to hum, and I expect that the pace of innovation will accelerate through the rest of the year.
With that, let me turn it over to Cathie to provide a deeper look at the financial performance and our outlook."

Overall, we delivered revenue of $26.8 billion, down 5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. Despite currency headwinds and even as we continued to increase our R&D investments, we improved profitability year-over-year. Gross margin was 23.4%, up 0.6 points year-over-year. And quarter-over-quarter gross margin was down 1.2 points, in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.8%, up 0.3 points year-over-year.  
We are nearing the completion of our 2012 restructuring plan. In Q1, about 2,800 people exited the company, making the total reduction to date approximately 44,000. We are on track to complete this existing program with a total of 55,000 people expected to exit by the end of fiscal '15. However, we do anticipate incremental opportunities for operational improvements identified through the separation process. 
Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.92 primarily excludes pretax charges of $222 million for amortization of intangible assets, $146 million for restructuring and $80 million associated with the separation. Including these charges, GAAP diluted net earnings per share for Q1 was $0.73, in line with our previously provided outlook of $0.72 to $0.76 per share.
Turning to the business performance. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 3% in constant currency or flat as reported. We outgrew the market and gained share across all regions while increasing profitability year-over-year to 3.7%. We saw particular strength in notebooks and continued to rollout exciting products. While commercial revenue was up only 1% in constant currency following the XP migration, we saw an increase in consumer momentum with 4% revenue growth in constant currency.
In Printing, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency or 5% as reported, with some challenges in both hardware and supplies and particular weakness in Russia. Profitability remains strong at 19.2%. Declines in low-end home and single-function mono laser hardware units drove overall units down 4% year-over-year. While it will take some time to turn the corner, we continue to make progress in our strategy of improving the quality of our installed base. Our unit mix improved with solid growth in key high-usage products like Officejet Pro X and value multifunction printers. 
Graphics performance remains strong with our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The increase in scale has contributed to a year-over-year increase in operating profit. Also, in Managed Print Services, we saw double-digit total contract value growth year-over-year. Although we still saw declines in overall supplies revenue, we continue to improve the revenue trajectory in ink while managing ink and toner channel inventory within desired ranges. Overall, supplies revenue mix was 65% of total print revenue. 
The Enterprise Group performed well with revenue up 3% in constant currency or flat as reported, with strong profitability of 15.6%. ISS revenue grew 9% in constant currency or 7% as reported, with growth across all regions and strength in core rack and blades categories. We also saw some recovery in Business Critical Systems with revenue down only 7% in constant currency or 9% as reported.
In Storage, performance improved in Q1, with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency or flat as reported. Converged Storage was up 21%, now making up 50% of total Storage revenue. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 12% year-over-year. All-flash 3PAR revenue accelerated, now making up 20% of total 3PAR midrange portfolio. Also, we expect to be the only scaled vendor to gain external disk share year-over-year for the last 4 quarters.
In Networking, revenue was down 9% year-over-year in constant currency or down 11% as reported. However, we continue to see positive momentum in our data center switching business, which grew for the fifth consecutive quarter. And while we had execution issues in the U.S. and China, we delivered solid revenue growth in the rest of the world.
Technology Services revenue was down 2% year-over-year in constant currency or down 5% as reported. Orders grew in constant currency, driven by support in EMEA and strong renewals.
Enterprise Services revenue was down 8% year-over-year in constant currency or down 11% as reported. Application and business services and IT outsourcing were each down 11%, as key account runoff and weaknesses in EMEA offset the momentum we're seeing in strategic Enterprise Services or services for the New Style of IT. Profitability improved year-over-year to 3%, up 1.9 points, driven primarily by productivity actions and improved margins in underperforming accounts. Also, the sales team increased efficiency with improved win rates and reduced field selling costs. Total contract value was up with double-digit growth in renewals, in new logos and in SCS signings, with particular strength in key areas including Cloud and Big Data.
Software revenue was down 3% year-over-year in constant currency or down 5% as reported as we faced execution challenges and headwinds from our shift to SaaS. Profitability was 18%, up 2.2 points year-over-year, as we effectively managed costs while increasing R&D investment in strategic areas such as Big Data and security.
Finally, in HP Financial Services, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency or down 8% as reported due to an early contract termination in the prior year period, making for a tough compare for revenue and operating profit. However, we experienced double-digit new volume growth and record-high attach rate to HP's products and services. ROE was just over 17%, and HP Financial Services continues to be a key differentiator for HP.
Before we get to the outlook, I want to spend a bit more time helping you understand how currency impacts our business. With 2/3 of our revenue coming from outside of the U.S., the impact from currency movements is significant. As Meg said, we have taken down our full year non-GAAP earnings outlook and this is entirely due to the currency challenges she described. We continue to offset currency movements as much as possible through hedging strategies. We have rolling hedging programs, which is designed to minimize the volatility of results by dampening large fluctuations. However, significant and sustained currency moves cannot be managed by hedges alone. We also use repricing as a lever when possible, considering competitive market dynamics. The hedging programs vary by business depending upon these factors.
As an example, Personal Systems and our EG hardware businesses have very little in natural hedges as our component contracts are typically in U.S. dollars. As a result, these businesses are disproportionately impacted by currency movements. However, we do have some ability to increase pricing in response to currency movements while being mindful of competition and potential negative impacts to customer demand.
In Printing, we have a lot of moving parts, with currency impacting our business both directly and indirectly. Like the other segments, the Printing business is negatively impacted by the strength of the dollar on the top and bottom line. The weaker yen helps the cost side of our business, but it also allows our Japanese competitors to price much more aggressively. In addition, Printing, specifically the laser business, is overweight in Russia, which adds yet another dimension to currency impact.
Services have more natural hedges since revenue and expenses are more closely matched in the same currency, but due to the nature of the contracts, repricing in response to currency movements is less of a lever. Across all of our businesses, we will continue to manage the currency challenge while also making the right trade-offs to support our strategy for long-term success.
We discussed the currency impacts to the P&L, but now let me talk about the balance sheet. As we discussed last quarter, we hedge our balance sheet based on anticipated net monetary assets and liabilities. Any hedge gains or losses are reported within the other assets and liabilities section and not the specific cash flow line item. Across the specific line items in Q1, we saw the largest impact from currency on working capital and financing receivables. The change to our cash conversion cycle would suggest a working capital headwind year-over-year of approximately $750 million. But the actual headwind is approximately $1.1 billion when including the hedge gain that is reported in other assets and liabilities. Similarly, the cash headwind from reported financing receivables appears in the statement of cash flows to be approximately $100 million but is actually closer to $250 million when including this adjustment. The offset means that the headwind of approximately $1.3 billion in other assets and liabilities is actually a lower headwind of about $800 million. Making this distinction is important so we can focus on the true drivers of cash flow.
Next, I want to discuss cash flow and capital allocation. In Q1, cash flow from operations was $744 million and free cash flow was negative $73 million. We had several factors impacting our operating and free cash flow in Q1. Remember, Q1 is typically the lowest cash flow quarter for HP, and we did expect this to be true again in fiscal '15. Having said that, the cash flow results were down year-over-year and somewhat below our expectations, and I want to take a minute to explain.
First, we had a working capital impact. The cash conversion cycle increased sequentially in Q1 '15 but declined sequentially in Q1 '14, which created a headwind of about $1.1 billion net of hedging. While we anticipated a lot of this, days sales outstanding was higher than expected, largely due to nonrecurring operational issues in the quarter, intra-month linearity in January and other smaller factors. Some of these smaller factors may continue and are captured in our outlook. 
We still expect the cash conversion cycle to be 10 to 12 days by year-end as we continue to make the right trade-offs between the use of cash and P&L optimization. As an example, we may decide to ship finished goods by boat versus by plane, which increases inventory but reduces cost of sales. Similarly, taking advantage of early pay discounts from suppliers reduces cost but decreases accounts payable. We do a full cost-benefit analysis to make sure these decisions drive economic value.
Next, we had a tough compare. Q1 '14 included proceeds from a large real estate sale, which drove an increase in net CapEx year-over-year in Q1 '15. 
Finally, there were several other unfavorable movements in Q1 '15. We had double-digit capital lease volume growth, which obviously is great for our business, but this was a greater use of cash of this year than last. We also ended the quarter with higher receivables from vendor rebates and contract manufacturers as well as lower litigation reserves. And we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than expected. I want to reemphasize that while Q1 cash flow was down year-over-year, we remain confident in our ability to generate cash as we've demonstrated over many quarters. We are providing an updated outlook today to our free cash flow, but the reduction from our $6.5 billion to $7 billion outlook last quarter is only due to currency and separation impacts we've announced today.
Turning to capital allocation. In Q1, we repurchased 41.1 million shares and paid $304 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $1.9 billion. This makes up for the $750 million shortfall from our fiscal 2014 commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Turning to the separation. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we will incur incremental separation costs and foreign tax expenses in both fiscal 2015 and 2016 associated with separating into 2 companies. The scale of this separation is unprecedented in its size and complexity. Over the past few months, we defined and quantified the expected charges related to the separation. These charges include finance, IT, consulting and legal fees, real estate and other items that are incremental and onetime in nature and not reflective of our operational performance. In addition, we've estimated our incremental foreign tax expenses related to the separation of foreign legal entities. The charges and taxes associated with this separation are excluded from our non-GAAP earnings.
The Q1 GAAP charge associated with the separation was $80 million, and we expect the Q2 GAAP charge to be approximately $250 million. Full year fiscal '15 charges are expected to be $1.3 billion and the FY '16 estimate is $500 million. While these are large numbers, they represent less than 2% of our annual operating costs and are necessary to realize the potential of the separation into 2 world-class companies.
Separation-related capital spend this year is expected to be approximately $300 million. The incremental gross foreign tax expenses are estimated to be about $950 million in fiscal 2015. We do expect more than half of the tax expenses to be offset by foreign tax credits. In fiscal '15, we anticipate a credit of about $200 million and the rest over the next few years. We will continue to provide updates on our separation on our quarterly calls.
Turning to the outlook for Q2 and the remainder of fiscal 2015. From a macro perspective, we've already talked about the impact associated with currency shifts. Additionally, we see continued challenges across certain geographies, including China, where we anticipate increasing competitiveness from local vendors; and Russia, where political and economic concerns are ongoing. These challenges are being offset to some degree by strengthening of the U.S. economy.
By business. In Personal Systems, while the PC market is expected to continue to contract, we plan to leverage our brand, channel, scale and strong product lineup to continue to gain share profitably. We will take advantage of the momentum in consumer and continue our strategic focus on commercial, including commercial mobility.
In Printing, we're planning to be more aggressive in placing hardware units with continued focus on high-value units. We will manage supplies channel inventory closely while driving further stability in supplies revenue in fiscal '15.
In Enterprise Group, we expect server momentum to continue with the Gen9 lineup and server refresh cycle. We expect Storage, particularly 3PAR, to outperform key competitors, especially in the midrange.
In Networking, we expect continued challenges in the near term but are making adjustments to improve execution.
In Enterprise Services, we expect continued improvement in profitability, making progress towards our long-term goal of 7% to 9% operating profit, and remain confident in our full year operating margin outlook of 4% to 6%. Given the current revenue trajectory and the expectation that currency will continue to be a headwind, we are providing a new Enterprise Services full year revenue outlook. Because of the currency volatility, going forward, we will provide this on a constant currency basis. We now expect full year revenue to decline 4% to 6%. We expect year-over-year revenue performance improvement in the second half of fiscal '15.
In Software, we plan to continue to shift our go-to-market focus and further align our product portfolio to best capture the growing SaaS opportunity. We also have much more work to do to drive consistent sales execution across the organization.
Overall for fiscal '15, we remain optimistic about the market opportunity and our competitive positioning. However, the currency headwind at current rates cannot be fully absorbed. We've done detailed modeling using current exchange rates and assumptions for repricing and productivity. With all that in mind, we're updating fiscal '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook to be $3.53 to $3.73, which is lower by $0.30 due to currency headwinds. Fiscal '15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $2.03 to $2.23. Q2 fiscal '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is expected to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88, which includes $0.09 of currency pressure. Q2 fiscal '15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.57 to $0.61. Given the updated earnings outlook for currency and the introduction of cash-related separation activities, we are updating our fiscal '15 free cash flow outlook to be approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And I think actually that we are executing on all cylinders. There has not been distraction to the core business. We've got a dedicated team focusing on the separation, and the rest of the company is focused on delivering for customers. And I feel very good about that. And also, the feedback from partners and customers has been terrific. So lots and lots of work ahead, but I feel good about where we are. It has surfaced lots of opportunities for continued cost savings and the ability to operate more efficiently. And when you tear apart a company that's been built up over many years through acquisition, through different systems being merged together, it's remarkable what you find. And whether it is single owners for end-to-end cost structure, the ability to benchmark versus our competitors on how many spans and layers we have, the ability to make small changes in the portfolio that we want to go forward with, lots and lots of opportunities that's going to make us much stronger as we go forward as 2 independent companies. So we're pretty excited about it. It is a huge amount of work, but I have to say it's exhilarating because we see the future, where these 2 companies will be far more cost competitive than even we are today as HPQ."

So I think we showed up with the best team, with the best technical solution and a competitive price. As you know, this is a long sales cycle business. I think we first engaged with Deutsche Bank over 18 months ago, maybe even closer to 2 years. So these are long-standing deals. But we're very excited because everyone in the industry wanted this business. It was a hallmark or a lighthouse account, and we did it on our terms. So we feel pretty good about it. I would say Helion was a big part of the differentiated solution. I think our ability to provide global support on an unprecedented scale was an important part of the win, and our ability to advise and transform. The key risk in these deals is how do you get from where you are to where you need to be, and I think we were judged to be the safest pair of hands."

You're right, we had 2 execution challenges, one in China and one in the U.S. And I think we touched on those. The strategy here is exactly the same strategy in many ways that we've deployed with servers, which is a market segmentation strategy, what kind of customers want to buy what kind of gear, and then we need to have that for them. So for example, in servers, we have high-performance compute, and we have terrific data center switches and wired and wireless LAN products. But we also have benefited by having a hyperscale offering through our joint venture with Foxconn in the server business, which led to the thesis we should have a white box strategy for our Networking business because there's a lot of people for whom that is the solution that they prefer. And better for us to offer it and surround with other HP product and services than walk away from that market segment entirely. We're very clear that we only play in businesses in which we can grow profitably. We have no interest in losing money in any business. And we believe in this new opportunity that we announced that we will make money there. So it is a market segmentation-based strategy where we have to have the right product with the right services attached that allows us to make money and gain share.

And then finally, we'll invest in new technologies like PageWide array that fuels everything from the Officejet Pro X all the way through being the underpinning and underlying technology behind Multi Jet Fusion, which is, of course, the engine behind our 3D printers. So of course, we'll continue to strike the right balance between growth and profitability, but we believe 19% operating profit is not good for business long term."

So we do expect that some of that benefit kind of moves away from us. The other thing, this is the only segment in Q1 where, overall, on a direct basis, they had a positive impact from currency. So again, IPG is a little different than other businesses. It's got the same top line and bottom line pressures from the strength of the dollar. It does have a benefit from the weakness of the yen, and then it does have to deal with Russia. But in Q1, the net currency impact was actually positive. We don't expect that, that continues in the rest of the year as the yen benefit basically moves away from us. And over time, we also hedge longer term, especially in the supplies area in IPG, and those hedges start to roll off as well."

So look, I think in general, we're pretty aligned with the industry projections of the Personal Systems market, which suggests sort of low single-digit growth. We believe that PC units will be in small decline, but there are pockets of growth across the segments -- in some segments, including mobility, accessories and services. We've seen and expected the slowdown in the commercial segment following the XP refresh that fueled high-growth last year. However, we've seen, to counterbalance that, momentum in the consumer side of the business as consumers refresh their older PCs. So looking forward, the market remains competitive. We believe we can continue to gain share in the areas where we choose to play as the market consolidates. Specifically, we're sort of focused on profitable growth in 3 areas. Firstly, we're investing in key growth areas of convertibles, commercial mobility, accessories and services, where the heat is in the market. Secondly, we remain focused on extending our leadership in the commercial enterprise and SMB segments, including education.

It's really just beginning. We do expect that, that will ramp as we go through fiscal '15, but it was not a major factor at all in the performance that we delivered in Industry Standard Servers this quarter.

So the biggest headwind to free cash flow this year over last year is the cash conversion cycle, basically going to back to 10 to 12 days.

That's what is driving the 10 to 12 days. But once we get to that 10 to 12 days, they year on year compare for '16 and that headwind is significantly reduced. So that's one of the big kind of tailwinds to cash flow. You're absolutely right, the separation costs are going to come down. So -- and the separation cost is anticipated to be $1.3 billion in fiscal '15 and about $500 million in fiscal '16. We don't think there's separation CapEx. The foreign taxes will turn to credits. I don't know how much were going to get in credits in fiscal '16, but certainly, you don't have the headwind of basically $750 million.

With the first half of fiscal 2015 now behind us, I'm pleased to report that once again, we delivered the results we said we would. We executed well in a tough market environment, and in Q2, we delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.87, at the high end of our previously provided outlook range. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion. Free cash flow was approximately $800 million. And we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
In the quarter, we executed well across Industry Standard Servers, Converged Storage, Personal Systems and graphics and Enterprise Services improved profitability. We continued to invest in innovation across the company and improved our go-to-market approach. 
At the same time, we faced significant market challenges due to currency movements, softness in PCs, home printing and IT outsourcing markets and execution challenges and pockets of the business that require more work. But overall, I'm pleased with our progress and the turnaround.
Turning to the separation. As you will recall, last October, we announced our plan to separate HP into 2 independent Fortune 50 companies. Today, I'm more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do. Over the past 6 months, we've seen the markets continue to shift and evolve at a rapid pace. In Hewlett Packard Enterprise, our customers are demanding services and solutions that will help them manage traditional IT better while planning the journey to a hybrid infrastructure. And we need to move faster and smarter to meet that demand. At HP Inc., we will contain engineering devices and immersive computing experiences for business and consumer and ink- and laser-based solutions that provide a faster, more affordable exciting way to print, manage and deliver content, all while continuing to invest in strategic areas like 3D printing. The separation will enable us to do that.
Since October, we've made substantial progress across a number of areas that gives me confidence that we'll complete the separation by the end of our fiscal year. We've completed the leadership and organizational structures for each company and largely completed our course assignments. We've made progress in recruiting new board members for each company. We've evaluated how we can best meet customer needs, and as a result, have planned a new, optimized, partner-driven go-to-market approach in over 50 global markets.  Our real estate teams have made decisions about our sites around the world, and we've performed thousands of hours of IT system testing ahead of the separation.  We've also announced a new brand that reference the future for Hewlett, all of that while continuing to deliver on our commitments in terms of FY '15 business performance.
As I've said before, one benefit of our separation is that the discipline process of reviewing every aspect of the new companies is uncovering opportunities to take costs out and improve the way we do business. Even at this early stage, each organization is optimizing for the realities of their markets and unique competitive sets.  As we dive deep into the planned organizations, we've identified both dis-synergies required to run separate companies as well as opportunities to streamline our processes and ultimately improve both cost structures. Cathie will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we estimate that the total dis-synergies associated with the separation will be approximately $400 million to $450 million annually divided about equally between the 2 companies. And we believe we can offset more than half of these dis-synergy costs in fiscal year 2016 and more than fully offset these costs by fiscal year 2017. 
As separate companies, we'll have sharper focus on the markets we serve, the ability to adapt and shift more quickly and a tighter linkage between rewards and results, and I can already see this beginning to take hold across HP. There's a greater feeling of accountability, and I'm seeing strong execution and more disciplined cost management. 
We're also continuing to make smart moves to set Hewlett and HP Inc. up for success. Over the first half of this year, we've done a number of smaller transactions, including the acquisition of Voltage, a data security provider the complements our existing information security and encryption business. And we've announced divestiture of Snapfish, the online photo sharing platform. Just this week, we closed on the acquisition of Aruba, and I'm really excited about combining our networking portfolio and broad channel with Aruba's highly complementary solutions and specialized sales team. The teams have already hit the ground running with the cross-selling opportunities.
And just this morning, we announced a groundbreaking partnership that will bring together HP's Chinese enterprise technology assets and China's prestigious University to create the leading Chinese provider of IT infrastructure.  Under the agreement, will purchase a 51% stake in a new business called comprising our HPC technologies business and HP's China-based server storage and technology services businesses for approximately 2.3 billion. This values the overall new HBC business at about 4.5 billion. The combined company will build on HBC's extensive and valuable patent portfolio, best-in-class product and customer focus and world-class research capability.  In one move, we have repositioned HP and shifted the entire technology landscape on the critical Chinese market to accelerate our overall performance and better serve our customers and partners.
Turning to innovation. We continue to drive the product road maps for both Hewlett and HP Inc. We recently announced new and enhanced purpose-built compute platforms and solutions including our Apollo family of servers, which support imaging applications and including of content storage, block and file storage, unstructured and real-time analytics as well as simple and transactional databases. These platforms are specifically designed to help customers leverage their data to drive business outcomes like faster decision-making, improved operational efficiency and direct content monetization.
Network function virtualization, or NFV, IS market poised to transform the telecom industry, and we have a strong position in this emerging market. Just over a year ago, we introduced the HP open and that the program programming, providing telcos resources to test proof of concepts. Recently, Telefonica, one of the world's largest telcos, selected HP as a technology provider systems integrated to virtualize its global infrastructure. can expect to see more as we advance in this space.
In Enterprise Services, we announced a partnership with FireEye, one of the leading security software companies. The partnership makes incidents response, compromise assessment and threat reduction offerings available to HP's Enterprise Services more strategic clients globally. This agreement helps HP protect our customers' critical information assets from advanced cyber attacks and supports our strategy to be a world-class provider of security services.
And in Software, we have announced several new security software offerings. We also unveiled new software releases designed to help organizations deliver mobile applications that accelerate the delivery of every phase of the mobile app life-cycle from creation and to production to delivery and postproduction management.
In printing, we announced a new series of laser jet printers designed to make businesses more efficient. Built around the latest in our toner formulation, they use less energy, take up to 40% less space and wake up, print and duplex in a fraction of a time. This announcement represented HP's most significant laser printing reengineering since the introduction of the first LaserJet in 1984. 
Finally, in Personal Systems, HP announced a new Spector 60 in Mobile World Congress in earlier this year. This 13.3-inch convertible PC delivers a high-quality ultra-thin design that provides the productivity of the high-end mobile, tablet mode for on the go, mode for play and stand mode for watching entertainment. This product earned more than 9 awards at the Mobile World Congress and continues to be recognized as one of the top products in the market.
Turning to our execution. We have made significant progress across a lot of fronts over the past 6 months, and importantly, we've seen no distraction from running business. In fact, the go-to-market approach of this company has drastically improved over the past 3 years, and I see that getting stronger going forward. 
Industry Standard Servers had a very strong quarter, growing 17% in constant currency with growth across all regions, driven by strong adoption of our portfolio and strength and density optimized in the support of the explosion of Big Data in the market.
In Enterprise Services, while the top line remains under pressure, the team improved profitability towards the FY '15 outlook of 4% to 6%.  Signings were up year-over-year even without the Deutsche Bank deal that we closed at the beginning of the quarter, and strategic Enterprise Services TCV was strong.
Personal Systems once again outgrew the overall market and all competitors, gaining share in every region. We saw particular strength in notebooks supported by key products, including our new Elite Book and Spector 360 I mentioned earlier.
In printing, currency is a challenge, but we gained 1 point of share in laser year-over-year and saw good growth in value multi-function printers. We also saw significant momentum in managed print services, with year-over-year growth in total contract value led by strong new logo signings.
So overall, our performance in Q2 was in line with our expectations, but we continue to face some significant headwind that impacted our results in the first half and may continue through the rest of the year. Unfavorable currency movements continued to be a challenge in the quarter. With over 65% of our revenue coming from outside the United States and over half of that in EMEA, we are disproportionately impacted by currency movements versus our competitors. And remember that currency impacts HP in multiple ways. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue. For example, our second quarter revenue declined approximately 7% year-over-year as reported, but only 2% in constant currency. In addition, the recent currency movements have enabled our competitors to price very aggressively. For example, aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the printing business, given the weakness of the yen, continues to be a challenge.  Finally, the currency movements and associated repricing impacted demand. We managed to offset the currency impact to company-level operating profit in Q2 through hedges and repricing.
We also saw geopolitical challenges in certain markets, including Russia and China as well as softer public sector spending in the U.K.  The PC market is also weaker than I expected at the beginning of the year, but Dion and his team are doing a good job managing through and gaining profitable share.
Finally, we continue to face execution issues in pockets of the portfolio, including Software and Networking. In Software, Q2 revenue was disappointing, primarily on license weakness. But Robert and his team are making progress on realigning the portfolio and go-to-market towards SaaS as well as partnering more closely with Enterprise Services and Enterprise Group to pull through software sales in all parts of the business.
And Networking, we made progress in our Americas go-to-market in the quarter. And as you can see, made some transformative moves with the Aruba acquisition and the partnership with China.
So to recap, while we have some challenges, I'm pleased with where we ended the quarter on the continued success of our turnaround and the progress we're making on separation. Our customers and partners continue to support our efforts, as do our employees. I couldn't be more proud of how well the entire company is working to deliver on our commitments for the year. Slowly but surely, HP is tackling its challenges and becoming stronger. It's an exhilarating time to be part of HP, and we remain on course.
Before I turn it over to Cathie, I wanted to provide an important update on the future leadership teams of the 2 companies after separation.  As you recall, on October 6, we announced that Cathie will become CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. We also said that Dion was commencing a search for the CFO of HP Inc. After looking at a number of of candidates in past few months, Dion, Cathy and I have decided that a better solution is for Cathie to take her experience over to HP Inc. So today, we've announced that Cathie will become CFO of HP Inc. after separation. This is a great outcome for Dion and his business. Cathie is a experienced public company CFO. She knows Dion's business , and she can help Dion manage business straight out of the box. 
Part of the reasons we can make this movie is that Cathie has done a great job bringing up the next generation of leaders in HP finance. We've got a deep bench to choose from, and as a result, we've asked Tim Stonesifer to become CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Tim is currently the CFO of HP's enterprise group and has done a fabulous job in that role. Prior to joining HP, Tim served as CFO of international operations at General Motors . Previously, Tim held a number of finance leadership positions during his 20-year tenure at General Electric.
I've worked closely with Tim already, and I can tell you that he's a talented and experienced leader. Both Cathie and I think he's the perfect choice to be CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. But I have to say I'm going to miss working day today with Cathie. Our close partnership during the past 4 years has been incredibly productive and a lot of fun. But as the future Chairman of HP Inc., it gives me great comfort to know that Dion will have Cathie by his side and I will still get to work with her.  And as CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I know I'm getting a fantastic CFO in Tim. This works out well all around. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Cathie to it into a bit more deep business detail and to provide our Q3 financial outlook."

Overall, we had a solid quarter, despite a challenging market environment. We delivered revenue of $25.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported or 2% in constant currency.

We delivered revenue of $25.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported or 2% in constant currency. 
Our gross margin was 24%, down 0.2 points year-over-year, driven by competitive pricing in hardware, partially offset by margin improvement in Enterprise Services and Software and favorable mix.  Gross margin was up 0.6 points sequentially, in line with normal seasonality. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by currency with reported declines in both SG&A and R&D. In constant currency though, R&D spend was actually up year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating profit was flat year-over-year at 8.6%.
Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.87 primarily excludes pretax charges of $269 million for separation, $255 million for restructuring and $221 million for amortization of intangible assets.
We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.55, just below our previously provided outlook range, primarily due to slightly accelerated restructuring and separation charges.
We are nearing the completion of our 2012 restructuring plan. In Q2, approximately 3,900 people exited the company, making the total reduction to date approximately 48,000. We are on track to complete this existing program with a total of 55,000 people expected to exit by the end of fiscal 2015.
Turning to results by business. Personal Systems performed well in a softening market environment. Currency moves and the associated price adjustments had some demand impact and weighed on profitability in the quarter. Revenue declined 5% year-over-year as reported, or was flat in constant currency, with 2% unit growth.  Profitability declined 0.5 points to 3%, driven primarily by unfavorable currency. 
Consumer revenue declined 2% year-over-year or grew 3% in constant currency, while commercial revenue declined 7% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency.  The commercial market continued to be soft, following momentum in 2014 from the XP refresh cycle. However, we achieved 23.1% market share, a record high. 
Our compelling product line up in both consumer and commercial enabled us once again to outperform our competitors.  Overall, the market slowed during the quarter, with units down 7% in calendar Q1. While we outgrew the market, we had slower sellout at the end of Q2, putting some pressure on Q3 revenue, but we do expect consider momentum from Windows 10 in Q4.
In Printing, the top line was pressured by a highly competitive market and aggressive pricing, which is an indirect impact from currency moves. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year as reported or 5% in constant currency. Like last quarter, a smaller gap between as reported and constant currency relative to the other business segments due to the financial hedges in place. 
We continued to manage profitability well, with operating margin of 18.3%, down 1.2 points year-over-year driven by competitive pricing, partially offset by supply mix, which was 57.6% in the quarter.
We saw strength in key parts of the portfolio, including profitable growth in graphics and high-value hardware categories. We lost 1 point of share in ink, but continued our momentum in office print with unit growth of office jet Proc x. We gained 1 points of share in laser year-over-year and continued to outperform the market in value multi-function printers.
We exited the quarter with supplies channel inventory slightly above our desired range due to slowdown in sales in April. We expect to reduce channel inventory levels in the second half, and we'll continue to closely monitor demand trends.  Our focus remains on stabilizing supplies revenue, and the team will continue placing higher value hardware units with greater supplies attached.
In Enterprise Group, revenue declined 1% year-over-year or grew 5% in constant currency, with solid operating profit of 14.5%, up 0.1 point year-over-year.
Industry Standard Servers momentum continued, delivering 11% year-over-year growth as reported and 17% in constant currency. We continue to see strong option attach and higher ASPs, but strength in density-optimized servers pressured margins. We are well positioned for the second half of the year with a strong backlog, the Windows Server 2003 refresh and overall Gen 9 portfolio momentum.
And in Business Critical Systems, while revenue was down 15% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency, the team delivered growth in operating profit dollars driven by improved gross margin and OpEx management. Superdome X, nonstop X pipelines are growing and driving momentum across the mission-critical x86 portfolio, including Big Data converged solution.
Storage declined 8% year-over-year or 2% at constant currency. While we had solid growth in 3PAR and overall converged storage and expect to gain about 0.3 points of share overall in calendar in Q1, a decline in traditional storage products and weaker-than-expected performance in EMEA drove revenue lower. All-flash 3PAR revenue grew again, and Gartner reported HP was the fastest growing flash vendor in 2014.  In the second half, we expect continued traction in Converged Storage to drive a return to growth overall in constant currency.
Networking had another difficult quarter with revenues declining 15% year-over-year as reported or 11% in constant currency. We make progress on driving stronger sales execution in the U.S. and grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency in EMEA and Asia Pacific excluding China.  China results were disappointing, but overall, we expect Networking performance will improve organically in the second half of the year. And we are optimistic about the future of this business as we onboard the Abuba team and the competitive portfolio of products and solutions. We're excited to have as the head of the new Networking business, and you will begin to see combined financials in the third quarter results.
As Meg discussed, we're also excited about our new partnership with in China. We believe this new structure will around and accelerate performance for HPC, our networking business in China. We expect the deal to close after the separation near the end of 2015, so we won't see an impact to our financials until fiscal 2016. Once it closes, we will account for our ownership using the equity method, with our 49% share of earnings flowing through the other interest and expense line.
Technology Services revenue declined 8% year-over-year as reported or just 2% in constant currency. Orders were down 9% year-over-year as reported, but were up 2% in constant currency, driven by higher hardware volume from Industry Standard Servers and new solutions including data center and Proactive Care. Penetration rates were up year-over-year for Business Critical Systems, Networking and traditional Industry Standard Servers, but the total penetration rate was down on mix. Going forward, we expect to stabilize with improving hardware sales.
In Enterprise Services, we continue to be pressured by key account runoff as well as weakness in EMEA and overall, although the team continues to execute against its profitability outlook this year. Revenue declined 16% year-over-year as reported or 10% in constant currency, while delivering 4% operating profit, up 1.4 points year-over-year. Strategic Enterprise Services signings continued to grow, and application and business services revenue showed marked improvement. Although Q2 revenue was weak, we do expect improvement in the second half and maintain our full year revenue outlook of 4% to 6% year-over-year decline in constant currency. And given the progress on efficiencies and expected quarterly seasonality, we remain confident in our full year operating profit outlook of 4% to 6%.
As we look beyond this fiscal year, we have a path to operating profit of 7% to 9%, but ITO industry challenges have been accelerating, driving risks to the longer-term sustainability of this profit level without further actions. Our current view is that we need to take up to $2 billion of gross annualized costs out of this business over the next 3 years. To effect any level of savings, we would expect to incur GAAP-only charges of up to a similar amount. We'll provide more information as we finalize our plans.
Software had a challenging quarter with weakness across the portfolio. Revenue was down 8% year-over-year as reported or 5% in constant currency. We did delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in SaaS bookings, driven by strong performance in IT management and enterprise security.
The team continues to focus on disciplined cost control, reducing operating expenses year-over-year. However, the accelerated revenue declined pressured profitability. Operating profit was 17.9%, down 1.3 points year-over-year.  In the second half, we expect continued pressure on the top line as we evolve our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings.
HP Financial Services revenue declined 7% year-over-year as reported or was flat in constant currency. Financing volume was down 1% year-over-year as reported, but was up 7% in constant currency with strength in the direct business. Return on equity was 15.1%.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion and free cash flow of $766 million. 
The cash conversion cycle improved to 4 days, down 9 days year-over-year and down 1 day sequentially.  We now expect the cash conversion cycle to be better than the 10 to 12 days forecast previously provided
However, there are a few items creating a cash flow headwind in fiscal 2015.   One  of the main items is related to how we hedge net monetary assets and liabilities where our hedges and underlying currency gains and losses offset one another in the P&L, but the cash flows may not. Our hedges are 30-day hedges, while our underlying exposures range from 14 days to multiple years. With large moves in currencies, this creates a timing difference between when we realize the cash flow from hedges versus the underlying exposures. Some of these timing differences reverse quickly within a quarter or 2, while others are longer term. So while there is an overall headwind in this year's cash flow given the current currency rates, these timing differences will net out over time.
In addition to the hedge cash flow timing differences, we are also seeing cash flow impact for the year from pulling forward some of the restructuring and separation cash payments from 2016, a reduction in warranty given lower PC shipments, and lower deferred revenue in TS due to currency and lower-than-expected orders. Given these headwinds and tailwinds, we are holding our full year free cash flow outlook of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. 
We repurchased 19 million shares in the quarter and paid $291 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $950 million.
Moving to the separation. We continue to make excellent progress and remain on track to meet the time lines of separation by the end of the fiscal year. I want to take some time to provide an update on onetime charges, synergies, cost savings and the Form 10 filing. 
First, Q2 separation charges were $269 million, and we expect Q3 charges to be $464 million. The multiyear estimate of total separation charges, including taxes and associated credits that we announced on the Q1 earnings call, remains unchanged. 
And as Meg shared, we estimate the ongoing dis-synergies associated with operating 2 separate companies to be $400 million to $450 million, which is split between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. These costs are primarily associated with corporate functions, including finance, legal, IT, real estate and HR. 
As expected, working through the creation of 2 new more efficient and accountable organization has uncovered opportunities for significant cost reductions. Our assessment is that we could take up to $1 billion of gross annualized costs out of the organizations in total and would incur a GAAP-only charge of a similar amount.  Although we don't yet have specific details to share, we expect to implement enough cost savings in the near term to offset more than half of the separation dis-synergies in fiscal 2016 and starting in fiscal 2017 with more than offset all the synergies.
We have also concluded the legal form of our separation. Based primarily on tax considerations, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be spin company in the U.S. The legal form may be different across all of the countries in which we do business. 
Finally, we still expect to file our Form 10 later this summer, and we'll continue to provide updates as we approach November 1.
Looking forward, currency may continue to be volatile. And if it is, each of our businesses will be impacted differently based on natural hedges, exiting financial hedges, repricing capabilities and the overall market environment. Based on the current rate, we expect full year revenue to be flat to slightly down in constant currency.
With all of that in mind, our guidance for fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share outlook remains in the range of $3.53 to $3.73. Fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook remains in the range of $2.03 to $2.23.
Q3 '15 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.87. And Q3 15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.54.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

The tailwind that we see is that the cash conversion cycle given the performance that we've had in the first half of the year, is now expected to be better than the 10 to 12 days that we had previously provided as an outlook. And so that offsets the headwinds around the balance sheet hedging that I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well as some of the that we've got around -- from 2016 for restructuring separation costs, and a little bit on the deferred revenue and warranty reserves.  And then in terms of the $400 million to $450 million of dis-synergies in '16 and beyond, yes, those are all cash costs. But as I mentioned, we will take approximately $1 billion of gross run rate savings out of the company across HPE and HPI. So we will offset more than half of those with those cost savings in fiscal 2016, but of course, we will take a GAAP-only charge of about $1 billion."

I'm curious because I get some accretion for the back half with guidance unchanged, so I'm wondering if that implies there's some incremental pressure somewhere offsetting? And then just on the question, I get a lot of questions, as do you I'm sure, free cash flow returning to that $6.5 billion to $7 billion. With the sale of HBC, I assumed you lose around $400 million to $500 million of operating cash. Half goes away, and the other half drops to the investing line on the cash flow statement. You have some that dis-synergies of about $200 million to $225 million in fiscal '16 and then any incremental restructuring charges if you find these cost savings post-split. And then presumably, that's offset by the foreign tax credits that come back. No big separation related costs versus this year and then cash flow from Aruba, but it seems that you be short of that $6.5 billion to $7 billion. So can you just maybe help bridge that difference? Or how should we think about that? Is it M&A that's making it up from a cash proceeds from HPC and Snapfish? Or is there something else to think about there?"

Secondly, in terms of how to think about the cash flow model for fiscal '16, I can't validate of those puts and takes that you've given, but I do -- I will threw out the following for you to think through. First, we think the the cash conversion cycle will be less of a headwind going into '16 than it was going into '15. You do want to take into consideration the fact that the 2012 program restructuring charges will be coming down pretty materially. But of course, we will have the offset to the incremental GAAP-only charges that we talked about today. We will have significantly lower separation kind of impact to cash flow from separation across basically taxes that we need to pay, the incremental costs associated with that and the CapEx. And then I think currency is a little bit of a complicated topic, for sure. But you need to obviously think about what you think the currency is going to do, but also take into consideration the implications to cash of our broad hedging programs, our balance sheet hedging programs, which I talked a little bit about, but also some of the benefits that we're getting from our revenue hedging program.

Also I anticipate both companies will actually be doing acquisitions, but probably more so on the Hewlett Packard Enterprise as that market's growing a bit faster. So we'll lay all of that out for you at the security analysts meeting.

First is I think it's our best ever product line and very, very solid sales execution that is actually playing into a pretty healthy market as well. I mean, as I said, ISS revenue grew 11% year-over-year as reported and 17% in local currency. And we expect to gain share when the Q1 results are out. And I think it's our products like Gen9, which is off to a very fast start. Cloud line and Apollo are resonating well with customers that are purpose-built for a specific workload to deliver business outcomes. So we've got the workload in the business outcome line with the right infrastructure. And then there's another little tailwind, which is the Windows Server 2000 and refresh -- 2003 refresh, the ramp of our Foxconn partnership and improved win rates frankly against Lenovo as they take over the IBM server business. And actually one thing, we haven't talked much about cloud on this call because there was so much to cover here. But we're pretty pleased with the results of our cloud  business. And what you have to remember, it shows up. The success of cloud shows up in 4 places -- in 3 places in the HP P&L. One is Industry Standard Servers because we are, by far, the leader in private Cloud whether it's Gartner or IDC or whoever, so that shows up in ISS. virtual private cloud and manage cloud services shows up in Enterprise Services, and then CSA, the cloud service automation and orchestration software that it all together shows up in Software. So we may, over time, break out or run alongside sort of overall cloud revenues as opposed to just having it show up in the individual businesses. But for the moment, probably to the end of this year, we report in the different businesses. So I thought I just say a word about that's another reason that ISS is strong as private cloud."

And then in terms of the rest of the year for ISS, we've got a really nice wind at our back. We've got -- we're going into the second half with a strong backlog, so a better backlog frankly then we have normally see going into Q3.

First is we are making progress towards the long-term goal of 7% to 9% operating margin. But the ITO industry challenges have accelerated and driving risks in the sustainability of this profit level if we don't to further cost reductions. And I'd say there's a couple of sort of large scale secular trends that are impacting that ITO business. First is the government austerity program have forced the business model transformation both here as well as in Europe. And basically, the public sector business has gone from buying in a fixed fee model to a cost-plus model, so that put some pressure on. And then secondly, there our -- definitely accelerated move to a consumption model, which is going to require us to make a faster labor mix shift to low-cost resources. And frankly, the transformation of the physical data center footprint to much more streamlined footprint that are for more automated. So there is real market shift going on here, and basically, the additional savings plan that we mentioned today would be the rest our plan for to reach that 7% to 9% operating margins, but more importantly, would enable us to sustain that level of profitability over time. So we've got more aggressive labor pyramid shifts that has to take place onshore, offshore locations to make sure that we stay competitive in that market. And the market's changing dramatically. That said, our apps business and our business process outsourcing business and our strategic Enterprise Services businesses are looking healthy year.

In my view is that if we don't have a healthy services business, that will actually compromise our overall business as we go forward because increasingly, services is becoming the tip of the spear and how we go to market, not only to direct customers, but frankly, our partners and are seeing the exact same thing.

With the first half of fiscal 2015 now behind us, I'm pleased to report that, once again, we delivered the results we said we would. We executed well in a tough market environment, and in Q2, we delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.87, at the high end of our previously provided outlook range. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion. Free cash flow was approximately $800 million. And we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
In the quarter, we executed well across Industry Standard Servers, Converged Storage, Personal Systems and graphics, and Enterprise Services improved profitability. We continued to invest in innovation across the company and improve our go-to-market approach.
At the same time, we faced significant market challenges due to currency movements, softness in PCs, home printing and IT outsourcing markets and execution challenges in pockets of the business that require more work. But overall, I'm pleased with our progress and the turnaround.
Turning to the separation. As you will recall, last October, we announced our plan to separate HP into 2 independent Fortune 50 companies. Today, I'm more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do. Over the past 6 months, we've seen the markets continue to shift and evolve at a rapid pace. In Hewlett Packard Enterprise, our customers are demanding services and solutions that will help them manage traditional IT better, while planning their journey to a hybrid infrastructure. And we need to move faster and smarter to meet that demand. At HP Inc., we will contain engineering multi-OS devices and immersive computing experiences for business and consumer and ink- and laser-based solutions that provide a faster, more affordable, exciting way to print, manage and deliver content, all while continuing to invest in strategic areas like 3D printing. The separation will enable us to do that.
Since October, we've made substantial progress across a number of areas that gives me confidence that we'll complete the separation by the end of our fiscal year. We've completed the leadership and organizational structures for each company and largely completed our workforce assignments. We've made progress in recruiting new board members for each company. We've evaluated how we can best meet customer needs, and as a result, have planned a new, optimized, partner-driven go-to-market approach in over 50 global markets. Our real estate teams have made decisions about our sites around the world, and we've performed thousands of hours of IT system testing ahead of the separation. We've also announced a new brand that represents the future for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, all of that while continuing to deliver on our commitments in terms of FY '15 business performance.
As I've said before, one benefit of our separation is that the disciplined process of reviewing every aspect of the new companies is uncovering opportunities to take costs out and improve the way we do business. Even at this early stage, each new organization is optimizing for the realities of their markets and unique competitive sets. As we dive deep into the planned organizations, we've identified both dis-synergies required to run separate companies as well as opportunities to streamline our processes and ultimately improve both cost structures. Cathie will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we estimate that the total dis-synergies associated with the separation will be approximately $400 million to $450 million annually, divided about equally between the 2 companies. And we believe we can offset more than half of these dis-synergy costs in fiscal year 2016 and more than fully offset these costs by fiscal year 2017.
As separate companies, we'll have sharper focus on the markets we serve, the ability to adapt and shift more quickly and a tighter linkage between rewards and results. And I can already see this beginning to take hold across HP. There's a greater feeling of accountability, and I'm seeing strong execution and more disciplined cost management.
We're also continuing to make smart moves to set Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. up for success. Over the first half of this year, we've done a number of small transactions, including the acquisition of Voltage, a data security provider that complements our existing information security and encryption business, and the announced divestiture of Snapfish, the online photo-sharing platform. Just this week, we closed on the acquisition of Aruba, and I'm really excited about combining our networking portfolio and broad channel with Aruba's highly complementary solutions and specialized sales team. The teams have already hit the ground running with the cross-selling opportunities.
And just this morning, we announced a groundbreaking partnership that will bring together HP's Chinese enterprise technology assets and China's prestigious Tsinghua University to create the leading Chinese provider of IT infrastructure. Under the agreement, Tsinghua will purchase a 51% stake in a new business called H3C, comprising our H3C Technologies business and HP's China-based server storage and technology services businesses for approximately $2.3 billion. This values the overall new H3C business at about $4.5 billion. The combined company will build on H3C's extensive and valuable patent portfolio, best-in-class products and customer focus and Tsinghua's world-class research capability. In one move, we have repositioned HP and shifted the entire technology landscape in the critical Chinese market to accelerate our overall performance and better serve our customers and partners.
Turning to innovation. We continue to drive the product road maps for both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. We recently announced new and enhanced purpose-built compute platforms and solutions including our Apollo family of servers, which support emerging applications, including mass content storage, block and file storage, unstructured and real-time analytics as well as simple and transactional databases. These platforms are specifically designed to help customers leverage their data to drive business outcomes like faster decision-making, improve operational efficiency and direct content monetization.
Network function virtualization, or NFV, is market poised to transform the telecom industry, and we have a strong position in this emerging market. Just over a year ago, we introduced the HP OpenNFV program, providing telcos the resources to test NFV proof of concepts. Recently, Telefonica, one of the world's largest telcos, selected HP as the technology provider and systems integrator to virtualize its global infrastructure. You can expect to see more as we advance in this space.
In Enterprise Services, we announced a partnership with FireEye, one of the leading security software companies. The partnership makes incidents response, compromise assessment and threat detection offerings available to HP's Enterprise Services' most strategic clients globally. This agreement helps HP protect our customers' critical information assets from advanced cyber attacks and supports our strategy to be a world-class provider of security services.
And in Software, we announced several new security software offerings. We also unveiled new software releases designed to help organizations deliver mobile applications that accelerate the delivery of every phase of the mobile app life-cycle, from creation and preproduction to delivery and postproduction management.
In printing, we announced a new series of LaserJet printers designed to make businesses more efficient. Built around the latest in our toner formulation, they use less energy, take up to 40% less space and wake up, print and duplex in a fraction of a time. This announcement represented HP's most significant laser printing reengineering since the introduction of the first LaserJet in 1984.
Finally, in Personal Systems, HP announced a new Spectre x360 at Mobile World Congress earlier this year. This 13.3-inch convertible PC delivers a high-quality, ultra-thin design that provides the productivity of a high-end notebook, tablet mode for on the go, tent mode for play and stand mode for watching entertainment. This product earned more than 9 Best of Show awards at Mobile World Congress and continues to be recognized as one of the top products in the market.
Turning to our execution. We have made significant progress across a lot of fronts over the past 6 months, and importantly, we've seen no distraction from running the business. In fact, the go-to-market approach of this company has drastically improved over the past 3 years, and I see that getting stronger going forward.
Industry Standard Servers had a very strong quarter, growing 17% in constant currency with growth across all regions, driven by strong adoption of our Gen9 portfolio and strength and density optimized in support of the explosion of Big Data in the market.
In Enterprise Services, while the top line remains under pressure, the team improved profitability towards their FY '15 outlook of 4% to 6%. Signings were up year-over-year, even without the Deutsche Bank deal that we closed at the beginning of the quarter, and strategic Enterprise Services TCV was strong.
Personal Systems once again outgrew the overall market and all competitors, gaining share in every region. We saw particular strength in notebooks, supported by key products, including our new EliteBook 1020 and Spectre x360 I mentioned earlier.
In printing, currency is a challenge, but we gained 1 point of share in laser year-over-year and saw good growth in value multi-function printers and graphics. We also saw significant momentum in managed print services, with year-over-year growth in total contract value led by strong new logo signings.
So overall, our performance in Q2 was in line with our expectations, but we continue to face some significant headwinds that impacted our results in the first half and may continue through the rest of the year. Unfavorable currency movements continued to be a challenge in the quarter. With over 65% of our revenue coming from outside the United States and over half of that in EMEA, we are disproportionately impacted by currency movements versus our competitors. And remember that currency impacts HP in multiple ways. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue. For example, our second quarter revenue declined approximately 7% year-over-year as reported, but only 2% in constant currency. In addition, the recent currency movements have enabled our competitors to price very aggressively. For example, aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the printing business, given the weakness of the yen, continued to be a challenge. Finally, the currency movements and the associated repricing impacted demand. We managed to offset the currency impact to company-level operating profit in Q2 through hedges and repricing.
We also saw geopolitical challenges in certain markets, including Russia and China as well as softer public sector spending in the U.K. The PC market is also weaker than I expected at the beginning of the year, but Dion and his team are doing a great job managing through and gaining profitable share.
Finally, we continue to face execution issues in pockets of the portfolio, including Software and Networking. In Software, Q2 revenue was disappointing, primarily on license weakness. But Robert and his team are making progress on realigning the portfolio and go-to-market towards SaaS, as well as partnering more closely with Enterprise Services and Enterprise Group to pull through software sales in all parts of the business.
In Networking, we made progress in our Americas go-to-market in the quarter and, as you can see, made some transformative moves with the Aruba acquisition and the partnership with Tsinghua in China.
So to recap, while we have some challenges, I'm pleased with where we ended the quarter, the continued success of our turnaround and the progress we're making on separation. And our customers and partners continue to support our efforts, as do our employees. I couldn't be more proud of how well the entire company is working to deliver on our commitments for the year. Slowly but surely, HP is tackling its challenges and becoming stronger. It's an exhilarating time to be part of HP, and we remain on course.
Before I turn it over to Cathie, I want to provide an important update on the future leadership teams of the 2 companies after separation.  As you recall, on October 6, we announced that Cathie would become CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. We also said that Dion was commencing a search for the CFO for HP Inc. After looking at a number of candidates during the past few months, Dion, Cathie and I have decided that a better solution is for Cathie to take her experience over to HP Inc. So today, we've announced that Cathie will become CFO of HP Inc. after separation. This is a great outcome for Dion and his business. Cathie is a highly experienced public company CFO. She knows Dion's business is cold, and she can help Dion manage the business straight out of the box.
Part of the reason we can make this move is that Cathie has done a great job bringing up the next generation of leaders in HP finance. We've got a deep bench to choose from, and as a result, we've asked Tim Stonesifer to become CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Tim is currently the CFO of HP's enterprise group and has done a fabulous job in that role. Prior to joining HP, Tim served as CFO of international operations at General Motors Shanghai. Previously, Tim held a number of finance leadership positions during his 20-year tenure at General Electric.
I've worked closely with Tim already, and I can tell you that he's a talented and experienced leader. Both Cathie and I think he's the perfect choice to be CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. But I have to say I'm going to miss working day-to-day with Cathie. Our close partnership during the past 4 years has been incredibly productive and a lot of fun. But as the future Chairman of HP Inc., it gives me great comfort to know that Dion will have Cathie by his side and I will still get to work with her. And as CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I know I'm getting a fantastic CFO in Tim. This works out well all around.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Cathie to go into a bit more business detail and to provide our Q3 financial outlook."

Overall, we had a solid quarter, despite a challenging market environment. We delivered revenue of $25.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported or 2% in constant currency.
Our gross margin was 24%, down 0.2 points year-over-year, driven by competitive pricing in hardware, partially offset by margin improvement in Enterprise Services and Software and favorable mix. Gross margin was up 0.6 points sequentially, in line with normal seasonality.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by currency, with reported declines in both SG&A and R&D. In constant currency though, R&D spend was actually up year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating profit was flat year-over-year at 8.6%.
Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.87 primarily excludes pretax charges of $269 million for separation, $255 million for restructuring and $221 million for amortization of intangible assets.
We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.55, just below our previously provided outlook range, primarily due to slightly accelerated restructuring and separation charges.
We are nearing the completion of our 2012 restructuring plan. In Q2, approximately 3,900 people exited the company, making the total reduction to date approximately 48,000. We are on track to complete this existing program with a total of 55,000 people expected to exit by the end of fiscal 2015.
Turning to the results by business. Personal Systems performed well in a softening market environment. Currency moves and the associated price adjustments had some demand impact and weighed on profitability in the quarter. Revenue declined 5% year-over-year as reported, or was flat in constant currency, with 2% unit growth. Profitability declined 0.5 points to 3%, driven primarily by unfavorable currency.
Consumer revenue declined 2% year-over-year or grew 3% in constant currency, while commercial revenue declined 7% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency. The commercial market continued to be soft, following momentum in 2014 from the XP refresh cycle. However, we achieved 23.1% market share, a record high.
Our compelling product line up in both consumer and commercial enabled us once again to outperform our competitors. Overall, the market slowed during the quarter, with units down 7% in calendar Q1. While we outgrew the market, we had slower sellout at the end of Q2, putting some pressure on Q3 revenue. But we do expect consumer momentum from Windows 10 in Q4.
In Printing, the top line was pressured by a highly competitive market and aggressive pricing, which has an indirect impact from currency moves. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year as reported or 5% in constant currency. Like last quarter, a smaller gap between as reported and constant currency relative to the other business segments due to the financial hedges in place.
We continued to manage profitability well, with operating margin of 18.3%, down 1.2 points year-over-year driven by competitive pricing, partially offset by supplies mix, which was 57.6% in the quarter.
We saw strength in key parts of the portfolio, including profitable growth in graphics and high-value hardware categories. We lost 1 point of share in ink, but continued our momentum in office print with unit growth of OfficeJet Pro X. We gained 1 point of share in laser year-over-year and continued to outperform the market in value multi-function printers.
We exited the quarter with supplies channel inventory slightly above our desired range due to slowdown in sales in April. We expect to reduce channel inventory levels in the second half, and we'll continue to closely monitor demand trends. Our focus remains on stabilizing supplies revenue, and the team will continue placing higher value hardware units with greater supplies attached.
In Enterprise Group, revenue declined 1% year-over-year or grew 5% in constant currency, with solid operating profit of 14.5%, up 0.1 point year-over-year.
Industry Standard Servers momentum continued, delivering 11% year-over-year growth as reported and 17% in constant currency. We continue to see strong option attach and higher ASPs, but strength in density-optimized servers pressured margins. We are well positioned for the second half of the year with a strong backlog, the Windows Server 2003 refresh and overall Gen9 portfolio momentum.
And in Business Critical Systems, while revenue was down 15% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency, the team delivered growth in operating profit dollars driven by improved gross margin and OpEx management. Superdome X and Nonstop X pipelines are growing and driving momentum across the mission-critical x86 portfolio, including Big Data converged solution.
Storage declined 8% year-over-year or 2% at constant currency. While we had solid growth in 3PAR and overall converged storage and expect to gain about 0.3 points of share overall in calendar Q1, a decline in traditional storage products and weaker-than-expected performance in EMEA drove revenue lower. All-flash 3PAR revenue grew again, and Gartner reported HP was the fastest growing flash vendor in 2014. In the second half, we expect continued traction in Converged Storage to drive a return to growth overall in constant currency.
Networking had another difficult quarter with revenues declining 15% year-over-year as reported or 11% in constant currency. We made progress on driving stronger sales execution in the U.S. and grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency in EMEA and Asia Pacific, excluding China. China results were disappointing, but overall, we expect Networking performance will improve organically in the second half of the year. And we are optimistic about the future of this business as we onboard the Aruba team and integrate the competitive portfolio of products and solutions. We're excited to have Dom Orr as the head of the new Networking business, and you will begin to see combined financials in the third quarter results.
As Meg discussed, we're also excited about our new partnership with Tsinghua in China. We believe this new structure will turn around and accelerate performance for H3C, our networking business in China. We expect the deal to close after the separation near the end of 2015, so we won't see an impact to our financials until fiscal 2016. Once it closes, we will account for our ownership using the equity method, with our 49% share of earnings flowing through the other interest and expense line.
Technology Services revenue declined 8% year-over-year as reported or just 2% in constant currency. Orders were down 9% year-over-year as reported, but were up 2% in constant currency, driven by higher hardware volume from Industry Standard Servers and new solutions including Datacenter and Proactive Care. Penetration rates were up year-over-year for Business Critical Systems, Networking and traditional Industry Standard Servers, but the total penetration rate was down on mix. Going forward, we expect ES to stabilize with improving hardware sales.
In Enterprise Services, we continue to be pressured by key account runoff as well as weakness in EMEA and ITO overall. Although the team continues to execute against its profitability outlook this year. Revenue declined 16% year-over-year as reported or 10% in constant currency, while delivering 4% operating profit, up 1.4 points year-over-year. Strategic Enterprise Services signings continued to grow, and application and business services revenue showed marked improvement. Although Q2 revenue was weak, we do expect improvement in the second half and maintain our full year revenue outlook of 4% to 6% year-over-year decline in constant currency. And given the progress on efficiencies and expected quarterly seasonality, we remain confident in our full year operating profit outlook of 4% to 6%.
As we look beyond this fiscal year, we have a path to operating profit of 7% to 9%, but ITO industry challenges have been accelerating, driving risks to the longer-term sustainability of this profit level without further actions. Our current view is that we need to take up to $2 billion of gross annualized costs out of this business over the next 3 years. To effect any level of savings, we would expect to incur GAAP-only charges of up to a similar amount. We'll provide more information as we finalize our plans.
Software had a challenging quarter with weakness across the portfolio. Revenue was down 8% year-over-year as reported or 5% in constant currency. We did delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in SaaS bookings, driven by strong performance in IT management and enterprise security.
The team continues to focus on disciplined cost control, reducing operating expenses year-over-year. However, the accelerated revenue decline pressured profitability. Operating profit was 17.9%, down 1.3 points year-over-year. In the second half, we expect continued pressure on the top line as we evolve our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings.
HP Financial Services revenue declined 7% year-over-year as reported or was flat in constant currency. Financing volume was down 1% year-over-year as reported, but was up 7% in constant currency with strength in the direct business. Return on equity was 15.1%.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion and free cash flow of $766 million.
The cash conversion cycle improved to 4 days, down 9 days year-over-year and down 1 day sequentially. We now expect the cash conversion cycle to be better than the 10 to 12 days forecast previously provided.
However, there are a few items creating a cash flow headwind in fiscal 2015. One of the main items is related to how we hedge net monetary assets and liabilities, where our hedges and underlying currency gains and losses offset one another in the P&L but the cash flows may not. Our hedges are 30-day hedges, while our underlying exposures range from 14 days to multiple years. With large moves in currencies, this creates a timing difference between when we realize the cash flow from hedges versus the underlying exposures. Some of these timing differences reverse quickly within a quarter or 2, while others are longer term. So while there is an overall headwind in this year's cash flow given the current currency rates, these timing differences will net out over time.
In addition to the hedge cash flow timing differences, we are also seeing cash flow impact for the year from pulling forward some of the restructuring and separation cash payments from 2016, a reduction in warranty given lower PC shipments, and lower deferred revenue in TS due to currency and lower-than-expected orders. Given these headwinds and tailwinds, we are holding our full year free cash flow outlook of $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
We repurchased 19 million shares in the quarter and paid $291 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $950 million.
Moving to the separation. We continue to make excellent progress and remain on track to meet the time lines of separation by the end of the fiscal year. I want to take some time to provide an update on onetime charges, dis-synergies, cost savings and the Form 10 filing.
First, Q2 separation charges were $269 million and we expect Q3 charges to be $464 million. The multiyear estimate of total separation charges, including taxes and the associated credits that we announced on the Q1 earnings call, remains unchanged.
And as Meg shared, we estimate the ongoing dis-synergies associated with operating 2 separate companies to be $400 million to $450 million, which is split between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. These costs are primarily associated with corporate functions, including finance, legal, IT, real estate and HR.
As expected, working through the creation of 2 new more efficient and accountable organization has uncovered opportunities for significant cost reductions. Our assessment is that we could take up to $1 billion of gross annualized costs out of the organizations in total and will incur a GAAP-only charge of a similar amount. Although we don't yet have specific details to share, we expect to implement enough cost savings in the near term to offset more than half of the separation dis-synergies in fiscal 2016, and starting in fiscal 2017, would more than offset all dis-synergies.
We have also concluded the legal form of our separation. Based primarily on tax considerations, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be the spin company in the U.S. The legal form may be different across all of the countries in which we do business.
Finally, we still expect to file our Form 10 later this summer, and we'll continue to provide updates as we approach November 1.
Looking forward, currency may continue to be volatile. And if it is, each of our businesses will be impacted differently based on natural hedges, existing financial hedges, repricing capabilities and the overall market environment. Based on the current rate, we expect full year revenue to be flat to slightly down in constant currency.
With all of that in mind, our guidance for fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook remains in the range of $3.53 to $3.73. Fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook remains in the range of $2.03 to $2.23.
Q3 '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.87. And Q3 '15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.54.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

The tailwind that we see is that the cash conversion cycle, given the performance that we've had in the first half of the year, is now expected to be better than the 10 to 12 days that we had previously provided as an outlook. And so that offsets the headwinds around the balance sheet hedging that I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well as some of the pull-in that we've got around -- from 2016 for restructuring and separation costs and then a little bit on the deferred revenue and warranty reserve. And then in terms of the $400 million to $450 million of dis-synergies in '16 and beyond, yes, those are all cash costs. But as I mentioned, we will take approximately $1 billion of gross run rate savings out of the company across HPE and HPI.

And then just on the question, I get a lot of questions, as do you, I'm sure, around free cash flow returning to that $6.5 billion to $7 billion. With the sale of H3C, I estimate you'll lose around $400 million to $500 million on operating cash. Half goes away, and then the other half drops to the investing line on the cash flow statement. You'll have some net dis-synergies of about $200 million to $225 million in fiscal '16 and then any incremental restructuring charges if you do find these cost savings post-split. And then presumably, that's offset by the foreign tax credits that come back. No big separation related costs versus this year and then cash flow from Aruba, but it still seems you'd be short of that $6.5 billion to $7 billion. So can you just maybe help bridge that difference? Or how should we think about that? Is it M&A that's making it up from the proceeds from H3C and Snapfish?

First, we think that the cash conversion cycle will be less of a headwind going into '16 than it was going into '15. You do want to take into consideration the fact that the 2012 program restructuring charges will be coming down pretty materially. But of course, we will have the offset to the incremental GAAP-only charges that we've talked about today. We will have significantly lower separation kind of impact to cash flow from separation across basically taxes that we need to pay, the incremental costs associated with that and the CapEx. And then I think currency is a little bit of a complicated topic, for sure. But you need to obviously think about what you think the currency is going to do, but also take into consideration the implications to cash of our broad hedging programs, our balance sheet hedging programs, which I talked a little bit about, but also some of the benefits that we're getting from our revenue hedging program.

First is I think it's our best-ever product line and very, very solid sales execution that is actually playing into a pretty healthy market as well. I mean, as I said, ISS revenue grew 11% year-over-year as reported and 17% in local currency. And we expect to gain share when the Q1 results are out. And I think it's -- our products like Gen9, which is off to a very fast start, Cloud line and Apollo are resonating well with customers that are purpose-built for specific workloads to deliver business outcomes. So we've got the workload and the business outcome line with the right infrastructure. And then there's another little tailwind, which is the Windows Server 2000 and refresh -- our 2003 refresh, the ramp of our Foxconn partnership and improved win rates, frankly, against Lenovo as they take over the IBM server business. And I'll say one thing, we haven't talked much about cloud on this call because there was so much to cover here. But we're pretty pleased with the results of our Cloud business. And what you have to remember, it shows up. The success of Cloud shows up in 4 places in the -- 3 places in the HP P&L. One is Industry Standard Servers because we are, by far and away, the leader in private cloud, whether it's Gartner or IDC or whoever, so that shows up in ISS. Our virtual private cloud or managed cloud services shows up in Enterprise Services. And then CSA, the Cloud Service Automation and orchestration software that knits it all together shows up in Software. So we may, over time, break out or run alongside sort of overall cloud revenues as opposed to just having it show up in the individual businesses. But for the moment, probably through the end of this year, we'll report in the different businesses. So I just thought I'd say a word about that's another reason that ISS is strong as private cloud."

First is we are making progress towards the long-term goal of 7% to 9% operating margin. But the ITO industry challenges have accelerated and are driving risks in the sustainability of this profit level if we don't do further cost reductions. And I'd say there's a couple of sort of large scale secular trends that are impacting that ITO business. First is the government austerity programs have forced a business model transformation both here as well as in Europe. And basically, the public sector business has gone from buying in a fixed fee model to a cost-plus model, so that put some pressure on. And then secondly, there are -- is a definitely accelerated move to a consumption model, which is going to require us to make a faster labor mix shift to low-cost resources and, frankly, the transformation of the physical data center footprint to much more streamlined footprint that are for more automated. So there's real market shift going on here. And basically, the additional savings plan that we mentioned today would derisk our plan for ES to reach that 7% to 9% operating margins but, more importantly, it would enable us to sustain that level of profitability over time. So we've got more aggressive labor pyramid shift that has to take place onshore, offshore locations to make sure that we stay competitive in that market. And the market's changing dramatically. That said, our apps business and our business process outsourcing business and our strategic Enterprise Services businesses are looking healthier.

So it really is much more of an ITO challenge and the change in the market dynamics."

And if you pull the lens back, let me give you my perspective on this business. As our customers are requiring business outcome solutions as opposed to a migration, what used to be they use to buy on a point product solution basis, we are going to have to lead with services because our customers are asking for transformation services, for business outcomes, for cost, efficiency, better return on invested capital of their assets, and both our services business in ES as well as our TS consulting businesses are becoming more strategic to the future of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And my view is that if we don't have a healthy services business, that will actually compromise our overall business as we go forward because increasingly, services is becoming the tip of the spear in how we go to market, not only to direct customers but, frankly, our partners and VARs are seeing the exact same thing. So the combination of ES plus TS consulting is going to be a really important strategic weapon, I think, for HP going forward."

So first of all, I think we have a terrific partner in Tsinghua. As many of you know, Tsinghua is sort of the Harvard and the MIT of China rolled into one, with incredible R&D capability and very much a part of sort of the Chinese community, if you will. And so obviously, H3C was going to be rolled into this joint venture, but frankly increasingly, servers, storage, technology services and networking, they are converging in China, just like they are here. And we thought it made sense to take all our Chinese enterprise assets and put them into this joint venture. As I said, it will be owned 51% by Tsinghua, 49% by us, and we're excited about the future possibilities. I will tell you already, the H3C and the China HP employees are pretty psyched up about this. They woke up to this news this morning. They are pumped up. And I think this is going to unleash a whole host of business in the Chinese market. So the things that will remain outside of the Tsinghua JV is our Enterprise Services business, which is primarily a business that serve multinational customers. So for example, if we're serving P&G in China, that would be Enterprise Services. The other is our cloud business, HP Helion cloud business as well as our Printing and PC business. And then, of course, Software, which is a very, very small business in China. So the bulk of our Chinese business goes into this JV with the exception obviously -- we have a very big Printing and PC business but that's a completely different business. So that was the thinking behind it."

With the first half of fiscal 2015 now behind us, I'm pleased to report that, once again, we delivered the results we said we would. We executed well in a tough market environment, and in Q2, we delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.87, at the high end of our previously provided outlook range. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion. Free cash flow was approximately $800 million. And we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
In the quarter, we executed well across Industry Standard Servers, Converged Storage, Personal Systems and graphics, and Enterprise Services improved profitability. We continued to invest in innovation across the company and improve our go-to-market approach.
At the same time, we faced significant market challenges due to currency movements, softness in PCs, home printing and IT outsourcing markets and execution challenges in pockets of the business that require more work. But overall, I'm pleased with our progress and the turnaround.
Turning to the separation. As you will recall, last October, we announced our plan to separate HP into 2 independent Fortune 50 companies. Today, I'm more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do. Over the past 6 months, we've seen the markets continue to shift and evolve at a rapid pace. In Hewlett Packard Enterprise, our customers are demanding services and solutions that will help them manage traditional IT better, while planning their journey to a hybrid infrastructure. And we need to move faster and smarter to meet that demand. At HP Inc., we will contain engineering multi-OS devices and immersive computing experiences for business and consumer and ink- and laser-based solutions that provide a faster, more affordable, exciting way to print, manage and deliver content, all while continuing to invest in strategic areas like 3D printing. The separation will enable us to do that.
Since October, we've made substantial progress across a number of areas that gives me confidence that we'll complete the separation by the end of our fiscal year. We've completed the leadership and organizational structures for each company and largely completed our workforce assignments. We've made progress in recruiting new board members for each company. We've evaluated how we can best meet customer needs, and as a result, have planned a new, optimized, partner-driven go-to-market approach in over 50 global markets. Our real estate teams have made decisions about our sites around the world, and we've performed thousands of hours of IT system testing ahead of the separation. We've also announced a new brand that represents the future for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, all of that while continuing to deliver on our commitments in terms of FY '15 business performance.
As I've said before, one benefit of our separation is that the disciplined process of reviewing every aspect of the new companies is uncovering opportunities to take costs out and improve the way we do business. Even at this early stage, each new organization is optimizing for the realities of their markets and unique competitive sets. As we dive deep into the planned organizations, we've identified both dis-synergies required to run separate companies, as well as opportunities to streamline our processes and ultimately improve both cost structures. Cathie will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we estimate that the total dis-synergies associated with the separation will be approximately $400 million to $450 million annually, divided about equally between the 2 companies. And we believe we can offset more than half of these dis-synergy costs in fiscal year 2016 and more than fully offset these costs by fiscal year 2017.
As separate companies, we'll have sharper focus on the markets we serve, the ability to adapt and shift more quickly and a tighter linkage between rewards and results. And I can already see this beginning to take hold across HP. There's a greater feeling of accountability, and I'm seeing strong execution and more disciplined cost management.
We're also continuing to make smart moves to set Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. up for success. Over the first half of this year, we've done a number of small transactions, including the acquisition of Voltage, a data security provider that complements our existing information security and encryption business, and the announced divestiture of Snapfish, the online photo-sharing platform. Just this week, we closed on the acquisition of Aruba, and I'm really excited about combining our networking portfolio and broad channel with Aruba's highly complementary solutions and specialized sales team. The teams have already hit the ground running with the cross-selling opportunities.
And just this morning, we announced a groundbreaking partnership that will bring together HP's Chinese enterprise technology assets and China's prestigious Tsinghua University to create the leading Chinese provider of IT infrastructure. Under the agreement, Tsinghua will purchase a 51% stake in a new business called H3C, comprising our H3C Technologies business and HP's China-based server storage and technology services businesses for approximately $2.3 billion. This values the overall new H3C business at about $4.5 billion. The combined company will build on H3C's extensive and valuable patent portfolio, best-in-class products and customer focus and Tsinghua's world-class research capability. In one move, we have repositioned HP and shifted the entire technology landscape in the critical Chinese market to accelerate our overall performance and better serve our customers and partners.
Turning to innovation. We continue to drive the product roadmaps for both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. We recently announced new and enhanced purpose-built compute platforms and solutions including our Apollo family of servers, which support emerging applications, including mass content storage, block and file storage, unstructured and real-time analytics, as well as simple and transactional databases. These platforms are specifically designed to help customers leverage their data to drive business outcomes like faster decision-making, improved operational efficiency and direct content monetization.
Network function virtualization, or NFV, is market poised to transform the telecom industry, and we have a strong position in this emerging market. Just over a year ago, we introduced the HP OpenNFV program, providing telcos the resources to test NFV proof of concepts. Recently, Telefónica, one of the world's largest telcos, selected HP as the technology provider and systems integrator to virtualize its global infrastructure. You can expect to see more as we advance in this space.
In Enterprise Services, we announced a partnership with FireEye, one of the leading security software companies. The partnership makes incidents response, compromise assessment and threat detection offerings available to HP's Enterprise Services' most strategic clients globally. This agreement helps HP protect our customers' critical information assets from advanced cyber attacks and supports our strategy to be a world-class provider of security services.
And in Software, we announced several new security software offerings. We also unveiled new software releases designed to help organizations deliver mobile applications that accelerate the delivery of every phase of the mobile app life-cycle, from creation and preproduction to delivery and postproduction management.
In printing, we announced a new series of LaserJet printers designed to make businesses more efficient. Built around the latest in our toner formulation, they use less energy, take up to 40% less space and wake up, print and duplex in a fraction of the time. This announcement represented HP's most significant laser printing reengineering since the introduction of the first LaserJet in 1984.
Finally, in Personal Systems, HP announced a new Spectre x360 at Mobile World Congress earlier this year. This 13.3-inch convertible PC delivers a high-quality, ultra-thin design that provides the productivity of a high-end notebook, tablet mode for on the go, tent mode for play and stand mode for watching entertainment. This product earned more than 9 Best of Show awards at Mobile World Congress and continues to be recognized as one of the top products in the market.
Turning to our execution. We have made significant progress across a lot of fronts over the past 6 months, and importantly, we've seen no distraction from running the business. In fact, the go-to-market approach of this company has drastically improved over the past 3 years, and I see that getting stronger going forward.
Industry Standard Servers had a very strong quarter, growing 17% in constant currency, with growth across all regions, driven by strong adoption of our Gen9 portfolio and strength and density optimized in support of the explosion of Big Data in the market.
In Enterprise Services, while the top line remains under pressure, the team improved profitability towards their FY '15 outlook of 4% to 6%. Signings were up year-over-year, even without the Deutsche Bank deal that we closed at the beginning of the quarter, and strategic Enterprise Services TCV was strong.
Personal Systems once again outgrew the overall market and all competitors, gaining share in every region. We saw particular strength in notebooks, supported by key products, including our new EliteBook 1020 and Spectre x360 I mentioned earlier.
In printing, currency is a challenge, but we gained 1 point of share in laser year-over-year and saw good growth in value multifunction printers and graphics. We also saw significant momentum in managed print services, with year-over-year growth in total contract value led by strong new logo signings.
So overall, our performance in Q2 was in line with our expectations, but we continue to face some significant headwinds that impacted our results in the first half and may continue through the rest of the year. Unfavorable currency movements continued to be a challenge in the quarter. With over 65% of our revenue coming from outside the United States and over half of that in EMEA, we are disproportionately impacted by currency movements versus our competitors. And remember that currency impacts HP in multiple ways. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue. For example, our second quarter revenue declined approximately 7% year-over-year as reported, but only 2% in constant currency. In addition, the recent currency movements have enabled our competitors to price very aggressively. For example, aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the printing business, given the weakness of the yen, continued to be a challenge. Finally, the currency movements and the associated repricing impacted demand. We managed to offset the currency impact to company-level operating profit in Q2 through hedges and repricing.
We also saw geopolitical challenges in certain markets, including Russia and China, as well as softer public sector spending in the U.K. The PC market is also weaker than I expected at the beginning of the year, but Dion and his team are doing a great job managing through and gaining profitable share.
Finally, we continue to face execution issues in pockets of the portfolio, including Software and Networking. In Software, Q2 revenue was disappointing, primarily on license weakness. But Robert and his team are making progress on realigning the portfolio and go-to-market towards SaaS, as well as partnering more closely with Enterprise Services and Enterprise Group to pull through software sales in all parts of the business.
In Networking, we made progress in our Americas go-to-market in the quarter and, as you can see, made some transformative moves with the Aruba acquisition and the partnership with Tsinghua in China.
So to recap, while we have some challenges, I'm pleased with where we ended the quarter, the continued success of our turnaround and the progress we're making on separation. And our customers and partners continue to support our efforts, as do our employees. I couldn't be more proud of how well the entire company is working to deliver on our commitments for the year. Slowly but surely, HP is tackling its challenges and becoming stronger. It's an exhilarating time to be part of HP, and we remain on course.
Before I turn it over to Cathie, I want to provide an important update on the future leadership teams of the 2 companies after separation.  As you recall, on October 6, we announced that Cathie would become CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. We also said that Dion was commencing a search for the CFO for HP Inc. After looking at a number of candidates during the past few months, Dion, Cathie and I have decided that a better solution is for Cathie to take her experience over to HP Inc. So today, we've announced that Cathie will become CFO of HP Inc. after separation. This is a great outcome for Dion and his business. Cathie is a highly experienced public company CFO. She knows Dion's business cold, and she can help Dion manage the business straight out of the box.
Part of the reason we can make this move is that Cathie has done a great job bringing up the next generation of leaders in HP finance. We've got a deep bench to choose from, and as a result, we've asked Tim Stonesifer to become CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Tim is currently the CFO of HP's Enterprise Group and has done a fabulous job in that role. Prior to joining HP, Tim served as CFO of international operations at General Motors Shanghai. Previously, Tim held a number of finance leadership positions during his 20-year tenure at General Electric.
I've worked closely with Tim already, and I can tell you that he's a talented and experienced leader. Both Cathie and I think he's the perfect choice to be CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. But I have to say I'm going to miss working day-to-day with Cathie. Our close partnership during the past 4 years has been incredibly productive and a lot of fun. But as the future Chairman of HP Inc., it gives me great comfort to know that Dion will have Cathie by his side and I will still get to work with her. And as CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I know I'm getting a fantastic CFO in Tim. This works out well all around.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Cathie to go into a bit more business detail and to provide our Q3 financial outlook."

Overall, we had a solid quarter, despite a challenging market environment. We delivered revenue of $25.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported or 2% in constant currency.
Our gross margin was 24%, down 0.2 points year-over-year, driven by competitive pricing in hardware, partially offset by margin improvement in Enterprise Services and Software and favorable mix. Gross margin was up 0.6 points sequentially, in line with normal seasonality.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by currency, with reported declines in both SG&A and R&D. In constant currency though, R&D spend was actually up year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating profit was flat year-over-year at 8.6%.
Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.87 primarily excludes pretax charges of $269 million for separation, $255 million for restructuring and $221 million for amortization of intangible assets.
We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.55, just below our previously provided outlook range, primarily due to slightly accelerated restructuring and separation charges.
We are nearing the completion of our 2012 restructuring plan. In Q2, approximately 3,900 people exited the company, making the total reduction to date approximately 48,000. We are on track to complete this existing program with a total of 55,000 people expected to exit by the end of fiscal 2015.
Turning to the results by business. Personal Systems performed well in a softening market environment. Currency moves and the associated price adjustments had some demand impact and weighed on profitability in the quarter. Revenue declined 5% year-over-year as reported, or was flat in constant currency, with 2% unit growth. Profitability declined 0.5 points to 3%, driven primarily by unfavorable currency.
Consumer revenue declined 2% year-over-year or grew 3% in constant currency, while commercial revenue declined 7% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency. The commercial market continued to be soft, following momentum in 2014 from the XP refresh cycle. However, we achieved 23.1% market share, a record high.
Our compelling product lineup in both consumer and commercial enabled us once again to outperform our competitors. Overall, the market slowed during the quarter, with units down 7% in calendar Q1. While we outgrew the market, we had slower sellout at the end of Q2, putting some pressure on Q3 revenue. But we do expect consumer momentum from Windows 10 in Q4.
In Printing, the top line was pressured by a highly competitive market and aggressive pricing, which has an indirect impact from currency moves. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year as reported or 5% in constant currency. Like last quarter, a smaller gap between as reported and constant currency relative to the other business segments due to the financial hedges in place.
We continued to manage profitability well, with operating margin of 18.3%, down 1.2 points year-over-year driven by competitive pricing, partially offset by supplies mix, which was 67.6% in the quarter.
We saw strength in key parts of the portfolio, including profitable growth in graphics and high-value hardware categories. We lost 1 point of share in ink, but continued our momentum in office print with unit growth of OfficeJet Pro X. We gained 1 point of share in laser year-over-year and continued to outperform the market in value multifunction printers.
We exited the quarter with supplies channel inventory slightly above our desired range due to the slowdown in sales in April. We expect to reduce channel inventory levels in the second half, and we'll continue to closely monitor demand trends. Our focus remains on stabilizing supplies revenue, and the team will continue placing higher value hardware units with greater supplies attached.
In Enterprise Group, revenue declined 1% year-over-year or grew 5% in constant currency, with solid operating profit of 14.5%, up 0.1 point year-over-year.
Industry Standard Servers momentum continued, delivering 11% year-over-year growth as reported and 17% in constant currency. We continue to see strong option attach and higher ASPs, but strength in density-optimized servers pressured margins. We are well positioned for the second half of the year with a strong backlog, the Windows Server 2003 refresh and overall Gen9 portfolio momentum.
And in Business Critical Systems, while revenue was down 15% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency, the team delivered growth in operating profit dollars driven by improved gross margin and OpEx management. Superdome X and Nonstop X pipelines are growing and driving momentum across the mission-critical x86 portfolio, including Big Data converged solutions.
Storage declined 8% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency. While we had solid growth in 3PAR and overall Converged Storage and expect to gain about 0.3 points of share overall in calendar Q1, a decline in traditional storage products and weaker-than-expected performance in EMEA drove revenue lower. All-flash 3PAR revenue grew again, and Gartner reported HP was the fastest growing flash vendor in 2014. In the second half, we expect continued traction in Converged Storage to drive a return to growth overall in constant currency.
Networking had another difficult quarter with revenues declining 16% year-over-year as reported or 11% in constant currency. We made progress on driving stronger sales execution in the U.S. and grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency in EMEA and Asia Pacific, excluding China. China results were disappointing, but overall, we expect Networking performance will improve organically in the second half of the year. And we're optimistic about the future of this business as we onboard the Aruba team and integrate the competitive portfolio of products and solutions. We're excited to have Dom Orr as the head of the new Networking business, and you will begin to see combined financials in the third quarter results.
As Meg discussed, we're also excited about our new partnership with Tsinghua in China. We believe this new structure will turn around and accelerate performance for H3C, our networking business in China. We expect the deal to close after the separation near the end of 2015, so we won't see an impact to our financials until fiscal 2016. Once it closes, we will account for our ownership using the equity method, with our 49% share of earnings flowing through the other interest and expense line.
Technology Services revenue declined 8% year-over-year as reported or just 2% in constant currency. Orders were down 9% year-over-year as reported, but were up 2% in constant currency, driven by higher hardware volume from Industry Standard Servers and new solutions including Datacenter and Proactive Care. Penetration rates were up year-over-year for Business Critical Systems, Networking and traditional Industry Standard Servers, but the total penetration rate was down on mix. Going forward, we expect TS to stabilize with improving hardware sales.
In Enterprise Services, we continue to be pressured by key account runoffs as well as weakness in EMEA and ITO overall, although the team continues to execute against its profitability outlook this year. Revenue declined 16% year-over-year as reported or 10% in constant currency, while delivering 4% operating profit, up 1.4 points year-over-year. Strategic Enterprise Services signings continued to grow, and Application and Business Services revenue showed marked improvement. Although Q2 revenue was weak, we do expect improvement in the second half and maintain our full year revenue outlook of 4% to 6% year-over-year decline in constant currency. And given the progress on efficiencies and expected quarterly seasonality, we remain confident in our full year operating profit outlook of 4% to 6%.
As we look beyond this fiscal year, we have a path to operating profit of 7% to 9%, but ITO industry challenges have been accelerating, driving risks to the longer-term sustainability of this profit level without further actions. Our current view is that we need to take up to $2 billion of gross annualized costs out of this business over the next 3 years. To effect any level of savings, we would expect to incur GAAP-only charges of up to a similar amount. We'll provide more information as we finalize our plans.
Software had a challenging quarter with weakness across the portfolio. Revenue was down 8% year-over-year as reported or 5% in constant currency. We did deliver double-digit year-over-year growth in SaaS bookings, driven by strong performance in IT management and enterprise security.
The team continues to focus on disciplined cost control, reducing operating expenses year-over-year. However, the accelerated revenue decline pressured profitability. Operating profit was 17.9%, down 1.3 points year-over-year. In the second half, we expect continued pressure on the top line as we evolve our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings.
HP Financial Services revenue declined 7% year-over-year as reported or was flat in constant currency. Financing volume was down 1% year-over-year as reported, but was up 7% in constant currency with strength in the direct business. Return on equity was 15.1%.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion and free cash flow of $766 million. The cash conversion cycle improved to 4 days, down 9 days year-over-year and down 1 day sequentially. We now expect the cash conversion cycle to be better than the 10 to 12 days forecast previously provided.
However, there are a few items creating a cash flow headwind in fiscal 2015. One of the main items is related to how we hedge net monetary assets and liabilities, where our hedges and underlying currency gains and losses offset one another in the P&L but the cash flows may not. Our hedges are 30-day hedges, while our underlying exposures range from 14 days to multiple years. With large moves in currencies, this creates a timing difference between when we realize the cash flow from hedges versus the underlying exposures. Some of these timing differences reverse quickly within a quarter or 2, while others are longer term. So while there is an overall headwind in this year's cash flow given the current currency rates, these timing differences will net out over time.
In addition to the hedge cash flow timing differences, we are also seeing cash flow impact for the year from pulling forward some of the restructuring and separation cash payments from 2016, a reduction in warranty given lower PC shipments, and lower deferred revenue in TS due to currency and lower-than-expected orders. Given these headwinds and tailwinds, we are holding our full year free cash flow outlook of $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
We repurchased 19 million shares in the quarter and paid $291 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $950 million.
Moving to the separation. We continue to make excellent progress and remain on track to meet the time line for separation by the end of the fiscal year. I want to take some time to provide an update on onetime charges, dis-synergies, cost savings and the Form 10 filing.
First, Q2 separation charges were $269 million and we expect Q3 charges to be $464 million. The multiyear estimate of total separation charges, including taxes and the associated credits that we announced on the Q1 earnings call, remains unchanged.
And as Meg shared, we estimate the ongoing dis-synergies associated with operating 2 separate companies to be $400 million to $450 million, which are split between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. These costs are primarily associated with corporate functions, including finance, legal, IT, real estate and HR.
As expected, working through the creation of 2 new more efficient and accountable organizations has uncovered opportunities for significant cost reductions. Our assessment is that we could take up to $1 billion of gross annualized costs out of the organizations in total and would incur a GAAP-only charge of a similar amount. Although we don't yet have specific details to share, we expect to implement enough cost savings in the near term to offset more than half of the separation dis-synergies in fiscal 2016, and starting in fiscal 2017, would more than offset all dis-synergies.
We have also concluded on the legal form of our separation. Based primarily on tax considerations, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be the spin company in the U.S. The legal form may be different across all of the countries in which we do business.
Finally, we still expect to file our Form 10 later this summer, and we'll continue to provide updates as we approach November 1.
Looking forward, currency may continue to be volatile. And if it is, each of our businesses will be impacted differently based on natural hedges, existing financial hedges, repricing capabilities and the overall market environment. Based on the current rates, we expect full year revenue to be flat to slightly down in constant currency.
With all of that in mind, our guidance for fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook remains in the range of $3.53 to $3.73. Fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook remains in the range of $2.03 to $2.23.
Q3 '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.87. And Q3 '15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.54.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And when you kind of net them both together, you get into the range of the $3.5 billion to $4 billion, so we're able to hold. The tailwind that we see is that the cash conversion cycle, given the performance that we've had in the first half of the year, is now expected to be better than the 10 to 12 days that we had previously provided as an outlook. And so that offsets the headwinds around the balance sheet hedging that I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well as some of the pull-in that we've got around -- from 2016 for restructuring and separation costs and then a little bit on the deferred revenue and warranty reserve. And then in terms of the $400 million to $450 million of dis-synergies in '16 and beyond, yes, those are all cash costs. But as I mentioned, we will take approximately $1 billion of gross run rate savings out of the company across HPE and HPI. And so we will offset more than half of those with those cost savings in fiscal 2016, but of course, we will take a GAAP-only charge of about $1 billion."

And then just on the question, I get a lot of questions, as do you, I'm sure, around free cash flow returning to that $6.5 billion to $7 billion. With the sale of H3C, I estimate you'll lose around $400 million to $500 million in operating cash. Half goes away, and then the other half drops to the investing line on the cash flow statement. You'll have some net dis-synergies of about $200 million to $225 million in fiscal '16 and then any incremental restructuring charges if you do find these cost savings post-split. And then presumably, that's offset by the foreign tax credits that come back. No big separation related costs versus this year and then cash flow from Aruba, but it still seems you'd be short of that $6.5 billion to $7 billion.

First, we think that the cash conversion cycle will be less of a headwind going into '16 than it was going into '15. You do want to take into consideration the fact that the 2012 program restructuring charges will be coming down pretty materially. But of course, we will have the offset to the incremental GAAP-only charges that we've talked about today. We will have significantly lower separation kind of impact to cash flow from separation across basically taxes that we need to pay, the incremental costs associated with that and the CapEx. And then I think currency is a little bit of a complicated topic, for sure. But you need to obviously think about what you think the currency is going to do, but also take into consideration the implications to cash of our broad hedging programs, our balance sheet hedging programs, which I talked a little bit about, but also some of the benefits that we're getting from our revenue hedging program.

The $1 billion and the $2 billion, in terms of the impact to the cash in fiscal '16, how should we think about that? Should we think of those cost savings as mostly offsetting those restructuring charges, but because the restructuring charges are a bit front-end loaded, that cash benefit won't come until later in the 3-year period? And then I just wanted to get a little bit of detail on the strength that you're seeing in the Industry Standard Server business, and why you think you're seeing strength there."

I think the insight into fiscal '16 that we provided is that the dis-synergies of $400 million to $450 million will be more than half offset in fiscal '16. And so we will obviously get some cash flow benefit from the actions that we will take with these GAAP-only charges in '16."

First is I think it's our best-ever product line and very, very solid sales execution that is actually playing into a pretty healthy market as well. I mean, as I said, ISS revenue grew 11% year-over-year as reported and 17% in local currency. And we expect to gain share when the Q1 results are out. And I think it's our products like Gen9, which is off to a very fast start, Cloudline and Apollo are resonating well with customers that are purpose-built for specific workloads to deliver business outcomes. So we've got the workload and the business outcome lined with the right infrastructure. And then there's another little tailwind, which is the Windows Server 2000 and refresh -- our 2003 refresh, the ramp of our Foxconn partnership and improved win rates, frankly, against Lenovo as they take over the IBM server business. And I'll say one thing, we haven't talked much about cloud on this call because there was so much to cover here. But we're pretty pleased with the results of our Cloud business. And what you have to remember, it shows up. The success of Cloud shows up in 4 places in the -- 3 places in the HP P&L. One is Industry Standard Servers because we are, by far and away, the leader in private cloud, whether it's Gartner or IDC or whoever, so that shows up in ISS. Our virtual private cloud or managed cloud services shows up in Enterprise Services. And then CSA, the Cloud Service Automation and orchestration software that knits it all together, shows up in Software. So we may, over time, break out or run alongside sort of overall cloud revenues as opposed to just having it show up in the individual businesses. But for the moment, probably through the end of this year, we'll report it in the different businesses. So I just thought I'd say a word about that's another reason that ISS is strong as private cloud."

On the quarter, the win rate that Meg talked about is up relative to the previous quarter low-double digits, so really strong improvement there. We are bringing on hundreds of new customers that haven't bought from HP in the last 12 months. So we're making really good progress against kind of the Lenovo lineup. And then in terms of the rest of the year for ISS, we've got a really nice wind at our back. We've got -- we're going into the second half with a strong backlog, so a better backlog, frankly, than we normally see going into Q3. As Meg said, we do have the Windows Server 2003 also coming up and, as you may recall, that is expiring in I think it's July of this year. And then Meg mentioned the Gen9 momentum."

First is we are making progress towards the long-term goal of 7% to 9% operating margin. But the ITO industry challenges have accelerated and are driving risk in the sustainability of this profit level if we don't do further cost reductions. And I'd say there's a couple of sort of large-scale secular trends that are impacting that ITO business. First is the government austerity programs have forced a business model transformation both here as well as in Europe. And basically, the public sector business has gone from buying in a fixed fee model to a cost-plus model, so that put some pressure on. And then secondly, there are -- is a definitely accelerated move to a consumption model, which is going to require us to make a faster labor mix shift to low-cost resources and, frankly, the transformation of the physical data center footprint to much more streamlined footprint that are far more automated. So there's real market shifts going on here. And basically, the additional savings plan that we mentioned today would derisk our plan for ES to reach that 7% to 9% operating margins but, more importantly, would enable us to sustain that level of profitability over time. So we've got more aggressive labor pyramid shifts that has to take place onshore, offshore locations to make sure that we stay competitive in that market. And the market's changing dramatically. That said, our apps business and our business process outsourcing business and our strategic Enterprise Services businesses are looking healthier. But remember, ITO is a big chunk of our Enterprise Services business."

Now there is an impact from the top 3 runoff, but it is still a lot softer than what we had been seeing. And so we're definitely starting to see the pressures in the ITO space. On the app side, we really -- we saw declines of 8% as reported in revenue, but only 2% in constant currency. And if you adjust for currency, we had a couple of our regions that actually were flat to slightly up, and we see that progressing as we go into the second half. So it really is much more of an ITO challenge and the change in the market dynamics."

And if you pull the lens back, let me give you my perspective on this business. As our customers are requiring business outcome solutions as opposed to a migration, which used to be they used to buy on a point product solution basis, we are going to have to lead with Services because our customers are asking for transformation services, for business outcomes, for cost, efficiency, better return on invested capital of their assets, and both our Services business in ES as well as our TS consulting businesses are becoming more strategic to the future of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And my view is that if we don't have a healthy Services business, that will actually compromise our overall business as we go forward because increasingly, Services is becoming the tip of the spear in how we go to market, not only to direct customers but, frankly, our partners and VARs are seeing the exact same thing. So the combination of ES plus TS consulting is going to be a really important strategic weapon, I think, for HP going forward."

As many of you know, Tsinghua is sort of the Harvard and the MIT of China rolled into one, with incredible R&D capability and very much a part of sort of the Chinese community, if you will. And so obviously, H3C was going to be rolled into this joint venture, but frankly, increasingly, servers, storage, technology services and networking, they are converging in China, just like they are here. And we thought it made sense to take all our Chinese enterprise assets and put them into this joint venture. As I said, it will be owned 51% by Tsinghua, 49% by us, and we're excited about the future possibilities. I will tell you already, the H3C and the China HP employees are pretty psyched up about this. They woke up to this news this morning. They're pumped up. And I think this is going to unleash a whole host of business in the Chinese market. So the things that will remain outside of the Tsinghua JV is our Enterprise Services business, which is primarily a business that serves multinational customers. So for example, if we're serving P&G in China, that would be Enterprise Services. The other is our cloud business, HP Helion cloud business, as well as our Printing and PC business. And then, of course, Software, which is a very, very small business in China. So the bulk of our Chinese business goes into this JV with the exception obviously -- we have a very big Printing and PC business but that's a completely different business.

In the third quarter, we once again did what we said We'D do, delivering non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.88, above our previously provided outlook range. We delivered $856 million in free cash flow, in line with our expectations. And we returned $670 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, all while executing with military precision one of the largest and most complex separation separations than had ever been undertaken.
By business, we're seeing the benefits of the work we've done over the past several years to strengthen the product strategy and go-to-market execution for the Enterprise Group. Enterprise Group performed very well in Q3, with solid constant currency revenue year-over-year growth across all 3 regions and good momentum in Industry Standard Servers, storage, networking and Technology Services support. In Enterprise Services, we're turning the corner in what has been one of the most critical parts of the turnaround. ES significantly improved its sequential revenue trajectory and delivered another quarter of sequential and year-over-year profit improvement.  Software performance was mixed with growth in security and IT management SaaS revenue. 
In Personal Systems and Printing, market declines and competitive pricing pressures have accelerated since May. While Dion and his team are aggressively managing costs and gaining share in key focus areas, we now see a difficult business environment for at least several quarters to come.
Turning to the separation. We achieved a number of significant milestones during the past few months. On July 1, we filed the initial Form 10 for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise with the SEC. A tremendous amount of work went into submission including building 3 years of audited financials for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Earlier this month, we filed the first amendment to the Form 10, which included the pro forma cash and debt levels for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Cathie will talk more about the details of the Form 10 in a minute.
On August 1, we successfully split the operations and IT systems for the company. This was an incredibly complex, process and the team executed very well. This separation required working directly with more than 3,500 customers and partners to prepare for the cut over. We successfully separated nearly 750 systems affecting 95% of our business with no issues. After shutting down for just 3 days to transition, critical operational systems across our business segments are now live globally. Customer orders are flowing through manufacturing, and shipments are in transit across our entire supply chain network. This was a huge accomplishment.
Finally, just last week, we introduced the expected members of the Board of Directors for both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. We handpicked both boards to create most experienced global-minded members we could find to help each company win in their unique markets. We are very proud of the diversity of these 2 boards and what it says about the importance we place on having people representative of our customer base participate in our decision-making.
Turning to our performance in the quarter. Even with the separation process heating up, we remained focused and continued to execute well across the businesses. However, we did face a challenging macroeconomic and IT spending environment in the third quarter, with soft consumer spending, continued weakness in Russia and China and stock market volatility driving uncertainty. Currency continued to significantly impact our reported revenue. 
Third quarter revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% as reported, but down only 2% in constant currency. By business, the momentum in Enterprise Group continued. Constant currency revenue growth was strong, both with and without the impact from the first quarter of Aruba Networks' contribution.
In Industry Standard Servers, a strong market combined with our Gen9 portfolio transition supported 15% revenue growth in constant currency. We've turned the corner in storage with our newer Converged Storage portfolio now representing more than 50% of the mix. We delivered 7% growth in storage overall in constant currency, with incredible 400% growth in all-flash storage, and we expect this will continue to strengthen our share position as a leader in the market. And the significant moves we've made in networking are already beginning to pay off with a 28% year-over-year constant currency growth, driven by strong performance on all regions except China.
Even without Aruba, the business grew mid-single digits in constant currency. The Aruba integration is already driving strong cross-selling opportunities. And with our announcement to partner with University, we delivered sequential improvement in networking -- in our networking business performance in China.
As you know, Enterprise Services is a long-lead-time business, and in Q3, we clearly saw the results of the work the team has been doing over the past 3 years. Revenue continued to stabilize, down just 3% in constant currency, the best constant currency revenue performance since Q3 FY '12.  Operating profit improved again, up nearly 2 points year-over-year to 6%. The business continued to make progress migrating to strategic Enterprise Services, or services for the New Style of IT as evidenced by triple digit year-over-year TCV growth and double-digit growth in revenue.
In Software, we remain focused on aligning our portfolio to the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise strategy and driving software-led integrated solutions across EG and ES, while addressing the challenges around the market shift to SaaS and internal execution challenges. We saw growth in key pockets of SaaS solutions as well as security with great early results from our recent acquisition of voltage. This was offset by weaker big data and IT management. The team remain disciplined around cost control and make progress on streamlining the portfolio with the completion of the divestiture of iManage and by moving the marketing optimization business to PPS at the beginning of Q4.
Moving to Personal Systems. As you all know, the market is very soft, down 13% year-over-year in calendar Q2, driving fiscal Q3 revenue down 7% in constant currency. There were a number of factors pressuring the market, which we now expect to continue through Q4 and well into the next fiscal year.
The market remain competitive, and currency was a continued headwind. In commercial, we had a tough compare with the Windows XP refresh cycle. And in consumer, we faced slightly higher channel inventory levels as customers paused purchasing decisions in anticipation of the Windows 10 launch.
Overall, HP remains well positioned in the market. We gained 1 point of share in calendar Q2 and expect consolidation to continue among the top players in this market. We were fast to markets with Windows 10, which resulted in strong initial market share, and the early feedback on this operating system has been positive.
Similarly, the overall printing market was very soft with hardware units down 6% year-over-year in calendar Q2. key challenge we faced this quarter was an acceleration of hardware average selling price erosion, driven by aggressive pricing by our Japanese competitors. But while our Q3 revenue was down, we are pleased with our share performance with units down just 2%. In laser, we gained over 3 points of share year-over-year, achieving 36.9% of the global market, the highest share in 6 years. We attribute some of the success to the R series launch earlier this year as well as continued momentum in our value multifunction printers, which achieved a new high share of 16.6%.
In ink jet, we continue to see strength in Office Print with strong growth in OfficeJet Pro X units. In Instant Ink, our innovative ink subscription service, has very strong momentum, with significant sequential growth in enrollees and customer retention rates well above our expectations. The economics on this delivery model provider customers with a competitive value proposition that can't be beat. Customers pay for only what they print and never run out, making it by far the most convenient flexible and affordable print option out there.
As we've said in the past, we are allocating resources to high-growth opportunities. And in Q3, we continued to roll out exciting innovations and win new customers. At HP Discover Las Vegas in June, we announced a strategy for Hewlett-Packard Enterprise focused on delivering solutions to help customers transform four critical areas of their enterprise. These 4 areas comprise helping customers move to a hybrid infrastructure that seamlessly brings together traditional IT and the cloud, protecting the digital enterprise, powering the data-driven organization and finally, enabling workplace productivity. Collectively, these 4 areas represent more than $1 trillion in total available market where Hewlett Packard Enterprise is uniquely positioned to win.
Aligned with these focus areas, we announced new partnerships and enhancements to our storage, converged data center infrastructure, cloud and software portfolios. For example, we announced the latest HP 3PAR store serve storage family, including a new class of flash services to accelerate IT as a Service consolidation and hybrid IT initiatives.
Also at Discover Las Vegas, over 30 customers and partners showcased their success with HP Helion cloud, providing a strong testament into how far we've come since launching HP Helion just a year earlier. Caterpillar, Del Monte and GE were among the customers that discussed positive business outcomes with HP Helion on stage.
At the event, we also announced HP Helion CloudSystem 9, bringing together our industry-leading private cloud solutions with HP Helion OpenStack and the HP Helion development platform. CloudSystem 9 provides customers an enterprise-grade open-source platform for cloud data application development and infrastructure. And in July, we acquired  Staccato, an enterprise-ready Platform as a Service solution with cloud as its core. Staccato gives HP a more complete cloud offering and will enhance the HP Helion development platform by enabling customers to bring applications to market faster.
Continuing our commitment to enable increased adoption of the emerging network function virtualization or NFV market, last month, we announced a collaboration with NAC create more open environments for customers, meeting the desire for faster deployment at a lower cost. HP also acquired Contact Stream, which offers solutions that allow service providers to create a more flexible and programmable networks through NFV. Contact Stream's open SDN controller platform complements HP's expertise and telecommunications and IT experience and is already deployed in a number of major carrier networks across the globe.
In Enterprise Services, we introduced a full suite of Windows 10 Services that give HP the most comprehensive portfolio of services available for the Microsoft ecosystem. The Enterprise Services team also signed some significant deals in the quarter, including a major deal with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to serve as prime contractor and systems integrator for a secure system that will improve its ability to react to humanitarian and defense crises worldwide.
Personal Systems rolled out a new Windows 10 tablet and new notebooks that combine great battery life in a fitter curve design. We also announced new 3D scanning capability for Sprout by HP, world's first immersive computer. This will make Sprout the first fully integrated desktop 3D scanning solution for consumers.
So overall, I'm pleased with our progress across many key areas despite a very challenging market backdrop for PCs and print and some of our other businesses we're executing well, innovating and gaining share in key areas, all while delivering on our separation time line. This is a major accomplishment and I want to thank all of the HP employees who are making it happen. I also want to thank our customers and partners for their ongoing faith and we can't be successful without their support.
And now I'll turn it over to Cathie."
108856,308671499,861565,"Hewlett-Packard Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Meg. Overall, I feel good about our performance in Q3, even amidst market softness in some parts of the portfolio and continued year-over-year headwinds from unfavorable currency. Revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% year-over-year or 2% in consta",2083,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, I feel good about our performance in Q3, even amidst market softness in some parts of the portfolio and continued year-over-year headwinds from unfavorable currency. Revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency with declines in all regions and a particular weakness in EMEA. The 6-point gap between as reported and constant currency revenue performance is wider than prior quarters as the financial hedges are rolling off.
Our gross margin of 23.8% was down 0.2 points year-over-year and 0.2 points sequentially in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 10% year-over-year, with reductions in SG&A primarily due to currency only partially offset by increased investment in R&D.  Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.6% was up 0.1 point year-over-year and flat sequentially. 
We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.88, above the high end of our outlook range. About $0.02 was a result of incremental channel business we would have otherwise expected to do in Q4 as we derisked our IT separation cutover by making sure the channel had what it needed when our systems were down in early August.
Our non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $401 million for separation, $242 million for amortization of intangible assets and additional noncash charges of $136 million for an Enterprise Services data center impairment and $114 million for a onetime pension adjustment.
GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.47 was below our previously provided outlook range of $0.50 to $0.54, primarily due to the ES data center impairment, which was not considered in our outlook. We are nearing the end of our 2012 restructuring program, and 3,900 people exited in Q3. By the end of Q4, we expect to exceed our prior estimate of 55,000 people to exit the company by up to 5%, but we'll not exceed the forecasted GAAP-only charges.
Turning to the results by business. Personal Systems revenue declined 13% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency with an 11% decline in units. However, we grew our worldwide market share to 18.9% as the market continued to consolidate. Currency remained a significant headwind for this business, although we managed to offset about half of the ASP impact with price adjustments, mix and the strength in option attach.
Profitability declined 1 point year-over-year to 3%, driven primarily by unfavorable currency net of repricing, partially offset by strength the commercial business, commodity cost savings and operational improvements. Sequentially, the favorable currency mix offset the net currency headwind, leaving margins flat.
In a tough market, our performance in commercial was solid. Commercial revenue declined 9% year-over-year or down just 2% at constant currency. However, we gained 1 point of share, achieving 22.7% market share and maintained our #1 position worldwide. We saw pockets of strength with growth in commercial notebooks, mobile workstations, commercial services and retail solution.  
Consumer performance was weaker with Q3 revenue down 22% year-over-year or down 17% in constant currency.  The overall market is highly competitive. However, our overall consumer market share was roughly flat with share gains in key areas including the premium consumer segment.
Looking forward, while we see continued market headwinds for several quarters to come, we also see opportunity in the market long term with our strength in commercial and Windows 10 as catalyst for demand especially in consumer.
In Print, revenue declined 9% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. As in prior quarters, the currency impact is somewhat smaller for printing due to the hedges we have in place for this business, but has widened about 1 point sequentially as the hedges the rolling off.
While the market was tough overall, we performed better than market in areas of focus. We gained 3 points of share in laser hardware overall, achieving our highest ever share in value multifunction printers. While we lost a fraction of a point of share in inkjet, we grew SMB hardware units double digits year-over-year and continue to see very positive momentum in our Instant Ink program. And graphics continue to be a bright spot of growth, with Indigo achieving 57% market share.
We maintained good profitability in Q3 with an operating margin of 17.8%, down 0.6 points from the prior year. Gross margins were pressured by a highly competitive pricing environment, only partially offset by a favorable supplies mix of 67.6%. Also, OpEx was down year-over-year, helped by the Snapfish sale. 
Channel inventory for hardware and supplies was above our desired ranges due to expected business continuity planning around the separation as well as softer-than-expected market demand. We expect to reduce channel inventory levels in Q4.
Looking forward, we expected printing headwinds to also continue longer term, particularly the competitive pricing on hardware, but we will continue to focus on stabilizing supplies revenue through strategic payments of high-value hardware units with greater supplies attach. We also plan to increase focus on alternative consumption models particularly for consumers. For example, as Meg described earlier, Instant Ink delivered a superior experience at better value for our customers with economics that make sense for HP. With Instant Ink planned to be available on all WiFi-enabled inkjet printers and some, we expect this trend to continue to gain traction to drive improved consumer sales overall.
Turning to the Enterprise Group. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency with strength in ISS, storage and networking. Profitability remains solid at 13%, down 1 point year-over-year, primarily due to the strength of Industry Standard Servers and currency. 
Industry Standard Servers revenue grew 8% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency with strong sales execution and continued product innovation. Margins were somewhat pressured as good option attach was offset by currency and the strength in density optimized servers. Going forward, we are well positioned to finish the year strong, given backlog levels and the continued market momentum. 
Business Critical Systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency. We continue to develop our mission-critical portfolio to address customers' most critical workloads and are seeing positive momentum with new x86 platforms like Superdome  and X.
Storage has a strong quarter with revenue down 2% or up 7% in constant currency. 18% year-over-year constant currency growth drove Converged Storage past the inflection point, and it now makes up more than 50% of the storage portfolio.
3PAR plus XP plus EVA grew 13% in constant currency. All-flash 3PAR revenue continued to drive the mid-range and led growth in the converged portfolio. Overall, we gained share again in external disk drive market and expect storage to be a growth driver in constant currency in Q4.
Networking also had a good quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year or 28% in constant currency. When adjusted for Aruba, networking reported revenue was down slightly year-over-year, but up mid-single digits in constant currency. Our focus on execution is showing up in improved performance across all regions. And the integration of Aruba is driving pipeline growth through cross-selling of cross-campus wireless solutions, which we expect to continue to drive sales for a strong Q4.
Technology Services declined 9% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency, although support orders were up year-over-year in constant currency again this quarter and profitability remained good. We are seeing continued adoption of our new portfolio, including Datacenter Care and Proactive Care, and expect TS to continue to stabilize with improving hardware sales.
Enterprise Services continued to improve their performance this quarter. Revenue showed progress, declining 11% year-over-year but only 3% in constant currency. We continued to transform our account base in our portfolio. As a result, excluding the top 3 key account runoff, revenue grew year-over-year in constant currency, and strategic Enterprise Services revenue grew double digits.  Signings were strong in this quarter with overall year-over-year growth driven by strength in both SCS and new logos, with win rates for each up double digits year-over-year.  Profitability also improved with Q3 operating profit reaching 6%, up 1.9 points year-over-year. The team continued to execute productivity improvements in excess of key account runoff and contractual pricing concessions.
Looking forward, with the progress we've made on cost improvement as well as normal quarterly seasonality, we are confident in our full year operating profit outlook of 4% to 6%. As mentioned on the Q2 earnings call, we see further opportunities to take costs out of this business and are working on detailed plans which we intend to share at on our security analysts meeting on September 15.  On revenue for fiscal '15, this quarter was a good proof point in our ability to exit the year down 4% to 6% in constant currency. 
Software revenue declined 6% year-over-year or 1% in constant currency as growth in security was offset by declines in IT management and big data. The team continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, reducing operating expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. However, top line currency pressure drove an operating profit margin of 20.6%, down 0.6 points year-over-year. Overall in Q4, we expect continued pressure in the top line as we evolve our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. 
HP Financial Services revenue declined 6% year-over-year as reported, but grew 3% in constant currency. Financing volume was down 2% nominally, but up 7% year-over-year in constant currency, and return on equity was 15.3%. HP Financial Services continue to be a key differentiator for HP and central to our strategy, providing our customers with the flexible pricing models they need to move to the New Style of IT.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $1.67 billion, down 54% year-over-year, primarily due to strong working capital improvement in the prior year period. Free cash flow was $856 million, in line with our expectations. In Q4, we expect larger cash outflows associated with the separation, primarily due to incremental taxes. However, we also expect other assets and liabilities to be a significant source of cash. Therefore, we are holding our free cash flow outlook for the year at $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
Our Q3 cash conversion cycle was 4 days, flat sequentially. This was broadly in line with normal sequential seasonality, except for day sales outstanding, which were impacted by unfavorable sales linearity. The year-over-year reduction was driven by a 7-day improvement in DPO, a day better in DSO, partially offset by a 4-day increase in DOI. As discussed, inventory was elevated late in the quarter due to business continuity planning associated with the internal systems separation date of August 1.
in the quarter, we repurchased $352 million of shares and paid $318 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $670 million. We will return significantly more than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year, even with the adjustment in Q1 for the shortfall last year.
Turning to the separation. As Meg discussed, we hit a number of key milestones and remain on track to officially separate on November 1. Q3 charges associated with the separation were $401 million. The total multiyear separation cash expenses are expected to be in line with the original forecast we provided on the Q1 earnings call.
On August 10, we filed our first amendment to the Form 10. The most significant new disclosure in the filing was the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise capital structure. As stated in the separation announcement, our goal is to split the debt and cash balances such that each company will achieve an investment grade rating. And based on the announcements made by the credit rating agencies to date, we are pleased that this is the outcome.
As part of the usual process for the Form 10, you can expect additional amendments to be filed until the Form 10 is declared effective close to the separation date. And as a reminder, we will be holding a security analyst meeting on September 15 to share more details about each company, including the FY '16 financial outlook.
Turning to our outlook. For fiscal '15, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is $3.59 to $3.65. GAAP outlook for the full year is $1.87 to $1.93. This excludes a likely onetime noncash benefit in Q4 from certain changes to our legal structure that we expect to complete in connection with the separation.
As we separate entities, we are evaluating existing and previously-reserved-against deferred tax assets. The details of these changes are being finalized, but they may result in an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately $1 billion to $1.6 billion.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

So let me address the last question first and tell you that the improvement in the cash conversion cycle over the last couple of years has been broad-based. It has not just been the PC group. There have been improvements in PCs, there's been improvement in IPG, and there've been improvement in EG. And so I don't think it's really skewed one direction. In terms of your question around the cash flow in Q4, let's start with the fact that in Q3, the free cash flow of $856 million was in line with our expectations. And so we believe we are on track to do the $3.5 billion to $4 billion in free cash flow for the year. Q4 is typically, as I'm sure you're aware, seasonally our stronger quarter from an earnings perspective and a cash flow perspective, but we do have some inflows and outflows that maybe are a little less typical. First, we've got the increase in separation costs, which are really driven by the incremental taxes that we need to pay as we're separating legal entities around the world. And then if you look at -- in my prepared remarks, I talked about business continuity planning, and it had 2 impacts. One, it -- we basically put more into the channel, so our channel inventory levels are a bit higher. But that was done late in the quarter, so that drove DSO to be a bit higher because of the unfavorable sales linearity. That, of course, will turn around a bit. We also put -- have more inventory as a result of derisking the IT cutover, and that was largely offset by DPO. And so you can look at that as kind of a wash. But we would expect that accounts receivable now would get collected earlier in Q4, and therefore, would be a nice tailwind for us. And then finally, probably the biggest impact is really in other assets and other liabilities. As we talked about at the end of I think Q1 and Q2, we had a very significant use of cash and other assets and other liabilities. And we talked about the fact that over the course of the year, a significant portion of that would reverse, that it was really timing. We saw a little bit of that in Q3, and we expect a pretty significant source of cash from other assets and other liabilities in Q4 that then supports our outlook for free cash flow of $3.5 billion to $4 billion for the year in total."

So overall, we thought that EG performance for the third quarter was pretty good too. On the revenue front, to Cathie's earlier comments, revenue was up 15% on local currency in ISS. We were up 7% in storage on a local currency. Meg alluded to the progress on 3PAR and all-flash. And networking excluding Aruba was up low single digits as well. So from a revenue perspective, we felt very good about that. To your point, there was a margin pressure. And when you look at it year-over-year, the increased volumes and ISS definitely put some pressure on the margin front, given that the margins in ISS are lower than storage and networking and that was primarily driven by Tier 1. And then foreign exchange obviously played an impact on that. When you look at it quarter-over-quarter, OpEx was up a little bit quarter-over-quarter as we continue to invest in R&D and our sales motion. And on the ISS front, there's some increased pricing pressure particularly in China. So that's what drove the delta there."

So I think we've got the right innovation engine. We've also refined our go to market over a longer period of time. And part of the challenge we had prior to me was the fact that we changed our go to market many times. Every CEO has a different idea how to go to market. We just locked on one and we're driving it. There might be things we can do to optimize, but we've got a strategy and we're driving it. And I think that's given the sales force and customers a lot of confidence, and we've all been out with a lot of customers. The first couple of years was sort of more internally focused. We've been out with customers. I would say our customer and partner confidence is at an all-time high. So in the backlog, by the way, going into fourth quarter is the highest backlog I had since I've been in the company. So all signs are good, but we may be in constant alert that this market changes at a drop of a hat. We have currency , we have some other problem, so it can dissipate, but we're feeling really good about the server business and frankly EG overall.

Our Japanese competitors get the weakness of the yen and that kind of war chest across their entire print portfolio. So competitive pricing has to be driven basically ASP declines, very material ASP declines both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially. So that has increased in oppressiveness. That's partially offset this quarter in the fact that the supplies mix is at roughly 68%, up 2 points on a year-over-year basis. We had good strength. We've got growth in graphics and have profitability in graphics. We also had a favorable mix impact because we have less home units in the ink space.

So when I break that down, , and I think about sort of commercial and consumer, there's some parts of consumer market that are not terribly interesting, empty-calorie business, and we're not terribly interested in pricing units there. But we've been doing pretty well in the premium segment, where we've been taking share in the higher priced segments, and we segment the market fairly significantly. We did anticipate a challenging operating system transition on Windows 10 on 2 dimensions. One is the free upgrade that was of course offered. And the second was the very short transition time, which is normally about 3 months, which was compressed to under 1 month. And what that drove was fairly high Windows 8 channel inventory levels, and that will take a little bit of time to flush. I guess the good news is that the Windows 10 feedback is pretty good, and a great operating system is important for the ecosystem and the industry. So once Window 8 flushes, which may take a little time here in the industry, we should see some stimulation from Windows 10. Commercial, of course, is a little simpler to understand. The compares are tough. This was the peak last year of the Windows XP transition. But that drives higher profitable units for us, and we clearly focus on that."

Just curious as we think about the separate entities, how the company thinks about the Technology Services piece, particularly as it relates to the fact that you've talked about positive growth on the orders side.

And part of what you're seeing in as reported revenues is the currency issue. But frankly as you saw our enterprise gross revenues decline in '12, '13 and '14, that has a knock-on effect with technology services attach. The other problem is there was very high technology services attach to our Business Critical Systems, for one. So we are recovering from that. What I have to say is the team, led by Antonio when he ran Technology Services, is he had done a remarkable job integrating new parts products like Proactive Care, Datacenter Care that are actually filling the vacuum that was left by and downward decline in enterprise growth hardware revenues. So you're now soon, just like in storage, you're going to see a shift to actually as reported growth in Technology Services because the new products are kicking in. attach rate is at very good level, we have hardware growing again. So we feel pretty good about the underlying fundamental architecture with Enterprise Group. And Technology Services has not only great financial characteristics virtually every customer needs to attach technology services. So they have that ability to service hardware in their data center real time with the biggest footprint of services of individuals around the world."

We see notebooks being stronger than desktops. We see opportunity in commercial mobility, in accessories, in services. And the market to me at the moment reminds me a little bit of the market in 2013. And it really requires a highly disciplined approach to market segmentation, cost optimization, leveraging the 160,000 channel partners that we have around the globe that do an amazing job of adding value to our customer set and continuing to drive our innovation agenda. We remain disciplined about chasing share for share's sake, playing where we choose to play and winning in those segments. And we are in a consolidating market.

With only 2 months left until our separation, I'm pleased with the progress we've made along many fronts. In the third quarter, we once again did what we said we'd do, delivering non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.88, above our previously provided outlook range. We delivered $856 million in free cash flow, in line with our expectations. And we returned $670 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, all while executing with military precision, one of the largest and most complex separations than had ever been undertaken.
By business, we're seeing the benefits of the work we've done over the past several years to strengthen the product strategy and go-to-market execution for the Enterprise Group. Enterprise Group performed very well in Q3, with solid constant currency revenue year-over-year growth across all 3 regions and good momentum in Industry Standard Servers, Storage, Networking and Technology Services support. In Enterprise Services, we're turning the corner in what has been one of the most critical parts of the turnaround. ES significantly improved its sequential revenue trajectory and delivered another quarter of sequential and year-over-year profit improvement.  Software performance was mixed with growth in security and IT management SaaS revenue. 
In Personal Systems and Printing, market declines and competitive pricing pressures have accelerated since May. While Dion and his team are aggressively managing costs and gaining share in key focus areas, we now see a difficult business environment for at least several quarters to come.
Turning to the separation. We achieved a number of significant milestones during the past few months. On July 1, we filed the initial Form 10 for Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the SEC. A tremendous amount of work went into the submission, including building 3 years of audited financials for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Earlier this month, we filed the first amendment to the Form 10, which included the pro forma cash and debt levels for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Cathie will talk more about the details of the Form 10 in a minute.
On August 1, we successfully split the operations and IT systems for the company. This was an incredibly complex process, and the team executed very well. This separation required working directly with more than 3,500 customers and partners to prepare for the cutover. We successfully separated nearly 750 systems, affecting 95% of our business with no issues. After shutting down for just 3 days to transition, critical operational systems across our business segments are now live globally. Customer orders are flowing through manufacturing, and shipments are in transit across our entire supply chain network. This was a huge accomplishment.
Finally, just last week, we introduced the expected members of the Board of Directors for both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. We handpicked both boards to create the most experienced global-minded members we could find to help each company win in their unique markets. We're very proud of the diversity of these 2 boards and what it says about the importance we place on having people representative of our customer base participate in our decision-making.
Turning to our performance in the quarter. Even with the separation process heating up, we remained focused and continued to execute well across the businesses. However, we did face a challenging macroeconomic and IT spending environment in the third quarter, with soft consumer spending, continued weakness in Russia and China and stock market volatility driving uncertainty. Currency continued to significantly impact our reported revenue. 
Third quarter revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% as reported but down only 2% in constant currency. By business, the momentum in Enterprise Group continued. Constant currency revenue growth was strong, both with and without the impact from the first quarter of Aruba Networks' contribution.
In Industry Standard Servers, a strong market, combined with our Gen9 portfolio transition, supported 15% revenue growth in constant currency. We've turned the corner in storage with our newer Converged Storage portfolio now representing more than 50% of the mix. We delivered 7% growth in storage overall in constant currency, with incredible 400% growth in all-flash storage, and we expect this will continue to strengthen our share position as a leader in the market. And the significant moves we've made in networking are already beginning to pay off with a 28% year-over-year constant currency growth, driven by strong performance on all regions except China.
Even without Aruba, the business grew mid-single digits in constant currency. The Aruba integration is already driving strong cross-selling opportunities. And with our announcement to partner with Tsinghua University, we delivered sequential improvement in networking -- in our networking business performance in China.
As you know, Enterprise Services is a long lead time business, and in Q3, we clearly saw the results of the work the team has been doing over the past 3 years. Revenue continued to stabilize, down just 3% in constant currency, the best constant currency revenue performance since Q3 FY '12.  Operating profit improved again, up nearly 2 points year-over-year to 6%. The business continued to make progress migrating to strategic Enterprise Services or services for the New Style of IT as evidenced by triple digit year-over-year TCV growth and double-digit growth in revenue.
In Software, we remained focused on aligning our portfolio to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise strategy and driving software-led integrated solutions across EG and ES while addressing the challenges around the market shift to SaaS and internal execution challenges. We saw growth in key pockets of SaaS solutions as well as security with great early results from our recent acquisition of Voltage. This was offset by weaker big data and IT management. The team remained disciplined around cost control and made progress on streamlining the portfolio with the completion of the divestiture of iManage and by moving the marketing optimization business to PPS at the beginning of Q4.
Moving to Personal Systems. As you all know, the market was very soft, down 13% year-over-year in calendar Q2, driving fiscal Q3 revenue down 7% in constant currency. There were a number of factors pressuring the market, which we now expect to continue through Q4 and well into the next fiscal year.
The market remained competitive, and currency was a continued headwind. In commercial, we had a tough compare with the Windows XP refresh cycle. And in consumer, we faced slightly higher channel inventory levels as customers paused purchasing decisions in anticipation of the Windows 10 launch.
Overall, HP remains well positioned in the market. We gained 1 point of share in calendar Q2 and expect consolidation to continue among the top players in this market. We were fast to market with Windows 10, which resulted in strong initial market share, and the early feedback on this operating system has been positive.
Similarly, the overall printing market was very soft, with hardware units down 6% year-over-year in calendar Q2. The key challenge we faced this quarter was an acceleration of hardware average selling price erosion, driven by aggressive pricing by our Japanese competitors. But while our Q3 revenue was down, we are pleased with our share performance with units down just 2%. In laser, we gained over 3 points of share year-over-year, achieving 36.9% of the global market, the highest share in 6 years. We attribute some of the success to the R series launch earlier this year as well as continued momentum in our value multifunction printers, which achieved a new high share of 16.6%.
In ink jet, we continue to see strength in office print with strong growth in Officejet Pro X units. In Instant Ink, our innovative ink subscription service, has very strong momentum, with significant sequential growth in enrollees and customer retention rates well above our expectations. The economics on this delivery model provide our customers with a competitive value proposition that can't be beat. Customers pay for only what they print and never run out, making it by far the most convenient, flexible and affordable print option out there.
As we've said in the past, we are allocating resources to high-growth opportunities, and in Q3, we continued to roll out exciting innovations and win new customers. At HP Discover Las Vegas in June, we announced a strategy for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, focused on delivering solutions to help customers transform four critical areas of their enterprise. These 4 areas comprise helping customers move to a hybrid infrastructure that seamlessly brings together traditional IT in the cloud, protecting the digital enterprise, empowering the data-driven organization and, finally, enabling workplace productivity. Collectively, these 4 areas represent more than $1 trillion in total available market where Hewlett Packard Enterprise is uniquely positioned to win.
Aligned with these focus areas, we announced new partnerships and enhancements to our storage, converged data center infrastructure, cloud and software portfolios. For example, we announced the latest HP 3PAR StoreServ Storage family, including a new class of flash services to accelerate IT as a Service consolidation and hybrid IT initiatives.
Also, at Discover Las Vegas, over 30 customers and partners showcased their success with HP Helion Cloud, providing a strong testament into how far we've come since launching HP Helion just a year earlier. Caterpillar, Del Monte and GE were among the customers that discussed positive business outcomes with HP Helion on stage.
At the event, we also announced HP Helion CloudSystem 9, bringing together our industry-leading private cloud solution with HP Helion OpenStack and the HP Helion Development Platform. CloudSystem 9 provides customers an enterprise-grade open source platform for cloud-native application development and infrastructure. And in July, we acquired Stackato, an enterprise-ready Platform-as-a-Service solution with Cloud Foundry at its core. Stackato gives HP a more complete cloud offering and will enhance the HP Helion Development Platform by enabling customers to bring applications to market faster.
Continuing our commitment to enable increased adoption of the emerging network function virtualization or NFV market, last month, we announced a collaboration with NEC to create more open environments for customers, meeting their desire for faster deployment at a lower cost. HP also acquired ConteXtream, which offers solutions that allow service providers to create a more flexible and programmable networks through NFV. ConteXtream's open SDN Controller platform complements HP's NFV expertise and telecommunications and IT experience and is already deployed at a number of major carrier networks across the globe.
In Enterprise Services, we introduced a full suite of Windows 10 Services that give HP the most comprehensive portfolio of services available for the Microsoft ecosystem. The Enterprise Services team also signed some significant deals in the quarter, including a major deal with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to serve as prime contractor and system integrator for a secure system that will improve its ability to react to humanitarian and defense crises worldwide.
Personal Systems rolled out a new Windows 10 tablet and new ENVY notebooks that combine great battery life in a fitter curved design. We also announced new 3D scanning capability for Sprout by HP, the world's first immersive computer. This will make Sprout the first fully integrated desktop 3D scanning solution for consumers.
So overall, I'm pleased with our progress across many key areas despite a very challenging market backdrop for PCs and print and some of our other businesses. We're executing well, innovating and gaining share in key areas, all while delivering on our separation time line. This is a major accomplishment, and I want to thank all of the HP employees who are making it happen. I also want to thank our customers and partners for their ongoing faith in us. We couldn't be successful without their support.
And now I'll turn it over to Cathie."

Overall, I feel good about our performance in Q3, even amidst market softness in some parts of the portfolio and continued year-over-year headwinds from unfavorable currency. Revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% year-over-year or 2% in consta",2094,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, I feel good about our performance in Q3, even amidst market softness in some parts of the portfolio and continued year-over-year headwinds from unfavorable currency. Revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency, with declines in all regions and particular weakness in EMEA. The 6-point gap between as reported and constant currency revenue performance is wider than prior quarters as the financial hedges are rolling off.
Our gross margin of 23.8% was down 0.2 points year-over-year and 0.2 points sequentially in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 10% year-over-year, with reductions in SG&A primarily due to currency, only partially offset by increased investment in R&D.  Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.6% was up 0.1 point year-over-year and flat sequentially. 
We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.88, above the high end of our outlook range. About $0.02 was a result of incremental channel business we would have otherwise expected to do in Q4 as we derisked our IT separation cutover by making sure the channel had what it needed when our systems were down in early August.
Our non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $401 million for separation, $242 million for amortization of intangible assets and additional noncash charges of $136 million for an Enterprise Services data center impairment and $114 million for a onetime pension adjustment.
GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.47 was below our previously provided outlook range of $0.50 to $0.54, primarily due to the ES data center impairment, which was not considered in our outlook. We are nearing the end of our 2012 restructuring program, and 3,900 people exited in Q3. By the end of Q4, we expect to exceed our prior estimate of 55,000 people to exit the company by up to 5%, but we'll not exceed the forecasted GAAP-only charges.
Turning to the results by business. Personal Systems revenue declined 13% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency, with an 11% decline in units. However, we grew our worldwide market share to 18.9% as the market continued to consolidate. Currency remained a significant headwind for this business, although we managed to offset about half of the ASP impact with price adjustments, mix and the strength in option attach.
Profitability declined 1 point year-over-year to 3%, driven primarily by unfavorable currency net of repricing, partially offset by the strength of the commercial business, commodity cost savings and other operational improvements. Sequentially, the favorable commercial mix offset the net currency headwind, leaving margins flat.
In a tough market, our performance in commercial was solid. Commercial revenue declined 9% year-over-year or down just 2% in constant currency. However, we gained 1 point of share, achieving 22.7% market share and maintained our #1 position worldwide. We saw pockets of strength with growth in commercial notebooks, mobile workstations, commercial services and retail solution.  
Consumer performance was weaker, with Q3 revenue down 22% year-over-year or down 17% in constant currency.  The overall market was highly competitive. However, our overall consumer market share was roughly flat with share gains in key areas, including the premium consumer segment.
Looking forward, while we see continued market headwinds for several quarters to come, we also see opportunity in the market long term with our strength in commercial and Windows 10 as a catalyst for demand especially in consumer.
In Print, revenue declined 9% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. As in prior quarters, the currency impact is somewhat smaller for printing due to the hedges we had in place for this business but has widened about 1 point sequentially as the hedges are rolling off.
While the market was tough overall, we performed better than the market in our areas of focus. We gained 3 points of share in laser hardware overall, achieving our highest ever share in value multifunction printers. While we lost a fraction of a point of share in inkjet, we grew SMB hardware units double digits year-over-year and continued to see very positive momentum in our Instant Ink program. And graphics continue to be a bright spot of profitable growth, with Indigo achieving 57% market share.
We maintained good profitability in Q3 with an operating margin of 17.8%, down 0.6 points from the prior year. Gross margins were pressured by a highly competitive pricing environment, only partially offset by favorable supplies mix of 67.6%. Also, OpEx was down year-over-year, helped by the Snapfish sale. 
Channel inventory for hardware and supplies was above our desired ranges due to expected business continuity planning around the separation as well as softer-than-expected market demand. We expect to reduce channel inventory levels in Q4.
Looking forward, we expect printing headwinds to also continue longer term, particularly the competitive pricing on hardware, but we will continue to focus on stabilizing supplies revenue through strategic placement of high-value hardware units with greater supplies attach. We also plan to increase sales focus on alternative consumption models particularly for consumers. 
For example, as Meg described earlier, Instant Ink delivered a superior experience at better value for our customers with economics that make sense for HP. With Instant Ink planned to be available on all WiFi-enabled inkjet printers this fall we expect this service to continue to gain traction and drive improved consumer sales overall.
Turning to the Enterprise Group. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency with strength in ISS, storage and networking. Profitability remains solid at 13%, down 1 point year-over-year, primarily due to the strength of Industry Standard Servers and currency. 
Industry Standard Servers revenue grew 8% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency with strong sales execution and continued product innovation. Margins were somewhat pressured as good option attach was offset by currency and the strength in density optimized servers. Going forward, we are well positioned to finish the year strong, given backlog levels and the continued market momentum. 
Business Critical Systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency. We continue to develop our mission-critical portfolio to address customers' most critical workloads and are seeing positive momentum with new x86 platforms like Superdome X and NonStop X.
Storage had a strong quarter with revenue down 2% or up 7% in constant currency. 18% year-over-year constant currency growth drove Converged Storage past the inflection point, and it now makes up more than 50% of the storage portfolio.
3PAR plus XP plus EVA grew 13% in constant currency. All-flash 3PAR revenue continued to drive the mid-range and led growth in the converged portfolio. Overall, we gained share again in the external disk drive market and expect storage to be a growth driver in constant currency in Q4.
Networking also had a good quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year or 28% in constant currency. When adjusted for Aruba, networking reported revenue was down slightly year-over-year but up mid-single digits in constant currency. Our focus on execution is showing up in improved performance across all region. And the integration of Aruba is driving pipeline growth through cross-selling across campus wireless solutions, which we expect to continue to drive sales for a strong Q4.
Technology Services declined 9% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency, although support orders were up year-over-year in constant currency again this quarter and profitability remained good. We are seeing continued adoption of our new portfolio, including Datacenter Care and Proactive Care, and expect TS to continue to stabilize with improving hardware sales.
Enterprise Services continued to improve their performance this quarter. Revenue showed progress, declining 11% year-over-year but only 3% in constant currency. We continued to transform our account base in our portfolio. As a result, excluding the top 3 key account runoff, revenue grew year-over-year in constant currency, and strategic Enterprise Services revenue grew double digits.  Signings were strong in this quarter with overall year-over-year growth, driven by strength in both SCS and new logos, with win rates for each up double digits year-over-year.  Profitability also improved, with Q3 operating profit reaching 6%, up 1.9 points year-over-year. The team continued to execute productivity improvements in excess of key account runoff and contractual pricing concessions.
Looking forward, with the progress we've made on cost improvements as well as normal quarterly seasonality, we are confident in our full year operating profit outlook of 4% to 6%. As mentioned on the Q2 earnings call, we see further opportunities to take costs out of this business and are working on the detailed plans which we intend to share at our Security Analyst Meeting on September 15.  On revenue for fiscal '15, this quarter was a good proof point in our ability to exit the year down 4% to 6% in constant currency. 
Software revenue declined 6% year-over-year or 1% in constant currency as growth in security was offset by declines in IT management and big data. The team continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, reducing operating expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. However, top line currency pressure drove an operating profit margin of 20.6%, down 0.6 points year-over-year. Overall, in Q4, we expect continued pressure on the top line as we evolve our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. 
HP Financial Services revenue declined 6% year-over-year as reported but grew 3% in constant currency. Financing volume was down 2% nominally but up 7% year-over-year in constant currency. And return on equity was 15.3%. HP Financial Services continues to be a key differentiator for HP and central to our strategy, providing our customers with the flexible pricing models they need to move to the New Style of IT.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $1.67 billion, down 54% year-over-year, primarily due to strong working capital improvement in the prior year period. Free cash flow was $856 million, in line with our expectations. In Q4, we expect larger cash outflows associated with the separation, primarily due to incremental taxes. However, we also expect other assets and liabilities to be a significant source of cash. Therefore, we are holding our free cash flow outlook for the year at $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
Our Q3 cash conversion cycle was 4 days, flat sequentially. This was broadly in line with normal sequential seasonality, except for day sales outstanding, which were impacted by unfavorable sales linearity. The year-over-year reduction was driven by a 7-day improvement in DPO, a day better than DSO, partially offset by a 4-day increase in DOI. As discussed, inventory was elevated late in the quarter due to business continuity planning associated with the internal systems separation date of August 1.
During the quarter, we repurchased $352 million of shares and paid $318 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $670 million. We will return significantly more than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year, even with the adjustment in Q1 for the shortfall last year.
Turning to the separation. As Meg discussed, we hit a number of key milestones and remain on track to officially separate on November 1. Q3 charges associated with the separation were $401 million. The total multiyear separation cash expenses are expected to be in line with the original forecast we provided on the Q1 earnings call.
On August 10, we filed our first amendment to the Form 10. The most significant new disclosure in the filing was the Hewlett Packard Enterprise capital structure. As stated at the separation announcement, our goal was to split the debt and cash balances such that each company will achieve an investment grade rating. And based on the announcements made by the credit rating agencies to date, we are pleased that this is the outcome.
As part of the usual process for the Form 10, you can expect additional amendments to be filed until Form 10 is declared effective close to the separation date. And as a reminder, we will be holding our Security Analyst Meeting on September 15 to share more details about each company, including the FY '16 financial outlook.
Turning to our outlook. For fiscal '15, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is $3.59 to $3.65. GAAP outlook for the full year is $1.87 to $1.93. This excludes a likely onetime noncash benefit in Q4 from certain changes to our legal structure that we expect to complete in connection with the separation.
As we separate entities, we are evaluating existing and previously reserved against deferred tax assets. The details of these changes are being finalized, but they may result in an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately $1 billion to $1.6 billion.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And then looking into fiscal '16, would it be fair to say that the cash conversion cycle improvements over the last couple of years has largely come from the PC side of the house? And I'm asking that because if you look at Hewlett Packard Enterprise's balance sheet metrics from the Form 10, it would seem you have room for some meaningful improvements when compared to some of your competitors, for example, in your DSO, and I'm just wondering if you've begun the process of identifying those opportunities on the HPE side to improve your cash flow."

So let me address the last question first and tell you that the improvement in the cash conversion cycle over the last couple of years has been broad-based. It has not just been the PC group. There have been improvements in PCs, there's been improvement in IPG and there's been improvement in EG. And so I don't think it's really skewed one direction. In terms of your question around the cash flow in Q4, let's start with the fact that in Q3, the free cash flow of $856 million was in line with our expectations. And so we believe we're on track to do the $3.5 billion to $4 billion in free cash flow for the year. Q4 is typically, as I'm sure you're aware, seasonally our stronger quarter from an earnings perspective and a cash flow perspective, but we do have some inflows and outflows that maybe are a little less typical. First, we've got the increase in separation costs, which are really driven by the incremental taxes that we need to pay as we're separating legal entities around the world. And then if you look at -- in my prepared remarks, I talked about business continuity planning, and it had really 2 impacts. One, it -- we basically put more into the channel, so our channel inventory levels are a bit higher. But that was done late in the quarter, so that drove DSO to be a bit higher because of the unfavorable sales linearity. That, of course, will turn around a bit. We also put -- had more inventory as a result of derisking the IT cutover, and that was largely offset by DPO. So you can look at that as kind of a wash. But we would expect that the accounts receivable now would get collected earlier in Q4 and, therefore, would be a nice tailwind for us. And then finally, probably the biggest impact, is really in other assets and other liabilities. As we talked about at the end of I think Q1 and Q2, we had a very significant use of cash in other assets and other liabilities. And we talked about the fact that over the course of the year, a significant portion of that would reverse, that it was really timing. We saw a little bit of that in Q3, and we expect a pretty significant source of cash from other assets and other liabilities in Q4 that then supports our outlook of free cash flow of $3.5 billion to $4 billion for the year in total."

And then it also takes into consideration the softness that we're seeing in the PC market.

So from a revenue perspective, we felt very good about that. To your point, there was some margin pressure. And when you look at it year-over-year, the increased volumes in ISS definitely put some pressure on the margin front, given that the margins in ISS are lower than storage and networking. And that was primarily driven by Tier 1. And then foreign exchange obviously played an impact in that. When you look at it quarter-over-quarter, OpEx was up a little bit quarter-over-quarter as we continue to invest in R&D and our sales motion. And then on the ISS front, there are some increased pricing pressure particularly in China. So that's what drove the delta there."

We've been out with customers. I would say our customer and partner confidence is at an all-time high. So -- and the backlog, by the way, going into fourth quarter is the highest backlog I've had since I've been at the company. So all signs are good, but we remain on constant alert.

In terms of the other assets and other liabilities, Kulbinder, it isn't any one thing that turns around. It's that the number of items that have -- are just kind of ordinary course of business have been a headwind and that -- I mean, an example is that the accounts -- the vendor receivables. At the end of Q3, our vendor rebate receivables was high. We knew that, that would turn around. That's ordinary course of business that it would turn around because we collect those receivables. And it's those kinds of items across a number of different line items that are turning around just in ordinary course in Q4 in other assets and other liabilities. And as I said, we did see some of that in Q3 as well."

As we talked about, the #1 headwind that helped drive the decline year-over-year was really the competitive pricing environment. And this is a situation where while we get benefit from the weakness in the yen, we get that benefit on our cost structure on a piece of our Printing business. Our Japanese competitors get the weakness of the yen and that kind of war chest across their entire print portfolio. So competitive pricing has really driven basically ASP declines, very material ASP declines both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially. So that has increased in aggressiveness. That's partially offset this quarter in the fact that the supplies mix is at roughly 68%, up 2 points on a year-over-year basis. We had good strength. We got growth in graphics, then we had good profitability in graphics. We also had a favorable mix impact because we have less home units in the ink space. And then like I said, we have the yen weakness as well. What's really important in this business, when you think about margins over the long term, is we've got to have the right cost structure, and then we have continue to place profitable units because that's what's going to drive the long-term success of -- and health of this business. And I don't know, Dion, if you would add anything else there."

The second is our focus on SMB and, in particular, the higher end of SMB with Officejet Pro X, which, of course, has terrific supplies attach associated with it.

We're not chasing share for share's sake, and we're very selective about what are valuable units, what we can attach around. And in a very challenging PC market, that is absolutely the right thing to do. There is some fairly significant headwinds. And so when I break that down, Shannon, and I think about sort of consumer and commercial, there's some parts of the consumer market that are not terribly interesting, empty calorie business. And we're not terribly interested in placing units there. But we've been doing pretty well in the premium segment, where we've been taking share in the higher priced [indiscernible]. And we segment the market and heat map the market fairly significantly. We did anticipate a challenging operating system transition to Windows 10 on 2 dimensions. One was a free upgrade that was, of course, offered. And the second was the very short transition time, which is normally about 3 months, which is compressed to under 1 month. And what that drove was fairly high Windows 8 channel inventory levels, and that will take a little bit of time to flush. I guess the good news is that the Windows 10 feedback is pretty good, and a great operating system is important for the ecosystem and the industry. So once Window 8 flushes, which may take a little time here in the industry, we should see some stimulation from Windows 10. Commercial, of course, is a little simpler to understand. The compares are tough. This was the peak last year of the Windows XP transition. But that drives higher profitable units for us, and we are clearly focused on that."

And part of what you're seeing in as reported revenues is the currency issue. But frankly, as you saw our Enterprise Group revenues decline in '12, '13 and '14, that has a knock-on effect with Technology Services attach. The other problem is there was very high technology services attach to our Business Critical Systems, Itanium for one. So we are recovering from that. What I have to say is the team, led by Antonio Neri when he ran Technology Services, is he has done a remarkable job in creating products, like Proactive Care, Datacenter Care, that are actually filling the vacuum that was left by Itanium and a downward decline in Enterprise Group hardware revenues. So you're now, pretty soon, just like in storage, you're going to see a shift now to actually as reported growth in Technology Services because the new products are kicking in, the attach rate is at very good levels and now we have hardware growing again. So we feel pretty good about the underlying financial architecture associated with Enterprise Group. And Technology Services has not only great financial characteristics, virtually, every customer needs to attach technology services, so they have that ability to service their hardware in their data center real time with the biggest footprint of services individuals around the world."

We see opportunity in commercial mobility, in accessories, in services. And the market to me at the moment reminds me a little bit of the market in 2013. And it really requires a highly disciplined approach to market segmentation, cost optimization, leveraging the 160,000 channel partners that we have around the globe that do an amazing job of adding value to our customer set and continuing to drive our innovation agenda.

With only 2 months left until our separation, I'm pleased with the progress we've made along many fronts. In the third quarter, we once again did what we said we'd do, delivering non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.88, above our previously provided outlook range. We delivered $856 million in free cash flow, in line with our expectations. And we returned $670 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, all while executing with military precision, one of the largest and most complex separations than had ever been undertaken.
By business, we're seeing the benefits of the work we've done over the past several years to strengthen the product strategy and go-to-market execution for the Enterprise Group. Enterprise Group performed very well in Q3, with solid constant currency revenue year-over-year growth across all 3 regions and good momentum in Industry Standard Servers, Storage, Networking and Technology Services support. In Enterprise Services, we're turning the corner in what has been one of the most critical parts of the turnaround. ES significantly improved its sequential revenue trajectory and delivered another quarter of sequential and year-over-year profit improvement. Software performance was mixed with growth in security and IT management SaaS revenue. 
In Personal Systems and Printing, market declines and competitive pricing pressures have accelerated since May. While Dion and his team are aggressively managing costs and gaining share in key focus areas, we now see a difficult business environment for at least several quarters to come.
Turning to the separation. We achieved a number of significant milestones during the past few months. On July 1, we filed the initial Form 10 for Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the SEC. A tremendous amount of work went into the submission, including building 3 years of audited financials for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Earlier this month, we filed the first amendment to the Form 10, which included the pro forma cash and debt levels for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Cathie will talk more about the details of the Form 10 in a minute.
On August 1, we successfully split the operations and IT systems for the company. This was an incredibly complex process, and the team executed very well. This separation required working directly with more than 3,500 customers and partners to prepare for the cutover. We successfully separated nearly 750 systems, affecting 95% of our business with no issues. After shutting down for just 3 days to transition, critical operational systems across our business segments are now live globally. Customer orders are flowing through manufacturing, and shipments are in transit across our entire supply chain network. This was a huge accomplishment.
Finally, just last week, we introduced the expected members of the Board of Directors for both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. We handpicked both boards to create the most experienced global-minded members we could find to help each company win in their unique markets. We're very proud of the diversity of these 2 boards and what it says about the importance we place on having people representative of our customer base participate in our decision-making.
Turning to our performance in the quarter. Even with the separation process heating up, we remained focused and continued to execute well across the businesses. However, we did face a challenging macroeconomic and IT spending environment in the third quarter, with soft consumer spending, continued weakness in Russia and China and stock market volatility driving uncertainty. Currency continued to significantly impact our reported revenue. 
Third quarter revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% as reported but down only 2% in constant currency. By business, the momentum in Enterprise Group continued. Constant currency revenue growth was strong, both with and without the impact from the first quarter of Aruba Networks' contribution.
In Industry Standard Servers, a strong market, combined with our Gen9 portfolio transition, supported 15% revenue growth in constant currency. We've turned the corner in storage with our newer Converged Storage portfolio now representing more than 50% of the mix. We delivered 7% growth in storage overall in constant currency, with incredible 400% growth in all-flash storage, and we expect this will continue to strengthen our share position as a leader in the market. And the significant moves we've made in networking are already beginning to pay off with a 28% year-over-year constant currency growth, driven by strong performance on all regions except China.
Even without Aruba, the business grew mid-single digits in constant currency. The Aruba integration is already driving strong cross-selling opportunities. And with our announcement to partner with Tsinghua University, we delivered sequential improvement in networking -- in our networking business performance in China.
As you know, Enterprise Services is a long lead time business, and in Q3, we clearly saw the results of the work the team has been doing over the past 3 years. Revenue continued to stabilize, down just 3% in constant currency, the best constant currency revenue performance since Q3 FY '12. Operating profit improved again, up nearly 2 points year-over-year to 6%. The business continued to make progress migrating to strategic Enterprise Services or services for the New Style of IT as evidenced by triple digit year-over-year TCV growth and double-digit growth in revenue.
In Software, we remained focused on aligning our portfolio to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise strategy and driving software-led integrated solutions across EG and ES while addressing the challenges around the market shift to SaaS and internal execution challenges. We saw growth in key pockets of SaaS solutions as well as security with great early results from our recent acquisition of Voltage. This was offset by weaker Big Data and IT management. The team remained disciplined around cost control and made progress on streamlining the portfolio with the completion of the divestiture of iManage and by moving the marketing optimization business to PPS at the beginning of Q4.
Moving to Personal Systems. As you all know, the market was very soft, down 13% year-over-year in calendar Q2, driving fiscal Q3 revenue down 7% in constant currency. There were a number of factors pressuring the market, which we now expect to continue through Q4 and well into the next fiscal year.
The market remained competitive, and currency was a continued headwind. In commercial, we had a tough compare with the Windows XP refresh cycle. And in consumer, we faced slightly higher channel inventory levels as customers paused purchasing decisions in anticipation of the Windows 10 launch.
Overall, HP remains well positioned in the market. We gained 1 point of share in calendar Q2 and expect consolidation to continue among the top players in this market. We were fast to market with Windows 10, which resulted in strong initial market share, and the early feedback on this operating system has been positive.
Similarly, the overall printing market was very soft, with hardware units down 6% year-over-year in calendar Q2. The key challenge we faced this quarter was an acceleration of hardware average selling price erosion, driven by aggressive pricing by our Japanese competitors. But while our Q3 revenue was down, we are pleased with our share performance with units down just 2%. In laser, we gained over 3 points of share year-over-year, achieving 36.9% of the global market, the highest share in 6 years. We attribute some of the success to the R series launch earlier this year as well as continued momentum in our value multifunction printers, which achieved a new high share of 16.6%.
In ink jet, we continue to see strength in office print with strong growth in Officejet Pro X units. And Instant Ink, our innovative ink subscription service, has very strong momentum, with significant sequential growth in enrollees and customer retention rates well above our expectations. The economics on this delivery model provide our customers with a competitive value proposition that can't be beat. Customers pay for only what they print and never run out, making it by far the most convenient, flexible and affordable print option out there.
As we've said in the past, we are allocating resources to high-growth opportunities, and in Q3, we continued to roll out exciting innovations and win new customers. At HP Discover Las Vegas in June, we announced a strategy for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, focused on delivering solutions to help customers transform 4 critical areas of their enterprise. These 4 areas comprise helping customers move to a hybrid infrastructure that seamlessly brings together traditional IT in the cloud, protecting the digital enterprise, empowering the data-driven organization and, finally, enabling workplace productivity. Collectively, these 4 areas represent more than $1 trillion in total available market where Hewlett Packard Enterprise is uniquely positioned to win.
Aligned with these focus areas, we announced new partnerships and enhancements to our storage, converged data center infrastructure, cloud and software portfolios. For example, we announced the latest HP 3PAR StoreServ Storage family, including a new class of flash services to accelerate IT as a Service consolidation and hybrid IT initiatives.
Also, at Discover Las Vegas, over 30 customers and partners showcased their success with HP Helion Cloud, providing a strong testament into how far we've come since launching HP Helion just a year earlier. Caterpillar, Del Monte and GE were among the customers that discussed positive business outcomes with HP Helion on stage.
At the event, we also announced HP Helion CloudSystem 9, bringing together our industry-leading private cloud solution with HP Helion OpenStack and the HP Helion Development Platform. CloudSystem 9 provides customers an enterprise-grade open source platform for cloud-native application development and infrastructure. And in July, we acquired Stackato, an enterprise-ready Platform-as-a-Service solution with Cloud Foundry at its core. Stackato gives HP a more complete cloud offering and will enhance the HP Helion Development Platform by enabling customers to bring applications to market faster.
Continuing our commitment to enable increased adoption of the emerging network function virtualization or NFV market, last month, we announced a collaboration with NEC to create more open environments for customers, meeting their desire for faster deployment at a lower cost. HP also acquired ConteXtream, which offers solutions that allow service providers to create a more flexible and programmable networks through NFV. ConteXtream's open SDN Controller platform complements HP's NFV expertise and telecommunications and IT experience and is already deployed at a number of major carrier networks across the globe.
In Enterprise Services, we introduced a full suite of Windows 10 Services that give HP the most comprehensive portfolio of services available for the Microsoft ecosystem. The Enterprise Services team also signed some significant deals in the quarter, including a major deal with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to serve as prime contractor and system integrator for a secure system that will improve its ability to react to humanitarian and defense crises worldwide.
Personal Systems rolled out a new Windows 10 tablet and new ENVY notebooks that combine great battery life in a thinner, curved design. We also announced new 3D scanning capability for Sprout by HP, the world's first immersive computer. This will make Sprout the first fully integrated desktop 3D scanning solution for consumers.
So overall, I'm pleased with our progress across many key areas despite a very challenging market backdrop for PCs and print and some of our other businesses. We're executing well, innovating and gaining share in key areas, all while delivering on our separation time line. This is a major accomplishment, and I want to thank all of the HP employees who are making it happen. I also want to thank our customers and partners for their ongoing faith in us. We couldn't be successful without their support.
And now I'll turn it over to Cathie."

Overall, I feel good about our performance in Q3, even amidst market softness in some parts of the portfolio and continued year-over-year headwinds from unfavorable currency. Revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% year-over-year or 2% in consta",2094,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, I feel good about our performance in Q3, even amidst market softness in some parts of the portfolio and continued year-over-year headwinds from unfavorable currency. Revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency, with declines in all regions and particular weakness in EMEA. The 6-point gap between as reported and constant currency revenue performance is wider than prior quarters as the financial hedges are rolling off.
Our gross margin of 23.8% was down 0.2 points year-over-year and 0.2 points sequentially in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 10% year-over-year, with reductions in SG&A primarily due to currency, only partially offset by increased investment in R&D. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.6% was up 0.1 point year-over-year and flat sequentially. 
We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.88, above the high end of our outlook range. About $0.02 was a result of incremental channel business we would have otherwise expected to do in Q4 as we derisked our IT separation cutover by making sure the channel had what it needed when our systems were down in early August.
Our non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $401 million for separation, $242 million for amortization of intangible assets and additional noncash charges of $136 million for an Enterprise Services data center impairment and $114 million for a onetime pension adjustment.
GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.47 was below our previously provided outlook range of $0.50 to $0.54, primarily due to the ES data center impairment, which was not considered in our outlook. We are nearing the end of our 2012 restructuring program, and 3,900 people exited in Q3. By the end of Q4, we expect to exceed our prior estimate of 55,000 people to exit the company by up to 5%, but we'll not exceed the forecasted GAAP-only charges.
Turning to the results by business. Personal Systems revenue declined 13% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency, with an 11% decline in units. However, we grew our worldwide market share to 18.9% as the market continued to consolidate. Currency remained a significant headwind for this business, although we managed to offset about half of the ASP impact with price adjustments, mix and the strength in option attach.
Profitability declined 1 point year-over-year to 3%, driven primarily by unfavorable currency net of repricing, partially offset by the strength of the commercial business, commodity cost savings and other operational improvements. Sequentially, the favorable commercial mix offset the net currency headwind, leaving margins flat.
In a tough market, our performance in commercial was solid. Commercial revenue declined 9% year-over-year or down just 2% in constant currency. However, we gained 1 point of share, achieving 22.7% market share and maintained our #1 position worldwide. We saw pockets of strength with growth in commercial notebooks, mobile workstations, commercial services and retail solution. 
Consumer performance was weaker, with Q3 revenue down 22% year-over-year or down 17% in constant currency. The overall market was highly competitive. However, our overall consumer market share was roughly flat with share gains in key areas, including the premium consumer segment.
Looking forward, while we see continued market headwinds for several quarters to come, we also see opportunity in the market long term with our strength in commercial and Windows 10 as a catalyst for demand especially in consumer.
In Print, revenue declined 9% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. As in prior quarters, the currency impact is somewhat smaller for printing due to the hedges we had in place for this business but has widened about 1 point sequentially as the hedges are rolling off.
While the market was tough overall, we performed better than the market in our areas of focus. We gained 3 points of share in laser hardware overall, achieving our highest ever share in value multifunction printers. While we lost a fraction of a point of share in inkjet, we grew SMB hardware units double digits year-over-year and continued to see very positive momentum in our Instant Ink program. And graphics continue to be a bright spot of profitable growth, with Indigo achieving 57% market share.
We maintained good profitability in Q3 with an operating margin of 17.8%, down 0.6 points from the prior year. Gross margins were pressured by a highly competitive pricing environment, only partially offset by favorable supplies mix of 67.6%. Also, OpEx was down year-over-year, helped by the Snapfish sale. 
Channel inventory for hardware and supplies was above our desired ranges due to expected business continuity planning around the separation as well as softer-than-expected market demand. We expect to reduce channel inventory levels in Q4.
Looking forward, we expect printing headwinds to also continue longer term, particularly the competitive pricing on hardware, but we will continue to focus on stabilizing supplies revenue through strategic placement of high-value hardware units with greater supplies attach. We also plan to increase sales focus on alternative consumption models particularly for consumers. 
For example, as Meg described earlier, Instant Ink delivers a superior experience at better value for our customers with economics that make sense for HP. With Instant Ink planned to be available on all WiFi-enabled inkjet printers this fall we expect this service to continue to gain traction and drive improved consumer sales overall.
Turning to the Enterprise Group. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency with strength in ISS, storage and networking. Profitability remains solid at 13%, down 1 point year-over-year, primarily due to the strength of Industry Standard Servers and currency. 
Industry Standard Servers revenue grew 8% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency with strong sales execution and continued product innovation. Margins were somewhat pressured as good option attach was offset by currency and the strength in density optimized servers. Going forward, we are well positioned to finish the year strong, given backlog levels and the continued market momentum. 
Business Critical Systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency. We continue to develop our mission-critical portfolio to address customers' most critical workloads and are seeing positive momentum with new x86 platforms like Superdome X and NonStop X.
Storage had a strong quarter with revenue down 2% or up 7% in constant currency. 18% year-over-year constant currency growth drove Converged Storage past the inflection point, and it now makes up more than 50% of the storage portfolio.
3PAR plus XP plus EVA grew 13% in constant currency. All-flash 3PAR revenue continued to drive the mid-range and led growth in the converged portfolio. Overall, we gained share again in the external disk drive market and expect storage to be a growth driver in constant currency in Q4.
Networking also had a good quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year or 28% in constant currency. When adjusted for Aruba, networking reported revenue was down slightly year-over-year but up mid-single digits in constant currency. Our focus on execution is showing up in improved performance across all regions. And the integration of Aruba is driving pipeline growth through cross-selling across campus wireless solutions, which we expect to continue to drive sales for a strong Q4.
Technology Services declined 9% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency, although support orders were up year-over-year in constant currency again this quarter and profitability remained good. We are seeing continued adoption of our new portfolio, including Datacenter Care and Proactive Care, and expect TS to continue to stabilize with improving hardware sales.
Enterprise Services continued to improve their performance this quarter. Revenue showed progress, declining 11% year-over-year but only 3% in constant currency. We continued to transform our account base in our portfolio. As a result, excluding the top 3 key account runoff, revenue grew year-over-year in constant currency, and strategic Enterprise Services revenue grew double digits. Signings were strong in this quarter with overall year-over-year growth, driven by strength in both SCS and new logos, with win rates for each up double digits year-over-year. Profitability also improved, with Q3 operating profit reaching 6%, up 1.9 points year-over-year. The team continued to execute productivity improvements in excess of key account runoff and contractual pricing concessions.
Looking forward, with the progress we've made on cost improvements as well as normal quarterly seasonality, we are confident in our full year operating profit outlook of 4% to 6%. As mentioned on the Q2 earnings call, we see further opportunities to take costs out of this business and are working on the detailed plans which we intend to share at our Security Analyst Meeting on September 15. On revenue for fiscal '15, this quarter was a good proof point in our ability to exit the year down 4% to 6% in constant currency. 
Software revenue declined 6% year-over-year or 1% in constant currency as growth in security was offset by declines in IT management and Big Data. The team continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, reducing operating expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. However, top line currency pressure drove an operating profit margin of 20.6%, down 0.6 points year-over-year. Overall, in Q4, we expect continued pressure on the top line as we evolve our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. 
HP Financial Services revenue declined 6% year-over-year as reported but grew 3% in constant currency. Financing volume was down 2% nominally but up 7% year-over-year in constant currency. And return on equity was 15.3%. HP Financial Services continues to be a key differentiator for HP and central to our strategy, providing our customers with the flexible pricing models they need to move to the New Style of IT.
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $1.67 billion, down 54% year-over-year, primarily due to strong working capital improvement in the prior year period. Free cash flow was $856 million, in line with our expectations. In Q4, we expect larger cash outflows associated with the separation, primarily due to incremental taxes. However, we also expect other assets and liabilities to be a significant source of cash. Therefore, we are holding our free cash flow outlook for the year at $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
Our Q3 cash conversion cycle was 4 days, flat sequentially. This was broadly in line with normal sequential seasonality, except for day sales outstanding, which were impacted by unfavorable sales linearity. The year-over-year reduction was driven by a 7-day improvement in DPO, a day better than DSO, partially offset by a 4-day increase in DOI. As discussed, inventory was elevated late in the quarter due to business continuity planning associated with the internal systems separation date of August 1.
During the quarter, we repurchased $352 million of shares and paid $318 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $670 million. We will return significantly more than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year, even with the adjustment in Q1 for the shortfall last year.
Turning to the separation. As Meg discussed, we hit a number of key milestones and remain on track to officially separate on November 1. Q3 charges associated with the separation were $401 million. The total multiyear separation cash expenses are expected to be in line with the original forecast we provided on the Q1 earnings call.
On August 10, we filed our first amendment to the Form 10. The most significant new disclosure in the filing was the Hewlett Packard Enterprise capital structure. As stated at the separation announcement, our goal was to split the debt and cash balances such that each company will achieve an investment grade rating. And based on the announcements made by the credit rating agencies to date, we are pleased that this is the outcome.
As part of the usual process for the Form 10, you can expect additional amendments to be filed until Form 10 is declared effective close to the separation date. And as a reminder, we will be holding our Security Analyst Meeting on September 15 to share more details about each company, including the FY '16 financial outlook.
Turning to our outlook. For fiscal '15, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is $3.59 to $3.65. GAAP outlook for the full year is $1.87 to $1.93. This excludes a likely onetime noncash benefit in Q4 from certain changes to our legal structure that we expect to complete in connection with the separation.
As we separate entities, we are evaluating existing and previously reserved against deferred tax assets. The details of these changes are being finalized, but they may result in an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately $1 billion to $1.6 billion.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Because you'll need to generate about $2 billion to $2.5 billion to reach your full year target. And then looking into fiscal '16, would it be fair to say that the cash conversion cycle improvements over the last couple of years has largely come from the PC side of the house? And I'm asking that because if you look at Hewlett Packard Enterprise's balance sheet metrics from the Form 10, it would seem you have room for some meaningful improvements when compared to some of your competitors, for example, in your DSO, and I'm just wondering if you've begun the process of identifying those opportunities on the HPE side to improve your cash flow."

So let me address the last question first and tell you that the improvement in the cash conversion cycle over the last couple of years has been broad-based. It has not just been the PC group. There have been improvements in PCs, there's been improvement in IPG and there's been improvement in EG. And so I don't think it's really skewed one direction. In terms of your question around the cash flow in Q4, let's start with the fact that in Q3, the free cash flow of $856 million was in line with our expectations. And so we believe we're on track to do the $3.5 billion to $4 billion in free cash flow for the year. Q4 is typically, as I'm sure you're aware, seasonally our stronger quarter from an earnings perspective and a cash flow perspective, but we do have some inflows and outflows that maybe are a little less typical. First, we've got the increase in separation costs, which are really driven by the incremental taxes that we need to pay as we're separating legal entities around the world. And then if you look at -- in my prepared remarks, I talked about business continuity planning, and it had really 2 impacts. One, it -- we basically put more into the channel, so our channel inventory levels are a bit higher. But that was done late in the quarter, so that drove DSO to be a bit higher because of the unfavorable sales linearity. That, of course, will turn around a bit. We also put -- had more inventory as a result of derisking the IT cutover, and that was largely offset by DPO. So you can look at that as kind of a wash. But we would expect that the accounts receivable now would get collected earlier in Q4 and, therefore, would be a nice tailwind for us. And then finally, probably the biggest impact, is really in other assets and other liabilities. As we talked about at the end of I think Q1 and Q2, we had a very significant use of cash in other assets and other liabilities. And we talked about the fact that over the course of the year, a significant portion of that would reverse, that it was really timing. We saw a little bit of that in Q3, and we expect a pretty significant source of cash from other assets and other liabilities in Q4 that then supports our outlook of free cash flow of $3.5 billion to $4 billion for the year in total."

We are going to bring channel inventory levels back down. It reflects the currency headwinds that we're getting both because of hedges that are coming off and just the currency headwind -- the indirect currency headwind of a very competitive pricing environment in IPG as our Japanese competitors take their -- the weak yen against both the euro and the dollar and really price aggressively. And then it also takes into consideration the softness that we're seeing in the PC market. And in terms of the year, just to make sure everyone's clear on this, we did narrow our range to $3.59 to $3.65, just because, of course, we just have 1 quarter left in the year."

So from a revenue perspective, we felt very good about that. To your point, there was some margin pressure. And when you look at it year-over-year, the increased volumes in ISS definitely put some pressure on the margin front, given that the margins in ISS are lower than storage and networking. And that was primarily driven by Tier 1. And then foreign exchange obviously played an impact in that. When you look at it quarter-over-quarter, OpEx was up a little bit quarter-over-quarter as we continue to invest in R&D and our sales motion. And then on the ISS front, there are some increased pricing pressure particularly in China. So that's what drove the delta there."

And we've had -- those hedges are running off.

So in essence, the restructuring charges that are at the corporate level, that are fundamentally restructuring the cost base by getting the labor pyramid right and the offshore mix correct, will be done.

Gen9 is definitely a winner. Our HP Apollo high-performance compute line is fantastic. We're back in the game and even some of the more basic rack and tower. And then, of course, our cloud line offering, density optimized servers for Tier 1, Tier 2 service providers with Foxconn, is totally the right thing to do, and we make money in that business. So I think we've got the right innovation engine. We've also refined our go-to-market over a longer period of time. And part of the challenge we had prior to me was the fact that we changed our go-to-market so many times. Every CEO had a different idea about how to go to market. We've just locked on one and we're driving it. There might be things we can do to optimize it, but we've got a strategy and we're driving it. And I think that's given the sales force and customers a lot of confidence. And we've all been out with a lot of customers. The first couple of years was sort of more internally focused. We've been out with customers. I would say our customer and partner confidence is at an all-time high. So -- and the backlog, by the way, going into fourth quarter is the highest backlog I've had since I've been at the company. So all signs are good, but we remain on constant alert. This market changes at the drop of a hat. You have a currency shock, you have some other problem and it can dissipate. But we're feeling really very good about the server business and, frankly, EG overall. Even in TS, you saw that orders are positive in a constant currency basis, and that's been that way for a couple of quarters. So we feel really good about that. And as the hardware business grows, there's more to attach to, which gives us that profit associated with TS."

As we talked about, the #1 headwind that helped drive the decline year-over-year was really the competitive pricing environment. And this is a situation where while we get benefit from the weakness in the yen, we get that benefit on our cost structure on a piece of our Printing business. Our Japanese competitors get the weakness of the yen and that kind of war chest across their entire print portfolio. So competitive pricing has really driven basically ASP declines, very material ASP declines both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially. So that has increased in aggressiveness. That's partially offset this quarter in the fact that the supplies mix is at roughly 68%, up 2 points on a year-over-year basis. We had good strength. We've had growth in graphics, then we had good profitability in graphics. We also had a favorable mix impact because we have less home units in the ink space. And then like I said, we have the yen weakness as well. What's really important in this business, when you think about margins over the long term, is we've got to have the right cost structure, and then we have continue to place profitable units because that's what's going to drive the long-term success of -- and health of this business.

And so when I break that down, Shannon, and I think about sort of consumer and commercial, there's some parts of the consumer market that are not terribly interesting, empty calorie business. And we're not terribly interested in placing units there. But we've been doing pretty well in the premium segment, where we've been taking share in the higher priced bands. And we segment the market and heat map the market fairly significantly. We did anticipate a challenging operating system transition to Windows 10 on 2 dimensions: One was a free upgrade that was, of course, offered. And the second was the very short transition time, which is normally about 3 months, which is compressed to under 1 month. And what that drove was fairly high Windows 8 channel inventory levels, and that will take a little bit of time to flush. I guess the good news is that the Windows 10 feedback is pretty good, and a great operating system is important for the ecosystem and the industry. So once Window 8 flushes, which may take a little time here in the industry, we should see some stimulation from Windows 10. Commercial, of course, is a little simpler to understand. The compares are tough. This was the peak last year of the Windows XP transition. But that drives higher profitable units for us, and we are clearly focused on that."

And part of what you're seeing in as reported revenues is the currency issue. But frankly, as you saw our Enterprise Group revenues decline in '12, '13 and '14, that has a knock-on effect with Technology Services attach. The other problem is there was very high technology services attach to our Business Critical Systems, Itanium for one. So we are recovering from that. What I have to say is the team, led by Antonio Neri when he ran Technology Services, is he has done a remarkable job in creating products, like Proactive Care, Datacenter Care, that are actually filling the vacuum that was left by Itanium and a downward decline in Enterprise Group hardware revenues. So you're now, pretty soon, just like in storage, you're going to see a shift now to actually as reported growth in Technology Services because the new products are kicking in, the attach rate is at very good levels and now we have hardware growing again. So we feel pretty good about the underlying financial architecture associated with Enterprise Group. And Technology Services has not only great financial characteristics, virtually, every customer needs to attach technology services, so they have that ability to service their hardware in their data center real time with the biggest footprint of services individuals around the world."

We see it being down high single digits versus only sort of negative 2 last year, driven by the XP refresh. We see notebooks being stronger than desktops. We see opportunity in commercial mobility, in accessories, in services. And the market to me at the moment reminds me a little bit of the market in 2013. And it really requires a highly disciplined approach to market segmentation, cost optimization, leveraging the 160,000 channel partners that we have around the globe that do an amazing job of adding value to our customer set and continuing to drive our innovation agenda. We remain disciplined about not chasing share for share's sake, playing where we choose to play and winning in those segments. And we are in a consolidating market. And inside that consolidating market, we are growing faster than the market. And if we do that in a very disciplined way, we still see opportunity in the longer term for the Personal Systems business."

Hewlett-Packard company net revenue for the quarter was $25.7 billion, down 9% year-over-year as reported or down 3% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $103.4 billion down 7% year-over-year as reported or down 2% in constant currency. Gross margin was 24.7%, up 0.1 point year-over-year and up 0.9 point quarter-over-quarter with sequential improvement across all of our major business segments. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were down 5% year-over-year, driven by a reduction in SG&A, partially offset by our continued focus on increasing our R&D investments. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was 9.1%, down 0.5 point year-over-year and up 0.5 point sequentially. Within the net expense of $151 million in Hawaii and, our non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.8 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.93 in Q4 within our outlook range. 
Q4 non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges, a $676 million for separation, $591 million for restructuring, $246 million for amortization of intangible assets and net tax benefit of $803 million. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.59 in line with our previously provided outlook range. 
On a GAAP basis, Q4 you the net earnings per share was $0.73, above our outlook range due to the net tax benefits just mentioned. These were onetime, noncash entries comprising a number of different items, including the reversal of a previously recorded U.S. tax valuation allowance that I discussed on the Q3 earnings call. 
The total separation costs, CapEx and associated cash flows expected across FY '15 and FY '16, in total, were originally $2.8 billion. And we now expect $2.4 billion in that same time period. The mix of expenses between onetime separation costs, CapEx and incremental taxes was different than planned the taxes coming in well under our plan in Q4. 
The 2012 restructuring program is nearly complete with approximately 4,300 people exiting the company in Q4 '15 and just under 56,000 cumulative reductions for the programs to date. Even with labor migration, we are down a net 59,000 people over this time frame. In Q4, we recorded GAAP only charges of $591 million, approximately $200 million were the final charges associated with the 2012 program and the remainder were associated with the new restructuring program that each company discussed at their respective Security Analyst Meetings in September. 
We delivered cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.8 billion in the quarter. This brings our total free cash flow for the year to $3.3 billion, which is just below our outlook range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. There was a tailwind from separation costs coming in lower as described. This was more than offset by the following: Other receivables, including VAT, elevated and financing receivables driven by higher HP Financial Services volume; cash outflow for restructuring; and lower earnings. 
In Q4, we returned $638 million of capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, and $4.1 billion was returned to shareholders for the full year. We returned over 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders in fiscal '15, even excluding the capital return of $750 million that completed our 2014 commitment. I'll now turn it over to Meg and Tim to discuss the results of the segments  that are now part of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Then Dion and I will return to share comments on printing and personal systems, the new HP Inc."

As we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting in September, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise has 5 key priorities for FY '16. We plan to grow top line revenue in constant currency, drive a year-over-year increase in operating profit, grow free",1285,"Thanks, Cathie. As we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting in September, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise has 5 key priorities for FY '16. We plan to grow top line revenue in constant currency, drive a year-over-year increase in operating profit, grow free cash flow, continue to execute our innovation roadmap and stabilize revenue and expand margins in enterprise services. And I'm pleased to say that overall, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise is off to a very strong start. First and foremost, the segments that comprise HPE have now had 2 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth and we believe we're in a strong position to deliver on our plans to grow overall in FY '16 in constant currency. 
Also, while there is more work to do, particularly in ES, our cost structure is much closer to where it needs to be thanks to aggressive supply chain management, SKU rationalization and workforce rebalancing. With respect to cash, we are starting the year with a net cash position at the operating company level and a separation cost wind down we are well positioned to increase cash flow at FY '16. The innovation we've been investing in over the past 4 years is paying off. We've introduced breakthrough new solutions and services that have driven a mix shift in our portfolio towards higher growth products and services. 
By leaning into new technology, we are ideally positioned to take advantage of market trends that will allow us to continue to take share from our competitors and to drive long-term growth. Finally, while each business segment faces different challenges and opportunities, the company as a whole is aligning tightly around the 4 customer transformation areas we discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting. Customers tell us our focus is spot on. I'm confident that our clear strategy will accelerate the significant progress we've already made in our financial performance. 
Now before Tim gets into the financial details, let me provide some highlights from the quarter across each segment. In enterprise group, we performed exceptionally well with strong revenue growth up 2% as reported or 9% in constant currency and improved profitability on a sequential basis. Our industry standard server business was strong with constant currency revenue growth across all regions, driven by solid core growth and increasing demand from Tier 1 service providers. Looking forward, we are well positioned to benefit from the server market upswing, driven by the growth in cloud and Big Data. 
The networking business also performed well with the Aruba acquisition driving strong cost selling opportunities across wireless and data center switching. Door significantly outpaced the market and we expect that we gained close to 1 point of share in the third calendar quarter. Our 3PAR all flash portfolio is outperforming the competition. 3PAR all flash is now a $500 million annualized run rate business and grew triple digits in the fourth quarter. That's larger and growing faster than pure in their most recently reported quarter. 
In fact, just last week, Gartner rated 3PAR as the best storage product on the market across every use case category. This is a powerful recommendation to our customers and partners and will help us continue to drive share gains against our competitors. Finally in technology services. We continue to see a growing proportion of the business come from high-value services like proactive care and data center care while operating margins remained steady. 
Turning to Enterprise Services, we have the best performance in Q4 that we've had in years due to a more diversified customer base, stabilized constant currency revenue growth and a significantly reduced cost structure. Revenue declined 2% in constant currency, although we grew new logos and saw double-digit growth in strategic enterprise services, driven by strength in helium cloud and security services. Operating profit was 8% in the quarter the best performance since 2011. 
For the full year, both revenue and operating margins were in the range of our outlook. Looking ahead, we have a clear plan in place to get to a longer term sustainable target operating margin of 7% to 9%. In software, we delivered strong margins while continuing to take steps to align the portfolio and the go-to-market approach with the 4 transformation areas. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year in constant currency or flat, if you normalize for recent M&A transactions on a pro forma basis. 
During the quarter, we announced several transactions, including the sale of tipping point and lightbulb, which will allow us to focus our resources and investment in higher growth strategic businesses. Finally, our financial services business continues to be a differentiator for the company. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, financial services helps customers by creating consumption-based models to provide new technology or financing programs to transition out of legacy systems. Total FY '15 [ph] financing volume increased 9% year-over-year in constant currency. As I have said before, HPE's innovation engine is humming Q4 was no exception. During the quarter, we introduced important new solutions and continued to see strong customer traction across the portfolio. For example, in September, we announced several new security solutions to help customers quickly detect high risk threats, reduced data breach impact and enhance overall security. We also won several significant new security deals in the quarter, including new wins for our voltage and fortify solutions with a major financial services company. 
In Enterprise Services, we announced a significant new partnership with Microsoft and HP Inc. to enable Windows 10 adoption and drive employee mobility for the enterprise. As part of the agreement, we will build and sell industry-specific, business applications for Windows 10 across key industries such as retail, energy and transportation. This agreement is a great example of how Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will work together going forward. In servers, we saw continued strong customer momentum with our leading portfolio of Apollo high-performance compute solutions. We are the clear market leader in high-performance computing and today, more than 1/3 of the market is leveraging HPE compute platforms to process, analyze and manage data securely. Cloud is another important growth driver for us and we saw strong momentum in the quarter. We are the leading cloud infrastructure provider and we see a significant opportunity as enterprises move to a hybrid cloud environment. In late October, we announced HP Helion OpenStack 2.0, our latest enterprise grade-cloud platform with new life cycle management and security enhancements. We believe strongly in open standards and our OpenStack-based cloud offerings provide the open, agile and secure hybrid cloud environment our customers are asking for. We also refined our cloud strategy during the quarter. Our goal is to help customers source, manage and consume services across traditional, private, public and managed cloud environment. To that end, we announced in October that we will double down on our private and managed cloud capabilities and sunset our public cloud offering. This is the right move. It plays to our strength in private and managed cloud. We will continue to extend our cloud infrastructure leadership and integrate the public cloud element for our customers through a strategic partner-based model. In line with that, approach, we've reached an agreement with Microsoft that you'll hear more about during discover next week. Microsoft shares our view of a hybrid IT approach for enterprises and we both see opportunity to simplify hybrid infrastructure for our customers. Going forward, Microsoft and Azure, will become a preferred public cloud partner. HP will serve as a provider of Microsoft infrastructure and services for its hybrid cloud offerings. Overall, the move to a hybrid cloud environment presents a significant growth opportunity for us and you can expect to hear more about our approach in coming months. And on that note, I'll hand the call over to Tim Stonesifer."

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise finished the year on a strong note, and we're already executing against the financial architecture we laid out at our Securities Analyst Meeting. This calls for solid growth from EG with stable to slightly up margins. Stabilizing revenue and ES with strong margin expansion, stabilizing software revenue with good profitability, all while leveraging financial services with the good return on equity. In Q4, our segments collectively delivered revenue of $14.1 billion, which was up 3% year-over-year in constant currency. This marks the second quarter in the row of delivering year-over-year constant currency growth and we expect to take share in x86 servers, storage and networking during the third calendar quarter. 
For the full fiscal year 2015, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $1.84, in the middle of the previously provided outlook. Similarly, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total free cash flow for the year to be $1 billion, just below the previously provided outlook. We benefited from a push out of separation costs that was offset primarily by the timing of value-added tax receivables and restructuring payments, along with the higher financing receivable that Cathy mentioned in her remarks. 
Now turning to the segments. The enterprise group continued its strong momentum, growing revenue 2% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Operating profit improved sequentially by 1 point to 14% and was down 0.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to currency. Industry Standard Servers grew 5% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency, and was up across all geographies in constant currency. The work we have done segmenting the market and delivering innovative products has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the strong market. We expect server momentum to continue next year, but at a moderated pace given more difficult comparisons. 
Business critical systems declined 8% year-over-year, but only 2% in constant currency. This was our strongest year-over-year revenue growth in over 3 years as our mission-critical x86 and nonstop platforms offset the challenges from titanium. Storage declined 7%, but was flat in constant currency, significantly outperforming the market. Converged Storage grew 17% in constant currency and was 53% of the portfolio. We are now seeing our R&D investments pay off with exceptional growth in all flash, which has taken over 10 points of share in the last year. 
We expect the improving mix of converged storage to drive overall growth in fiscal year 2016 at improved margins and with better TS attach. Networking grew 35% year-over-year or 43% in constant currency, and grew high single digits in constant currency, excluding Aruba. The recent strategic moves we've made are already yielding results. The Aruba acquisition is driving incremental opportunities from the campus wireless refresh, and we've returned the growth in China following the announcement of our partnership with Xingwa. We expect to close the Xingwa transaction in Q1. 
TS declined 11% or 4% in constant currency, impacted by tough compare and consulting from the prior year. Order growth was flat year-over-year in local currency, lighter than expected. This was partially due to customers in China, waiting for the Xingwa transaction to close before signing new multi-year supporting contracts. Additionally, we had a higher mix of Tier 1 service provider growth and servers that attach a little support. We are addressing these issues with more value-added services like proactive care and data center care that are increasing our support attach dollars on a per unit basis. 
For the full year, orders were up 1% on local currency and TS continues to be on track for flat constant currency revenue in fiscal year '16. In enterprise services, revenue declined 9% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency and was flat when you exclude the top 3 account runoff. For full fiscal 2015, we saw total bookings growth, driven by new logo signings and solid renewals. 
Our cost actions also delivered strong margin expansion. Profitability was up 1.4 points year-over-year to 8.2% for the quarter, the highest it's been since the second quarter of 2011. Infrastructure technology outsourcing was down 11% year-over-year or down 4% in constant currency. We saw encouraging constant currency growth in EMEA, which was previously our most challenged region. Application and business services was down 5% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency. Our strongest constant currency result in over 3 years. 
This result is especially encouraging since ABF's carries the highest operating margins within ES. In software, revenue declined 7% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency and was flat when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. The team continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, achieving operating margins of 30.1%, down 1.3 points year-over-year due mostly to currency. We enjoyed good revenue growth in security and double-digit revenue growth in Big Data year-over-year and constant currency when adjusted for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. 
In particular, license revenue for Vertica increased in excess of 50% year-over-year, driven by several large wins in North America. SaaS also grew year-over-year in constant currency and in each business when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. Going forward, we expect better alignment with the enterprise group and enterprise services to improve cross-selling opportunities. However, we also continue to expect pressure on the top line as we evolve our go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. 
In financial services, revenue declined 11% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency with operating profit declining 1.3 points to 11%. The challenge is to both revenue and profitability were entirely due to unfavorable currency and a tough compare. Financing is playing an increasingly strategic role for our customers with volume up 9% in constant currency during fiscal year of 2015. Financing volume was a good indicator of future revenue performance. The return on equity remained healthy at 16.4%. 
With that, let's turn to the outlook. On the top line, we expect the momentum of Q3 and Q4 constant currency revenue growth to continue through fiscal '16. The currency environment continues to be volatile and based on current rates, we expect a 3-point headwind of revenue in fiscal year '16. Before I give our EPS outlook, let me provide some guidance for earnings seasonality at the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. 
In general, EPS will be back-end-loaded for a few reasons. First, both enterprise services and software margins normally expand throughout the year from a low in Q1. Second, the benefits we received from restructuring will continue ramping over time. And finally, the negative impact from dis-synergies will decline throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.37 to $0.41 in the first quarter of 2016, and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP dilute net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. 
We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.09 to $0.13 in Q1 of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. We continue to expect free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for the full year. However, please keep in mind that cash flow is seasonally lowest in the first quarter, and in fiscal year '16, it will also be impacted by the majority of the remaining separation payments. 
Finally, for capital allocation, earlier this month, we announced our Q1 dividend of $0.55 per share, in line with our commitment to distribute approximately $400 million in the form of dividends in fiscal year '16. We remain committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow for the full year to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. In closing, let me say I'm pleased with the progress we are making against the 5 key priorities we discussed at our security Analyst Meeting. The business has momentum and our financial architecture continues to strengthen. In short, I'm excited about our prospects and the future of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Deonne."

The experiencing markets are experiencing challenges right now. As we discussed on the Q3 earnings call and in more detail at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expected to have several tough quarters and Q4 was indeed a difficult quarter and somewhat weaker than we expected. Following separation, we remain confident that we are well positioned for the long-term in the marketplace. The market challengers the not intimidate us, and we are keenly aware of what we need to be focused on going forward. 
Turning to the results. Overall in Q4, our business performance was mixed. In personal systems, we executed well against the expected tough market backdrop while printing represented a much greater challenge due to a number of factors that have changed our midterm view of the market and the supplies revenue trajectory. 
Before I go into those details on printing, let me briefly reflect on the Q4 results for personal systems. The PC market continued to be tough, especially in consumer where industry channel inventory remained elevated in the market. While we saw improved performance in the U.S., EMEA remained weak with market units declining 22% year-over-year in the third calendar quarter as we foreshadowed at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
As I said in the past, when markets are down, our ability to outperform the market profitably is key. HP gained unit share in calendar third quarter in each of our 3 regions, achieving 19.7% market share worldwide. We continue to extend our lead in the market with commercial PC share of 23.7%, our highest share position ever. And we managed to do this, all while improving personal systems operating profit by 8/10 of a point sequentially to 3.8%. We believe that innovation and sprinkle of magic are key to differentiation as the PC market goes through consolidation. 
In Q4, we introduced a robust portfolio of enterprise class and consumer PCs with a number of form factors and industry firsts. And we announced a partnership with Disney and Lucas' films around Star Wars, The Force Awakens, delighting our customers with the launch of our Star Wars special edition notebook PC. Looking ahead, we expect the PC market to remain challenged for more quarters to come. As expected, Windows 10 has not been a material catalyst for sales yet, but continues to receive favorable reviews. We see the most adoption in the U.S. retail segment and our share here is very strong. We maintained the Disney operating system is important for the industry and a contributing factor to support a future hardware refresh cycle. 
Turning to printing. We saw accelerated revenue declines across hardware and supplies and there have been a couple of factors that have changed since the Security Analyst Meeting. The most significant factor was the continued effects of currency movements that have accelerated pricing pressures, even more than we expected in certain profitable segments of the printing markets. Secondly, the market was somewhat weaker than we expected in the calendar third quarter. And you're seeing this in our results and you saw in the results of some of our peers, some of whom have announced their intentions to reevaluate strategic options. We do not expect landscape to improve in the near future, and we will constantly us that's how the market evolves. In any case, our market leadership and scale served us well, but we have much more work to do on many dimensions. Specifically in hardware, we saw a 17% year-over-year unit decline due to 3 factors. Firstly, the hardware market continued to contract with calendar third quarter total units down 6% year-over-year, down more than we expected. Secondly, pressure in the unit performance was a plan channel inventory reduction. We consciously elevated inventory levels in Q3 in advance of the IT system cut over as part of our separation related continuity planning. The good news is that with the reduction in Q4, the hardware channel inventory is now within the desired range as we finish the year. 
So approximately 3/4 of the unit decline is linked to the market and channel inventory. Thirdly, with the market down more than expected, the competitive pricing environment was even more challenging in certain profitable segments where usage is high. Let me take a moment to outline impact currency is having on the pricing dynamics in the market. We have seen further reduction in average unit prices in key segments. Our competitors have leveraged currency advantages to drive down pricing, and we have responded in kind. 
This has changed the price points for certain units and means that some units in specific markets were no longer MPV positive. And as we said we would do, we have responsibly been going after profitable share gains and walking away from negative MPV hardware unit deals. Another consequence of lower average unit price points is that we are attracting buyers that may have different usage patterns than we originally targeted. For example, the pricing of some of the authorship price hardware have formed into price bands that are within reach of home users who typically print less. The unintended result is that we are not getting the yield per unit we would've expected on some of these units. 
We see this impacting our supplies revenue trajectory. Q4 '15 supplies revenue was not where we expected it to be and we have more work to do. We will accelerate initiatives across all of the levers we pulled to improve the supplies revenue trajectory. Examples of these initiatives include driving programs to increase ink usage and to increase aftermarket supply share. On ink usage, we expect to accelerate our instant ink subscription services with programs that increase our tax rate. 
In Q4, one of the programs was to expand the number of models and therefore, price points that instant ink addresses, ensuring more customers never run out of ink. We are confident that the fundamentals of the 4 box model are sound. We believe all of these actions will help improve the trajectory of supplies revenue over time. However, given the unit declines and changing usage patents, the data from our 4 box model is indicating that we expect the stabilization in ink supplies revenue to be delayed towards the end of 2017 as we drive these initiatives. We are moving quickly on 3 vectors. We remain focused on solutioning the $1 billion of productivity improvements we laid out at the Security Analyst Meeting. Secondly, we can't compete on price alone so we are balancing our pricing actions with increased marketing and sales activity to stimulate demand. And finally, we have to materially change our nonrevenue generating cost structure to compete aggressively. This may both accelerate and increase the previously announced restructuring actions. 
In closing, we firmly believe in our strategy around core growth in the future as outlined in the Security Analyst Meeting. Let me remind you, we are still the leader in large consolidating markets. We have scale, innovation, channel reach and an incredible brand. While the markets are challenging now, we believe the actions we are taking now will protect the core that generates the majority of our cash flow, and of course, we will continue to invest in adjacent market opportunities and our future. I'll now turn it over to Cathie who can provide additional details and our financial outlook."

Printing net revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or down 9% in constant currency. As expected, the year-over-year currency impact was greater than past quarters as favorable long dated financial hedges matured. From a channel inventory perspective, we've reduced both hardware and supplies level year-over-year and sequentially, but we are still slightly above target weeks of supply range for supplies. Supplies revenue was down 10% year-over-year as reported or down 5% on constant currency and was 65% of the revenue mix in the quarter. 
We have some bright spots in the quarter, including constant currency revenue growth in graphics. Also, Managed Print Services revenue grew double-digits in constant currency year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal '15, we saw strong growth both as reported and in constant currency and total contract value for our partner MPS offering. From an operating profit perspective, we delivered 17.4% down 8.8 points year-over-year. Currency headwinds and competitive pricing were only partially offset by strong supplies mix. Turning to personal systems. Revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or down 7% in constant currency. Consumer and commercial PC units were each down year-over-year, but we outperformed the market in calendar Q3, gaining 0.3 points of share in consumer and 1.6 points of share in commercial. We've done a lot of work to drive to our variable cost structure, which supports our profitability in these down quarters. Personal systems operating process improved sequentially to 3.8% on the strength of gross margins, was down 2.2 points year-over-year as a result of reduced operating expense leverage volume despite OpEx reduction and improved gross margins. Gaining cost efficiencies will position us well as the market slowly recovers. Considering the combined performance of the Printing and Personal Systems segments in the context of the overall Hewlett-Packard company results, we estimate our pro forma contribution to the non-GAAP EPS results for fiscal '15 to be about a penny a below the baseline range provided by the Security Analyst Meeting. Our pro forma free cash flow contribution to the company was approximately $2.3 billion for fiscal '16 within the range we outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting. Turning to the financial outlook. Beginning in Q1 '16, the new HP Inc. will make a reporting change related to pension. For the last several years, we have had pension income. Our pension liabilities and assets will be revalued each October 31, based on interest rates and asset values on that day. This can drive nonoperational volatility in our pension income from year-to-year. For FY '16, this volatility causes the year-over-year decrease in pension income of approximately $90 million. And we don't expect this to have an impact to FY '16 cash flow. Without a change in reporting method however, this headwinds would have put incremental pressure on our investment and sub optimizing our business for nonoperational impact is not in our best long-term interest. Specifically, the change relates to the expected performance of the planned assets and interest rate movements. The market related factors in determining pension income or expense. 
We will exclude these market related factors from the non-GAAP operational results going forward. With this reporting change, the service cost associated with our pension plan and our amortization of prior service costs will continue to be reported as operational expenses within our non-GAAP results. For more information, please refer to the Investor Relations earnings presentation, which includes a few slides detailing the change. We believe that going forward, this reporting change provides a greater transparency to underlying operating results. 
However, the reporting change will result in a reduction of our non-GAAP EPS outlook given we will now exclude our nonoperational pension income. Moving to revenue. As discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expect year-over-year constant currency declines to moderate, but currency will continue to be a headwind to revenue of about 3 to 4 points in FY '16. Since then, net currency moves have been unfavorable and we see only incremental pressure to both revenue and operating profit year-over-year. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be about 1 point lower than the 22% to 23% range provided at the Security Analyst Meeting, given the pension reporting change noted. 
For Q1 specifically, keep the following things in mind: The personal systems and printing markets continue to be tough. Supplies revenue will continue to be under pressure as we reduce supplies channel inventory and the supplies revenue trajectory improvement will take longer. Given the pricing dynamics Deonne laid out, we expect printer units to be down double-digits year-over-year as we continue to focus on profitable unit placement. And finally, productivity improvements are expected to ramp throughout the year. Considering these factors, we expect the first half operating profit to be lower than our typical in year seasonality. 
With all that in mind, the HP Inc. Q1 '16 non-GAAP net interest per share outlook is in the range of $0.33 to $0.38, inclusive the pension reporting change. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $1.59 to $1.69. Operationally our non-GAAP EPS outlook is unchanged, but with the exclusion of nonoperating pension income there was a reduction of $0.08 in fiscal '16 as compared to what we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
On a GAAP basis, Q1 '16 GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $0.27 to $0.32. And our full year FY '16 GAAP GAAP earnings per share outlook range is $1.50 to $1.60. The reduction in the full-year GAAP EPS outlook of $0.05 in fiscal '16 from what we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting is associated with the following: $0.03 for lower pension income as a result of the revaluation of pension assets and liabilities as of October 31, 2015 and $0.02 is associated with the amortization of intangibles related to the marketing optimization shift to HP Inc. and the separation charges that move from FY '15 to FY '16. For FY '16, we expect our normalized free cash flow to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion consistent with the discussion of the Security Analyst Meeting. However, we are adjusting our free cash flow outlook to our range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion, down $100 million due to separation payments that slipped from FY '15. 
Finally, for capital allocation, we announced earlier this month that we will be paying a dividend of $0.124 per share in fiscal '16. We remain committed to a total capital return to shareholders for the full year to be at the high end of our overall framework of 50% to 75% of free cash flow. We expect that share repurchase will drive a moderate decline in weighted average shares outstanding beginning in Q1. With that, let's open it up for questions."

So let me start out with the cash flow. So the separation costs, we had about $300 million of favorability from a free cash flow perspective on the E side in '15. $200 million of that will move over to '16. So if you look at the overall amount",359,"Sure. Okay. So let me start out with the cash flow. So the separation costs, we had about $300 million of favorability from a free cash flow perspective on the E side in '15. $200 million of that will move over to '16. So if you look at the overall amount of separation costs we were able to -- able to work down the overall amount, so there will be about a $200 million separation cost increase in '16. If you look at the overall free cash flow and the adjustment to '16, we're still holding to the '16 guide. And basically our shortfall was, driven by a couple of things. If you think about the financial volumes were higher in our financial services business as well as we had some pressure on the BEP receivables that we were unable to collect, that will push over and then give us some favorability in '16, which will offset some of the separation costs pressure. So overall, we're sticking to the guide that we provided at SAM. As far as Xingwa, we have an adjusted EPS yet because the deal is not closed. But just to give you some color around that from the remaining 49% that will stick with us, we're going to account for that with the equity accounting method. So you'll see that earnings and cash flow impact flow-through the other income line. And then as far as a guide or framing it up for an EPS perspective, we've said historically that we've earned -- we had about $400 million of, of profit in that business in 2014. So I think you could use that as a proxy. And then I just take a couple of things into account. One would be the timing of the transaction. So when we close it, and then the second thing I would think about his there will be some stranded costs associated with overhead costs that do not go with the transaction. So similar to the synergy costs, will need to work that out of the system that will take a little bit of time so that's the Xinhua impact may."

How do I transform my IT environment to a hybrid environment. How to a secure by digital enterprise? How do I enable analytics, Big Data analytics environment and how do I drive workplace plays productivity? And we are aligning software services and hardware or infrastructure to that. And this is particularly powerful for software because software now has some of the anchor I'd be in each of these areas and is also helping us decide what parts of software we want to be in and what parts we don't hereby be we've talked about my vault and tipping point.

We have found that our for box model is in fact, very good. And as we have collected more Big Data and every week we collect new data, we update basically the model. What we saw in Q4 were basically 2 things that really impacted that model and impacted when the ink supplies would stabilize and push it out to basically '17. The first thing was we did see incremental competitiveness in key segments particularly in SMB Inc. And therefore, we placed glass units. And as a result, of that that's going to have a knock on effect around ink supplies. Secondly, what we saw was through aggressive pricing, we actually took a product that should've been sold into 1 end-user, an end-user that in fact, drinks a lot and we now are getting -- selling that product into home users with just don't print enough. And so we need to change that, and that's part of better managing the marketing, better managing basically the price points. And that has a knock on effect because those were units that we had expected would be very high usage. So we have a lot of confidence in the model. But you have to work the model all the time and it's across those 4 dimensions that we've talked about, the installed base usage, after market share and then also making sure that we're careful about what we do for be supplies pricing perspective."

What I would tell you is, we feel really good about our strategy relative to what we see Dell and EMC doing. I mean, they could not be in more stark contract. They're getting bigger leveraging up and doubling down mostly on leverage technology while our strategy is to get smaller. I've just spent the last 4 years deleveraging the balance sheet and leaning included technology the conversion for structure, new server architectures, 3PAR with all-flash Aruba et cetera.

And so really, the markets moved to shorter more strategic relationships in ITO as opposed to just labor arbitrage, and now there is how do we transform your infrastructure to be a more nimble, more agile and lower cost? We've talked about the number of our customers for whom were not just taking their mess for less in the old days that's probably what he would've done now we are saying we will help transform your IT environment to be part of this new world order that's going to allow it to be lower-cost more modern and allow you to be more agile. And those contracts are -- tend to be shorter and we're actually okay. With that, because we also are very clear now that you're going to not going to lose money in contracts in years 1 and 2, and these things have to be profitable from the beginning. And that's been a change in the industry and frankly a change, that we're putting we're very, very focused on only taking deals that are good business for us. And it like Dion said in his business, share for share sake is not interesting for us here. We want to do good profitable deals with customers that we can drive a good outcome for.

Finally, each of the unaudited pro forma Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc.'s fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and cash flow information presented in this call and the accompanying presentation is based on the estimated contributions of each company to Hewlett-Packard Company's fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS and cash flow as adjusted to give effect to the separation transaction effective on November 1, 2015. 
The pro forma amounts do not necessarily reflect that the fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS and cash flow of Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP Inc. would have been had the separation occurred on November 1, 2014. They also may not be useful in predicting the future financial condition and results of operations of the separate companies. The actual financial positions and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors.
With that, let me turn it over to Meg."

The fourth quarter was the final quarter where Hewlett-Packard operated as one combined company. On November 1, we completed the historic separation and became 2 separate independent public companies: HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I couldn't be prouder of how we executed on the incredibly complex separation. Throughout the year-long separation process, we saw no disruption to our customers and partners, and we continued to draw the business forward. And now, both companies are off and running. Each company has a clear, well-defined strategy and is well positioned to win in its respected market. 
Before we get into the business segment performance and outlook, I'll let Cathie provide details on the Q4 results of the previously combined company."

Hewlett-Packard Company net revenue for the quarter was $25.7 billion, down 9% year-over-year as reported or down 3% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $103.4 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported or down 2% in constan",580,"Thanks, Meg. Hewlett-Packard Company net revenue for the quarter was $25.7 billion, down 9% year-over-year as reported or down 3% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $103.4 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported or down 2% in constant currency. Gross margin was 24.7%, up 0.1 point year-over-year and up 0.9 points quarter-over-quarter with sequential improvement across all of our major business segments. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were down 5% year-over-year, driven by a reduction in SG&A, partially offset by our continued focus on increasing our R&D investments. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was 9.1%, down 0.5 points year-over-year and up 0.5 points sequentially. With a net expense of $151 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.8 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.93 in Q4, within our outlook range. 
Q4 non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $676 million for separation, $591 million for restructuring, $246 million for amortization of intangible assets and net tax benefits of $803 million. 
For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.59, in line with our previously provided outlook range. 
On a GAAP basis, Q4 diluted net earnings per share was $0.73, above our outlook range due to the net tax benefits just mentioned. These were onetime, noncash entries comprising a number of different items, including the reversal of a previously recorded U.S. tax valuation allowance that I discussed on the Q3 earnings call. 
The total separation costs, CapEx and associated cash flows expected across FY '15 and FY '16, in total, were originally $2.8 billion. And we now expect $2.4 billion in that same time period. The mix of expenses between onetime separation costs, CapEx and incremental taxes was different than planned with taxes coming in well under our plans in Q4. 
The 2012 restructuring program is nearly complete with approximately 4,300 people exiting the company in Q4 '15 and just under 56,000 cumulative reductions for the programs to date. Even with labor migration, we are down a net 59,000 people over this time frame. 
In Q4, we recorded GAAP-only charges of $591 million. Approximately $200 million were the final charges associated with the 2012 program, and the remainder were associated with the new restructuring program that each company discussed at their respective Security Analyst Meetings in September. 
We delivered cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.8 billion in the quarter. This brings our total free cash flow for the year to $3.3 billion, which is just below our outlook range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. There was a tailwind from separation costs coming in lower as described. This was more than offset by the following: other receivables, including VAT; elevated financing receivables driven by higher HP Financial Services volume; cash outflow for restructuring; and lower earnings. 
In Q4, we returned $638 million of capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, and $4.1 billion was returned to shareholders for the full year. We returned over 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders in fiscal '15, even excluding the capital return of $750 million that completed our 2014 commitment. 
I'll now turn it over to Meg and Tim to discuss the results of the segments  that are now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Then Dion and I will return to share comments on Printing and Personal Systems, the new HP Inc."

As we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting in September, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has 5 key priorities for FY '16. We plan to grow top line revenue in constant currency, drive a year-over-year increase in operating profit, grow free",1279,"Thanks, Cathie. As we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting in September, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has 5 key priorities for FY '16. We plan to grow top line revenue in constant currency, drive a year-over-year increase in operating profit, grow free cash flow, continue to execute our innovation road map and stabilize revenue and expand margins in Enterprise Services. And I'm pleased to say that overall, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is off to a very strong start. First and foremost, the segments that comprise HPE have now had 2 consecutive quarters of constant-currency revenue growth, and we believe we're in a strong position to deliver on our plans to grow overall in FY '16 in constant currency. 
Also, while there is more work to do, particularly in ES, our cost structure is much closer to where it needs to be, thanks to aggressive supply chain management, SKU rationalization and workforce rebalancing. 
With respect to cash, we are starting the year with a net cash position at the operating company level and a separation costs wind down, we are well positioned to increase cash flow at FY '16. The innovation we've been investing in over the past 4 years is paying off. We've introduced breakthrough new solutions and services that have driven a mix shift in our portfolio towards higher-growth products and services. By leaning into new technology, we are ideally positioned to take advantage of market trends that will allow us to continue to take share from our competitors and to drive long-term growth. 
Finally, while each business segment faces different challenges and opportunities, the company as a whole is aligning tightly around the 4 customer transformation areas we discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting. Customers tell us our focus is spot-on. I'm confident that our clear strategy will accelerate the significant progress we've already made in our financial performance. 
Now before Tim gets into the financial details, let me provide some highlights from the quarter across each segment. In Enterprise Group, we performed exceptionally well with strong revenue growth up 2% as reported or 9% in constant currency and improved profitability on a sequential basis. 
Our Industry Standard Server business was strong with constant-currency revenue growth across all regions, driven by solid core growth and increasing demand from Tier-1 service providers. Looking forward, we are well positioned to benefit from the server market upswing, driven by the growth in cloud and big data. 
The Networking business also performed well with the Aruba acquisition driving strong cross-selling opportunities across wireless and data center switching. 
Storage significantly outpaced the market, and we expect that we gained close to a point of share in the third calendar quarter. 
Our 3PAR All-Flash portfolio is outperforming the competition. 3PAR All-Flash is now a $500 million annualized run rate business and grew triple digits in the fourth quarter. That's larger and growing faster than Pure in their most recently reported quarter. In fact, just last week, Gartner rated 3PAR as the best storage product on the market across every use case category. This is a powerful recommendation to our customers and partners and will help us continue to drive share gains against our competitors. 
Finally, in Technology Services. We continue to see a growing proportion of the business come from high-value services like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care, while operating margins remained steady. 
Turning to Enterprise Services. We have the best performance in Q4 that we've had in years due to a more diversified customer base, stabilized constant-currency revenue growth and a significantly reduced cost structure. Revenue declined 2% in constant currency, although we grew new logos and saw double-digit growth in Strategic Enterprise Services, driven by strength in Helion cloud and security services. Operating profit was 8% in the quarter, the best performance since 2011. For the full year, both revenue and operating margins were in the range of our outlook. Looking ahead, we have a clear plan in place to get to a longer-term sustainable target operating margin of 7% to 9%. 
In Software, we delivered strong margins while continuing to take steps to align the portfolio and the go-to-market approach with the 4 transformation areas. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year in constant currency or flat, if you normalize for recent M&A transactions on a pro forma basis. During the quarter, we announced several transactions, including the sale of Tipping Point and LiveVault, which will allow us to focus our resources and investments in higher-growth strategic businesses. 
Finally, our Financial Services business continues to be a differentiator for the company. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Financial Services helps customers by creating consumption-based models to buy new technology or financing programs to transition out of legacy systems. Total FY '15 financing volume increased 9% year-over-year in constant currency. 
As I have said before, HPE's innovation engine is humming, and Q4 was no exception. During the quarter, we introduced important new solutions and continued to see strong customer traction across the portfolio. For example, in September, we announced several new security solutions to help customers quickly detect high-risk threats, reduced data breach impact and enhance overall security. We also won several significant new security deals in the quarter, including new wins for our Voltage and Fortify solutions with a major financial services company. 
In Enterprise Services, we announced a significant new partnership with Microsoft and HP Inc. to enable Windows 10 adoption and drive employee mobility for the enterprise. As part of the agreement, we will build and sell industry-specific business applications for Windows 10 across key industries such as retail, energy and transportation. This agreement is a great example of how Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will work together going forward. 
In Servers, we saw a continued strong customer momentum with our leading portfolio of Apollo high-performance compute solutions. We are the clear market leader in high-performance computing. And today, more than 1/3 of the market is leveraging HPE compute platforms to process, analyze and manage data securely. 
Cloud is another important growth driver for us, and we saw a strong momentum in the quarter. We are the leading cloud infrastructure provider, and we see a significant opportunity as enterprises move to a hybrid cloud environment. 
In late October, we announced HP Helion OpenStack 2.0, our latest enterprise-grade cloud platform with new life cycle management and security enhancements. We believe strongly in open standards, and our OpenStack-based cloud offerings provide the open, agile and secure hybrid cloud environment our customers are asking for. 
We also refined our cloud strategy during the quarter. Our goal is to help customers source, manage and consume services across traditional, private, public and managed cloud environments. To that end, we announced in October that we will double down on our private and managed cloud capabilities and sunset our public cloud offering. This is the right move. It plays to our strengths in private and managed cloud. We will continue to extend our cloud infrastructure leadership and integrate the public cloud element for our customers through a strategic partner-based model. 
In line with that, approach, we've reached an agreement with Microsoft that you'll hear more about during Discover next week. Microsoft shares our view of a hybrid-IT approach for enterprises, and we both see opportunity to simplify hybrid infrastructure for our customers. Going forward, Microsoft and Azure will become a preferred public cloud partner. HPE will serve as a preferred provider of Microsoft's infrastructure and services for its hybrid cloud offerings. 
Overall, the move to a hybrid cloud environment presents a significant growth opportunity for us, and you can expect to hear more about our approach in coming months. 
And on that note, I'll hand the call over to Tim Stonesifer."

Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year on a strong note, and we're already executing against the financial architecture we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting. This calls for solid growth from EG with stable to slightly up margins, stabilizing revenue and ES with strong margin expansion, stabilizing software revenue with good profitability, all while leveraging Financial Services with their good return on equity. 
In Q4, our segments collectively delivered revenue of $14.1 billion, which was up 3% year-over-year in constant currency. This marks the second quarter in a row of delivering year-over-year constant-currency growth, and we expect to take share in x86 servers, storage and networking during the third calendar quarter. 
For the full fiscal year 2015, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $1.84, in the middle of the previously provided outlook. Similarly, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total free cash flow for the year to be $1 billion, just below the previously provided outlook. We benefited from a pushout of separation costs that was offset primarily by the timing of value-added tax receivables and restructuring payments, along with the higher-financing receivables that Cathie mentioned in her remarks. 
Now turning to the segments. The Enterprise Group continued its strong momentum, growing revenue 2% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Operating profit improved sequentially by 1 point to 14% and was down 0.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to currency. 
Industry Standard Servers grew 5% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency and was up across all geographies in constant currency. The work we have done segmenting the market and delivering innovative products has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the strong market. We expect server momentum to continue next year but at a moderated pace given more difficult compares. 
Business Critical Systems declined 8% year-over-year but only 2% in constant currency. This was our strongest year-over-year revenue growth in over 3 years as our mission-critical x86 and NonStop platforms offset the challenges from Itanium. 
Storage declined 7% but was flat in constant currency, significantly outperforming the market. Converged Storage grew 17% in constant currency and was 53% of the portfolio. We are now seeing our R&D investments pay off with exceptional growth in All-Flash, which has taken over 10 points of share in the last year. We expect the improving mix of Converged Storage to drive overall growth in fiscal year 2016 at improved margins and with better TS attached. 
Networking grew 35% year-over-year or 43% in constant currency and grew high single digits in constant currency, excluding Aruba. The recent strategic moves we've made are already yielding results. The Aruba acquisition is driving incremental opportunities from the campus wireless refresh, and we've returned the growth in China following the announcement of our partnership with Tsinghua. We expect to close the Tsinghua transaction in Q1. 
TS declined 11% or 4% in constant currency, impacted by tough compare and consulting from the prior year. Order growth was flat year-over-year in local currency, lighter than expected. This was partially due to customers in China waiting for the Tsinghua transaction to close before signing new multiyear support contracts. Additionally, we had a higher mix of Tier-1 service provider growth and servers that attach little support. We're addressing these issues with more value-added services like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care that are increasing our support-attached dollars on a per unit basis. For the full year, orders were up 1% in local currency, and TS continues to be on track for flat constant-currency revenue in fiscal year '16. 
In Enterprise Services, revenue declined 9% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency and was flat when you exclude the top 3 account runoff. For full fiscal 2015, we saw total bookings growth, driven by new logo signings and solid renewals. Our cost actions also delivered strong margin expansion. Profitability was up 1.4 points year-over-year to 8.2% for the quarter, the highest it's been since the second quarter of 2011. 
Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing was down 11% year-over-year or down 4% in constant currency. We saw encouraging constant-currency growth in EMEA, which was previously our most challenged region. 
Application and Business Services was down 5% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency, our strongest constant-currency result in over 3 years. This result is especially encouraging since ABS carries the highest-operating margins within ES. 
In Software, revenue declined 7% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency and was flat when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. The team continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, achieving operating margins of 30.1%, down 1.3 points year-over-year due mostly to currency. We enjoyed good revenue growth in security and double-digit revenue growth in big data year-over-year in constant currency when adjusted for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. 
In particular, license revenue for Vertica increased in excess of 50% year-over-year, driven by several large wins in North America. SaaS also grew year-over-year in constant currency and in each business when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. 
Going forward, we expect better alignment with the Enterprise Group and Enterprise Services to improve cross-selling opportunities. However, we also continue to expect pressure on the top line as we evolve our go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. 
In Financial Services, revenue declined 11% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency with operating profit declining 1.3 points to 11%. The challenges to both revenue and profitability were entirely due to unfavorable currency and a tough compare. Financing is playing an increasingly strategic role for our customers with volume up 9% in constant currency during fiscal year 2015. Financing volume is a good indicator of future revenue performance. The return on equity remained healthy at 16.4%. 
With that, let's turn to the outlook. On the top line, we expect the momentum of Q3 and Q4 constant-currency revenue growth to continue through fiscal year '16. The currency environment continues to be volatile, and based on current rates, we expect a 3-point headwind of revenue in fiscal year '16. 
Before I give our EPS outlook, let me provide some guidance for earnings seasonality at the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In general, EPS will be back-end-loaded for a few reasons: first, both Enterprise Services and Software margins normally expand throughout the year from a low in Q1. Second, the benefits we received from restructuring will continue ramping over time. And finally, the negative impact from dis-synergies will decline throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.37 to $0.41 in the first quarter of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.09 to $0.13 in Q1 of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. We continue to expect free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for the full year. However, please keep in mind that cash flow is seasonally lowest in the first quarter. And in fiscal year '16, it will also be impacted by the majority of the remaining separation payments. 
Finally, for capital allocation, earlier this month, we announced our Q1 dividend of $0.55 per share, in line with our commitment to distribute approximately $400 million in the form of dividends in fiscal year '16. We remain committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow for the full year to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
In closing, let me say that I'm pleased with the progress we are making against the 5 key priorities we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting. The business has momentum, and our financial architecture continues to strengthen. In short, I'm excited about our prospects and the future of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dion."

The Printing and Personal Systems markets are experiencing challenges right now. As we discussed on the Q3 earnings call and in more detail at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expected to have several tough quarters, and Q4 was indeed a difficult quarter and somewhat weaker than we expected. Following separation, we remain confident that we are well positioned for the long term in the marketplace. The market challenges do not intimidate us, and we are keenly aware of what we need to be focused on going forward. 
Turning to the results. Overall, in Q4, our business performance was mixed. In Personal Systems, we executed well against the expected tough market backdrop, while Printing represented a much greater challenge due a number of factors that have changed our midterm view of the market and the supplies revenue trajectory. 
Before I go into those details on Printing, let me briefly reflect on the Q4 results for Personal Systems. The PC market continued to be tough, especially in Consumer, where industry channel inventory remained elevated in the market. While we saw improved performance in the U.S., EMEA remained weak with market units declining 22% year-over-year in the third calendar quarter as we foreshadowed at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
As I've said in the past, when markets are down, our ability to outperform the market profitably is key. HP gained unit share in calendar third quarter in each of our 3 regions, achieving 19.7% market share worldwide. We continue to extend our lead in the market with Commercial PC share of 23.7%, our highest share position ever. And we managed to do this, all while improving Personal Systems operating profit by 8/10 of a point sequentially to 3.8%. We believe that innovation and sprinkles of magic are key to differentiation as the PC market goes through consolidation. 
In Q4, we introduced a robust portfolio of enterprise class and consumer PCs with a number of form factors and industry firsts. And we announced a partnership with Disney and Lucasfilms around Star Wars: The Force Awakens, delighting our customers with the launch of our Star Wars Special Edition Notebook PC. Looking ahead, we expect the PC market to remain challenged for more quarters to come. As expected, Windows 10 has not been a material catalyst for sales yet but continues to receive favorable reviews. We see the most adoption in the U.S. retail segment, and our share here is very strong. We maintained that Disney operating system is important for the industry and a contributing factor to support a future hardware refresh cycle. 
Turning to Printing. We saw accelerated revenue declines across hardware and supplies, and there have been a couple of factors that have changed since the Security Analyst Meeting. The most significant factor was the continued effects of currency movements that have accelerated pricing pressures, even more than we expected in certain profitable segments of the printing markets. 
Secondly, the market was somewhat weaker than we expected in the calendar third quarter, and you're seeing this in our results, and you saw it in the results of some of our peers, some of whom have announced their intentions to reevaluate strategic options. We do not expect the landscape to improve in the near future, and we will constantly assess how the market evolves. In any case, our market leadership and scale serve us well, but we have much more work to do on many dimensions. 
Specifically in hardware, we saw a 17% year-over-year unit decline due to 3 factors. Firstly, the hardware market continued to contract with calendar third quarter total units down 6% year-over-year, down more than we expected. 
Secondly, pressure in the unit performance was a planned channel inventory reduction. We consciously elevated inventory levels in Q3 in advanced of the IT system cutover as part of our separation-related continuity planning. The good news is that with the reduction in Q4, the hardware channel inventory is now within the desired range as we finish the year. So approximately 3/4 of the unit decline is linked to the market and channel inventory reduction. 
Thirdly, with the market down more than expected, the competitive pricing environment was even more challenging in certain profitable segments where usage is high. 
Let me take a moment to outline the impact currency is having on the pricing dynamics in the market. We have seen further reduction in average unit prices in key segments. Our competitors have leveraged currency advantages to drive down pricing, and we have responded in kind. 
This has changed the price points for certain units and means that some units in specific markets were no longer MPV positive. And as we said we would do, we have responsibly been going after profitable share gains and walking away from negative MPV hardware unit deals. 
Another consequence of lower average unit price points is that we are attracting buyers that may have different usage patterns than we originally targeted. For example, the pricing of some of the authorship pro hardware has formed into price bands that are within reach of home users who typically print less. The unintended result is that we are not getting the yield per unit we would have expected on some of these units. 
We see this impacting our supplies revenue trajectory. Q4 '15 supplies revenue was not where we expected it to be, and we have more work to do. We will accelerate initiatives across all of the levers we pull to improve the supplies revenue trajectory. Examples of these initiatives include driving programs to increase ink usage and to increase aftermarket supply share. On ink usage, we expect to accelerate our Instant Ink subscription service with programs that increase our tax rate. In Q4, one of the programs was to expand the number of models and therefore price points that Instant Ink addresses, ensuring more customers never run out of ink. 
We are confident that the fundamentals of the 4-box model are sound. We believe all of these actions will help improve the trajectory of supplies revenue over time. However, given the unit declines and changing usage patents, the data from our 4-box model is indicating that we expect the stabilization in ink supplies revenue to be delayed towards the end of 2017 as we drive these initiatives. 
We are moving quickly on 3 vectors: we remain focused on solutioning the $1 billion of productivity improvements we laid out at the Security Analyst Meeting. Secondly, we can't compete on price alone, so we are balancing our pricing actions with increased marketing and sales activity to stimulate demand. And finally, we have to materially change our non-revenue generating cost structure to compete aggressively. This may both accelerate and increase the previously announced restructuring actions. 
In closing, we firmly believe in our strategy around core growth in the future as outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting. Let me remind you, we are still the leader in large consolidating markets. We have scale, innovation, channel reach and an incredible brand. While the markets are challenging now, we believe the actions we are taking now will protect the core that generates the majority of our cash flow, and of course, we will continue to invest in adjacent market opportunities and our future. 
I'll now turn it over to Cathie, who can provide additional details and our financial outlook."

Printing net revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or down 9% in constant currency. As expected, the year-over-year currency impact was greater than past quarters as favorable long-dated financial hedges matured. From a channel inventory perspective, we've reduced both hardware and supplies levels year-over-year and sequentially, but we are still slightly above-target weeks of supply range for supplies. Supplies revenue was down 10% year-over-year as reported or down 5% on constant currency and was 65% of the revenue mix in the quarter. 
We had some bright spots in the quarter, including constant-currency revenue growth in Graphics. Also, Managed Print Services revenue grew double digits in constant currency year-over-year in Q4. And for fiscal '15, we saw strong growth, both as reported and in constant currency, in total contract value for our partner MPS offering. 
From an operating profit perspective, we delivered 17.4%, down 0.8 points year-over-year. Currency headwinds and competitive pricing were only partially offset by strong supplies mix. 
Turning to Personal Systems. Revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or down 7% in constant currency. Consumer and Commercial PC units were each down year-over-year, but we outperformed the market in calendar Q3, gaining 0.3 points of share in Consumer and 1.6 points of share in Commercial. We've done a lot of work to drive to a variable cost structure, which supports our profitability in these down quarters.  Personal Systems operating process improved sequentially to 3.8% on the strength of gross margins but was down 0.2 points year-over-year as a result of reduced operating expense leverage on lower volumes despite OpEx reductions and improved gross margins. Gaining cost efficiencies will position us well as the market slowly recovers. 
Considering the combined performance of the Printing and Personal Systems segments in the context of the overall Hewlett-Packard Company results, we estimate our pro forma contribution to the non-GAAP EPS result for fiscal '15 to be about $0.01 below the baseline range provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. Our pro forma free cash flow contribution to the company was approximately $2.3 billion for fiscal '15, within the range we outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
Turning to the financial outlook. Beginning in Q1 '16, the new HP Inc. will make a reporting change related to pension. For the last several years, we have had pension income. Our pension liabilities and assets are revalued each October 31 based on interest rates and asset values on that day. This can drive nonoperational volatility in our pension income from year-to-year. For FY '15, this volatility causes a year-over-year decrease in pension income of approximately $90 million, and we don't expect this to have an impact to FY '15 cash flow. Without a change in reporting method, however, this headwind would have put incremental pressure on our investments, and suboptimizing our business for nonoperational impact is not in our best long-term interest. Specifically, the change relates to the expected performance of the planned assets and interest rate movements, the market-related factors in determining pension income or expense. We will exclude these market-related factors from the non-GAAP operational results going forward. 
With this reporting change, the service costs associated with our pension plans and the amortization of prior service costs will continue to be reported as operational expenses within our non-GAAP results. For more information, please refer to the Investor Relations earnings presentation, which includes a few slides detailing the change. 
We believe that going forward, this reporting change provides a greater transparency to underlying operating results. However, the reporting change will result in a reduction of our non-GAAP EPS outlook, given we will now exclude our nonoperational pension income. 
Moving to revenue. As discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expect year-over-year constant-currency declines to moderate, but currency will continue to be a headwind to revenue of about 3 to 4 points in FY '15. Since then, net currency moves have been unfavorable, and we see only incremental pressure to both revenue and operating profit year-over-year. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be about 1 point lower than the 22% to 23% range provided at the Security Analyst Meeting given the pension reporting change noted. 
For Q1 specifically, keep the following things in mind: the Personal Systems and Printing markets continue to be tough. Supplies revenue will continue to be under pressure as we reduce supplies channel inventory, and the supplies revenue trajectory improvement will take longer. Given the pricing dynamics Dion laid out, we expect printer units to be down double digits year-over-year as we continue to focus on profitable unit placements. And finally, productivity improvements are expected to ramp throughout the year. Considering these factors, we expect the first half operating profit to be lower than our typical in-year seasonality. 
With all that in mind, the HP Inc. Q1 '16 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.33 to $0.38, inclusive of the pension reporting change. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $1.59 to $1.69. Operationally, our non-GAAP EPS outlook is unchanged, but with the exclusion of nonoperating pension income, there was a reduction of $0.08 in fiscal '15 as compared to what we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
On a GAAP basis, Q1 '16 GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $0.27 to $0.32, and our full year FY '16 GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $1.50 to $1.60. The reduction in the full-year GAAP EPS outlook of $0.05 in fiscal '16 from what we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting is associated with the following: $0.03 for lower pension income as a result of the revaluation of pension assets and liabilities as of October 31, 2015, and $0.02 is associated with the amortization of intangibles related to the marketing optimization shift to HP Inc. and the separation charges that move from FY '15 to FY '16. For FY '16, we expect our normalized free cash flow to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, consistent with the discussion at the Security Analyst Meeting. However, we are adjusting our free cash flow outlook to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion, down $100 million due to separation payments that slipped from FY '15. 
Finally, for capital allocation, we announced earlier this month that we will be paying a dividend of $0.124 per share in fiscal '16. We remain committed to a total capital return to shareholders for the full year to be at the high end of our overall framework of 50% to 75% of free cash flow. We expect that share repurchases will drive a moderate decline in weighted average shares outstanding beginning in Q1. With that, let's open it up for questions."

So from a separation cost, we had about $300 million of favorability from a free cash flow perspective on the E side in '15. $200 million of that will move over to '16. So if you look at the overall amount of separation costs we were able to -- actually, able to work down the overall amount, so there'll be about a $200 million separation cost increase in '16. If you look at the overall free cash flow and the adjustment to '16, we're still holding to the '16 guide. And basically, our shortfall was driven by a couple of things. If you think about the financing volumes were higher in our financial services business as well as we had some pressure on the VAT receivables that we're unable to collect. That will push over and then give us some favorability in '16, which will offset some of the separation cost pressure. So overall, we're sticking to the guide that we provided at SAM. As far as Tsinghua, we haven't adjusted EPS yet because the deal is not closed. But just to give you some color around that, from the remaining 49% that will stick with us, we're going to account for that with the equity accounting method. So you'll see that earnings and cash flow impact flow through the other income line. And then as far as a guide or framing it up from an EPS perspective, we've said historically that we've earned -- we had about $400 million of profit in that business in 2014, so I think you could use that as a proxy. And then I'd just take a couple of things into account: One would be the timing of the transaction, so when we close it; and then the second thing I would think about is there will be some stranded costs associated with overhead costs that do not go with the transaction. So similar to dissynergy costs, we will need to work that out of the system and that will take a little bit of time, so that's the Tsinghua impact."

First of all because we now have a great server, storage, networking, converged offering. But as we move to these 4 transformation areas that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting, this is dead-on with customers. I mean, these 4 transformation areas is exactly what virtually every customer is looking for. How do I transform my IT environment to a hybrid environment? How do I secure my digital enterprise? How do I enable analytics, big data analytics environment? And how do I drive workplace productivity? And we are aligning software services and hardware or infrastructure to that. And this is particularly powerful for software because software now has some of the anchor IP in each of these areas and it's also helping us decide what parts of software we want to be in and what parts we don't. We've talked about LiveVault and TippingPoint. This core transformation area gives us a very good portfolio criteria by which to manage that software business. So I think the transformation areas are absolutely right on for customers, and we feel like we've got a pretty good portfolio. And where we have gaps, our first choice will be to do organic innovation, second choice will be around partnering with our ventures arm and then finally would be M&A along the lines of a 3PAR, 3Com, Aruba kind of acquisition."

I guess, I'll start and then I'll throw it to Dion to add any additional comments. We have found that our 4-box model is, in fact, very good. And as we have collected more big data, and every week we collect new data, we update basically the model. What we saw in Q4 were basically 2 things that really impacted the model and impacted when the ink supplies would stabilize and push it out to basically late '17. The first thing was we did see incremental competitiveness in key segments, particularly in SMB ink and, therefore, we placed less units. And as a result of that, that's going to have a knock-on effect around ink supplies. Secondly, what we saw was, through aggressive pricing, we actually took a -- we took a product that should've been sold into 1 end-user, an end-user that, in fact, prints a lot, and we now are getting -- selling that product into home users which just don't print enough. And so we need to change that. And that's part of better managing the marketing, better managing basically the price points. And that has a knock-on effect because those were units that we had expected would be very high usage. So we have a lot of confidence in the model, but you have to work the model all the time and it's across those 4 dimensions that we've talked about, the installed base usage, aftermarket share and then also making sure that we're careful about what we do from the supplies pricing perspective."

And as a result of that, we need to go to the gym, we need to get fit, we need to deal with currency, the way that it's exposing itself in the market and the ramifications it's having in the marketplace and do the 3 things that we talked about, drive those productivity improvements, not fight on price alone, balance marketing and sales and materially go after nonrevenue-generating expenses. When we do that, we can turn marginal NPV units that have slipped into negative back into positive territory and that will then reinform the 4-box model."

What I would tell you is we feel really good about our strategy relative to what we see Dell and EMC doing. I mean, they could not be in more stark contrast. They're getting bigger, leveraging up and doubling down mostly on legacy technology, while our strategy is to get smaller. I've just spent the last 4 years deleveraging the balance sheet and leaning into new technology like converged infrastructure, new server architectures, 3PAR with all-flash, Aruba, et cetera. So we feel really good about our strategy and our portfolio of assets. And I'll underscore what I said before, these 4 transformation areas is the way we're going to pivot this company to solutions-selling. ES already solution-sells. EG and software are moving rapidly towards that solution of driving business outcomes as opposed to just selling speeds and feeds.

It seems like it may compress some of that a little bit, but maybe I'm wrong on that. And then the second -- the other question for Dion and/or Cathie would be, I think you'd mentioned that you said the PC channel had some elevated inventory. And I believe we heard about this when you are going through the separation and you wanted to have your systems make sure that they converted over, but that was several months ago. So are you referring to excess inventory in the channel from HP or others or both? Or how should we think about that comment? Because I would've thought by now that, that PC inventory or anything due to your separation in the IT conversion cycles would've already right side themselves."

So the ES business is changing, and you will recall in the old days, and particularly the ITO part of the business, you would lose money in the first 2 years of the contract then you break even for about 3 years and then you'd make money in the final 4 years. But the only problem with that is that in about year 8, the customer would renegotiate, and you'd miss out on the whole profit of the whole thing. And so really, the markets moved to shorter, more strategic relationships in ITO as opposed to just labor arbitrage. Now there is how do we transform your infrastructure to be more nimble, more agile and lower cost? And we've talked about a number of our customers for whom we're not just taking their mess for less in the old days, that's probably what we would've done. Now we are saying we will help transform your IT environment to be part of this new world order that's going to allow it to be lower-cost, more modern and allow you to be more agile. And those contracts are -- tend to be shorter and we're actually okay with that because we also are very clear now that we're not going to lose money in contracts in years 1 and 2, and these things have to be profitable from the beginning. And that's been a change in the industry and, frankly, a change that we're putting a lot of discipline in. We're very, very focused on only taking deals that are good business for us. And like Dion said in his business, share for share's sake is not interesting to us here. We want to do good, profitable deals with customers that we can drive a good outcome for. And you're seeing that. I mean we said at our analyst meeting, we now have the highest net promoter score in the business, in the Services business. And that, ultimately, and we can see it, is going to translate I think higher new logos and higher TCV."

Going forward, starting with Q1 fiscal '16, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will report earnings as separate companies. I will outline how the call will flow today since it will be a little different than our typical earnings calls. 
Meg will kick things off with Q4 highlights for Hewlett-Packard Company, and Cathie will follow with additional details. After that, Meg and Tim will review segment results and outlook for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Then Dion and Cathie will review segment results and outlook for HP Inc. Finally, we'll open it up to questions. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and a slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our HP Inc.'s Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com and on Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Investor Relations web page at www.hpe.com. 
As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. 
We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP Inc.'s and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. 
For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. 
Finally, each of the unaudited pro forma Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc.'s fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and cash flow information presented in this call and the accompanying presentation is based on the estimated contributions of each company to Hewlett-Packard Company's fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS and cash flow as adjusted to give effect to the separation transaction effective on November 1, 2015. 
The pro forma amounts do not necessarily reflect that the fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS and cash flow of Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP Inc. would have been had the separation occurred on November 1, 2014. They also may not be useful in predicting the future financial condition and results of operations of the separate companies. The actual financial positions and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors.
With that, let me turn it over to Meg."

Hewlett-Packard Company net revenue for the quarter was $25.7 billion, down 9% year-over-year as reported or down 3% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $103.4 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported or down 2% in constant currency. Gross margin was 24.7%, up 0.1 point year-over-year and up 0.9 points quarter-over-quarter, with sequential improvement across all of our major business segments. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were down 5% year-over-year, driven by a reduction in SG&A, partially offset by our continued focus on increasing our R&D investments. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was 9.1%, down 0.5 points year-over-year and up 0.5 points sequentially. With a net expense of $151 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.8 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.93 in Q4, within our outlook range. 
Q4 non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $676 million for separation, $591 million for restructuring, $246 million for amortization of intangible assets and net tax benefits of $803 million. 
For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.59, in line with our previously provided outlook range. 
On a GAAP basis, Q4 diluted net earnings per share was $0.73, above our outlook range due to the net tax benefits just mentioned. These were onetime, noncash entries comprising a number of different items, including the reversal of a previously recorded U.S. tax valuation allowance that I discussed on the Q3 earnings call. 
The total separation costs, CapEx and associated cash flows expected across FY '15 and FY '16, in total, were originally $2.8 billion. And we now expect $2.4 billion in that same time period. The mix of expenses between onetime separation costs, CapEx and incremental taxes was different than planned, with taxes coming in well under our plans in Q4. 
The 2012 restructuring program is nearly complete, with approximately 4,300 people exiting the company in Q4 '15 and just under 56,000 cumulative reductions for the program to date. Even with labor migration, we are down a net 59,000 people over this time frame. 
In Q4, we recorded GAAP-only charges of $591 million. Approximately $200 million were the final charges associated with the 2012 program, and the remainder were associated with the new restructuring program that each company discussed at their respective Security Analyst Meetings in September. 
We delivered cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.8 billion in the quarter. This brings our total free cash flow for the year to $3.3 billion, which is just below our outlook range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. There was a tailwind from separation costs coming in lower as described. This was more than offset by the following: other receivables, including VAT; elevated financing receivables driven by higher HP Financial Services volume; cash outflow for restructuring; and lower earnings. 
In Q4, we returned $638 million of capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, and $4.1 billion was returned to shareholders for the full year. We returned over 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders in fiscal '15, even excluding the capital return of $750 million that completed our 2014 commitment. 
I'll now turn it over to Meg and Tim to discuss the results of the segments that are now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Then Dion and I will return to share comments on Printing and Personal Systems, the new HP Inc."

As we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting in September, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has 5 key priorities for FY '16. We plan to grow top line revenue in constant currency, drive a year-over-year increase in operating profit, grow free",1277,"Thanks, Cathie. As we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting in September, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has 5 key priorities for FY '16. We plan to grow top line revenue in constant currency, drive a year-over-year increase in operating profit, grow free cash flow, continue to execute our innovation road map and stabilize revenue and expand margins in Enterprise Services. And I'm pleased to say that overall, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is off to a very strong start. First and foremost, the segments that comprise HPE have now had 2 consecutive quarters of constant-currency revenue growth, and we believe we're in a strong position to deliver on our plans to grow overall in FY '16 in constant currency. 
Also, while there is more work to do, particularly in ES, our cost structure is much closer to where it needs to be, thanks to aggressive supply chain management, SKU rationalization and workforce rebalancing. 
With respect to cash, we are starting the year with a net cash position at the operating company level and as separation costs wind down, we are well positioned to increase cash flow at FY '16. The innovation we've been investing in over the past 4 years is paying off. We've introduced breakthrough new solutions and services that have driven a mix shift in our portfolio towards higher-growth products and services. By leaning into new technology, we are ideally positioned to take advantage of market trends that will allow us to continue to take share from our competitors and to drive long-term growth. 
Finally, while each business segment faces different challenges and opportunities, the company as a whole is aligning tightly around the 4 customer transformation areas we discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting. Customers tell us our focus is spot-on. I'm confident that our clear strategy will accelerate the significant progress we've already made in our financial performance. 
Now, before Tim gets into the financial details, let me provide some highlights from the quarter across each segment. In Enterprise Group, we performed exceptionally well, with strong revenue growth up 2% as reported or 9% in constant currency and improved profitability on a sequential basis. 
Our Industry Standard Server business was strong, with constant-currency revenue growth across all regions, driven by solid core growth and increasing demand from Tier 1 service providers. Looking forward, we are well positioned to benefit from the server market upswing, driven by the growth in cloud and big data. 
The Networking business also performed, well with the Aruba acquisition driving strong cross-selling opportunities across wireless and data center switching. 
Storage significantly outpaced the market, and we expect that we gained close to a point of share in the third calendar quarter. 
Our 3PAR All-Flash portfolio is outperforming the competition. 3PAR All-Flash is now a $500 million annualized run rate business and grew triple digits in the fourth quarter. That's larger and growing faster than Pure in their most recently reported quarter. In fact, just last week, Gartner rated 3PAR as the best storage product on the market across every use case category. This is a powerful recommendation to our customers and partners and will help us continue to drive share gains against our competitors. 
Finally, in Technology Services. We continue to see a growing proportion of the business come from high-value services like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care, while operating margins remained steady. 
Turning to Enterprise Services. We had the best performance in Q4 that we've had in years due to a more diversified customer base, stabilized constant-currency revenue growth and a significantly reduced cost structure. Revenue declined 2% in constant currency, although we grew new logos and saw double-digit growth in Strategic Enterprise Services, driven by strength in Helion cloud and security services. Operating profit was 8% in the quarter, the best performance since 2011. For the full year, both revenue and operating margins were in the range of our outlook. Looking ahead, we have a clear plan in place to get to a longer-term sustainable target operating margin of 7% to 9%. 
In Software, we delivered strong margins while continuing to take steps to align the portfolio and the go-to-market approach with the 4 transformation areas. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year in constant currency or flat, if you normalize for recent M&A transactions on a pro forma basis. During the quarter, we announced several transactions, including the sale of TippingPoint and LiveVault, which will allow us to focus our resources and investments in higher-growth strategic businesses. 
Finally, our Financial Services business continues to be a differentiator for the company. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Financial Services helps customers by creating consumption-based models to buy new technology or financing programs to transition out of legacy systems. Total FY '15 financing volume increased 9% year-over-year in constant currency. 
As I have said before, HPE's innovation engine is humming, and Q4 was no exception. During the quarter, we introduced important new solutions and continued to see strong customer traction across the portfolio. For example, in September, we announced several new security solutions to help customers quickly detect high-risk threats, reduced data breach impact and enhance overall security. We also won several significant new security deals in the quarter, including new wins for our Voltage and Fortify solutions with a major financial services company. 
In Enterprise Services, we announced a significant new partnership with Microsoft and HP Inc. to enable Windows 10 adoption and drive employee mobility for the enterprise. As part of the agreement, we will build and sell industry-specific business applications for Windows 10 across key industries such as retail, energy and transportation. This agreement is a great example of how Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will work together going forward. 
In Servers, we saw continued strong customer momentum with our leading portfolio of Apollo high-performance compute solutions. We are the clear market leader in high-performance computing. And today, more than 1/3 of the market is leveraging HPE compute platforms to process, analyze and manage data securely. 
Cloud is another important growth driver for us, and we saw strong momentum in the quarter. We are the leading cloud infrastructure provider, and we see a significant opportunity as enterprises move to a hybrid cloud environment. 
In late October, we announced HP Helion OpenStack 2.0, our latest enterprise-grade cloud platform with new life cycle management and security enhancements. We believe strongly in open standards, and our OpenStack-based cloud offerings provide the open, agile and secure hybrid cloud environment our customers are asking for. 
We also refined our cloud strategy during the quarter. Our goal is to help customers source, manage and consume services across traditional, private, public and managed cloud environments. To that end, we announced in October that we will double down on our private and managed cloud capabilities and sunset our public cloud offering. This is the right move. It plays to our strengths in private and managed cloud. We will continue to extend our cloud infrastructure leadership and integrate the public cloud element for our customers through a strategic partner-based model. 
In line with that approach, we've reached an agreement with Microsoft that you'll hear more about during Discover next week. Microsoft shares our view of a hybrid-IT approach for enterprises, and we both see opportunity to simplify hybrid infrastructure for our customers. Going forward, Microsoft and Azure will become a preferred public cloud partner. HPE will serve as a preferred provider of Microsoft's infrastructure and services for its hybrid cloud offerings. 
Overall, the move to a hybrid cloud environment presents a significant growth opportunity for us, and you can expect to hear more about our approach in coming months. 
And on that note, I'll hand the call over to Tim Stonesifer."

Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year on a strong note, and we're already executing against the financial architecture we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting. This calls for solid growth from EG, with stable to slightly up margins, stabilizing revenue and ES with strong margin expansion, stabilizing software revenue with good profitability, all while leveraging Financial Services with their good return on equity. 
In Q4, our segments collectively delivered revenue of $14.1 billion, which was up 3% year-over-year in constant currency. This marks the second quarter in a row of delivering year-over-year constant-currency growth, and we expect to take share in x86 servers, storage and networking during the third calendar quarter. 
For the full fiscal year 2015, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $1.84, in the middle of the previously provided outlook. Similarly, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total free cash flow for the year to be $1 billion, just below the previously provided outlook. We benefited from a push-out of separation costs that was offset primarily by the timing of value-added tax receivables and restructuring payments, along with the higher-financing receivables that Cathie mentioned in her remarks. 
Now turning to the segments. The Enterprise Group continued its strong momentum, growing revenue 2% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Operating profit improved sequentially by 1 point to 14% and was down 0.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to currency. 
Industry Standard Servers grew 5% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency and was up across all geographies in constant currency. The work we have done segmenting the market and delivering innovative products has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of this strong market. We expect server momentum to continue next year but at a moderated pace given more difficult compares. 
Business Critical Systems declined 8% year-over-year but only 2% in constant currency. This was our strongest year-over-year revenue growth in over 3 years as our mission-critical x86 and NonStop platforms offset the challenges from Itanium. 
Storage declined 7% but was flat in constant currency, significantly outperforming the market. Converged Storage grew 17% in constant currency and was 53% of the portfolio. We are now seeing our R&D investments pay off with exceptional growth in All-Flash, which has taken over 10 points of share in the last year. We expect the improving mix of Converged Storage to drive overall growth in fiscal year 2016 at improved margins and with better TS attach. 
Networking grew 35% year-over-year or 43% in constant currency and grew high single digits in constant currency, excluding Aruba. The recent strategic moves we've made are already yielding results. The Aruba acquisition is driving incremental opportunities from the campus wireless refresh, and we've returned to growth in China following the announcement of our partnership with Tsinghua. We expect to close the Tsinghua transaction in Q1. 
TS declined 11% or 4% in constant currency, impacted by tough compare in consulting from the prior year. Order growth was flat year-over-year in local currency, lighter than expected. This was partially due to customers in China waiting for the Tsinghua transaction to close before signing new multiyear support contracts. Additionally, we had a higher mix of Tier 1 service provider growth in Servers that attach little support. We're addressing these issues with more value-added services like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care that are increasing our support-attached dollars on a per unit basis. For the full year, orders were up 1% in local currency, and TS continues to be on track for flat constant-currency revenue in fiscal year '16. 
In Enterprise Services, revenue declined 9% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency and was flat when you exclude the top 3 account runoff. For full fiscal 2015, we saw total bookings growth, driven by new logo signings and solid renewals. Our cost actions also delivered strong margin expansion. Profitability was up 1.4 points year-over-year to 8.2% for the quarter, the highest it's been since the second quarter of 2011. 
Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing was down 11% year-over-year or down 4% in constant currency. We saw encouraging constant-currency growth in EMEA, which was previously our most challenged region. 
Application and Business Services was down 5% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency, our strongest constant-currency result in over 3 years. This result is especially encouraging since ABS carries the highest-operating margins within ES. 
In Software, revenue declined 7% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency and was flat when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. The team continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, achieving operating margins of 30.1%, down 1.3 points year-over-year due mostly to currency. We enjoyed good revenue growth in security and double-digit revenue growth in big data year-over-year in constant currency when adjusted for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. 
In particular, license revenue for Vertica increased in excess of 50% year-over-year, driven by several large wins in North America. SaaS also grew year-over-year in constant currency and in each business when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. 
Going forward, we expect better alignment with the Enterprise Group and Enterprise Services to improve cross-selling opportunities. However, we also continue to expect pressure on the top line as we evolve our go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. 
In Financial Services, revenue declined 11% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency, with operating profit declining 1.3 points to 11%. The challenges to both revenue and profitability were entirely due to unfavorable currency and a tough compare. Financing is playing an increasingly strategic role for our customers, with volume up 9% in constant currency during fiscal year 2015. Financing volume is a good indicator of future revenue performance. The return on equity remained healthy at 16.4%. 
With that, let's turn to the outlook. On the top line, we expect the momentum of Q3 and Q4 constant-currency revenue growth to continue through fiscal year '16. The currency environment continues to be volatile, and based on current rates, we expect a 3-point headwind of revenue in fiscal year '16. 
Before I give our EPS outlook, let me provide some guidance for earnings seasonality at the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In general, EPS will be back-end-loaded for a few reasons: First, both Enterprise Services and Software margins normally expand throughout the year from a low in Q1; second, the benefits we receive from restructuring will continue ramping over time; and finally, the negative impact from dis-synergies will decline throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.37 to $0.41 in the first quarter of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.09 to $0.13 in Q1 of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. We continue to expect free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for the full year. However, please keep in mind that cash flow is seasonally lowest in the first quarter. And in fiscal year '16, it will also be impacted by the majority of the remaining separation payments. 
Finally, for capital allocation, earlier this month, we announced our Q1 dividend of $0.055 per share, in line with our commitment to distribute approximately $400 million in the form of dividends in fiscal year '16. We remain committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow for the full year to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
In closing, let me say that I'm pleased with the progress we are making against the 5 key priorities we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting. The business has momentum, and our financial architecture continues to strengthen. In short, I'm excited about our prospects and the future of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dion."

The Printing and Personal Systems markets are experiencing challenges right now. As we discussed on the Q3 earnings call and in more detail at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expected to have several tough quarters, and Q4 was indeed a difficult quarter and somewhat weaker than we expected. Following separation, we remain confident that we are well positioned for the long term in the marketplace. The market challenges do not intimidate us, and we are keenly aware of what we need to be focused on going forward. 
Turning to the results. Overall, in Q4, our business performance was mixed. In Personal Systems, we executed well against the expected tough market backdrop, while Printing represented a much greater challenge due a number of factors that have changed our near-term view of the market and the supplies revenue trajectory. 
Before I go into those details on Printing, let me briefly reflect on the Q4 results for Personal Systems. The PC market continued to be tough, especially in Consumer, where industry channel inventory remained elevated in the market. While we saw improved performance in the U.S., EMEA remained weak, with market units declining 22% year-over-year in the third calendar quarter as we foreshadowed at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
As I've said in the past, when markets are down, our ability to outperform the market profitably is key. HP gained unit share in calendar third quarter in each of our 3 regions, achieving 19.7% market share worldwide. We continue to extend our lead in the market with Commercial PC share of 23.7%, our highest share position ever. And we managed to do this all while improving Personal Systems operating profit by 0.8 of 1 point sequentially to 3.8%. We believe that innovation and sprinkles of magic are key to differentiation as the PC market goes through consolidation. 
In Q4, we introduced a robust portfolio of enterprise class and consumer PCs with a number of form factors and industry firsts. And we announced a partnership with Disney and Lucasfilms around Star Wars: The Force Awakens, delighting our customers with the launch of our Star Wars Special Edition Notebook PC. 
Looking ahead, we expect the PC market to remain challenged for more quarters to come. As expected, Windows 10 has not been a material catalyst for sales yet but continues to receive favorable reviews. We see the most adoption in the U.S. retail segment, and our share here is very strong. We maintain that this new operating system is important for the industry and a contributing factor to support a future hardware refresh cycle. 
Turning to Printing. We saw accelerated revenue declines across hardware and supplies, and there have been a couple of factors that have changed since the Security Analyst Meeting. The most significant factor was the continued effects of currency movements that have accelerated pricing pressures, even more than we expected in certain profitable segments of the printing markets. 
Secondly, the market was somewhat weaker than we expected in the calendar third quarter, and you're seeing this in our results, and you saw it in the results of some of our peers, some of whom have announced their intentions to reevaluate strategic options. We do not expect the landscape to improve in the near future, and we will constantly assess how the market evolves. In any case, our market leadership and scale serve us well, but we have much more work to do on many dimensions. 
Specifically in hardware, we saw a 17% year-over-year unit decline due to 3 factors. Firstly, the hardware market continued to contract with calendar third quarter total units down 6% year-over-year, down more than we expected. 
Secondly, pressure in the unit performance was a planned channel inventory reduction. We consciously elevated inventory levels in Q3 in advance of the IT system cutover as part of our separation-related continuity planning. The good news is that with the reduction in Q4, the hardware channel inventory is now within the desired range as we finish the year. So approximately 3/4 of the unit decline is linked to the market and channel inventory reduction. 
Thirdly, with the market down more than expected, the competitive pricing environment was even more challenging in certain profitable segments where usage is high. 
Let me take a moment to outline the impact currency is having on the pricing dynamics in the market. We have seen further reduction in average unit prices in key segments. Our competitors have leveraged currency advantages to drive down pricing, and we have responded in kind. 
This has changed the price points for certain units and means that some units in specific markets were no longer MPV positive. And as we said we would do, we have responsibly been going after profitable share gains and walking away from negative MPV hardware unit deals. 
Another consequence of lower average unit price points is that we are attracting buyers that may have different usage patterns than we originally targeted. For example, the pricing of some of the Officejet pro hardware has fallen into price bands that are within reach of home users who typically print less. The unintended result is that we are not getting the yield per unit we would have expected on some of these units. 
We see this impacting our supplies revenue trajectory. Q4 '15 supplies revenue was not where we expected it to be, and we have more work to do. We will accelerate initiatives across all of the levers we pull to improve the supplies revenue trajectory. Examples of these initiatives include driving programs to increase ink usage and to increase aftermarket supply share. On ink usage, we expect to accelerate our Instant Ink subscription service, with programs that increase our attach rate. In Q4, one of the programs was to expand the number of models and therefore price points that Instant Ink addresses, ensuring more customers never run out of ink. 
We are confident that the fundamentals of the 4-box model are sound. We believe all of these actions will help improve the trajectory of supplies revenue over time. However, given the unit declines and changing usage patterns, the data from our 4-box model is indicating that we expect the stabilization in ink supplies revenue to be delayed towards the end of 2017 as we drive these initiatives. 
We are moving quickly on 3 vectors: We remain focused on solution-ing the $1 billion of productivity improvements we laid out at the Security Analyst Meeting; secondly, we can't compete on price alone, so we are balancing our pricing actions with increased marketing and sales activity to stimulate demand; and finally, we have to materially change our non-revenue generating cost structure to compete aggressively. This may both accelerate and increase the previously announced restructuring actions. 
In closing, we firmly believe in our strategy around core growth in the future as outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting. Let me remind you, we are still the leader in large consolidating markets. We have scale, innovation, channel reach and an incredible brand. While the markets are challenging now, we believe the actions we are taking now will protect the core that generates the majority of our cash flow, and of course, we will continue to invest in adjacent market opportunities and our future. 
I'll now turn it over to Cathie, who can provide additional details and our financial outlook."

Printing net revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or down 9% in constant currency. As expected, the year-over-year currency impact was greater than past quarters as favorable long-dated financial hedges matured. From a channel inventory perspective, we've reduced both hardware and supplies levels year-over-year and sequentially, but we are still slightly above-target weeks of supply range for supplies. Supplies revenue was down 10% year-over-year as reported or down 5% on constant currency and was 65% of the revenue mix in the quarter. 
We had some bright spots in the quarter, including constant-currency revenue growth in Graphics. Also, Managed Print Services revenue grew double digits in constant currency year-over-year in Q4. And for fiscal '15, we saw strong growth, both as reported and in constant currency, in total contract value for our partner MPS offering. 
From an operating profit perspective, we delivered 17.4%, down 0.8 points year-over-year. Currency headwinds and competitive pricing were only partially offset by strong supplies mix. 
Turning to Personal Systems. Revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or down 7% in constant currency. Consumer and Commercial PC units were each down year-over-year, but we outperformed the market in calendar Q3, gaining 0.3 points of share in Consumer and 1.6 points of share in Commercial. We've done a lot of work to drive to a variable cost structure, which supports our profitability in these down quarters.  Personal Systems' operating process improved sequentially to 3.8% on the strength of gross margins but was down 0.2 points year-over-year as a result of reduced operating expense leverage on lower volumes despite OpEx reductions and improved gross margins. Gaining cost efficiencies will position us well as the market slowly recovers. 
Considering the combined performance of the Printing and Personal Systems segments in the context of the overall Hewlett-Packard Company results, we estimate our pro forma contribution to the non-GAAP EPS result for fiscal '15 to be about $0.01 below the baseline range provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. Our pro forma free cash flow contribution to the company was approximately $2.3 billion for fiscal '15, within the range we outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
Turning to the financial outlook. Beginning in Q1 '16, the new HP Inc. will make a reporting change related to pension. For the last several years, we have had pension income. Our pension liabilities and assets are revalued each October 31 based on interest rates and asset values on that day. This can drive nonoperational volatility in our pension income from year-to-year. For FY '15, this volatility causes a year-over-year decrease in pension income of approximately $90 million, and we don't expect this to have an impact to FY '16 cash flow. Without a change in reporting method, however, this headwind would have put incremental pressure on our investments, and suboptimizing our business for nonoperational impact is not in our best long-term interest. Specifically, the change relates to the expected performance of the planned assets and interest rate movements, the market-related factors in determining pension income or expense. We will exclude these market-related factors from the non-GAAP operational results going forward. 
With this reporting change, the service costs associated with our pension plans and the amortization of prior service costs will continue to be reported as operational expenses within our non-GAAP results. For more information, please refer to the Investor Relations earnings presentation, which includes a few slides detailing the change. 
We believe that going forward, this reporting change provides a greater transparency to underlying operating results. However, the reporting change will result in a reduction of our non-GAAP EPS outlook, given we will now exclude our nonoperational pension income. 
Moving to revenue. As discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expect year-over-year constant-currency declines to moderate, but currency will continue to be a headwind to revenue of about 3 to 4 points in FY '16. Since then, net currency moves have been unfavorable, and we see only incremental pressure to both revenue and operating profit year-over-year. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be about 1 point lower than the 22% to 23% range provided at the Security Analyst Meeting given the pension reporting change noted. 
For Q1 specifically, keep the following things in mind. The Personal Systems and Printing markets continue to be tough. Supplies revenue will continue to be under pressure as we reduce supplies channel inventory, and the supplies revenue trajectory improvement will take longer. Given the pricing dynamics Dion laid out, we expect printer units to be down double digits year-over-year as we continue to focus on profitable unit placements. And finally, productivity improvements are expected to ramp throughout the year. Considering these factors, we expect the first half operating profit to be lower than our typical in-year seasonality. 
With all that in mind, the HP Inc. Q1 '16 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.33 to $0.38, inclusive of the pension reporting change. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $1.59 to $1.69. Operationally, our non-GAAP EPS outlook is unchanged, but with the exclusion of nonoperating pension income, there is a reduction of $0.08 in fiscal '16 as compared to what we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
On a GAAP basis, Q1 '16 GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $0.27 to $0.32, and our full year FY '16 GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $1.50 to $1.60. The reduction in the full-year GAAP EPS outlook of $0.05 in fiscal '16 from what we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting is associated with the following: $0.03 for lower pension income as a result of the revaluation of pension assets and liabilities as of October 31, 2015, and $0.02 is associated with the amortization of intangibles related to the marketing optimization shift to HP Inc. and the separation charges that move from FY '15 to FY '16. For FY '16, we expect our normalized free cash flow to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, consistent with the discussion at the Security Analyst Meeting. However, we are adjusting our free cash flow outlook to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion, down $100 million due to separation payments that slipped from FY '15. 
Finally, for capital allocation, we announced earlier this month that we will be paying a dividend of $0.124 per share in fiscal '16. We remain committed to a total capital return to shareholders for the full year to be at the high end of our overall framework of 50% to 75% of free cash flow. We expect that share repurchases will drive a moderate decline in weighted average shares outstanding beginning in Q1. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Let me start out with the cash flow.

So from a separation cost, we had about $300 million of favorability from a free cash flow perspective on the E side in '15. $200 million of that will move over to '16. So if you look at the overall amount of separation costs we were able to -- actually, able to work down the overall amount, so there'll be about a $200 million separation cost increase in '16. If you look at the overall free cash flow and the adjustment to '16, we're still holding to the '16 guide. And basically, our shortfall was driven by a couple of things. If you think about the financing volumes were higher in our Financial Services business, as well as we had some pressure on the VAT receivables that we were unable to collect. That will push over and then give us some favorability in '16, which will offset some of the separation cost pressure. So overall, we're sticking to the guide that we provided at SAM. As far as Tsinghua, we haven't adjusted EPS yet because the deal is not closed. But just to give you some color around that, from the remaining 49% that will stick with us, we're going to account for that with the equity accounting method. So you'll see that earnings and cash flow impact flow through the other income line. And then as far as a guide or framing it up from an EPS perspective, we've said historically that we've earned -- we had about $400 million of op profit in that business in 2014, so I think you could use that as a proxy. And then I'd just take a couple of things into account: One would be the timing of the transaction, so when we close it; and then the second thing I would think about is there will be some stranded costs associated with overhead costs that do not go with the transaction. So similar to dis-synergy costs, we will need to work that out of the system and that will take a little bit of time, so that's the Tsinghua impact."

And this is particularly powerful for software because software now has some of the anchor IP in each of these areas and it's also helping us decide what parts of software we want to be in and what parts we don't. And we talked about LiveVault and TippingPoint. This 4 transformation area gives us a very good portfolio criteria by which to manage that software business. So I think the transformation areas are absolutely right on for customers, and we feel like we've got a pretty good portfolio. And where we have gaps, our first choice will be to do organic innovation; second choice will be around partnering with our Ventures arm; and then finally, would be M&A along the lines of a 3PAR, 3Com, Aruba kind of acquisition."

On the supplies business, what I think I've heard is the market's a little bit worse, the pricing environment's tough and inventory levels may be high. I guess, can you speak about the visibility you have on each of those items beginning to improve? And then kind of linked to that is that I think, once upon a time, not so long ago, you were saying that the supplies business would stabilize by the middle of this year. Then it was by the end of '16, now it's by the end of '17. So this 4-box model which manages business which is supposed to give this predictability, it doesn't seem that predictable I guess. So my question is how much faith do you have in that continued model about that supplies business eventually turning?"

I guess, I'll start and then I'll throw it to Dion to add any additional comments. We have found that our 4-box model is, in fact, very good. And as we have collected more big data, and every week we collect new data, we update basically the model. What we saw in Q4 were basically 2 things that really impacted the model and impacted when the ink supplies would stabilize and push it out to basically late '17. The first thing was we did see incremental competitiveness in key segments, particularly in SMB ink and, therefore, we placed less units. And as a result of that, that's going to have a knock-on effect around ink supplies. Secondly, what we saw was, through aggressive pricing, we actually took a -- we took a product that should've been sold into 1 end-user, an end-user that, in fact, prints a lot, and we now are getting -- selling that product into home users which just don't print enough. And so we need to change that. And that's part of better managing the marketing, better managing basically the price points. And that has a knock-on effect because those were units that we had expected would be very high usage. So we have a lot of confidence in the model, but you have to work the model all the time and it's across those 4 dimensions that we've talked about, the installed base, usage, aftermarket share and then also making sure that we're careful about what we do from a supplies pricing perspective."

But there are dynamics in the market, competitive dynamics in the market that just our working assumptions need to change around it. It's exactly how it is going to be. And as a result of that, we need to go to the gym, we need to get fit, we need to deal with currency, the way that it's exposing itself in the market and the ramifications it's having on the marketplace and do the 3 things that we talked about, drive those productivity improvements, not fight on price alone, balance marketing and sales and materially go after nonrevenue-generating expenses. When we do that, we can turn marginal MPV units that have slipped into negative back into positive territory and that will then reinform the 4-box model."

So listen, obviously, I think one of the things that validates the decision to separate is these markets are changing enormously. I mean Dion talked about a couple of his competitors looking at strategic opportunities. We also, obviously, see the Dell-EMC transaction. What I would tell you is we feel really good about our strategy relative to what we see Dell and EMC doing. I mean, they could not be in more stark contrast. They're getting bigger, leveraging up and doubling down mostly on legacy technology, while our strategy is to get smaller. I've just spent the last 4 years deleveraging the balance sheet and leaning into new technology like converged infrastructure, new server architectures, 3PAR with All-Flash, Aruba, et cetera. So we feel really good about our strategy and our portfolio of assets. And I'll underscore what I said before, these 4 transformation areas is the way we're going to pivot this company to solutions-selling. ES already solution-sells. EG and software are moving rapidly towards that solution of driving business outcomes as opposed to just selling speeds and feeds. And it's a cultural change for this company, but actually I will tell you it's underway and I'm feeling pretty good about it."

It seems like it may compress some of that a little bit, but maybe I'm wrong on that. And then the second -- or the other question for Dion and/or Cathie would be, I think you'd mentioned that you said the PC channel had some elevated inventory. And I believe we heard about this when you were going through the separation and you wanted to have your systems make sure that they converted over, but that was several months ago. So are you referring to excess inventory in the channel from HP or others or both? Or how should we think about that comment? Because I would have thought by now that, that PC inventory or anything due to your separation in the IT conversion cycles would have already right sided themself."

So the ES business is changing, and you will recall in the old days, in particularly the ITO part of the business, you would lose money in the first 2 years of the contract, then you'd break even for about 3 years and then you'd make money in the final 4 years. But the only problem with that is then, about year 8, the customer would renegotiate, and you'd miss out on the whole profit of the whole thing. And so really, the markets moved to shorter, more strategic relationships in ITO. As opposed to just labor arbitrage, now there is how do we transform your infrastructure to be more nimble, more agile and lower cost? And we've talked about a number of our customers for whom we're not just taking their mess for less. In the old days, that's probably what we would have done. Now we are saying, ""We will help transform your IT environment to be part of this new world order that's going to allow it to be lower-cost, more modern and allow you to be more agile."" And those contracts are -- tend to be shorter and we're actually okay with that because we also are very clear now that we're not going to lose money in contracts in years 1 and 2, and these things have to be profitable from the beginning. And that's been a change in the industry and, frankly, a change that we're putting a lot of discipline in. We're very, very focused on only taking deals that are good business for us. And like Dion said in his business, share for share's sake is not interesting to us here. We want to do good, profitable deals with customers that we can drive a good outcome for. And you're seeing that. I mean we said at our analyst meeting, we now have the highest Net Promoter Score in the business, in the Services business. And that, ultimately, and we can see it, is going to translate I think into higher new logos and higher TCV."

Going forward, starting with Q1 fiscal '16, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will report earnings as separate companies. I will outline how the call will flow today since it will be a little different than our typical earnings calls. 
Meg will kick things off with Q4 highlights for Hewlett-Packard Company, and Cathie will follow with additional details. After that, Meg and Tim will review segment results and outlook for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Then Dion and Cathie will review segment results and outlook for HP Inc. Finally, we'll open it up to questions. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and a slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our HP Inc.'s Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com and on Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Investor Relations web page at www.hpe.com. 
As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. 
We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP Inc.'s and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. 
For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. 
Finally, each of the unaudited pro forma Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc.'s fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and cash flow information presented in this call and the accompanying presentation is based on the estimated contributions of each company to Hewlett-Packard Company's fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS and cash flow as adjusted to give effect to the separation transaction effective on November 1, 2015. 
The pro forma amounts do not necessarily reflect that the fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS and cash flow of Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP Inc. would have been had the separation occurred on November 1, 2014. They also may not be useful in predicting the future financial condition and results of operations of the separate companies. The actual financial positions and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors.
With that, let me turn it over to Meg."

Hewlett-Packard Company net revenue for the quarter was $25.7 billion, down 9% year-over-year as reported or down 3% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $103.4 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported or down 2% in constant currency. Gross margin was 24.7%, up 0.1 point year-over-year and up 0.9 points quarter-over-quarter, with sequential improvement across all of our major business segments. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were down 5% year-over-year, driven by a reduction in SG&A, partially offset by our continued focus on increasing our R&D investments. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was 9.1%, down 0.5 points year-over-year and up 0.5 points sequentially. With a net expense of $151 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.8 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.93 in Q4, within our outlook range. 
Q4 non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $676 million for separation, $591 million for restructuring, $246 million for amortization of intangible assets and net tax benefits of $803 million. 
For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.59, in line with our previously provided outlook range. 
On a GAAP basis, Q4 diluted net earnings per share was $0.73, above our outlook range due to the net tax benefits just mentioned. These were onetime, noncash entries comprising a number of different items, including the reversal of a previously recorded U.S. tax valuation allowance that I discussed on the Q3 earnings call. 
The total separation costs, CapEx and associated cash flows expected across FY '15 and FY '16, in total, were originally $2.8 billion. And we now expect $2.4 billion in that same time period. The mix of expenses between onetime separation costs, CapEx and incremental taxes was different than planned, with taxes coming in well under our plans in Q4. 
The 2012 restructuring program is nearly complete, with approximately 4,300 people exiting the company in Q4 '15 and just under 56,000 cumulative reductions for the program to date. Even with labor migration, we are down a net 59,000 people over this time frame. 
In Q4, we recorded GAAP-only charges of $591 million. Approximately $200 million were the final charges associated with the 2012 program, and the remainder were associated with the new restructuring program that each company discussed at their respective Security Analyst Meetings in September. 
We delivered cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.8 billion in the quarter. This brings our total free cash flow for the year to $3.3 billion, which is just below our outlook range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. There was a tailwind from separation costs coming in lower as described. This was more than offset by the following: other receivables, including VAT; elevated financing receivables driven by higher HP Financial Services volume; cash outflow for restructuring; and lower earnings. 
In Q4, we returned $638 million of capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, and $4.1 billion was returned to shareholders for the full year. We returned over 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders in fiscal '15, even excluding the capital return of $750 million that completed our 2014 commitment. 
I'll now turn it over to Meg and Tim to discuss the results of the segments that are now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Then Dion and I will return to share comments on Printing and Personal Systems, the new HP Inc."
108856,316526332,908178,"HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 24, 2015",2015-11-24,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Cathie. As we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting in September, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has 5 key priorities for FY '16. We plan to grow top line revenue in constant currency, drive a year-over-year increase in operating profit, grow free",1277,"Thanks, Cathie. As we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting in September, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has 5 key priorities for FY '16. We plan to grow top line revenue in constant currency, drive a year-over-year increase in operating profit, grow free cash flow, continue to execute our innovation road map and stabilize revenue and expand margins in Enterprise Services. And I'm pleased to say that overall, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is off to a very strong start. First and foremost, the segments that comprise HPE have now had 2 consecutive quarters of constant-currency revenue growth, and we believe we're in a strong position to deliver on our plans to grow overall in FY '16 in constant currency. 
Also, while there is more work to do, particularly in ES, our cost structure is much closer to where it needs to be, thanks to aggressive supply chain management, SKU rationalization and workforce rebalancing. 
With respect to cash, we are starting the year with a net cash position at the operating company level and as separation costs wind down, we are well positioned to increase cash flow at FY '16. The innovation we've been investing in over the past 4 years is paying off. We've introduced breakthrough new solutions and services that have driven a mix shift in our portfolio towards higher-growth products and services. By leaning into new technology, we are ideally positioned to take advantage of market trends that will allow us to continue to take share from our competitors and to drive long-term growth. 
Finally, while each business segment faces different challenges and opportunities, the company as a whole is aligning tightly around the 4 customer transformation areas we discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting. Customers tell us our focus is spot-on. I'm confident that our clear strategy will accelerate the significant progress we've already made in our financial performance. 
Now, before Tim gets into the financial details, let me provide some highlights from the quarter across each segment. In Enterprise Group, we performed exceptionally well, with strong revenue growth up 2% as reported or 9% in constant currency and improved profitability on a sequential basis. 
Our Industry Standard Server business was strong, with constant-currency revenue growth across all regions, driven by solid core growth and increasing demand from Tier 1 service providers. Looking forward, we are well positioned to benefit from the server market upswing, driven by the growth in cloud and big data. 
The Networking business also performed, well with the Aruba acquisition driving strong cross-selling opportunities across wireless and data center switching. 
Storage significantly outpaced the market, and we expect that we gained close to a point of share in the third calendar quarter. 
Our 3PAR All-Flash portfolio is outperforming the competition. 3PAR All-Flash is now a $500 million annualized run rate business and grew triple digits in the fourth quarter. That's larger and growing faster than Pure in their most recently reported quarter. In fact, just last week, Gartner rated 3PAR as the best storage product on the market across every use case category. This is a powerful recommendation to our customers and partners and will help us continue to drive share gains against our competitors. 
Finally, in Technology Services. We continue to see a growing proportion of the business come from high-value services like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care, while operating margins remained steady. 
Turning to Enterprise Services. We had the best performance in Q4 that we've had in years due to a more diversified customer base, stabilized constant-currency revenue growth and a significantly reduced cost structure. Revenue declined 2% in constant currency, although we grew new logos and saw double-digit growth in Strategic Enterprise Services, driven by strength in Helion cloud and security services. Operating profit was 8% in the quarter, the best performance since 2011. For the full year, both revenue and operating margins were in the range of our outlook. Looking ahead, we have a clear plan in place to get to a longer-term sustainable target operating margin of 7% to 9%. 
In Software, we delivered strong margins while continuing to take steps to align the portfolio and the go-to-market approach with the 4 transformation areas. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year in constant currency or flat, if you normalize for recent M&A transactions on a pro forma basis. During the quarter, we announced several transactions, including the sale of TippingPoint and LiveVault, which will allow us to focus our resources and investments in higher-growth strategic businesses. 
Finally, our Financial Services business continues to be a differentiator for the company. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Financial Services helps customers by creating consumption-based models to buy new technology or financing programs to transition out of legacy systems. Total FY '15 financing volume increased 9% year-over-year in constant currency. 
As I have said before, HPE's innovation engine is humming, and Q4 was no exception. During the quarter, we introduced important new solutions and continued to see strong customer traction across the portfolio. For example, in September, we announced several new security solutions to help customers quickly detect high-risk threats, reduced data breach impact and enhance overall security. We also won several significant new security deals in the quarter, including new wins for our Voltage and Fortify solutions with a major financial services company. 
In Enterprise Services, we announced a significant new partnership with Microsoft and HP Inc. to enable Windows 10 adoption and drive employee mobility for the enterprise. As part of the agreement, we will build and sell industry-specific business applications for Windows 10 across key industries such as retail, energy and transportation. This agreement is a great example of how Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will work together going forward. 
In Servers, we saw continued strong customer momentum with our leading portfolio of Apollo high-performance compute solutions. We are the clear market leader in high-performance computing. And today, more than 1/3 of the market is leveraging HPE compute platforms to process, analyze and manage data securely. 
Cloud is another important growth driver for us, and we saw strong momentum in the quarter. We are the leading cloud infrastructure provider, and we see a significant opportunity as enterprises move to a hybrid cloud environment. 
In late October, we announced HP Helion OpenStack 2.0, our latest enterprise-grade cloud platform with new life cycle management and security enhancements. We believe strongly in open standards, and our OpenStack-based cloud offerings provide the open, agile and secure hybrid cloud environment our customers are asking for. 
We also refined our cloud strategy during the quarter. Our goal is to help customers source, manage and consume services across traditional, private, public and managed cloud environments. To that end, we announced in October that we will double down on our private and managed cloud capabilities and sunset our public cloud offering. This is the right move. It plays to our strengths in private and managed cloud. We will continue to extend our cloud infrastructure leadership and integrate the public cloud element for our customers through a strategic partner-based model. 
In line with that approach, we've reached an agreement with Microsoft that you'll hear more about during Discover next week. Microsoft shares our view of a hybrid-IT approach for enterprises, and we both see opportunity to simplify hybrid infrastructure for our customers. Going forward, Microsoft and Azure will become a preferred public cloud partner. HPE will serve as a preferred provider of Microsoft's infrastructure and services for its hybrid cloud offerings. 
Overall, the move to a hybrid cloud environment presents a significant growth opportunity for us, and you can expect to hear more about our approach in coming months. 
And on that note, I'll hand the call over to Tim Stonesifer."

Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year on a strong note, and we're already executing against the financial architecture we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting. This calls for solid growth from EG, with stable to slightly up margins, stabilizing revenue and ES with strong margin expansion, stabilizing software revenue with good profitability, all while leveraging Financial Services with their good return on equity. 
In Q4, our segments collectively delivered revenue of $14.1 billion, which was up 3% year-over-year in constant currency. This marks the second quarter in a row of delivering year-over-year constant-currency growth, and we expect to take share in x86 servers, storage and networking during the third calendar quarter. 
For the full fiscal year 2015, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $1.84, in the middle of the previously provided outlook. Similarly, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total free cash flow for the year to be $1 billion, just below the previously provided outlook. We benefited from a push-out of separation costs that was offset primarily by the timing of value-added tax receivables and restructuring payments, along with the higher-financing receivables that Cathie mentioned in her remarks. 
Now turning to the segments. The Enterprise Group continued its strong momentum, growing revenue 2% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Operating profit improved sequentially by 1 point to 14% and was down 0.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to currency. 
Industry Standard Servers grew 5% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency and was up across all geographies in constant currency. The work we have done segmenting the market and delivering innovative products has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of this strong market. We expect server momentum to continue next year but at a moderated pace given more difficult compares. 
Business Critical Systems declined 8% year-over-year but only 2% in constant currency. This was our strongest year-over-year revenue growth in over 3 years as our mission-critical x86 and NonStop platforms offset the challenges from Itanium. 
Storage declined 7% but was flat in constant currency, significantly outperforming the market. Converged Storage grew 17% in constant currency and was 53% of the portfolio. We are now seeing our R&D investments pay off with exceptional growth in All-Flash, which has taken over 10 points of share in the last year. We expect the improving mix of Converged Storage to drive overall growth in fiscal year 2016 at improved margins and with better TS attach. 
Networking grew 35% year-over-year or 43% in constant currency and grew high single digits in constant currency, excluding Aruba. The recent strategic moves we've made are already yielding results. The Aruba acquisition is driving incremental opportunities from the campus wireless refresh, and we've returned to growth in China following the announcement of our partnership with Tsinghua. We expect to close the Tsinghua transaction in Q1. 
TS declined 11% or 4% in constant currency, impacted by tough compare in consulting from the prior year. Order growth was flat year-over-year in local currency, lighter than expected. This was partially due to customers in China waiting for the Tsinghua transaction to close before signing new multiyear support contracts. Additionally, we had a higher mix of Tier 1 service provider growth in Servers that attach little support. We're addressing these issues with more value-added services like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care that are increasing our support-attached dollars on a per unit basis. For the full year, orders were up 1% in local currency, and TS continues to be on track for flat constant-currency revenue in fiscal year '16. 
In Enterprise Services, revenue declined 9% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency and was flat when you exclude the top 3 account runoff. For full fiscal 2015, we saw total bookings growth, driven by new logo signings and solid renewals. Our cost actions also delivered strong margin expansion. Profitability was up 1.4 points year-over-year to 8.2% for the quarter, the highest it's been since the second quarter of 2011. 
Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing was down 11% year-over-year or down 4% in constant currency. We saw encouraging constant-currency growth in EMEA, which was previously our most challenged region. 
Application and Business Services was down 5% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency, our strongest constant-currency result in over 3 years. This result is especially encouraging since ABS carries the highest-operating margins within ES. 
In Software, revenue declined 7% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency and was flat when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. The team continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, achieving operating margins of 30.1%, down 1.3 points year-over-year due mostly to currency. We enjoyed good revenue growth in security and double-digit revenue growth in big data year-over-year in constant currency when adjusted for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. 
In particular, license revenue for Vertica increased in excess of 50% year-over-year, driven by several large wins in North America. SaaS also grew year-over-year in constant currency and in each business when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. 
Going forward, we expect better alignment with the Enterprise Group and Enterprise Services to improve cross-selling opportunities. However, we also continue to expect pressure on the top line as we evolve our go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. 
In Financial Services, revenue declined 11% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency, with operating profit declining 1.3 points to 11%. The challenges to both revenue and profitability were entirely due to unfavorable currency and a tough compare. Financing is playing an increasingly strategic role for our customers, with volume up 9% in constant currency during fiscal year 2015. Financing volume is a good indicator of future revenue performance. The return on equity remained healthy at 16.4%. 
With that, let's turn to the outlook. On the top line, we expect the momentum of Q3 and Q4 constant-currency revenue growth to continue through fiscal year '16. The currency environment continues to be volatile, and based on current rates, we expect a 3-point headwind of revenue in fiscal year '16. 
Before I give our EPS outlook, let me provide some guidance for earnings seasonality at the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In general, EPS will be back-end-loaded for a few reasons: First, both Enterprise Services and Software margins normally expand throughout the year from a low in Q1; second, the benefits we receive from restructuring will continue ramping over time; and finally, the negative impact from dis-synergies will decline throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.37 to $0.41 in the first quarter of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.09 to $0.13 in Q1 of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. We continue to expect free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for the full year. However, please keep in mind that cash flow is seasonally lowest in the first quarter. And in fiscal year '16, it will also be impacted by the majority of the remaining separation payments. 
Finally, for capital allocation, earlier this month, we announced our Q1 dividend of $0.055 per share, in line with our commitment to distribute approximately $400 million in the form of dividends in fiscal year '16. We remain committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow for the full year to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
In closing, let me say that I'm pleased with the progress we are making against the 5 key priorities we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting. The business has momentum, and our financial architecture continues to strengthen. In short, I'm excited about our prospects and the future of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dion."

The Printing and Personal Systems markets are experiencing challenges right now. As we discussed on the Q3 earnings call and in more detail at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expected to have several tough quarters, and Q4 was indeed a difficult quarter and somewhat weaker than we expected. Following separation, we remain confident that we are well positioned for the long term in the marketplace. The market challenges do not intimidate us, and we are keenly aware of what we need to be focused on going forward. 
Turning to the results. Overall, in Q4, our business performance was mixed. In Personal Systems, we executed well against the expected tough market backdrop, while Printing represented a much greater challenge due a number of factors that have changed our near-term view of the market and the supplies revenue trajectory. 
Before I go into those details on Printing, let me briefly reflect on the Q4 results for Personal Systems. The PC market continued to be tough, especially in Consumer, where industry channel inventory remained elevated in the market. While we saw improved performance in the U.S., EMEA remained weak, with market units declining 22% year-over-year in the third calendar quarter as we foreshadowed at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
As I've said in the past, when markets are down, our ability to outperform the market profitably is key. HP gained unit share in calendar third quarter in each of our 3 regions, achieving 19.7% market share worldwide. We continue to extend our lead in the market with Commercial PC share of 23.7%, our highest share position ever. And we managed to do this all while improving Personal Systems operating profit by 0.8 of 1 point sequentially to 3.8%. We believe that innovation and sprinkles of magic are key to differentiation as the PC market goes through consolidation. 
In Q4, we introduced a robust portfolio of enterprise class and consumer PCs with a number of form factors and industry firsts. And we announced a partnership with Disney and Lucasfilms around Star Wars: The Force Awakens, delighting our customers with the launch of our Star Wars Special Edition Notebook PC. 
Looking ahead, we expect the PC market to remain challenged for more quarters to come. As expected, Windows 10 has not been a material catalyst for sales yet but continues to receive favorable reviews. We see the most adoption in the U.S. retail segment, and our share here is very strong. We maintain that this new operating system is important for the industry and a contributing factor to support a future hardware refresh cycle. 
Turning to Printing. We saw accelerated revenue declines across hardware and supplies, and there have been a couple of factors that have changed since the Security Analyst Meeting. The most significant factor was the continued effects of currency movements that have accelerated pricing pressures, even more than we expected in certain profitable segments of the printing markets. 
Secondly, the market was somewhat weaker than we expected in the calendar third quarter, and you're seeing this in our results, and you saw it in the results of some of our peers, some of whom have announced their intentions to reevaluate strategic options. We do not expect the landscape to improve in the near future, and we will constantly assess how the market evolves. In any case, our market leadership and scale serve us well, but we have much more work to do on many dimensions. 
Specifically in hardware, we saw a 17% year-over-year unit decline due to 3 factors. Firstly, the hardware market continued to contract with calendar third quarter total units down 6% year-over-year, down more than we expected. 
Secondly, pressure in the unit performance was a planned channel inventory reduction. We consciously elevated inventory levels in Q3 in advance of the IT system cutover as part of our separation-related continuity planning. The good news is that with the reduction in Q4, the hardware channel inventory is now within the desired range as we finish the year. So approximately 3/4 of the unit decline is linked to the market and channel inventory reduction. 
Thirdly, with the market down more than expected, the competitive pricing environment was even more challenging in certain profitable segments where usage is high. 
Let me take a moment to outline the impact currency is having on the pricing dynamics in the market. We have seen further reduction in average unit prices in key segments. Our competitors have leveraged currency advantages to drive down pricing, and we have responded in kind. 
This has changed the price points for certain units and means that some units in specific markets were no longer MPV positive. And as we said we would do, we have responsibly been going after profitable share gains and walking away from negative MPV hardware unit deals. 
Another consequence of lower average unit price points is that we are attracting buyers that may have different usage patterns than we originally targeted. For example, the pricing of some of the Officejet pro hardware has fallen into price bands that are within reach of home users who typically print less. The unintended result is that we are not getting the yield per unit we would have expected on some of these units. 
We see this impacting our supplies revenue trajectory. Q4 '15 supplies revenue was not where we expected it to be, and we have more work to do. We will accelerate initiatives across all of the levers we pull to improve the supplies revenue trajectory. Examples of these initiatives include driving programs to increase ink usage and to increase aftermarket supply share. On ink usage, we expect to accelerate our Instant Ink subscription service, with programs that increase our attach rate. In Q4, one of the programs was to expand the number of models and therefore price points that Instant Ink addresses, ensuring more customers never run out of ink. 
We are confident that the fundamentals of the 4-box model are sound. We believe all of these actions will help improve the trajectory of supplies revenue over time. However, given the unit declines and changing usage patterns, the data from our 4-box model is indicating that we expect the stabilization in ink supplies revenue to be delayed towards the end of 2017 as we drive these initiatives. 
We are moving quickly on 3 vectors: We remain focused on solution-ing the $1 billion of productivity improvements we laid out at the Security Analyst Meeting; secondly, we can't compete on price alone, so we are balancing our pricing actions with increased marketing and sales activity to stimulate demand; and finally, we have to materially change our non-revenue generating cost structure to compete aggressively. This may both accelerate and increase the previously announced restructuring actions. 
In closing, we firmly believe in our strategy around core growth in the future as outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting. Let me remind you, we are still the leader in large consolidating markets. We have scale, innovation, channel reach and an incredible brand. While the markets are challenging now, we believe the actions we are taking now will protect the core that generates the majority of our cash flow, and of course, we will continue to invest in adjacent market opportunities and our future. 
I'll now turn it over to Cathie, who can provide additional details and our financial outlook."
108856,316526332,908178,"HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 24, 2015",2015-11-24,"Earnings Calls","HP Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dion.

Printing net revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or down 9% in constant currency. As expected, the year-over-year currency impact was greater than past quarters as favorable long-dated financial hedges matured. From a channel inventory perspective, we've reduced both hardware and supplies levels year-over-year and sequentially, but we are still slightly above-target weeks of supply range for supplies. Supplies revenue was down 10% year-over-year as reported or down 5% on constant currency and was 65% of the revenue mix in the quarter. 
We had some bright spots in the quarter, including constant-currency revenue growth in Graphics. Also, Managed Print Services revenue grew double digits in constant currency year-over-year in Q4. And for fiscal '15, we saw strong growth, both as reported and in constant currency, in total contract value for our partner MPS offering. 
From an operating profit perspective, we delivered 17.4%, down 0.8 points year-over-year. Currency headwinds and competitive pricing were only partially offset by strong supplies mix. 
Turning to Personal Systems. Revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or down 7% in constant currency. Consumer and Commercial PC units were each down year-over-year, but we outperformed the market in calendar Q3, gaining 0.3 points of share in Consumer and 1.6 points of share in Commercial. We've done a lot of work to drive to a variable cost structure, which supports our profitability in these down quarters.  Personal Systems' operating process improved sequentially to 3.8% on the strength of gross margins but was down 0.2 points year-over-year as a result of reduced operating expense leverage on lower volumes despite OpEx reductions and improved gross margins. Gaining cost efficiencies will position us well as the market slowly recovers. 
Considering the combined performance of the Printing and Personal Systems segments in the context of the overall Hewlett-Packard Company results, we estimate our pro forma contribution to the non-GAAP EPS result for fiscal '15 to be about $0.01 below the baseline range provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. Our pro forma free cash flow contribution to the company was approximately $2.3 billion for fiscal '15, within the range we outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
Turning to the financial outlook. Beginning in Q1 '16, the new HP Inc. will make a reporting change related to pension. For the last several years, we have had pension income. Our pension liabilities and assets are revalued each October 31 based on interest rates and asset values on that day. This can drive nonoperational volatility in our pension income from year-to-year. For FY '15, this volatility causes a year-over-year decrease in pension income of approximately $90 million, and we don't expect this to have an impact to FY '16 cash flow. Without a change in reporting method, however, this headwind would have put incremental pressure on our investments, and suboptimizing our business for nonoperational impact is not in our best long-term interest. Specifically, the change relates to the expected performance of the planned assets and interest rate movements, the market-related factors in determining pension income or expense. We will exclude these market-related factors from the non-GAAP operational results going forward. 
With this reporting change, the service costs associated with our pension plans and the amortization of prior service costs will continue to be reported as operational expenses within our non-GAAP results. For more information, please refer to the Investor Relations earnings presentation, which includes a few slides detailing the change. 
We believe that going forward, this reporting change provides a greater transparency to underlying operating results. However, the reporting change will result in a reduction of our non-GAAP EPS outlook, given we will now exclude our nonoperational pension income. 
Moving to revenue. As discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expect year-over-year constant-currency declines to moderate, but currency will continue to be a headwind to revenue of about 3 to 4 points in FY '16. Since then, net currency moves have been unfavorable, and we see only incremental pressure to both revenue and operating profit year-over-year. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be about 1 point lower than the 22% to 23% range provided at the Security Analyst Meeting given the pension reporting change noted. 
For Q1 specifically, keep the following things in mind. The Personal Systems and Printing markets continue to be tough. Supplies revenue will continue to be under pressure as we reduce supplies channel inventory, and the supplies revenue trajectory improvement will take longer. Given the pricing dynamics Dion laid out, we expect printer units to be down double digits year-over-year as we continue to focus on profitable unit placements. And finally, productivity improvements are expected to ramp throughout the year. Considering these factors, we expect the first half operating profit to be lower than our typical in-year seasonality. 
With all that in mind, the HP Inc. Q1 '16 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.33 to $0.38, inclusive of the pension reporting change. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $1.59 to $1.69. Operationally, our non-GAAP EPS outlook is unchanged, but with the exclusion of nonoperating pension income, there is a reduction of $0.08 in fiscal '16 as compared to what we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. 
On a GAAP basis, Q1 '16 GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $0.27 to $0.32, and our full year FY '16 GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $1.50 to $1.60. The reduction in the full-year GAAP EPS outlook of $0.05 in fiscal '16 from what we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting is associated with the following: $0.03 for lower pension income as a result of the revaluation of pension assets and liabilities as of October 31, 2015, and $0.02 is associated with the amortization of intangibles related to the marketing optimization shift to HP Inc. and the separation charges that move from FY '15 to FY '16. For FY '16, we expect our normalized free cash flow to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, consistent with the discussion at the Security Analyst Meeting. However, we are adjusting our free cash flow outlook to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion, down $100 million due to separation payments that slipped from FY '15. 
Finally, for capital allocation, we announced earlier this month that we will be paying a dividend of $0.124 per share in fiscal '16. We remain committed to a total capital return to shareholders for the full year to be at the high end of our overall framework of 50% to 75% of free cash flow. We expect that share repurchases will drive a moderate decline in weighted average shares outstanding beginning in Q1. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

They're now sort of 62.5% of the total overall market and growing. And I think we've been pretty predictable over the course of the last 2 years, not taking share for shares' sake. We did grow in all 3 regions to 19.7% overall. Commercial share, we grew to 23.7%, and that was our highest ever share position. So we remain very disciplined. We walked away from some sizable Black Friday deals that were not very high calorie or, in fact, negative calorie. So I think we continue to execute as we said we would. We continue to segment the market, drive to where the heat is in the market, drive cost out, make sure our channel inventory and, particularly, aged inventory is well under control. And as we did that, we saw profit margin expansion 0.8 of 1 point sequentially to 3.8%. So we're squarely on strategy here."

So from a separation cost, we had about $300 million of favorability from a free cash flow perspective on the E side in '15. $200 million of that will move over to '16. So if you look at the overall amount of separation costs we were able to -- actually, able to work down the overall amount, so there'll be about a $200 million separation cost increase in '16. If you look at the overall free cash flow and the adjustment to '16, we're still holding to the '16 guide. And basically, our shortfall was driven by a couple of things. If you think about the financing volumes were higher in our Financial Services business, as well as we had some pressure on the VAT receivables that we were unable to collect. That will push over and then give us some favorability in '16, which will offset some of the separation cost pressure. So overall, we're sticking to the guide that we provided at SAM. As far as Tsinghua, we haven't adjusted EPS yet because the deal is not closed. But just to give you some color around that, from the remaining 49% that will stick with us, we're going to account for that with the equity accounting method. So you'll see that earnings and cash flow impact flow through the other income line. And then as far as a guide or framing it up from an EPS perspective, we've said historically that we've earned -- we had about $400 million of op profit in that business in 2014, so I think you could use that as a proxy. And then I'd just take a couple of things into account: One would be the timing of the transaction, so when we close it; and then the second thing I would think about is there will be some stranded costs associated with overhead costs that do not go with the transaction. So similar to dis-synergy costs, we will need to work that out of the system and that will take a little bit of time, so that's the Tsinghua impact."

How do I enable analytics, a big data analytics environment? And how do I drive workplace productivity? And we are aligning software services and hardware or infrastructure to that. And this is particularly powerful for software because software now has some of the anchor IP in each of these areas and it's also helping us decide what parts of software we want to be in and what parts we don't.

I guess, I'll start and then I'll throw it to Dion to add any additional comments. We have found that our 4-box model is, in fact, very good. And as we have collected more big data, and every week we collect new data, we update basically the model. What we saw in Q4 were basically 2 things that really impacted the model and impacted when the ink supplies would stabilize and push it out to basically late '17. The first thing was we did see incremental competitiveness in key segments, particularly in SMB ink and, therefore, we placed less units. And as a result of that, that's going to have a knock-on effect around ink supplies. Secondly, what we saw was, through aggressive pricing, we actually took a -- we took a product that should've been sold into 1 end-user, an end-user that, in fact, prints a lot, and we now are getting -- selling that product into home users which just don't print enough. And so we need to change that. And that's part of better managing the marketing, better managing basically the price points. And that has a knock-on effect because those were units that we had expected would be very high usage. So we have a lot of confidence in the model, but you have to work the model all the time and it's across those 4 dimensions that we've talked about, the installed base, usage, aftermarket share and then also making sure that we're careful about what we do from a supplies pricing perspective."

They're getting bigger, leveraging up and doubling down mostly on legacy technology, while our strategy is to get smaller. I've just spent the last 4 years deleveraging the balance sheet and leaning into new technology like converged infrastructure, new server architectures, 3PAR with All-Flash, Aruba, et cetera. So we feel really good about our strategy and our portfolio of assets. And I'll underscore what I said before, these 4 transformation areas is the way we're going to pivot this company to solutions-selling. ES already solution-sells. EG and software are moving rapidly towards that solution of driving business outcomes as opposed to just selling speeds and feeds. And it's a cultural change for this company, but actually I will tell you it's underway and I'm feeling pretty good about it."

Meg, I believe you've mentioned some of the ES contracts may be getting shorter. Did I hear that correctly? And what does that mean to the profitability as such, the ability to invest in such? It seems like it may compress some of that a little bit, but maybe I'm wrong on that. And then the second -- or the other question for Dion and/or Cathie would be, I think you'd mentioned that you said the PC channel had some elevated inventory. And I believe we heard about this when you were going through the separation and you wanted to have your systems make sure that they converted over, but that was several months ago. So are you referring to excess inventory in the channel from HP or others or both? Or how should we think about that comment? Because I would have thought by now that, that PC inventory or anything due to your separation in the IT conversion cycles would have already right sided themself."

So the ES business is changing, and you will recall in the old days, in particularly the ITO part of the business, you would lose money in the first 2 years of the contract, then you'd break even for about 3 years and then you'd make money in the final 4 years. But the only problem with that is then, about year 8, the customer would renegotiate, and you'd miss out on the whole profit of the whole thing. And so really, the markets moved to shorter, more strategic relationships in ITO. As opposed to just labor arbitrage, now there is how do we transform your infrastructure to be more nimble, more agile and lower cost? And we've talked about a number of our customers for whom we're not just taking their mess for less. In the old days, that's probably what we would have done. Now we are saying, ""We will help transform your IT environment to be part of this new world order that's going to allow it to be lower-cost, more modern and allow you to be more agile."" And those contracts are -- tend to be shorter and we're actually okay with that because we also are very clear now that we're not going to lose money in contracts in years 1 and 2, and these things have to be profitable from the beginning. And that's been a change in the industry and, frankly, a change that we're putting a lot of discipline in. We're very, very focused on only taking deals that are good business for us. And like Dion said in his business, share for share's sake is not interesting to us here. We want to do good, profitable deals with customers that we can drive a good outcome for. And you're seeing that. I mean we said at our analyst meeting, we now have the highest Net Promoter Score in the business, in the Services business. And that, ultimately, and we can see it, is going to translate I think into higher new logos and higher TCV."

Going into quarter 4, what I said was industry inventory levels were high and our inventory levels were also high. As we exit Q4, I would say that industry inventory levels are still elevated but somewhat lower than they were as the market has begun to digest the Windows 8 inventory. But our inventory position is now back within the ranges and in good shape with regards to the age profile of that inventory."
