175749,282428812,760850,"Equifax Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, for that very detailed introduction. I'm going to first thank for joining us this morning. As well, let me go through high-level review of the fourth quarter, and then John will through the financial. I'll come back for the 2015, and then we",2483,"Thanks, Jeff, for that very detailed introduction. I'm going to first thank for joining us this morning. As well, let me go through high-level review of the fourth quarter, and then John will through the financial. I'll come back for the 2015, and then we'll go to Q&A. We finished 2014 in a very strong fashion and we carry some good momentum as we move into 2015. Looking back at last year, both reported growth and constant currency growth in the fourth quarter finished at the highest level of the year, which is always a good thing. For the quarter, fourth quarter 2014, total revenue was $625 million, up 8% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from the fourth quarter 2013. In the quarter, FX create a $13 million year-over-year headwind, which was a significant increase in the third quarter of headwinds of $6 million. I think you all are particularly aware of what's going on with the euro, and the ruble, the pound and others. 
Core non-mortgage market growth accelerated nicely at 8% in the quarter, ending the year at 7% solidly in the range of our long-term growth model. Consistent with the view we articulated throughout the year, the mortgage market was no longer a headwind in the fourth quarter. As a result, in 2015 and beyond, we'll focus our attention on a constant currency organic growth rate. What I mean by that is we broken out the past few years, because of the volatility, we broken out mortgage impact and will no longer do that because as I'll talk about later on the export the mortgage market to be relatively benign year-on-year on 2015. The adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter is $26.5 million, in line with the guidance we gave you the quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.02, up 12% from $0.91 a year ago, and it was at the upper end of the range that we've guided to. Also, given our strong performance for the quarter and the year, we've announced a 16% increase in the dividend, moving from $0.25 a share per quarter to $0.29 share. 
As I always do, we transition into some of the business units highlights that I think are noteworthy. First, let's start with USIS. They revenue and margin expanded operating margins throughout 2015, and they're poised to deliver an even stronger top line growth and margin expansion in 2015 than they delivered in 2014. 
A couple of highlights. A Decision 360, which we talk to you a lot about, continue to deliver unique value for our customers and drive revenue growth for us. A couple of interesting data point. In 2014, if you take our Top 100 customers, on average, they use now up from 1 product to 3 different unique data assets we've had, which is really of value to them and to us. It's even a better story when you look at our KCP accounts. We talked about that with the key client program accounts, about 8 of our largest customers in the United States. On average, they're now consuming 4.5 products unique data assets that we have. And we can bundle unique asset to add value to the client, they win and we win. So we [indiscernible] have done a great job of not just monetizing these asset but making it easier for customers to consume. 
Sticking with USIS. We continue to make great progress on the auto sector. We provide not only credit information to our auto customers but also adding nonemployment income verification. In 2014, revenues from our auto grew by 17%, almost 3x the rate of the market growth. We expect that trend to continue throughout 2015 as well. ISI had a very successful year, returning to strong double-digit growth, driven by new client innovation and deeper penetration with some of our largest, most important customers. And a more significant and unique initiatives, IB management and authentication, continue to position us well with large government contract opportunities, particularly with the Federal Agencies, such as Social Security Administration and the IRS. In 2014, we processed over 516 million identity verifications within the government and across all verticals in the U.S. alone. Through the concerted effort of USIS, enterprise has become an integral part of the global market initiative. We developed a detailed strategy for each vertical, including pricing, product innovation, distribution, incentive compensation, further accelerate market growth and penetration. 
On the International, we had an outstanding execution of the NPI initiatives. They delivered a vitality index of 14%, fueling solid growth in virtually every market where we operate. We anticipate revenue growth to be at the upper end of the long-term range for 2015, which is 7% to 10%, and we expect margins to expand nicely throughout the course of 2015. So highlights there, single-digit growth in our core Information Solutions product offerings, coupled with double-digit growth in efficient solutions and Personal Solutions, resulted in another year of strong organic growth in a much stronger market position as we enter 2015. U.K. exited the year with double-digit growth and very high single-digit growth rate for the year, significantly outpacing the economic environment growth. Particularly for us, it was a double-digit growth in Decision Analytics and Personal Solutions. That's a trend that's continued now for 3 or 4 years in the U.K. 
Canada exited the year with very healthy double-digit constant currency growth rate, primarily driven by the core Information Solution product offerings. There were 2 great examples of were the team is executing and enabling the growth at significant levels above and beyond what the economies are contributing. 
Latin America delivered broad-based, double-digit constant currency growth across virtually all the major product offerings in all countries. In Russia, we have over 20 million records database and significantly expanded the data assets in our fraud prevention system, which we'll talk a little bit about Russia to get some questions. Obviously, the sanctions in the ruble will impact our view of Russia going forward at least 2015. Finally, all of the Centers of Excellences that support our business units, especially in this case, international, dedicated significant resources to ensure successful integration of TDX. And right now, the integration of TDX is largely behind us. TDX and [indiscernible] are now focused meeting attention on the very large opportunity with U.K. government that we announced in December. For that project, which is going well, there'll be required R&D development in order to meet the security requirements of the U.K. government. We're in essence standing up the environment, the handover the government needs to go as planned, as scheduled. We expect that environment to be slow at sometime in the late second quarter to mid third quarter so again, system at the time. It take us some time to format the currency data, and they work with our partners, the collection agencies. We expect to monetize, start monetizing that win some time in the late fourth quarter and really nicely in 2016. So that's going as planned. 
On the Workforce Solutions. They had a blockbuster year in 2014. Despite significant headwinds from the mortgage market, Workforce Solutions delivered strong double-digit non-mortgage market organic growth once again and 270 basis points of margin expansion for the year. We expect to get another really solid growth here in 2015 for EWS as well as meaningful margin expansion once again as we think about those models. Our Workforce Solutions exited the year in the fourth quarter with core non-mortgage market organic growth rate of over 17%. Remarkable. For the year, core non-mortgage market growth was 13%, driven by strong double-digit growth in auto, government and preemployment. We now have over 4,300 companies across United States contributing employment income information to the Work Number database. 
Our data and analytics initiatives, which we talked to you about now for a couple years are key drivers of revenue growth in both 2014 and 2015. In fact, we are looking at 35% to 40% growth in our analytics product line across EWS in 2015. In 2014, we signed 227 contracts with companies who needed to assure their compliance obligations under the Affordable Care Act. In addition to the incremental revenues, customers are also contributing to the employment and income information to the Work Number database, so it is too baked to the apple, if you will, and making money on the analytics for ACA as well as building the database at a much faster rate. We're also developing a number of other innovative analytical solutions to enlighten employers about the demographics and the profile of their workforce, truly taking EWS and bringing it to the level of any other business we have in the world if not even higher in the area of analytics. 
We've also broaden our relationship with CMS, leveraging our historical Robert records to provide employment income verification on individuals and alleviate their need to use more costly source of information. We're expecting our CMS relationship to grow by over 50% in 2015 when compared to 2014. What I meant by that comment there is, we started off with CMS just using very recent records of The Work Number. We're now going back to all records. We still add great value and provide solutions to CMS thus, providing increase resource workforce. Finally, our compliance center initiatives, such as [indiscernible] are generating some strong interest in employers who require a great assurance on their compliance with numerous regulatory -- regulations and loss, and that's been a great growth vehicle for them and EWS. 
On the PSol, they have moved aggressively on their four-pronged strategy. They outlined it briefly on the third quarter call, improving on their execution of building value our products and consumers need and want, expanding our presence in the indirect market through the TrustedID acquisition, enhancing our International opportunities, leveraging our domestic building platforms and product strategies and evaluating opportunities in the lead generation space to compete more directly with the premium companies that exist. We anticipate 2015 growth will be marginally in the range of the long-term model we communicated to you before. 
We have variety of initiatives in value-based acquisition and retention. We improved customer lifetime value of our core product offerings by almost 45%. We also have a number of other initiatives underway addressing our immediate strategy, increasing ARPU and lowering our churn, all of which enable us to deliver stronger growth and margin expansion. In the indirect market, our TrustedID team has signed contracts or is in negotiation with large financial institutions and nonfinancial institutions on opportunities, which, in aggregate, could represent up to $25 million of annualized revenue potential. H&R Block is an excellent example of how we're developing highly customized and unique product offerings which support and enhance our indirect partners' customer relationships. It also underscores how Personal Solutions are developing new products and expanding its distribution channels with solutions that help consumers address the ever-growing threat of identity theft. Taxpayer victims that identity theft criminals who use a consumers' personal information to file a fraudulent tax return. Leveraging our data and analytics expertise combined with H&R Block tax-related capabilities and expertise, H&R Block tax identity shield provides consumers with the ability to better understand the vulnerabilities for tax identity theft and, most importantly, take the appropriate steps to help boost that vulnerability. This is the first and only tax identity theft protection and resolution system product in the marketplace today, and we're proud we're working with a great partner like H&R Block. 
For the past few years, North American Personal Solutions team has worked very closely with the counterparts in the U.K. to accelerate the growth in the U.K. Effective in January this year, we decided to realign our Personal Solutions segments to include now the U.S., Canada and U.K. And eventually, we expect to make this a global business, including Latin America. And the whole goal here is leveraging infrastructure expertise and the investments we're making in our largest PSol business, which is the U.S., to accelerate growth around the world and is paying dividends. 
Finally, Personal Solutions have been very innovative with a vitality Index of over 17% for 2014, the highest of any business unit in the company. It's one of the reasons why we believe we have a number of opportunities in the space for us to deliver incremental revenue growth and to establish strong competitive position in the marketplace. Our unique mix of consumer data asset and strong partnerships with many of our customer should enable us to grow superior solutions in this space. 
Before I turn it over to John, let me transition back with things going on the corporate level. At the corporate level, efficiently improving our overall operating efficiency with our LEAN organization, which you're all aware, that's been around for about 8, 9 years now. At the request of some of our key client customers, our largest customers, the large A customers, we have now rolled up LEAN up their request into their operations. These efforts that have significantly strengthened our relationship with these customers in providing valuable insights on how to further reduce their operating expense and improve effectiveness to the application of our various product offerings. Really unique way to add value to our customers up their request. New Product Innovations at the corp level continues to be one of the strongest engines for growth. We launched last year what we call MTI 2.0, and what's done for us is enhanced our voice of customer process to better understand our customers' needs and challenges. We've developed a better market testing environment and enabled us to bring products to the market faster. We've launched full speed, reestablished metrics for the local NPI and make more effective use of our different IT platforms. So it's really refreshed NPI results were solid last year. Here's an example. We're building products, as I said, faster accelerating revenue at faster rates. And a great example of what we're doing our fraud in the Nike services. Revenue global, which is up 17% last year. So it enables [indiscernible] product type faster, give customer feedback faster and then launch our product faster than we did in the past. So we should see timing of revenue for NPI be reduced as a result of doing the 2.0. 
In short, 2014 was an outstanding year. In addition to delivering record revenue and earnings growth, the team executed well in our 4 corporate imperatives, and they are: delivering consistent, strong, profitable growth and shareholder returns; number two, developing unparalleled analytic insights, leveraging our unique data assets; three, continue to innovate through market leadership and key domain and verticals that are important to us; and fourth, further strengthen our reputation as a trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world. 
So with that, John, the financial, please."

As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. 
The FX headwind accelerated in the fourth quarter beyond what we originally expected for the third quarter compared to the fourth quarter 2013. Revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $13 million, and adjusted EPS was negatively impacted by about $0.03 a share. 
Now let me turn to the business unit financial performance for 4Q '14. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $284 million, up 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Online Information Solutions revenue was $198 million, up about 7% when compared to the year ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $25 million, also up 7% compared to Q4 2013. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was down 13% in the fourth quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenues was $61 million, down 10% when compared to the year ago quarter. ISI revenues were up double digits from 2013. The decline in CMS was primarily driven by $7.2 million of prior year revenues, which are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables on which Jeff referred to in his introduction. Excluding these prior year revenues from 2013, Financial Marketing Services will be up about 0.7% and CMS would be down about 1%. 
The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 40.8%, up from the adjusted operating margin of 39% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Internationals revenue was $159 million, up 15% on a reported basis and up 25% on a local currency basis. Acquisitions contributed approximately 15 points of the local currency growth. Constant currency organic revenue growth was about 10%. By region, Europe's revenue was $72 million, up 44% in U.S. dollars and up 47% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of TDX. Organic revenue growth and Europe was slightly above 10%. 
Latin America's revenue was $49 million, down 3% in U.S. dollars but up 13% in local currency, which included the acquisitions of Inffinix and the credit bureau in Paraguay. Organic growth was 6%, driven by double-digit organic growth in Decision Solutions and Analytical Services. Canada revenue was $39 million, with organic growth of 3% and U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. For the fourth quarter, International's operating margin was 22.6%, down from 29.1% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Workforce Solutions revenue was $129 million for the quarter, up 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. All growth in Workforce Solutions was organic. Verification Services, with revenue of $81 million, was up 24% when compared to the same quarter in 2013. Employer Services revenue was $48 million, up 2% compared to last year. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 32.5% compared to 28.9% in Q4 of 2013. North America Personal solutions revenue was $59 million, up 2%. Growth was driven primarily by Canadian subscription growth and indirect revenue through TrustedID. For the fourth quarter, operating margin was 33.7% compared to 30.7% in Q4 2013, largely driven by reduced marketing expense in the quarter. I should note that the figures I just presented reflect the organizational structure as it existed on December 31, 2014. As Rick noted as of January, we have realigned our business units, consolidating our U.K. Personal Solutions, along with North America Personal Solutions into the new Personal Solutions segment. In the attachments to our earnings release, we are providing 8 quarters of our stated history for the segments, and we'll be reporting them in 2015. We also present our multiyear business model in the new business unit configuration. For the full year 2014, consolidated revenue of $2.44 billion was up 6% on a reported and on an adjusted basis and up 7% on a constant-currency basis. The full year operating margin was 2612%, while the adjusted operating margin was 26.5% down slightly from 26.7% in 2013. Diluted EPS attributable to Equifax was $2.97, considered $2.69 per 2013. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.89, up 8% compared to the adjusted EPS of $3.60 in 2013. Operating cash flow was again very strong at $203 million in 4Q '14 and $616 million for the year. we continue to adjust the stock buyback activity repurchasing 1.4 million shares for $150 million in 4Q '14 and 3.9 million shares worth $302 million in calendar year 2014. Our strong cash flow in 2014 allowed us to complete the recently $40 million of acquisitions in addition to over $300 million in share repurchases and still maintain a very conservative leverage ratio of 1.8x EBITDA. We believe we have significant debt capacity available to us within our current credit ratings and are comfortable operating leverage ratios in the 2.5x EBITDA area. With our strong cash flow and substantial available leverage, we can implement the 16% dividend increase we announced yesterday and continue a substantial share repurchase program while completing acquisitions consistent with the high-end of our targeted 1% to 2% of annual revenue range. 
Now let me turn it back  to Rick."

I'll quickly summarize for you before we look 2 questions. As we look at 2015, we expect the U.S. mortgage market will move from a headwind to slightly positive year-on-year.

As we look at 2015, we expect the U.S. mortgage market will move from a headwind to slightly positive year-on-year. We can discuss that in detail in the Q&A. We expect, however, FX will continue to represent headwind for both revenue and EPS throughout the year. The guidance I will provide is organic growth only at this time,. However, as the year unfolds, I would anticipate adding to our overall growth rate through some M&A. Without and base on the current level of domestic and International business activity and current FX rates, we expect 2015 revenues to be between $2.550 billion to $2.6 billion. This reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 10% in 2015, which is up from a 4% growth rate in 2014. This strong revenue growth was partially offset by what we anticipate to be at 2 to 3 points of negative impact from FX, and again, this reflects organic growth at this time. 
Current FX rates, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share. Excluding the $0.12 per share negative impact from FX at the current rates, this reflects an 11% of 14% growth in 2015, which is beyond the upper end of our range, the long-term model we have which is 10% to 13%. This guidance is consistent with revenue growth consistent with a long-term business model for organic growth. We also expect our 2015 operating margin to be up over 27%, which is up nicely from the 26.5% in 2014. Also, our per capita location not changed. We remain committed to our dividend policy of 25% to 35% of adjusted net income. We invested in our business with CapEx in the range of $75 million to $100 million and continuing our acquisition focus. Given our strong cash flow and conservative debt leverage, as in major acquisitions, we intend to continue our current significant model of stock buyback activity. And finally, we anticipate the tax rate for the year to be between 35% and 36%. 
For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $632 million and $642 million, reflecting constant currency organic growth rate of 11% to 14%. And this will be partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.00 to $1.03, which is up to 12% to 16%, excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects 15% to 18% organic growth. And also for the first quarter, we expect operating margin to finish over 27%, which is up over 100 basis points in 2014. 
So with that, operator, if you could, please open up to any questions others may have."

That's growing at a rapid clip every year. I see no reason we can't get the active records up over 100 million records in the database in total over 300 million. And as I've always said before, both add value, the historical records as I mentioned on the CMS is a great source of revenue and elsewhere, and obviously, the value of the active records. And the significance of getting the database continue to drive obviously the incremental revenue if you had a record x amount of dollars. But as you continue to go from 30 million active to 40 million to 50 million to 60 million to 70 million, the viability of the database has in high transaction volume verticals is greatly enhanced.

That was great last year expect that to continue in 2015 automotive. I think I mentioned about 70% 3x the market growth. That will continue. There's another dynamic, David, going on which would be interested to everyone here. And that is kind of a shift which is influencing the online activity. A shift when we call prospect data feeds, which used to reside or does reside in our business called CMS and what customers use to be taking us asked to try to target people. What we're seeing our customers ready do now is up so come across our current customers at a point-of-sale. So what you're seeing is kind of a decline in the CMS prospect data feeds and an increase in prescreened, which is an online activity. That occurred last year. Actually I expect that trend to continue to occur in 2015."

That's an enormous growth lever in it of itself. Number two, if taking The Work Number assets to new verticals or deeper into existing verticals. We are at the early stages, for example, in automotive. It is booming for us. It's very early stages to penetrate that market deeper, faster, and so on, and so forth, in credit card. So no verticals in deeper and current verticals we anticipated, number 3. It is taking us to a new level. I think I talked the exact numbers now. And I talked about 30% to 50% growth in analytics.

They will continue this time and management team has done a great job with telco business. We're uniquely positioned there. We're growing at multiples of the market itself.

Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. 
During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax, adjusted operating revenue and adjusted operating margin that will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted operating revenue includes the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings from 2013 revenue.
Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects as well as certain other items. The other items excluded for 2013 are the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013, the resource realignment charge and the impairment of our investment in Boa Vista.
In 2014, we also excluded the associated tax effects in addition to the impact of a settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements. 
The adjusted operating margin also excludes certain items. For 2013, adjusted operating margin excludes the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings and the resource realignment charge. For 2014, the adjusted operating margin excludes the legal settlement regarding the dispute over software license agreements. 
All of these measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. 
Also, refer -- please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.equifax.com for further details.

As I always do, I'll go through the high-level review of the fourth quarter. Jeff -- or John will then go through the financial. I'll com",2591,"Thanks, Jeff, for that very detailed introduction, that was great, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. As I always do, I'll go through the high-level review of the fourth quarter. Jeff -- or John will then go through the financial. I'll come back with an outlook for 2015, then we'll go to Q&A. 
We finished 2014 in very strong fashion and we carry some good momentum as we move into 2015. Looking back at last year, both reported growth and constant currency growth in the fourth quarter finished at their highest level of the year, which is always a good thing. For the quarter, fourth quarter 2014, total revenue was $625 million, up 8% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from the fourth quarter 2013. In the quarter, FX created a $13 million year-over-year headwind, which was a significant increase from the third quarter headwind of $6 million. I think you all are intimately aware of what's going on with the euro, the ruble, the pound and others. 
Core non-mortgage market growth accelerated nicely to 8% in the quarter ending the year at 7%, solidly in the range of our long-term growth model. Consistent with the view we've articulated throughout the year, the mortgage market was no longer a headwind in the fourth quarter. As a result, in 2015 and beyond, we'll focus our attention on the constant currency organic growth rate. What I mean by that is we've broken out the past few years. Because of volatility, we've broken out mortgage impact and we'll no longer do that because we, as I'll talk about later on, we expect the mortgage market to be relatively benign year-on-year when we look at 2015. 
The adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was $26.5 million, in line with the guidance that we gave you for the quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.02, up 12% from $0.91 a year ago and it was at the upper end of the range that we've guided to. 
Also, given our strong performance for the quarter and the year, we've announced a 16% increase in the dividend, moving from $0.25 a share per quarter to $0.29 a share. 
As I always do, we transition into some of the business units highlights that I think are noteworthy. First, let's start with USIS. They accelerated their revenue and their margin -- and expanded their operating margins throughout 2015 and they're poised to deliver an even stronger top line growth and margin expansion in 2015 than they delivered in 2014. 
A couple of highlights. Decision 360, which we've talked to you a lot about, continues to deliver unique value for our customers and drive revenue growth for us. 
A couple of interesting data points. In 2014, if you take our top 100 customers, on average, they used now up from 1 product to 3 different unique data assets that we have, which is really, I think, value to them and to us. 
It's even a better story when you look at our KCP accounts. We've talked to you about that, the key client program accounts, about 8 of our largest customers in the United States. On average, they are now consuming 4.5 products, unique data assets that we have. And again, anytime we can bundle the unique data assets together to add value to a client, they win and we win. So Rudy Ploder and his team have done a great job of not just monetizing these assets, but making it easy for our customers to consume. 
Sticking with USIS. We continue to make great progress in the auto sector. We provide not only credit information to our auto customers, but also adding now employment income verification. In 2014, revenues from our auto group grew by 17%, almost 3x the rate of the market growth. We expect that trend to continue in 2015 as well. 
IXI had a very successful year, returning to strong double-digit growth, driven by new product innovation and deeper penetration with some of our largest, most important customers. 
One of our more significant and unique fraud initiatives, ID management and authentication, continue to position us well with large government contract opportunities, particularly with the federal agencies, such as Social Security Administration and the IRS. In 2014, we processed over 516 million identity verifications within the government and across all verticals in the U.S. alone. Through the concerted effort of USIS, enterprise selling has become an integral part of our go-to-market initiative. We developed a detailed strategy for each vertical, including pricing, product innovation, distribution, incentive compensation, enabling us to further accelerate market growth and penetration. 
On to International, we had an outstanding execution of the NPI initiatives. They delivered a vitality index of 14%, fueling solid growth in virtually every market where we operate. We anticipate revenue growth to be at the upper end of the long-term range for 2015, which is 7% to 10%, and we expect margins to expand nicely throughout the course of 2015. 
Some highlights there. Single-digit growth in our core Information Solutions product offerings, coupled with double-digit growth in Decision Solutions and Personal Solutions, resulted in another year of strong organic growth and a much stronger market position as we enter 2015. U.K. exited the year with double-digit growth and very high single-digit growth rate for the year, significantly outpacing the economic environment growth. Particularly for us, it was a double-digit growth in decision analytics and Personal Solutions. That's a trend that's continued now for 3 or 4 years in the U.K. 
Canada exited the year with very healthy double-digit constant currency growth rate, primarily driven by their core Information Solution product offerings. Those are 2 great examples of where the team is executing at a level, enabling them to grow at significant levels above and beyond what the economy is contributing. 
Latin America delivered broad-based, double-digit constant currency growth across virtually all major product lines in all countries. 
In Russia, we added over 20 million records to the credit database and have significantly expanded their data assets in our fraud prevention system. We should talk a little bit about Russia, we've got some questions. Obviously, the sanctions in the ruble will impact our view of Russia going forward, at least for 2015. 
Finally, all of the centers of excellences that support our business units, especially in this case, International, have dedicated significant resources to ensure the successful integration of TDX. And I believe right now, the integration of TDX is largely behind us. TDX and the COEs will now focus their immediate attention on the very large opportunity with the U.K. government that we announced in December. For that project, which is going well, there'll be required IT developments in order to meet the security requirements of the U.K. government. We're, in essence, standing up the environment to handle what the government needs. It's going as planned, as scheduled. We expect that environment to be stood up sometime in the late second quarter to mid-third quarter. Start getting the data into system at the time, it takes us some time to format the data, cleanse the data and then work with our partners, the collection agencies. We expect to monetize -- start monetizing that win some time in the late fourth quarter and ramp up really nicely in 2016. So that's going as planned. 
On the Workforce Solutions. They had a blockbuster year in 2014. Despite significant headwinds from the mortgage market, Workforce Solutions delivered strong double-digit, non-mortgage market organic growth once again and 270 basis points of margin expansion for the year. We're expecting to get another really solid, good growth here in 2015 for EWS as well as meaningful margin expansion once again, that's the great thing about those models. 
Our Workforce Solutions exited the fourth -- exited the year and the fourth quarter with core non-mortgage market organic growth rate of over 17%, remarkable. For the year, core non-mortgage market growth was 13%, driven by strong double-digit growth in auto, government and preemployment. We now have over 4,300 companies across United States contributing employment and income information to The Work Number database. 
Our data and analytics initiatives, which we talked to you about now for a couple years, are key drivers of revenue growth in both 2014 and 2015. In fact, we are looking at 35% to 40% growth in our analytics product line across EWS in 2015. In 2014, we signed 227 contracts with companies who need to assure their compliance obligations under the Affordable Care Act. 
In addition to the incremental revenues, customers are also contributing their employment and income information to The Work Number database. So it is two bites of the apple, if you will, making money on the analytics for ACA as well as building the database at a much faster rate. 
We're also developing a number of other innovative analytical solutions to enlighten employers about the demographics and the profile of their workforce, truly taking EWS and bringing it to the level of any other business we have around in the world, if not even higher, in the area of analytics. 
We've also broadened our relationship with CMS, leveraging our historical records to provide employment income verification on individuals and alleviate their need to use alternative, more costly source of information. We're expecting our CMS relationship to grow by over 50% in 2015 when compared to 2014. What I meant by that comment there is we started off with CMS just using very recent records off The Work Number, we're now going back to older records. We still add great value and provide solutions to CMS, thus providing an increased revenue source for us. 
Finally, our compliance center initiatives, such as I-9, are generating strong interest from employers who require great assurance on their compliance with numerous regulatory -- regulations and laws and that's been a great growth vehicle for them and EWS. 
On the PSol. They have moved aggressively on their four-pronged strategy that I outlined briefly in the third quarter call, improving on their execution of delivering value-added products that consumers need and want, expanding our presence in the indirect market through the TrustedID acquisition, enhancing our International opportunities, leveraging our domestic delivery platforms and product strategies and evaluating opportunities in the lead generation space to compete more directly with the freemium companies that exist. We anticipate 2015 growth in margin will be in the range of their long-term model we communicated to you before. 
We have a variety of initiatives in value-based acquisitions and retention. We improved customer lifetime value of our core product offerings by almost 45%. We also have a number of other initiatives underway addressing our media strategy, increasing ARPU and lowering our churn, all of which enable us to deliver stronger growth and margin expansion. 
In the indirect market, our TrustedID team has signed contracts or is in negotiation with financial -- large financial institutions and nonfinancial institutions on opportunities, which, in aggregate, could represent up to $25 million of annualized revenue potential. H&R Block is an excellent example of how we're developing highly customized and unique product offerings which support and enhance our indirect partners' customer relationships. It also underscores how Personal Solutions is developing new products and expanding its distribution channels with solutions that help consumers address the ever-growing threat of identity theft. Millions of taxpayers are victims of tax identity theft where criminals use a consumer's personal information to file a fraudulent tax return. Leveraging our data and analytics expertise, combined with H&R Block's tax-related capabilities and expertise, H&R Block's Tax Identity Shield provides consumers with the ability to better understand the vulnerabilities for tax identity theft, and most importantly, take the appropriate steps to help reduce that vulnerability. This is the first and only tax theft -- tax identity theft protection and resolution system product in the marketplace today and we're proud to be working with a great partner like H&R Block. 
For the past few years, North American Personal Solutions team has worked very closely with their counterparts in the U.K. to accelerate the growth in the U.K. Effective in January of this year, we've decided to realign our Personal Solutions segments to include now the U.S., Canada and the U.K. And eventually, we expect to make this a global business, including Latin America. And the whole goal here is to leverage the infrastructure and expertise and the investments we're making in our largest PSol business, which is the U.S., to accelerate growth around the world and is paying dividends. 
Finally, Personal Solutions has been very innovative with a vitality Index of over 17% for 2014, the highest of any business unit in the company. And it's one of the reasons why we believe there'll be a number of opportunities in the lead gen space for us to deliver incremental revenue growth and to establish strong, competitive position in the marketplace. Our unique mix of consumer data assets and strong partnerships with many of our customers should enable us to grow superior solutions in this space. 
Before I go over to John, let me just transition back with some things going on at the corporate level. At the corporate level, in addition to improving our overall operating efficiency with our LEAN organization, which you're aware of, has been around for about 8, 9 years now. At the request of some of our key client customers, our largest customers, the large A customers, we have now rolled out LEAN at their request into their operations. These efforts is going to help significantly strengthen our relationship with these customers and providing valuable insights on how to further reduce their operating expenses and improve effectiveness to the application of our various product offerings, a really unique way to add value to our customers at their request. 
New Product Innovation at the corp level continues to be one of our strongest engines for growth. We launched last year what we call NPI 2.0 and what that's done for us is enhance our Voice of Customer process to better understand our customers' needs and challenges. We've developed a better market testing environment that enabled us to bring products to market faster, build prototype and to launch full speed, to establish metrics for -- reestablish metrics for local NPI and made more effective use of our different IT platforms. So it's really refreshed NPI and the results were solid last year. 
Here's an example. We're building products, as I said, faster, accelerating revenue at faster rates. And a great example is what we're doing in our Fraud and ID services, revenue of which globally was up over 17% last year. So it enables Fraud and ID to prototype a product faster, get customer feedback faster and then launch that product faster than we ever could in the past. So we should see time to revenue for NPI be reduced as a result of what we're doing with 2.0. 
In short, 2014 was an outstanding year. In addition to delivering record revenue and earnings growth, the team executed well on our 4 corporate imperatives and they are: delivering consistent, strong, profitable growth and shareholder returns; number two, developing unparalleled analytical insights, leveraging our unique data assets; three, continue to innovate for market leadership in key domains and verticals that are important to us; and fourth, further strengthen our reputation as a trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world. 
So with that, John, the financials, please?"

As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. 
The FX headwind accelerated in the fourth quarter beyond what we originally expected. For the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $13 million and adjusted EPS was negatively impacted by about $0.03 a share. 
Now let me turn to the business unit financial performance for 4Q '14. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $284 million, up 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Online Information Solutions revenue was $198 million, up about 7% when compared to the year ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $25 million, also up 7% compared to Q4 2013. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was down 13% in the fourth quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $61 million, down 10% when compared to the year ago quarter. IXI revenues were up double digits from 2013. The decline in CMS was primarily driven by $7.2 million of prior year revenues, which are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and which Jeff referred to in his introduction. Excluding these prior year revenues from 2013, Financial Marketing Services would be up about 0.7% and CMS would be down about 1%. 
The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 40.8%, up from the adjusted operating margin of 39% in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
International's revenue was $159 million, up 15% on a reported basis and up 25% on a local currency basis. Acquisitions contributed approximately 15 points of the local currency growth. Constant currency organic revenue growth was about 10%. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $72 million, up 44% in U.S. dollars and up 47% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of TDX. Organic revenue growth in Europe was slightly above 10%. 
Latin America's revenue was $49 million, down 3% in U.S. dollars, but up 13% in local currency, which included the acquisitions of Inffinix and the credit bureau in Paraguay. Organic growth was 6%, driven by double-digit organic growth in Decision Solutions and Analytical Services. 
Canada revenue was $39 million with organic growth of 3% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. 
For the fourth quarter, International's operating margin was 22.6%, down from 29.1% in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Workforce Solutions revenue was $129 million for the quarter, up 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. All growth in Workforce Solutions was organic. Verification Services with revenue of $81 million, was up 24% when compared to the same quarter in 2013. Employer Services revenue was $48 million, up 2% compared to last year. 
The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 32.5% compared to 28.9% in Q4 2013. 
North America Personal Solutions revenue was $59 million, up 2%. Growth was driven primarily by Canadian subscription growth and indirect revenue through TrustedID. 
For the fourth quarter, operating margin was 33.7% compared to 30.7% in Q4 2013, largely driven by reduced marketing expense in the quarter. 
I should note that the figures I just presented reflect the organizational structure as it existed on December 31, 2014. As Rick noted, as of January, we have realigned our business units, consolidating our U.K. Personal Solutions along with North American Personal Solutions into the new Personal Solutions segment. 
In the attachments to our earnings release, we are providing 8 quarters of restated history for the segments as we will be reporting them in 2015. We also present our multiyear business model in the new business unit configuration. 
For the full year 2014, consolidated revenue of $2.44 billion was up 6% on a reported and on adjusted basis and up 7% on constant currency basis. The full year operating margin was 26.2% while the adjusted operating margin was 26.5% down slightly from 26.7% in 2013. 
Diluted EPS attributable to Equifax was $2.97 compared to $2.69 per 2013. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.89, up 8% when compared to the adjusted EPS of $3.60 in 2013. 
Operating cash flow was again very strong at $203 million in 4Q '14 and $616 million for the year. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 1.4 million shares for $115 million in 4Q '14 and 3.9 million shares for $302 million in calendar year 2014. 
Our strong cash flow in 2014 allowed us to complete $340 million of acquisitions in addition to over $300 million in share repurchases and still maintain a very conservative leverage ratio of 1.8x EBITDA. 
We believe we have significant debt capacity available to us within our current credit ratings and are comfortable operating at leverage ratios in the 2.5x EBITDA area. 
With our strong cash flow and substantial available leverage, we can implement the 16% dividend increase we announced yesterday and continue a substantial share repurchase program while completing acquisitions consistent with the high end of our targeted 1% to 2% of annual revenue range. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

As we look at 2015, we expect the U.S. mortgage market will move from a headwind to slightly positive year-on-year. We could discuss that in detail during the Q&A. We expect, however, FX will continue to represent a headwind for both revenue and EPS throughout the year. 
The guidance I will provide is organic growth only at this time. However, as the year unfolds, I would anticipate adding to our overall growth rate through some M&A. 
With that and based upon the current level of domestic and international business activity and current FX rates, we expect 2015 revenues to be between $2.550 billion to $2.6 billion. This reflects constant-currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 10% in 2015, which is up from a 4% growth rate in 2014. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by what we anticipate to be 2 to 3 points of negative impact from FX. And again, this reflects organic growth at this time. 
At current FX rates, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share. Excluding the $0.12 per share negative impact from FX at the current rates, this reflects 11% to 14% growth in 2015, which is beyond the upper end of our range of the long-term model we have for growth, which is 10% to 13%. This guide is consistent -- the revenue growth is consistent with the long-term business model for organic growth. 
We also expect our 2015 operating margin to be up over 27%, which is up nicely from the 26.5% in 2014. Also, our priorities for capital location have not changed. We remain committed to our dividend policy of 25% to 35% of adjusted net income. We invest in our business with CapEx in the range of $75 million to $100 million and continuing our acquisition focus. 
Given our strong cash flow and conservative debt leverage, absent any major acquisitions, we intend to continue our current significant model of stock buyback activity. 
And finally, we anticipate the tax rate for the year to be between 35% and 36%. 
For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $632 million and $642 million, reflecting constant-currency organic growth rate of 11% to 13% and this will be partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.00 and $1.03, which is up 12% to 16%. Excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects 15% to 18% organic growth. And also for the first quarter, we expect operating margin to finish over 27%, which is up over 100 basis points from 2014. 
So with that, operator, if you could please open it up for any questions our audience might have."

The total database ended the year well over 250 million, the active database well over 60 million. We -- as I mentioned in my opening comments, over 4,300 companies now are contributing. That's growing at a rapid clip every year. I see no reason we can't get the active records up over 100 million records in the database, in total over 300 million. And as I've always said before, both add value. The historical records, as I've mentioned on the CMS talk a few minutes ago, is a great source of revenue and elsewhere and you obviously know the value of the active records. And a significance of getting a database continuing to drive obviously is incremental revenue. Every time you have a record you've got to hit, you get X amount of dollars. But as you continue to go from 30 million active to 40 million to 50 million to 60 million to 70 million, the viability that database has in high-transaction volume verticals is greatly enhanced. So we're making great progress in places like credit card, automotive, insurance as an examples."

You mentioned one, yes, you follow the 10-year Treasuries, you follow the interest rates and the mortgage applications are up in the first quarter. Our expectation, Greg, as I said in my opening comments, is we expect overall mortgage for the year to be a modest tailwind versus last year. You could see little strength in the first quarter and kind of dissipating as we go to second, third and fourth quarters. So mortgage is a little bit of a help in the first quarter. But beyond that, the number of wins we had last year across-the-board, that could be ACA or EWS and that could be automotive in USIS, a large direct-to-consumer win we talked about back in the third quarter is monetizing itself in the first quarter. So think about it as being overall great execution by the BU leaders, which is driving the first quarter growth rate at a higher level than we'd normally see combined with some help from the mortgage market."

They've got great metrics now that we've invested heavily in a new platform, we're calling it Renaissance [ph] within PSol, which enables them to launch products at a faster rate, better user interface and experience for the customer. Number two, he's got to leverage the headcount of his indirect model. We bought a company called TrustedID who's doing that. I mentioned $25 million worth of annual contracts that are in the pipeline either closed or being negotiated right now.  Number three, he's got to leverage everything he's doing, which is great in the U.S., to accelerate growth in Canada and the U.K. and take it to Latin America. Number four, he's in the process of developing his own free model. If you believe freemium is here to stay, which I do, I abdicate that responsibility to others. We're going to find a way to participate ourselves. So if he does that, think about this as you think about building your models.

Number one is increasing the size of the database at the fastest rate we possibly can, so going from 67 million to 70 million this year, 70 million to 100 million records. That is an enormous -- you know the math, Andrew. That's an enormous growth lever in and of itself. Number two is taking The Work Number assets to either new verticals or deeper into existing verticals. We are at the early stages, for example, in automotive. It is booming for EWS, but it's very early stages to penetrate that market deeper, faster, so on and so forth, same with credit card. So more verticals and deeper in the current verticals we participate in. Number 3, it is taking analytics to a new level. I think I talked -- I can't remember the exact numbers now, Andrew, but I talked about 40% to 50% growth in analytics. It's remarkable what we've done. And it's meaningful, I'm not going to disclose the numbers, but it's meaningful dollars to the corporation, let alone to EWS, what they have done the last couple of years in analytics. And again, that's early days as well. The fourth one, which we don't talk about a lot, but is very, very important, this is kind of my fault from years ago. We look at the employer size. You've got The Work Number, which is a verification side, as you know, and all the other great suite of products we have on the client's tax credit, compliance center, so on and so forth. Our mentality for years, we've owned this asset for 8 years now, it's hard to believe, but to be totally honest with you today, asset is only there to protect the core Work Number. That's kind of a tough way to wake up every morning, thinking I'm here to protect. So Dann and I, a couple of years ago, decided to change the mentality. They were bringing a great new leader in Scott Collins and really change the culture, the capabilities and the mindset to grow. So they've gone from a just project, which means you have probably negative growth to flat, to now a business that will grow for us even though things like unemployment claims are at historical lows. So that's how I think about EWS from those 4 levers. And as far as the organic growth in 2015, yes, I think I may have mentioned, I expect their growth rate in 2015 to once again be a stellar and it will be all-organic, stellar growth and meaningful margin expansions once again."

On strategic capabilities, clearly, 2 significant growth drivers that we have experienced and will experience going forward. One is the -- what we call Decision 360, Andrew, which you're aware of. Now we have all these unique data assets. What Rudy has done is built this thing called office and the connector. We've invested in systems. We have invested in prototyping capabilities that enable us now to take these unique data assets, pull together and make it so much easier and faster for our customers to consume. That is really disrupting the marketplace. I think I mentioned that our top 100 clients are now consuming 3 products on average, our KCP accounts are 4.5 to 5 products. So Decision 360 leveraging all these unique assets is one huge strategic enablement. Number two is about 18 months, 2 years ago, we changed organizational structure to a concept we call enterprise-wide, which reowns the relationship with all these large clients. So he takes all these unique assets and brings all those assets to the customers. That's simplification of go-to-market strategies' health. As far as verticals, that, I think, offers significant opportunity for core organic growth. Obviously, KCP, I mentioned significant growth last year. They will continue this year. Tom Madison's team have done a great job with telco. We're uniquely positioned there. We have very unique data assets. Auto, we're growing at multiples of the market itself. In the midterm, I'd say -- what we're saying is a rebound in the home equity market. I think we talked about that last year. That will benefit Dann as well as Rudy.

I mean, let's go look at Spain, if you look at Spain we're growing almost double digit there as we exit the year. It's just remarkable. Those 3 countries, which are not booming economies, by any means. Canada is a commodity-based economy, they're starting to slow. So the core you are seeing there or the reasons you're seeing the growth in Canada, to answer your question, as well as U.K. and Spain, is the same set of strategic initiatives we have across the company, it's innovation, it's building new products, it's taking products to market faster. It's driving analytics. It's leveraging Fraud and ID.

Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. 
During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax, adjusted operating revenue and adjusted operating margin that will be adjusted for certain items which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted operating revenue includes the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings from 2013 revenue.
Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects as well as certain other items. The other items excluded for 2013 are the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013, the resource realignment charge and the impairment of our investment in Boa Vista.
In 2014, we also excluded the associated tax effects in addition to the impact of a settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements. 
The adjusted operating margin also excludes certain items. For 2013, adjusted operating margin excludes the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings and the resource realignment charge. For 2014, the adjusted operating margin excludes the legal settlement regarding the dispute over software license agreements. 
All of these measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. 
Also, refer -- please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.equifax.com for further details.

As I always do, I'll go through the high-level review of the fourth quarter. Jeff -- or John will then go through the financial. I'll come back with an outlook for 2015, then we'll go to Q&A. 
We finished 2014 in very strong fashion and we carry some good momentum as we move into 2015. Looking back at last year, both reported growth and constant currency growth in the fourth quarter finished at their highest level of the year, which is always a good thing. For the quarter, fourth quarter 2014, total revenue was $625 million, up 8% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from the fourth quarter 2013. In the quarter, FX created a $13 million year-over-year headwind, which was a significant increase from the third quarter headwind of $6 million. I think you all are intimately aware of what's going on with the euro, the ruble, the pound and others. 
Core non-mortgage market growth accelerated nicely to 8% in the quarter ending the year at 7%, solidly in the range of our long-term growth model. Consistent with the view we've articulated throughout the year, the mortgage market was no longer a headwind in the fourth quarter. As a result, in 2015 and beyond, we'll focus our attention on the constant currency organic growth rate. What I mean by that is we've broken out the past few years -- because of volatility, we've broken out mortgage impact and we'll no longer do that because we, as I'll talk about later on, we expect the mortgage market to be relatively benign year-on-year when we look at 2015. 
The adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 26.5%, in line with the guidance that we gave you for the quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.02, up 12% from $0.91 a year ago, and it was at the upper end of the range that we've guided to. 
Also, given our strong performance for the quarter and the year, we've announced a 16% increase in the dividend, moving from $0.25 a share per quarter to $0.29 a share. 
As I always do, we transition into some of the business units highlights that I think are noteworthy. First, let's start with USIS. They accelerated their revenue and their margin -- and expanded their operating margins throughout 2015, and they're poised to deliver an even stronger top line growth and margin expansion in 2015 than they delivered in 2014. 
A couple of highlights. Decision 360, which we've talked to you a lot about, continues to deliver unique value for our customers and drive revenue growth for us. 
A couple of interesting data points. In 2014, if you take our top 100 customers, on average, they use now up from 1 product to 3 different unique data assets that we have, which is really adding value to them and to us. 
It's even a better story when you look at our KCP accounts. We've talked to you about that, the key client program accounts, about 8 of our largest customers in the United States. On average, they are now consuming 4.5 products, unique data assets that we have. And again, anytime we can bundle the unique data assets together to add value to a client, they win and we win. So Rudy Ploder and his team have done a great job of not just monetizing these assets, but making it easy for our customers to consume. 
Sticking with USIS. We continue to make great progress in the auto sector, where we provide not only credit information to our auto customers, but also adding now employment income verification. In 2014, revenues from our auto group grew by 17%, almost 3x the rate of the market growth. We expect that trend to continue in 2015 as well. 
IXI had a very successful year, returning to strong double-digit growth, driven by new product innovation and deeper penetration with some of our largest, most important customers. 
One of our more significant and unique fraud initiatives, ID management and authentication, continue to position us well with large government contract opportunities, particularly with the federal agencies, such as Social Security Administration and the IRS. In 2014, we processed over 516 million identity verifications within the government and across all verticals in the U.S. alone. Through the concerted effort of USIS, enterprise selling has become an integral part of our go-to-market initiative. We developed a detailed strategy for each vertical, including pricing, product innovation, distribution, incentive compensation, enabling us to further accelerate market growth and penetration. 
On to International, we had an outstanding execution of the NPI initiatives. They delivered a vitality index of 14%, fueling solid growth in virtually every market where we operate. We anticipate revenue growth to be at the upper end of the long-term range for 2015, which is 7% to 10%, and we expect margins to expand nicely throughout the course of 2015. 
Some highlights there. Single-digit growth in our core Information Solutions product offerings, coupled with double-digit growth in Decision Solutions and Personal Solutions, resulted in another year of strong organic growth and a much stronger market position as we enter 2015. U.K. exited the year with double-digit growth and very high-single-digit growth rate for the year, significantly outpacing the economic environment growth. Particularly for us, it was a double-digit growth in decision analytics and Personal Solutions. That's a trend that's continued now for 3 or 4 years in the U.K. 
Canada exited the year with very healthy double-digit constant currency growth rate, primarily driven by their core Information Solution product offerings. Those are 2 great examples of where the team is executing at a level enabling them to grow at significant levels above and beyond what the economy is contributing. 
Latin America delivered broad-based, double-digit constant currency growth across virtually all major product lines in all countries. 
In Russia, we added over 20 million records to the credit database and have significantly expanded the data assets in our fraud prevention system. We should talk a little bit about Russia, we've got some questions. Obviously, the sanctions and the ruble will impact our view of Russia going forward, at least for 2015. 
Finally, all of the centers of excellences that support our business units, especially in this case, International, have dedicated significant resources to ensure the successful integration of TDX. And I believe right now, the integration of TDX is largely behind us. TDX and the COEs will now focus their immediate attention on the very large opportunity with the U.K. government that we announced in December. For that project, which is going well, there'll be required IT developments in order to meet the security requirements of the U.K. government. We're, in essence, standing up the environment to handle what the government needs. It's going as planned, as scheduled. We expect that environment to be stood up sometime in the late second quarter to mid-third quarter. Start getting the data into system at the time, it takes us some time to format the data, cleanse the data and then work with our partners, the collection agencies. We expect to monetize -- start monetizing that win some time in the late fourth quarter and ramp up really nicely in 2016. So that's going as planned. 
On the Workforce Solutions. They had a blockbuster year in 2014. Despite significant headwinds from the mortgage market, Workforce Solutions delivered strong double-digit, non-mortgage market organic growth once again and 270 basis points of margin expansion for the year. We're expecting to get another really solid, good growth here in 2015 for EWS as well as meaningful margin expansion once again, that's the great thing about those models. 
Our Workforce Solutions exited the fourth -- exited the year and the fourth quarter with core non-mortgage market organic growth rate of over 17%, remarkable. For the year, core non-mortgage market growth was 13%, driven by strong double-digit growth in auto, government and preemployment. We now have over 4,300 companies across the United States contributing employment and income information to The Work Number database. 
Our data and analytics initiatives, which we talked to you about now for a couple years, are key drivers of revenue growth in both 2014 and 2015. In fact, we are looking at 35% to 40% growth in our analytics product line across EWS in 2015. In 2014, we signed 227 contracts with companies who need to assure their compliance obligations under the Affordable Care Act. 
In addition to the incremental revenues, customers are also contributing their employment and income information to The Work Number database. So it is two bites of the apple, if you will, making money on the analytics for ACA as well as building the database at a much faster rate. 
We're also developing a number of other innovative analytical solutions to enlighten employers about the demographics and the profile of their workforce, truly taking EWS and bringing it to the level of any other business we have around in the world, if not even higher, in the area of analytics. 
We've also broadened our relationship with CMS, leveraging our historical records to provide employment income verification on individuals and alleviate their need to use alternative, more costly sources of information. We're expecting our CMS relationship to grow by over 50% in 2015 when compared to 2014. What I meant by that comment there is we started off with CMS just using very recent records off The Work Number, we're now going back to older records, which still add great value and provide solutions to CMS, thus providing an increased revenue source for us. 
Finally, our compliance center initiatives, such as I-9, are generating strong interest from employers who require great assurance on their compliance with numerous regulatory -- regulations and laws, and that's been a great growth vehicle for them and EWS. 
On the PSol. They have moved aggressively on their four-pronged strategy that I outlined briefly in the third quarter call, improving on their execution of delivering value-added products that consumers need and want, expanding our presence in the indirect market through the TrustedID acquisition, enhancing our International opportunities, leveraging our domestic delivery platforms and product strategies and evaluating opportunities in the lead generation space to compete more directly with the freemium companies that exist. We anticipate 2015 growth in margin will be in the range of their long-term model we communicated to you before. 
We have a variety of initiatives in value-based acquisitions and retention. We improved customer lifetime value of our core product offerings by almost 45%. We also have a number of other initiatives underway addressing our media strategy, increasing ARPU and lowering our churn, all of which enable us to deliver stronger growth and margin expansion. 
In the indirect market, our TrustedID team has signed contracts or is in negotiation with financial -- large financial institutions and nonfinancial institutions on opportunities, which, in aggregate, could represent up to $25 million of annualized revenue potential. H&R Block is an excellent example of how we're developing highly customized and unique product offerings which support and enhance our indirect partners' customer relationships. It also underscores how Personal Solutions is developing new products and expanding its distribution channels with solutions that help consumers address the ever-growing threat of identity theft. Millions of taxpayers are victims of tax identity theft, where criminals use a consumer's personal information to file a fraudulent tax return. Leveraging our data and analytics expertise, combined with H&R Block's tax-related capabilities and expertise, H&R Block's Tax Identity Shield provides consumers with the ability to better understand their vulnerabilities for tax identity theft, and most importantly, take the appropriate steps to help reduce that vulnerability. This is the first and only tax theft -- tax identity theft protection and restoration system product in the marketplace today, and we're proud to be working with a great partner like H&R Block. 
For the past few years, North American Personal Solutions team has worked very closely with their counterparts in the U.K. to accelerate the growth in the U.K. Effective in January of this year, we've decided to realign our Personal Solutions segments to include now the U.S., Canada and the U.K. And eventually, we expect to make this a global business, including Latin America. And the whole goal here is to leverage the infrastructure and expertise and the investments we're making in our largest PSol business, which is the U.S., to accelerate growth around the world, and it's paying dividends. 
Finally, Personal Solutions has been very innovative with a vitality Index of over 17% for 2014, the highest of any business unit in the company. And it's one of the reasons why we believe there'll be a number of opportunities in the lead gen space for us to deliver incremental revenue growth and to establish a strong, competitive position in the marketplace. Our unique mix of consumer data assets and strong partnerships with many of our customers should enable us to grow superior solutions in this space. 
Before I go over to John, let me just transition back with some things going on at the corporate level. At the corporate level, in addition to improving our overall operating efficiency with our LEAN organization, which you're aware of, has been around for about 8, 9 years now, at the request of some of our key client customers, our largest customers, the large A customers, we have now rolled out LEAN at their request into their operations. This effort has significantly strengthened our relationship with these customers and providing valuable insights on how to further reduce their operating expenses and improve effectiveness through the application of our various product offerings, a really unique way to add value to our customers at their request. 
New Product Innovation at the corp level continues to be one of our strongest engines for growth. We launched last year what we call NPI 2.0, and what that's done for us is enhance our Voice of Customer process to better understand our customers' needs and challenges. We've developed a better market testing environment that enabled us to bring products to market faster, build prototype and to launch full speed, to establish metrics for -- reestablish metrics for local NPI and made more effective use of our different IT platforms. So it's really refreshed NPI, and the results were solid last year. 
Here's an example. We're building products, as I said, faster, accelerating revenue at faster rates. And a great example is what we're doing in our Fraud and ID services, revenue of which globally was up over 17% last year. So it enables Fraud and ID to prototype a product faster, get customer feedback faster and then launch that product faster than we ever could in the past. So we should see time to revenue for NPI be reduced as a result of what we're doing with 2.0. 
In short, 2014 was an outstanding year. In addition to delivering record revenue and earnings growth, the team executed well on our 4 corporate imperatives and they are: delivering consistent, strong, profitable growth and shareholder returns; number two, developing unparalleled analytical insights, leveraging our unique data assets; three, continue to innovate for market leadership in key domains and verticals that are important to us; and fourth, further strengthen our reputation as a trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world. 
So with that, John, the financials, please?"

As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. 
The FX headwind accelerated in the fourth quarter beyond what we originally expected. For the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $13 million and adjusted EPS was negatively impacted by about $0.03 a share. 
Now let me turn to the business unit financial performance for 4Q '14. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $284 million, up 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Online Information Solutions revenue was $198 million, up about 7% when compared to the year ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $25 million, also up 7% compared to Q4 2013. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was down 13% in the fourth quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $61 million, down 10% when compared to the year-ago quarter. IXI revenues were up double digits from 2013. The decline in CMS was primarily driven by $7.2 million of prior year revenues, which are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and which Jeff referred to in his introduction. Excluding these prior year revenues from 2013, Financial Marketing Services would be up about 0.7% and CMS would be down about 1%. 
The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 40.8%, up from the adjusted operating margin of 39% in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
International's revenue was $159 million, up 15% on a reported basis and up 25% on a local currency basis. Acquisitions contributed approximately 15 points of the local currency growth. Constant currency organic revenue growth was about 10%. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $72 million, up 44% in U.S. dollars and up 47% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of TDX. Organic revenue growth in Europe was slightly above 10%. 
Latin America's revenue was $49 million, down 3% in U.S. dollars but up 13% in local currency, which included the acquisitions of Inffinix and the credit bureau in Paraguay. Organic growth was 6%, driven by double-digit organic growth in Decision Solutions and Analytical Services. 
Canada revenue was $39 million, with organic growth of 3% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. 
For the fourth quarter, International's operating margin was 22.6%, down from 29.1% in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Workforce Solutions revenue was $129 million for the quarter, up 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. All growth in Workforce Solutions was organic. Verification Services, with revenue of $81 million, was up 24% when compared to the same quarter in 2013. Employer Services revenue was $48 million, up 2% compared to last year. 
The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 32.5% compared to 28.9% in Q4 2013. 
North America Personal Solutions revenue was $59 million, up 2%. Growth was driven primarily by Canadian subscription growth and indirect revenue through TrustedID. 
For the fourth quarter, operating margin was 33.7% compared to 30.7% in Q4 2013, largely driven by reduced marketing expense in the quarter. 
I should note that the figures I just presented reflect the organizational structure as it existed on December 31, 2014. As Rick noted, as of January, we have realigned our business units, consolidating our U.K. Personal Solutions along with North American Personal Solutions into the new Personal Solutions segment. 
In the attachments to our earnings release, we are providing 8 quarters of restated history for the segments as we will be reporting them in 2015. We also present our multiyear business model in the new business unit configuration. 
For the full year 2014, consolidated revenue of $2.44 billion was up 6% on a reported and an adjusted basis and up 7% on constant currency basis. The full year operating margin was 26.2% while the adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, down slightly from 26.7% in 2013. 
Diluted EPS attributable to Equifax was $2.97 compared to $2.69 for 2013. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.89, up 8% when compared to the adjusted EPS of $3.60 in 2013. 
Operating cash flow was again very strong at $203 million in 4Q '14 and $616 million for the year. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 1.4 million shares for $115 million in 4Q '14 and 3.9 million shares for $302 million in calendar year 2014. 
Our strong cash flow in 2014 allowed us to complete $340 million of acquisitions in addition to over $300 million in share repurchases and still maintain a very conservative leverage ratio of 1.8x EBITDA. 
We believe we have significant debt capacity available to us within our current credit ratings and are comfortable operating at leverage ratios in the 2.5x EBITDA area. 
With our strong cash flow and substantial available leverage, we can implement the 16% dividend increase we announced yesterday and continue a substantial share repurchase program while completing acquisitions consistent with the high end of our targeted 1% to 2% of annual revenue range. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."
175749,282428812,761592,"Equifax Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. I'll quickly summarize before we go to questions.

As we look at 2015, we expect the U.S. mortgage market will move from a headwind to slightly positive year-on-year. We could discuss that in detail during the Q&A. We expect, however, FX will continue to represent a headwind for both revenue and EPS throughout the year. 
The guidance I will provide is organic growth only at this time. However, as the year unfolds, I would anticipate adding to our overall growth rate through some M&A. 
With that and based upon the current level of domestic and international business activity and current FX rates, we expect 2015 revenues to be between $2.550 billion to $2.6 billion. This reflects constant-currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 10% in 2015, which is up from a 4% growth rate in 2014. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by what we anticipate to be 2 to 3 points of negative impact from FX. And again, this reflects organic growth at this time. 
At current FX rates, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share. Excluding the $0.12 per share negative impact from FX at the current rates, this reflects 11% to 14% growth in 2015, which is beyond the upper end of our range of the long-term model we have for growth, which is 10% to 13%. This guide is consistent -- the revenue growth is consistent with the long-term business model for organic growth. 
We also expect our 2015 operating margin to be up over 27%, which is up nicely from the 26.5% in 2014. Also, our priorities for capital allocation have not changed. We remain committed to our dividend policy of 25% to 35% of adjusted net income, reinvesting in our business with CapEx in the range of $75 million to $100 million and continuing our acquisition focus. 
Given our strong cash flow and conservative debt leverage, absent any major acquisitions, we intend to continue our current significant level of stock buyback activity. 
And finally, we anticipate the tax rate for the year to be between 35% and 36%. 
For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $632 million and $642 million, reflecting constant-currency organic growth rate of 11% to 13%, and this will be partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.00 and $1.03, which is up 12% to 16%. Excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects 15% to 18% organic growth. And also for the first quarter, we expect operating margin to finish over 27%, which is up over 100 basis points from 2014. 
So with that, operator, if you could please open it up for any questions our audience might have."

The total database ended the year well over 250 million, the active database well over 60 million. We -- as I mentioned in my opening comments, over 4,300 companies now are contributing. That's growing at a rapid clip every year. I see no reason we can't get the active records up over 100 million records in the database, in total over 300 million. And as I've always said before, both add value. The historical records, as I've mentioned on the CMS talk a few minutes ago, is a great source of revenue, and elsewhere, and you obviously know the value of the active records. And the significance of getting that database -- continuing to drive it, obviously, is incremental revenue. Every time you add a record, you get a hit, you get X amount of dollars. But as you continue to go from 30 million active to 40 million to 50 million to 60 million to 70 million, the viability that database has in high-transaction volume verticals is greatly enhanced.

Our expectation, Greg, as I said in my opening comments, is we expect overall mortgage for the year to be a modest tailwind versus last year. You could see a little strength in the first quarter and then kind of dissipating as we go to second, third and fourth quarters. So mortgage is a little bit of a help in the first quarter. But beyond that, the number of wins we had last year across-the-board, that could be ACA or EWS and that could be automotive in USIS, a large direct-to-consumer win we talked about back in the third quarter is monetizing itself in the first quarter. So think about it as being overall great execution by the BU leaders, which is driving the first quarter growth rate at a higher level than we'd normally see, combined with some help from the mortgage market."

Think about the strategy -- the growth strategy in EWS on 4 dimensions, and they're all equally important.

Think about the strategy -- the growth strategy in EWS on 4 dimensions, and they're all equally important. Number one is increasing the size of the database at the fastest rate we possibly can, so going from 67 million to 70 million this year, 70 million to 100 million records. That is an enormous -- you know the math, Andrew. That's an enormous growth lever in and of itself. Number two is taking The Work Number assets to either new verticals or deeper into existing verticals. We are at the early stages, for example, in automotive. It is booming for EWS, but it's very early stages. So we need to penetrate that market deeper, faster, so on and so forth, same with credit card. So more verticals and deeper in the current verticals we participate in. Number 3, it is taking analytics to a new level. I think I talked -- I can't remember the exact numbers now, Andrew, but I talked about 40% to 50% growth in analytics. It's remarkable what we've done. And it's meaningful, I'm not going to disclose the numbers, but it's meaningful dollars to the corporation, let alone to EWS, what they have done the last couple of years in analytics. And again, that's early days as well. The fourth one, which we don't talk about a lot, but is very, very important, this is kind of my fault from years ago. When we look at the employer size -- you've got The Work Number, which is the verification side, as you know, and all the other great suite of products we have, unemployment claims, tax credit, compliance center, so on and so forth. Our mentality for years, we've owned this asset for 8 years now, it's hard to believe, but to be totally honest with you today, asset is only there to protect the core Work Number. That's kind of a tough way to wake up every morning, thinking I'm here to protect. So Dann and I, a couple of years ago, decided to change the mentality. They were bringing a great new leader in Scott Collins and really changed the culture, the capabilities and the mindset to growth. So they've gone from a just project, which means you have probably negative growth to flat, to now a business that will grow for us even though things like unemployment claims are at historical lows. So that's how I think about EWS, on those 4 levers. And as far as the organic growth in 2015, yes, I think I may have mentioned, I expect their growth rate in 2015 to once again be a stellar and it will be all-organic, stellar growth and meaningful margin expansions once again."

On strategic capabilities, clearly, 2 significant growth drivers that we have experienced and will experience going forward. One is the -- what we call Decision 360, Andrew, which you're aware of. Now we have all these unique data assets. What Rudy has done is built this thing called the office or the connector. We've invested in systems. We have invested in prototyping capabilities that enable us now to take these unique data assets, pull them together and make it so much easier and faster for our customers to consume. That is really disrupting the marketplace. I think I mentioned that our top 100 clients are now consuming 3 products on average, our top KCP accounts are 4.5 to 5 products. So Decision 360, leveraging all these unique assets, is one huge strategic enabler. Number two is about 18 months, 2 years ago, we changed the organizational structure to a concept we call enterprise-wide, which is Rudy owns the relationship with all these large clients. So he takes all these unique assets and brings all those assets to the customers. That simplification of go-to-market strategy has helped. As far as verticals, that, I think, offers significant opportunity for core organic growth. Obviously, KCP, I mentioned significant growth last year. They will continue this year. Tom Madison's team have done a great job. Telco, we're uniquely positioned there. We have very unique data assets. Auto, we're growing at multiples of the market itself. In the midterm, I'd say -- what we're saying is a rebound in the home equity market. I think we talked about that last year. That will benefit Dann as well as Rudy. And I think that's a multiyear growth lever for us not just for 2015."

As always, thank you for making time for join us this morning. The first quarter's performance was very robust and significantly exceeded our expectations. As you'll hear throughout my comments and John's comments",1749,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for making time for join us this morning. The first quarter's performance was very robust and significantly exceeded our expectations. As you'll hear throughout my comments and John's comments in the question-and-answer period will be at the growth for the quarter was very broad-based. It was across all business units, across many verticals and across many countries. USIS and Workforce Solutions, in particular, posted an exceptional quarter. USIS out-strengthened the Decision 360 initiative, enterprise selling strategy, direct-to-consumer channel partners, mortgage and home equity lending. Workforce Solutions saw broad strength in Verification Services, including government, automotive and mortgage as well as solid strength in its employee services business. The revenue strength in both of those business nice margin expansions as you saw. Also, International and PSol finished very solid performances for the quarter. 
In total, the revenue was $652 million, up 12% on a reported basis, up 14.4% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FX created $17 million of year-over-year headwind, an increase from the fourth quarter of last year, which is $13 million of headwind. The adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.07, up 20% from $0.89 a share last year and significantly above the upper end of the guidance we provided a few months ago. We'll [indiscernible] by business year highlights, and then John will get into the details of the financials. I'll start as I always do with USCIS. There, the Decision 360 initiative, New Product Innovation and enterprise selling team delivered 14% revenue growth and healthy 42.4% operating margin, up 520 basis points from last year. 
Couple of highlights. Our relationship with Credit Karma, when we talked about in the past, they went live in January and generated transaction volumes exceeding our original projections. In addition to purchasing our credit information, Credit Karma is also using our freemium thought and identity authentication solutions provide consumers with online access to the credit information. Originally, we're part of a [indiscernible] solution with Credit Karma, and we believe this will ultimately lead to a [indiscernible] solution in an effort to better maximize to the consumers. 
As I mentioned in the last call, in recent quarters, one of the things we're seeing is that the financial institutions are changing the way they originate their consumer accounts and Financial Marketing Services, FMS. The traditional prescreen activity are giving away to more targeted one-on-one online offers. We talked about again this last few quarter. And as a result, our revenue mix is shifting towards higher margin online solutions. Growth in prescreen revenues has moderated somewhat. 
Net-net, I think at shifted the benefit to USIS. As you know, the full commercial USIS few quarters ago. Our commercial business is off to a great start recording the best first quarter performance since 2007, with record revenue and operating margin performance. Mortgage originations in home equity lending were also stronger in the quarter as low interest rate environment and lending activity has exceeded our expectations for the quarter. We'll get into that in the Q&A and compare the MD&A. Our core tribunal reporting volume was up 18% and will also experience strong growth in our high-value Undisclosed Debt Monitoring product services as lenders continue with our more rigorous underwriting standards. The pace of mortgage refinancing activity in home equity lending continues to be solid, and we expect it will moderate as we talked about back in February. Some we're going to expect in second [ph] quarter and continue to moderate as we exit the year. USIS growth rate is expected to be strong over the course of the year and be comfortably above its long-term growth range of 5% to 7% for the full year. 
On the International, they posted double-digit local currency growth in 5 countries, including the U.K. We continued to make good progress with the integration of TDX, which delivered constant currency revenue growth in excess of 25% for the first quarter. And also, leveraging NPI further, their market position as many of their products revenue about their expectation for the quarter around the world. 
International's ongoing effort to diversify its revenue base is underscored by double-digit constant currency growth from their SME customer base, retail customers, insurance customers, government customers and utility customers around the globe. 
Also, all verticals, including financial, our decision and analytics solutions are strengthening relationships with our customers and opening new opportunities to NPI and new sources of growth going forward. 
International's operating margin performance is also improving. Excluding TDX and all the investments we're making in TDX, International's operating margin expanded by approximately 190 basis points in the quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we executed the debt recovery services contract with here Majesty's government in U.K. we talked about last time. That's resulting in continued investment in TDX as we prepare to ramp up and go live sometime in late third quarter for this multiyear U.K. government opportunity. So net-net, that opportunity is on pace and on track on almost every dimension. And again, we expect some modest revenue at the back end of this year ramping up in 2014. 
In addition, the unique capabilities of TDX and also in Phoenix, that's what we bought in Mexico, those capabilities are being leverage another geographic markets where we do not simply have credit information operating units. This year, International will be launching its Latin American regionalization strategy. That what Jeff kind of alluded to. That includes people, process and system changes. This effort will further streamline our operations and provide incremental operating leverage for International. It will also improve customer service and accelerate our time for revenue for new product innovation. 
For the year, we expect revenue growth to be solidly in the long-term range of 7% to 10% growth in International with improved operating margins as we exit the year. 
On to EWS. Their momentum accelerated in the quarter, remarkable performance. This broad-based revenue growth of 24%, up from 15% growth in the fourth quarter, and margins were up an astonishing 800 basis points from first quarter of last year to 40.3% for the quarter. Verification Services continue to make great progress penetrating our targeted non-mortgage markets. We delivered strong double-digit growth in home equity lending, auto, card, consumer finance, government and preemployment. And finally, growth in the mortgage activity drove a very healthy 34% growth in overall Verification Services revenue. In addition, our penetration of pure lending space with our employment and income Verification Services have delivered strong new sources of growth. 
We now have over 4,500 companies contributing their employment and income information into The Work Number database, and this number of companies are growing on a monthly basis. The outlook for 2015 continues to be very good. Although mortgage originations are expected to slow, our revenues in various ACA initiatives further penetration of employment income verification in non-mortgage markets. And our strategic initiatives in employee services are expected to offset the mortgage decreased later this year, resulting in full year revenue growth, well-above the top end of the multiyear range and margin expansion in the range of the neighborhood of 350 basis points or more versus 2014. 
On to PSol. Constant currency revenue growth was at the upper end of the multiyear range, and operating margins continue to be strong. In addition, we're making good progress on the strategic transformation. Double-digit growth in indirect Canada and U.K. were the major contributors to growth in the quarter. For our direct-to-consumer activity, the U.S. key operating metric, average revenue per subscriber insurance continue to improve. 
2015 will be a good transformational year for PSol as we talked about in the past. They are making good progress on [indiscernible] strengthening the core U.S.-based business and developing strong marketing position in the indirect space; and three, growing our International presence in Canada and the U.K. We expect Personal Solutions to end the year with revenue comfortably within our multiyear target range. 
Let me go back to corporate and give you some highlights of a corporate level, and then I'll turn it over to John for the financials. I think we spent about 9 years not talk about how NPI drives growth and talk about 3 points of growth coming from NPI and we deliver those 3 points of growth for us in the first quarter. There's another very important  growth driver, which we launched about 3 or 4 years. We don't talk a lot about, and we launched it across all our business units and that's what we call Enterprise Growth Initiatives, EDI for us. It's a very systematically for managing multimillion-dollar revenue initiatives and overwhelmed with resources and process and senior management attention gives importance to our long-term growth. Our EGI initiatives had a banner first quarter performance with strong double-digit growth, exceeding our expectations for the quarter. And our outlook for the year continues to be for very strong year-on-year growth coming from EGI. 
Also, at the corporate level, we're talking how we develop a strong reputation of customers regarding our expertise in marine, and we're doing this globally. We're not only leveraging this relationship through our existing customers but continue to drive incremental revenue growth but will also open doors with noncustomers around the world because we have patiently developed some of our very key verticals. It gives us yet another opportunity to grow revenue for strong customer partnerships and really differentiate our offerings to these customers in yet another dimension. Our global fraud initiatives, which crossed our all of our B2B business units, delivered double-digit growth in the quarter as well. 
In summary, the quarter's performance is the strongest first quarter performance we've experienced in many years. Sequential revenue growth from the fourth quarter was up 4.4%, whereas in the past years, we typically experience modest or even declining sequential growth. Adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points in the fourth quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased almost 5% from the fourth quarter when we usually see declining sequential growth. Despite this unprecedented performance, we're still early in the year and there's still some uncertainties out there in macroeconomic challenges around the globe. However, we are more optimistic now than we were when we entered the year. 
I'll turn it over to you, John, for some financials, and I'll come back with some closing comments."
175749,290549068,792624,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone.

As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. 
Now during the quarter, we recorded a charge of $23.4 million, principally related to the realignment of internal resources to more effectively support our strategic objectives. The was primarily driven by the regionalization, consolidation strategy in International, including the integration of TDX; consolidation of functions related to the integration of commercial into USIS; and then some realignment actions across the remainder of the business. The cost were 2/3 severance but also include related real estate, legal and other costs. The costs are reflected in SG&A and the general corporate expense line of our financial statements. The actions will occur throughout 2015 and should be completed within 12 months. Ongoing savings, once the actions are complete, are expected to be $10 million to $15 million per year, with limited incremental benefit in 2015. 
Now consistent with our past practice, we're treating unusual or infrequent items. We've excluded this charge from our adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The FX impact on revenue and EPS this quarter were consistent with our expectations that we provided to you in February. 
Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $299 million, up 14% when compared to the first quarter. Online Information Solutions revenue was $222 million, up 15% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $31 million, up 28% compared to Q1 2014. These trends compare favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 21% in the first quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $46 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. As Rick mentioned earlier, the slower growth reflects a shift in how financial institutions originating their accounts to 1:1 online solicitations. The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 42.4%, up from 37.2% in the first quarter of 2013. We continue to expect USIS to have operating margins in the low 40s, consistent with our long-term model in 2015. 
International's revenue was $139 million, down 1% on a reported basis, but up 10% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $58 million, up 1% in U.S. dollars and up 12% on local currency. Latin America's revenue was $48 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars, but up 3% in local currency. For the first quarter, International operating margin was 20.2%, down slightly from 20.6% in the first quarter 2014. This reduction in margin was principally due to FX. For the full year, we continue to expect the operating margin to expand slightly compared to 2014. 
Workforce Solutions revenue was $149 million for the quarter, up 24% when compared to the first quarter of 2014. Verification Services with revenue of $86 million was up 34% when compared to the same quarter in 2014. Employer Services revenue was $63 million, up 13% compared to last year. Following the Lockheed hiatus in 2014, processing their backlog during the first quarter. Also, revenue from our ACA analytical solutions was very strong in the quarter. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 40.3% compared to 32.3% in Q1 of 2014. The marketing benefited from the Lockheed renewal, which contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the margin in the quarter. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect Workforce Solutions operating margin to be in the range of 36% to 37%. 
Personal Solutions revenue was $66 million, up 4% and a reported basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the first quarter, operating margin was 27.4% compared to 28.5% in Q1 2014. This year-over-year reduction is consistent with our expectations and the guidance we gave for Q1 and the full year. 
In the first quarter, general corporate expense, at $78.4 million, was up significantly, reflecting the $23.4 million realignment charge I mentioned previously. Excluding this charge, general corporate expense was $55 million, up $8.7 million sequentially and $24.3 million versus 1Q '15 -- versus 1Q '14. This increase is principally due to increased incentive and equity compensation and benefit expense. This reflects the very strong performance in 1Q '15 as well as earlier timing of annual equities expense in 2015 versus 2014. We also saw increased professional legal and regulatory costs in 1Q '15 versus 1Q '14. 
Looking at 2Q '15, we expect general corporate expense to be down $10 million sequentially on an adjusted basis, reflecting lower equity expense and at or slightly below the Q2 level in both Q3 and Q4. Operating cash flow was $103 million in the first quarter. Cash flow grew faster than earnings, reflecting positive working capital performance. We continue our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 1 million shares for $90 million and paid $35 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our leverage remains a very conservative 1.75x EBITDA. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

Quick outlook for guidance the second quarter and the total year. I'll give you some numbers just to put in perspective with the influence of the mortgage market as it relates to second quarter and the balance of the year. Again, we expect the market to -- the mortgage market performance, like we talked about back in February, a bit second quarter and then continue to moderate even further year-on-year in the third and fourth quarter. 
So for the second quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million. That is in constant currency organic, revenue growth rate of 10% to 12%, and that's partially offset by the 3 points of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.09 and $1.11, which is up 14% to 16%, excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency growth rate of 16% to 18% for the quarter. We also expect operating margin to continue to improve in the quarter in the range of 27.5% to 28%. 
Obviously, there's some uncertainty for the balance of the year, its macroeconomic uncertainty around the world and U.S. economic uncertainty, some uncertainty in the Middle East, uncertainty in Latin America. So against that uncertain backdrop, I'm convinced that this team will continue to execute extremely well and continue to drive above-market growth across all our other businesses and all our verticals in the second quarter and the balance of the year. So with that and based upon the current level of domestic and International business activity and the FX rates, we expect 2015 to have a revenue range of $2.585 billion to $2.635 billion, which is up from our previous guidance. This reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 11% for the year. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by 3 points of negative impact from FX. And again, as reported, this is only organic revenue growth at this time. 
2015 adjusted EPS, we expect to be in the range of $4.28 and $4.35 per share, also above from our previous guidance. This reflects 10%, 12% growth in 2015. FX impact for the year, as we previously stated in the last earnings call, is expected to be about $0.11 for the year and we have -- 11% [ph] for the year -- $0.11 [ph] per the year. We have $0.02 share impact in the first quarter, which says we have a remaining $0.09 per share impact for the full year.

And I always tell people that there's different way to think about that. And if look at one of our competitors talks about their piece of business, their Credit Karma, if you will, resell partners, they aggregate in the PSol business. That reflects a much different growth profile. So as I think about USIS general today when it comes to PSol, which will be in the future, that free market is here, and it's clear, we got a great strategy around that and continues to develop right now."

During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin that will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects and a charge principally related to the realignment of internal resources to more effectively support the company's strategic objectives. Adjusted operating margin excludes the onetime charge principally related to the realignment of our internal resources. These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included in our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.equifax -- .investor.equifax.com, for further details.

175749,290549068,793103,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for making time for join us this morning. The first quarter's performance was very robust and significantly exceeded our expectations.

The first quarter's performance was very robust and significantly exceeded our expectations. A theme you'll hear throughout my comments and John's comments and the question-and-answer period will be that the growth for the quarter was very broad based. It was across all business units, across many verticals and across many countries. USIS and Workforce Solutions in particular posted an exceptional quarter. USIS saw strength with its Decision 360 initiatives, enterprise selling strategy, direct-to-consumer channel partners, mortgage and home equity lending. Workforce Solutions saw broad strength in Verification Services, including government, automotive and mortgage, as well as solid strength in its Employer services business. The revenue strength in both those businesses led to nice margin expansions, as you saw. Also, International and PSol finished with very solid performances for the quarter. 
In total, the revenue was $652 million, up 12% on a reported basis, up 14.4% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FX created $17 million of year-over-year headwind, an increase from the fourth quarter of last year, which was $13 million of headwind. The adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.07, up 20% from $0.89 a share last year and significantly above the upper end of the guidance we provided a few months ago. 
And I will walk through some business by business unit highlights, and then John will get into the details of the financials. I'll start, as I always do, with USCIS. There they leverage this -- their Decision 360 initiative, New Product Innovation and enterprise selling teams to deliver 14% revenue growth and a healthy 42.4% operating margin, up 520 basis points from last year. 
Couple of highlights. Our relationship with Credit Karma we talked about in the past, they went live in January and generated transaction volumes exceeding our original predictions -- projections. In addition to purchasing our credit information, Credit Karma is also using our premier fraud and identity authentication solutions to provide consumers with online access to their credit information. Originally, we were part of a 2-Bureau solution with Credit Karma, and we believe this will ultimately move to a 3-Bureau solution in an effort to better maximize the benefits to the consumers. 
As I mentioned last call, in recent quarters, one of the things we're seeing is that the financial institutions are changing the way they originate new consumer accounts. In Financial Marketing Services, FMS, the traditional Prescreen activity are giving away some more targeted one-on-one online offers. We talked about this again in last few quarters. And as a result, our revenue mix as it [indiscernible] been shifting towards higher-margin online solutions, our growth in Prescreen revenues has moderated somewhat. 
Net-net, these had shifted the benefit to USIS. 
As you know, we folded Commercial into USIS a few quarters ago. The Commercial business is off to a great start, recording their best first quarter performance since 2007 with record revenue and operating margin performance. 
Mortgage origination and home equity lending were also stronger in the quarter as low interest rate environment resulted in lending activity that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. And we'll get into that in the Q&A and compare it to the MBA. 
Our core tri-bureau reporting volume was up 18%, and we're also experiencing -- experienced strong growth in our high-value Undisclosed Debt Monitoring product services as lenders continued to move -- continued with their more rigorous underwriting standards. 
The pace of mortgage refinancing activity in home equity lending continues to be solid, and we expect it will moderate, as we talked about back in February, somewhat going into second quarter and then continue to moderate as we exit the year. USIS growth rate is expected to be strong over the course of the year and be comfortably above its long-term growth range of 5% to 7% for the full year. 
On the International, they posted a double-digit local currency growth in 5 countries, including the U.K., continue to make good progress with the integration of TDX, which delivered constant currency revenue growth in excess of 25% for the first quarter. And they're also leveraging NPI further, their market position, as many products delivered revenue above their expectation for the quarter around the world. International's ongoing effort to diversify its revenue base is underscored by double-digit constant currency growth from their SME customer base, retail customers, insurance customers, government customers and utility customers around the globe. Also, all verticals, including financial, our decision and analytics solutions, are strengthening relationships with our customers and opening new opportunities to NPI and new sources of growth going forward. 
International's operating margin performance is also improving. Excluding TDX and all the investments we're making in TDX, International's operating margin expanded by approximately 190 basis points in the quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2014. 
During the quarter, we executed a debt recovery services contract with Her Majesty's government in the U.K. that we talked about last time. That's resulting in continued investment in TDX as we prepare to ramp up and go live sometime in late third quarter for this multiyear U.K. government opportunity. So net-net, that opportunity is on pace and on track on almost every dimension. And again, we expect some modest revenue at the back end of this year, further ramping up in 2014 (sic) [2016]. 
In addition, the unique capabilities of TDX and also Inffinix, that's the one what we bought in Mexico, those capabilities are being leveraged in other geographic markets where we do not personally [ph] have credit information operating units. 
This year, International will be launching a Latin American regionalization strategy, that's what Jeff kind of alluded to, that includes people, process and system changes. This effort will further streamline our operations and provide incremental operating leverage for International and also improve customer service and accelerate our time to revenue for New Product Innovation. 
For the year, we expect revenue growth to be solidly in the long-term range of 7% to 10% growth for International with improving -- improved operating margins as we exit the year. 
On to EWS. Their momentum accelerated in the quarter, a remarkable performance, with broad-based revenue growth of 24%, up from 15% growth in the fourth quarter, and margins were up an astonishing 800 basis points from the first quarter of last year to 40.3% for the quarter. Verification Services continued to make great progress penetrating our targeted non-mortgage markets. They delivered strong double-digit growth in home equity lending, auto, car, consumer finance, government and pre-employment. And finally, growth in our mortgage activity drove a very healthy 34% growth in overall Verification Services revenue. In addition, our penetration of peer-to-peer lending space with our employment and income verification services had delivered strong new sources of growth. 
We now have over 4,500 companies contributing their employment and income information into The Work Number database, and this number of companies are growing on a monthly basis. 
The outlook for 2015 continues to be very good. Although mortgage originations are expected to slow, our revenues from various ACA initiatives, further penetration of employment and income verification in non-mortgage markets and our strategic initiatives in Employer Services are expected to offset the mortgage decrease later this year, resulting in full year revenue growth well above the top end of the multiyear range and margin expansion in the range or the neighborhood of 350 basis points or more versus 2014. 
On to PSol. Constant currency revenue growth was at the upper end of the multiyear range and operating margins continued to be strong. In addition, they're making good progress on their strategic transformation. Double-digit growth in indirect Canada and U.K. were the major contributors to growth in the quarter. For our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S., the key operating metric, average revenue per subscriber and churn, continue to improve. 
2015 will be a good transformational year for PSol, as we talked about in the past. They are making good progress on 3 fronts: strengthening the core U.S.-based business; number two, developing a strong market position in the indirect space; and three, growing our international presence in Canada and the U.K. We expect Personal Solutions to end the year with revenue growing comfortably within our multiyear target range. 
Let me go back to corporate and I'll give you some highlights at the corporate level and then turn it over to John for the financials. 
You've all heard us I think we've spent about 9 years now talking about how NPI drives growth. In fact, we've talked about 3 points of growth coming from NPI, and NPI delivered those 3 points of growth for us in the first quarter. There's another very important growth driver, which we launched about 3 or 4 years ago we don't talk a lot about. And we launched it across all of our business units, and that's what we call enterprise growth initiatives, EGI for us. It's a very systematic way for managing multimillion dollar revenue initiatives that we overwhelm with resources and process and senior management attention because of their importance to our long-term growth. Now our EGI initiatives had a banner first quarter performance with strong double-digit growth, exceeding our expectations for the quarter, and our outlook for the year continues to be for very strong year-on-year growth coming from EGI. 
Also, at the corporate level, we've been talking about how we've developed a strong reputation with our customers regarding our expertise in LEAN, and we're doing this globally. We're not only leveraging relationships with our existing customers by continuing to drive incremental revenue growth, but we're also opening doors with non-customers around the world because of the reputation we've developed in some of our very key verticals. It gives us yet another opportunity to grow revenue through strong customer partnerships and really differentiate our offerings to these customers in yet another dimension. Our global fraud initiatives, which cross our all of our BU -- all of our B2B business units, delivered double-digit growth in the quarter as well. 
In summary, the quarter's performance is the strongest first quarter performance we've experienced in many years. Sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter was up 4.4%, whereas in the past years we would typically experience modest or even declining sequential growth. Adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points from the fourth quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased almost 5% from the fourth quarter when we usually see declining sequential growth. Despite this unprecedented performance, we're still early in the year and there are still some uncertainties out there and macroeconomic challenges around the globe. However, we are more optimistic now than we were when we entered the year. 
I'll turn over to you, John, now for some financials and I'll come back with some closing comments."
175749,290549068,793103,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. Now during the quarter, we recorded a charge of $23.4 million principally related to the real",856,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. 
Now during the quarter, we recorded a charge of $23.4 million principally related to the realignment of internal resources to more effectively support our strategic objectives. The actions were primarily driven by the regionalization and consolidation strategies in International, including the integration of TDX; consolidation of functions related to the integration of Commercial into USIS; and then the -- some realignment actions across the remainder of the business. The costs were 2/3 severance but also include related real estate, legal and other costs. The costs are reflected in SG&A and the general corporate expense lines of our financial statements. The actions will occur throughout 2015 and should be completed within 12 months. Ongoing savings, once the actions are complete, are expected to be $10 million to $15 million per year with limited incremental benefit in 2015. 
Now consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we have excluded this charge from our adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The FX impact on revenue and EPS this quarter were consistent with our expectations that we provided to you in February. 
Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $299 million, up 14% when compared to the first quarter. Online Information Solutions revenue was $222 million, up 15% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $31 million, up 28% compared to Q1 2014. These trends compare favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 21% in the first quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $46 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. As Rick mentioned earlier, the slower growth reflects a shift in how financial institutions are originating new accounts to 1:1 online solicitations. 
The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 42.4%, up from 37.2% in the first quarter of 2013. We continue to expect USIS to have operating margins in the low 40s, consistent with our long-term model in 2015. 
International's revenue was $139 million, down 1% on a reported basis but up 10% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $58 million, up 1% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $48 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars but up 3% in local currency. 
For the first quarter, International's operating margin was 20.2%, down slightly from 20.6% in the first quarter of 2014. This reduction in margin was principally due to FX. For the full year, we continue to expect the operating margin to expand slightly compared to 2014. 
Workforce Solutions revenue was $149 million for the quarter, up 24% when compared to the first quarter of 2014. Verification Services with revenue of $86 million was up 34% when compared to the same quarter in 2014. Employer Services revenue was $63 million, up 13% compared to last year. Following the WOTC hiatus in 2014, states began processing their backlog during the first quarter. Also, revenue from our ACA analytical solutions was very strong in the quarter. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 40.3% compared to 32.3% in Q1 of 2014. The margin benefited from the WOTC Renewal, which contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the margin in the quarter. For full year 2015, we continue to expect Workforce Solutions operating margin to be in the range of 36% to 37%. 
Personal Solutions revenue was $66 million, up 4% on a reported basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the first quarter, operating margin was 27.4% compared to 28.5% in Q1 2014. This year-over-year reduction is consistent with our expectations and the guidance we gave for Q1 and the full year. 
In the first quarter, general corporate expense at $78.4 million was up significantly, reflecting the $23.4 million realignment charge I mentioned previously. Excluding this charge, general corporate expense was $55 million, up $8.7 million sequentially and $24.3 million versus 1Q '15 -- versus 1Q '14. This increase was principally due to increased incentive and equity compensation and benefits expense. This reflects the very strong performance in 1Q '15 as well as earlier timing of annual equity expense in 2015 versus 2014. We also saw increased professional, legal and regulatory costs in 1Q '15 versus 1Q '14. Looking at 2Q '15, we expect general corporate expense to be down $10 million sequentially on an adjusted basis, reflecting lower equity expense and at or slightly below the Q2 level in both Q3 and Q4. 
Operating cash flow was $103 million in the first quarter. Cash flow grew faster than earnings, reflecting positive working capital performance. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 1 million shares for $90 million and paid $35 million in dividends to our shareholders. 
Our leverage remains a very conservative 1.75x EBITDA. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."
175749,290549068,793103,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, John.

Before I give you some numbers, I just want to put into perspective the influence of the mortgage market as it relates to the second quarter and the balance of th",453,"Great. Thanks, John. A quick outlook for guidance for the second quarter and the total year. Before I give you some numbers, I just want to put into perspective the influence of the mortgage market as it relates to the second quarter and the balance of the year. Again, we expect the market to -- the mortgage market to perform much like we talked about back in February, moderating a bit in the second quarter and then continuing to moderate even further year-on-year in the third and fourth quarter. 
So for the second quarter, we expect organic revenue growth -- organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million. That is a constant currency organic revenue growth rate of 10% to 12%, and it's partially offset by 3 points of FX headwind. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.09 and $1.11, which is up 14% to 16%, excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects  constant currency growth rate of 16% to 18% for the quarter. 
We also expect operating margin to continue to improve and end the quarter in the range of 27.5% to 28%. 
Obviously, there's some uncertainty for the balance of the year. Its macroeconomic uncertainty around the world and it's U.S. economic uncertainty, some uncertainty in the Middle East, uncertainty in Latin America. So -- but against that uncertain backdrop, I'm convinced that this team will continue to execute extremely well and continue driving above-market growth across all of our businesses and all of our verticals through the second quarter and the balance of the year. 
So with that and based upon the current level of domestic and International business activity and the FX rates, we expect 2015 to have revenue in the range of $2.585 billion to $2.635 billion, which is up from our previous guidance. This reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 11% for the year. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by 3 points of negative impact from FX. And again, as before, this is only organic revenue growth at this time. 
2015 adjusted EPS, we expect to be in the range of $4.28 and $4.35 per share, also up from our previous guidance. This reflects 10% to 12% growth in 2015. 
FX impact for the year, as we previously stated in the last earnings call, is expected to be about $0.11 for the year, and we have a -- 11% for the year -- $0.11 for the year. We have a $0.02 a share impact in the first quarter, which says we have a remaining $0.09 per share impact for the full year. 
So with that, operator, let's open up for any questions you might have."

And remember, as I mentioned before, Shlomo, we get multiple bites of the apples there. You get some consulting revenue, you get the analytics revenue. And in many cases, the employers who are using that analytics don't give us Work Number records that we can analyze their level of compliance as they get Work Number records. So that revenue growth, by adding those records to the revenue base, don't show up in Employer. It shows up in Verification once we load it on the system. So you should consider ACA analytics or Workforce Analytics as being a long-term, sustainable growth piece of EWS' strategy. Also, within the Employer Services, they're building out a really good full suite of compliance-centric products to help our employers ensure they're compliant with many regulatory changes, not just before we'll carry that."

I'll talk specifically about TDX. What you can hear us talk about more in the future is a debt services platform which is really integrating the capabilities we have in our Mexican acquisition, it's about the same time frame, called Inffinix, and then TDX, which is the U.K.-domiciled capability. So you'll hear us talk about a kind of just debt servicing platform versus TDX or Inffinix going forward. Specific to the Her Majesty's contract, as I alluded to briefly in my comments, it's going as expected. We've overwhelmed this with people, with process. The timeline was tight. It was such a significant award that we had to make sure we got it right and we're getting it right. And the hope is we stand this technical environment up, this structure up in third quarter, and we start to receive their first load of data in the third quarter. It takes you a while to analyze the data, understand the data, format the data. And then you pass that -- the analytics on to the collection agencies across the country. So that's why I said you expect a nominal amount of revenue in the 2015 year, maybe the very end of the fourth quarter, and then ramping up nicely in 2016."

I'll give a couple of examples of where we're attacking EGI today. One is in automotive, and we're couple of years into that now.

The whole suite of new products. Obviously, in that one there, we don't see things in PSol with the new platform and PSol's go-to-market. So does it give you explicitly pricing power?

Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Adjusted operating margin excludes the onetime charge principally related to the realignment of our internal resources. These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included in our earnings release and also posted on our website.

175749,290549068,793520,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for making time to join us this morning. The first quarter's performance was very robust and significantly exceeded our expectations. A theme you'll hear throughout my comments and John's co",1833,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for making time to join us this morning. 
The first quarter's performance was very robust and significantly exceeded our expectations. A theme you'll hear throughout my comments and John's comments and the question-and-answer period will be that the growth for the quarter was very broad based. It was across all business units, across many verticals and across many countries. USIS and Workforce Solutions in particular posted an exceptional quarter. USIS saw strength with its Decision 360 initiatives, enterprise selling strategy, direct-to-consumer channel partners, mortgage and home equity lending. Workforce Solutions saw broad strength in Verification Services, including government, automotive and mortgage, as well as solid strength in its Employer Services business. The revenue strength in both those businesses led to nice margin expansions, as you saw. Also, International and PSol finished with very solid performances for the quarter. 
In total, the revenue was $652 million, up 12% on a reported basis, up 14.4% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FX created $17 million of year-over-year headwind, an increase from the fourth quarter of last year, which was $13 million of headwind. The adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.07, up 20% from $0.89 a share last year and significantly above the upper end of the guidance we provided a few months ago. 
As always, I will walk through some business by business unit highlights, and then John will get into the details of the financials. I'll start, as I always do, with USIS. There the leverage is -- their Decision 360 initiative, New Product Innovation and enterprise selling teams to deliver 14% revenue growth and a healthy 42.4% operating margin, up 520 basis points from last year.  
Couple of highlights. Our relationship with Credit Karma, we talked about in the past, they went live in January and generated transaction volumes exceeding our original predictions -- projections. In addition to purchasing our credit information, Credit Karma is also using our premier fraud and identity authentication solutions to provide consumers with online access to their credit information. Presently, we were part of a dual-bureau solution with Credit Karma, and we believe this will ultimately move to a 3-Bureau solution in an effort to better maximize the benefits to the consumers. 
As I mentioned in the last call, in recent quarters, one of the things we're seeing is that the financial institutions are changing the way they originate new consumer accounts. In Financial Marketing Services, FMS, the traditional Prescreen activity are giving away some more targeted one-on-one online offers. We talked about this again in the last few quarters. And as a result, our revenue mix as it's rapidly been shifting towards higher-margin online solutions, while our growth in Prescreen revenues has moderated somewhat. 
Net-net, I view that shift as a benefit to USIS. 
As you know, we folded Commercial into USIS a few quarters ago. The Commercial business is off to a great start, recording their best first quarter performance since 2007 with record revenue and operating margin performance. 
Mortgage origination and home equity lending were also stronger in the quarter as low interest rate environment resulted in lending activity that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. And we'll get into that in the Q&A and compare it to the MBA. 
Our core tri-bureau reporting volume was at 18%, and we're also experiencing -- experienced strong growth in our high-value Undisclosed Debt Monitoring product services as lenders continue to move -- continued with their more rigorous underwriting standards. 
The pace of mortgage refinancing activity in home equity lending continues to be solid, and we expect it will moderate, as we talked about back in February, somewhat going into second quarter and then continue to moderate as we exit the year. USIS growth rate is expected to be strong over the course of the year and be comfortably above its long-term growth range of 5% to 7% for the full year. 
On the International, they posted double-digit local currency growth in 5 countries, including the U.K., continue to make good progress with the integration of TDX, which delivered constant currency revenue growth in excess of 25% for the first quarter. And they're also leveraging NPI to further their market position, as many products delivered revenue above their expectation for the quarter around the world. International's ongoing efforts to diversify its revenue base is underscored by double-digit constant currency growth from their SME customer base, retail customers, insurance customers, government customers and utility customers around the globe. Also, all verticals, including financial, our decision and analytics solutions, are strengthening relationships with our customers and opening new opportunities to NPI and new sources of growth going forward. 
International's operating margin performance is also improving. Excluding TDX and all the investments we're making in TDX, International's operating margin expanded by approximately 190 basis points in the quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2014. 
During the quarter, we executed a debt recovery services contract with Her Majesty's government in the U.K. that we talked about last time. That's resulting in continued investment in TDX as we prepare to ramp up and go live sometime in late third quarter for this multiyear U.K. government opportunity. So net-net, that opportunity is on pace and on track on almost every dimension. And again, we expect some modest revenue at the back end of this year, further ramping up in 2014 (sic) [2016]. 
In addition, the unique capabilities of TDX and also Inffinix, that's the one what we bought in Mexico, those capabilities are being leveraged in other geographic markets where we do not presently have credit information operating units. 
This year, International will be launching a Latin American regionalization strategy, that's what Jeff kind of alluded to, that includes people, process and system changes. This effort will further streamline our operations and provide incremental operating leverage for International and also improve customer service and accelerate our time to revenue for New Product Innovation. 
For the year, we expect revenue growth to be solidly in the long-term range of 7% to 10% growth for International with improving -- improved operating margins as we exit the year. 
On to EWS. Their momentum accelerated in the quarter, a remarkable performance, with broad-based revenue growth of 24%, up from 15% growth in the fourth quarter, and margins were up an astonishing 800 basis points from the first quarter of last year to 40.3% for the quarter. Verification Services continue to make great progress penetrating our targeted non-mortgage markets. They delivered strong double-digit growth in home equity lending, auto, car, consumer finance, government and pre-employment. And finally, growth in the mortgage activity drove a very healthy 34% growth in overall Verification Services revenue. In addition, our penetration of peer-to-peer lending space with our employment and income verification services had delivered strong new sources of growth. 
We now have over 4,500 companies contributing their employment and income information into The Work Number database, and this number of companies are growing on a monthly basis. 
The outlook for 2015 continues to be very good. Although mortgage originations are expected to slow, our revenues from various ACA initiatives, further penetration of employment and income verification in non-mortgage markets and our strategic initiatives in Employer Services are expected to offset the mortgage decrease later this year, resulting in full year revenue growth well above the top end of the multiyear range and margin expansion in the range or the neighborhood of 350 basis points or more versus 2014. 
On to PSol. Constant currency revenue growth was at the upper end of the multiyear range and operating margins continued to be strong. In addition, they're making good progress on their strategic transformation. Double-digit growth in indirect Canada and U.K. were the major contributors to growth in the quarter. For our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S., the key operating metric, average revenue per subscriber and churn, continue to improve. 
2015 will be a good transformational year for PSol, as we talked about in the past. They are making good progress on 3 fronts: strengthening the core U.S.-based business; number two, developing a strong market position in the indirect space; and three, growing our international presence in Canada and the U.K. We expect Personal Solutions to end the year with revenue growth comfortably within our multiyear target range. 
Let me go back to corporate and I'll give you some highlights at the corporate level and then turn it over to John for the financials. 
You've often heard us -- I think we've spent about 9 years now talking about how NPI drives growth. In fact, we've talked about 3 points of growth coming from NPI, and NPI delivered those 3 points of growth for us in the first quarter. There's another very important growth driver, which we launched about 3 or 4 years ago we don't talk a lot about. And we launched it across all of our business units, and that's what we call enterprise growth initiatives, EGI for us. It's a very systematic way for managing multimillion dollar revenue initiatives that we overwhelm with resources and process and senior management attention because of the importance to our long-term growth. Now our EGI initiatives had a banner first quarter performance with strong double-digit growth, exceeding our expectations for the quarter, and our outlook for the year continues to be for very strong year-on-year growth coming from EGI. 
Also, at the corporate level, we've been talking about how we've developed a strong reputation with our customers regarding our expertise in LEAN, and we're doing this globally. We're not only leveraging relationships with our existing customers, but continuing to drive incremental revenue growth, but we're also opening doors with non-customers around the world because of the reputation we've developed in some of our very key verticals. It gives us yet another opportunity to grow revenue through strong customer partnerships and really differentiate our offerings to these customers in yet another dimension. Our global fraud initiatives, which cross all of our BU -- all of our B2B business units, delivered solid double-digit growth for the quarter as well. 
In summary, the quarter's performance is the strongest first quarter performance we've experienced in many years. Sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter was up 4.4%, whereas in the past years we would typically experience modest or even declining sequential growth. Adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points from the fourth quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased almost 5% from the fourth quarter when we usually see declining sequential growth. Despite this unprecedented performance, we're still early in the year and there are still some uncertainties out there and macroeconomic challenges around the globe. However, we are more optimistic now than we were when we entered the year. 
I'll turn over to you, John, now for some financials and I'll come back with some closing comments."
175749,290549068,793520,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. Now during the quarter, we recorded a charge of $23.4 million principally related to the real",856,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. 
Now during the quarter, we recorded a charge of $23.4 million principally related to the realignment of internal resources to more effectively support our strategic objectives. The actions were primarily driven by the regionalization and consolidation strategies in International, including the integration of TDX; consolidation of functions related to the integration of Commercial into USIS; and then the -- some realignment actions across the remainder of the business. The costs were 2/3 severance but also include related real estate, legal and other costs. The costs are reflected in SG&A and the general corporate expense lines of our financial statements. The actions will occur throughout 2015 and should be completed within 12 months. Ongoing savings, once the actions are complete, are expected to be $10 million to $15 million per year with limited incremental benefit in 2015. 
Now consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we have excluded this charge from our adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The FX impact on revenue and EPS this quarter were consistent with our expectations that we provided to you in February. 
Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $299 million, up 14% when compared to the first quarter. Online Information Solutions revenue was $222 million, up 15% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $31 million, up 28% compared to Q1 2014. These trends compare favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 21% in the first quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $46 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. As Rick mentioned earlier, this slower growth reflects a shift in how financial institutions are originating new accounts to 1:1 online solicitations. 
The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 42.4%, up from 37.2% in the first quarter of 2013. We continue to expect USIS to have operating margins in the low 40s, consistent with our long-term model in 2015. 
International's revenue was $139 million, down 1% on a reported basis but up 10% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $58 million, up 1% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $48 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars but up 3% in local currency. 
For the first quarter, International's operating margin was 20.2%, down slightly from 20.6% in the first quarter of 2014. This reduction in margin was principally due to FX. For the full year, we continue to expect the operating
margin to expand slightly compared to 2014. 
Workforce Solutions revenue was $149 million for the quarter, up 24% when compared to the first quarter of 2014. Verification Services with revenue of $86 million was up 34% when compared to the same quarter in 2014. Employer Services revenue was $63 million, up 13% compared to last year. Following the WOTC hiatus in 2014, states began processing their backlog during the first quarter. Also, revenue from our ACA analytical solutions was very strong in the quarter. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 40.3% compared to 32.3% in Q1 of 2014. The margin benefited from the WOTC Renewal, which contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the margin in the quarter. For full year 2015, we continue to expect Workforce Solutions operating margin to be in the range of 36% to 37%. 
Personal Solutions revenue was $66 million, up 4% on a reported basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the first quarter, operating margin was 27.4% compared to 28.5% in Q1 2014. This year-over-year reduction is consistent with our expectations and the guidance we gave for Q1 and the full year. 
In the first quarter, general corporate expense at $78.4 million was up significantly, reflecting the $23.4 million realignment charge I mentioned previously. Excluding this charge, general corporate expense was $55 million, up $8.7 million sequentially and $24.3 million versus 1Q '15 -- versus 1Q '14. This increase was principally due to increased incentive and equity compensation and benefits expense. This reflects the very strong performance in 1Q '15 as well as earlier timing of annual equity expense in 2015 versus 2014. We also saw increased professional, legal and regulatory costs in 1Q '15 versus 1Q '14. Looking at 2Q '15, we expect general corporate expense to be down $10 million sequentially on an adjusted basis, reflecting lower equity expense and at or slightly below the Q2 level in both Q3 and Q4. 
Operating cash flow was $103 million in the first quarter. Cash flow grew faster than earnings, reflecting positive working capital performance. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 1 million shares for $90 million and paying $35 million in dividends to our shareholders. 
Our leverage remains a very conservative 1.75x EBITDA. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

A quick outlook for guidance for the second quarter and the total year. Before I give you some numbers, I just want to put into perspective the influence of the mortgage market as it relates to the second quarter and the balance of the year. Again, we expect the market to -- the mortgage market to perform much like we talked about back in February, moderating a bit in the second quarter and then continuing to moderate even further year-on-year in the third and fourth quarter. 
So for the second quarter, we expect organic revenue growth -- organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million. That is a constant currency organic revenue growth rate of 10% to 12%, and it's partially offset by 3 points of FX headwind. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.09 and $1.11, which is up 14% to 16%, excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects  constant currency growth rate of 16% to 18% for the quarter. 
We also expect operating margin to continue to improve and end the quarter in the range of 27.5% to 28%. 
Obviously, there's some uncertainty for the balance of the year. It's macroeconomic uncertainty around the world and it's U.S. economic uncertainty, some uncertainty in the Middle East, uncertainty in Latin America. So -- but against that uncertain backdrop, I'm convinced that this team will continue to execute extremely well and continue driving above-market growth across all of our businesses and all of our verticals through the second quarter and the balance of the year. 
So with that and based upon the current level of domestic and international business activity and the FX rates, we expect 2015 to have revenue in the range of $2.585 billion to $2.635 billion, which is up from our previous guidance. This reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 11% for the year. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by 3 points of negative impact from FX. And again, as before, this is only organic revenue growth at this time. 
2015 adjusted EPS we expect to be in the range of $4.28 and $4.35 per share, also up from our previous guidance. This reflects 10% to 12% growth in 2015. 
FX impact for the year, as we previously stated in the last earnings call, is expected to be about $0.11 for the year, and we have a -- 11% for the year -- $0.11 for the year. We have a $0.02 a share impact in the first quarter, which says we have a remaining $0.09 per share impact for the full year. 
So with that, operator, let's open up for any questions you might have."

So he has built processes, he is changing the team to think about growth and not protect. So that's helping. And then you had a -- the WOTC benefit for the first quarter that added some growth as well. So as I think about the Verification Services piece of EWS, Shlomo, when we bought the business, we thought it would be a good solid year-on-year middle-single-digit kind of growth rate. So I would not model a double-digit growth rate for Verification -- or for Employer Services at this time."

And that is -- going to grow over 100% this year, and we've -- we're signing hundreds of contracts to help employers make sure they're compliant with the ACA laws. And remember, as I mentioned before, Shlomo, we get multiple bites of the apple there. You get some consulting revenue, you get the analytics revenue. And in many cases, the employers who are using that analytics don't give us Work Number records; the only way you can analyze the level of compliance is to get the Work Number records. So that revenue growth, by adding those records to the database, don't show up in Employer. It shows up in Verification once we load it on the system. So you should consider ACA analytics or Workforce Analytics as being a long-term, sustainable growth piece of EWS' strategy. Also, within the Employer Services, they're building out a really good full suite of compliance-centric products to help our employers ensure they're compliant with many regulatory changes, not just before [indiscernible] we'll carry that."

So I wonder if you have a sense as to where you think we are as far as issuers ramping up their consumer credit card businesses. And then sort of as a corollary, you mentioned the shift in the way your customers are going to market, and I wonder how that dovetails with some of the newer credit modeling solutions that FICO is introducing around thin files and perhaps how that might open up sort of the next leg of growth in consumer credit cycle or whether you think it will at all."

Since the Bancard issuance in the U.S. kind of hit the bottom, the market has rebounded at a rate of about 10% or so a year. So it's growing modestly -- actually above modestly. However, it still remains significantly below the pre-recessionary levels. So, improving, but nowhere close to where we were back in the pre-recessionary environment. And obviously, that improvement helps us. As far as FICO, as you know, the FICO municipal thin score -- thin file score you alluded to is predicated largely upon our data and Elan's data. A lot of the data they use in that model is buying the data from our -- we used to call NCT [ph] plus, the positive credit file on utilities and telcos. So as that product takes off, obviously we're a benefactor of that."

We're still looking at this in earnest maybe 3 or 4 years ago and said we've got these large, multimillion dollar, sometimes across business unit deals. It needs more rigor to ensure our timed revenue is as expected, much like we did in NPI. So Andy and his team have been doing this now for 3 or 4 years. And we're doing stuff. I'll give a couple of examples of where we're attacking EGI today. One is in automotive, and we're couple of years into that now. When we decided to get into automotive heavily, we leveraged EGI discipline to do so. Another I alluded to in EWS a few minutes ago was this Compliance Center, building up more capabilities other than just INI [ph] and W-2 and some others and now ACA Workforce Analytics. The whole suite of new products. So he's leading that one there, we're doing some things in PSol with the new platform and PSol's go-to market. So does it give you explicitly pricing power? It definitely gives you revenue growth, which is a factor in our performance, as you've seen, as we exit 2014 and continue in 2015. I think anytime you can build products that differentiate what you do versus your competition, it does -- you add more value. The discussion goes away from price and more to share gain you spend."

175749,290549068,815935,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for making time to join us this morning. The first quarter's performance was very robust and significantly exceeded our expectations. A theme you'll hear throughout my comments and John's co",1832,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for making time to join us this morning. 
The first quarter's performance was very robust and significantly exceeded our expectations. A theme you'll hear throughout my comments and John's comments and the question-and-answer period will be that the growth for the quarter was very broad based. It was across all business units, across many verticals and across many countries. USIS and Workforce Solutions in particular posted an exceptional quarter. USIS saw strength with its Decision 360 initiatives, enterprise selling strategy, direct-to-consumer channel partners, mortgage and home equity lending. Workforce Solutions saw broad strength in Verification Services, including government, automotive and mortgage, as well as solid strength in its Employer Services business. The revenue strength in both those businesses led to nice margin expansions, as you saw. Also, International and PSol finished with very solid performances for the quarter. 
In total, the revenue was $652 million, up 12% on a reported basis, up 14.4% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FX created $17 million of year-over-year headwind, an increase from the fourth quarter of last year, which was $13 million of headwind. The adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.07, up 20% from $0.89 a share last year and significantly above the upper end of the guidance we provided a few months ago. 
As always, I will walk through some business by business unit highlights, and then John will get into the details of the financials. I'll start, as I always do, with USIS. There they leverage this -- their Decision 360 initiative, New Product Innovation and enterprise selling teams to deliver 14% revenue growth and a healthy 42.4% operating margin, up 520 basis points from last year.  
Couple of highlights. Our relationship with Credit Karma, we talked about in the past, they went live in January and generated transaction volumes exceeding our original predictions -- projections. In addition to purchasing our credit information, Credit Karma is also using our premier fraud and identity authentication solutions to provide consumers with online access to their credit information. Presently, we were part of a dual-bureau solution with Credit Karma, and we believe this will ultimately move to a 3-Bureau solution in an effort to better maximize the benefits to the consumers. 
As I mentioned in the last call, in recent quarters, one of the things we're seeing is that the financial institutions are changing the way they originate new consumer accounts. In Financial Marketing Services, FMS, the traditional Prescreen activity are giving away some more targeted one-on-one online offers. We talked about this again in last few quarters. And as a result, our revenue mix as it's [indiscernible] been shifting towards higher-margin online solutions, while our growth in Prescreen revenues has moderated somewhat. 
Net-net, I view that shift as a benefit to USIS. 
As you know, we folded Commercial into USIS a few quarters ago. The Commercial business is off to a great start, recording their best first quarter performance since 2007 with record revenue and operating margin performance. 
Mortgage origination and home equity lending were also stronger in the quarter as low interest rate environment resulted in lending activity that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. And we'll get into that in the Q&A and compare it to the MBA. 
Our core tri-bureau reporting volume was up 18%, and we're also experiencing -- experienced strong growth in our high-value Undisclosed Debt Monitoring product services as lenders continue to move -- continued with their more rigorous underwriting standards. 
The pace of mortgage refinancing activity in home equity lending continues to be solid, and we expect it will moderate, as we talked about back in February, somewhat going into second quarter and then continue to moderate as we exit the year. USIS growth rate is expected to be strong over the course of the year and be comfortably above its long-term growth range of 5% to 7% for the full year. 
On the International, they posted double-digit local currency growth in 5 countries, including the U.K., continue to make good progress with the integration of TDX, which delivered constant currency revenue growth in excess of 25% for the first quarter. And they're also leveraging NPI to further their market position, as many products delivered revenue above their expectation for the quarter around the world. International's ongoing efforts to diversify its revenue base is underscored by double-digit constant currency growth from their SME customer base, retail customers, insurance customers, government customers and utility customers around the globe. Also, all verticals, including financial, our decision and analytics solutions, are strengthening relationships with our customers and opening new opportunities to NPI and new sources of growth going forward. 
International's operating margin performance is also improving. Excluding TDX and all the investments we're making in TDX, International's operating margin expanded by approximately 190 basis points in the quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2014. 
During the quarter, we executed a debt recovery services contract with Her Majesty's government in the U.K. that we talked about last time. That's resulting in continued investment in TDX as we prepare to ramp up and go live sometime in late third quarter for this multiyear U.K. government opportunity. So net-net, that opportunity is on pace and on track on almost every dimension. And again, we expect some modest revenue at the back end of this year, further ramping up in 2014 (sic) [2016]. 
In addition, the unique capabilities of TDX and also Inffinix, that's the one what we bought in Mexico, those capabilities are being leveraged in other geographic markets where we do not presently have credit information operating units. 
This year, International will be launching a Latin American regionalization strategy, that's what Jeff kind of alluded to, that includes people, process and system changes. This effort will further streamline our operations and provide incremental operating leverage for International and also improve customer service and accelerate our time to revenue for New Product Innovation. 
For the year, we expect revenue growth to be solidly in the long-term range of 7% to 10% growth for International with improving -- improved operating margins as we exit the year. 
On to EWS. Their momentum accelerated in the quarter, a remarkable performance, with broad-based revenue growth of 24%, up from 15% growth in the fourth quarter, and margins were up an astonishing 800 basis points from the first quarter of last year to 40.3% for the quarter. Verification Services continue to make great progress penetrating our targeted non-mortgage markets. They delivered strong double-digit growth in home equity lending, auto, car, consumer finance, government and pre-employment. And finally, growth in the mortgage activity drove a very healthy 34% growth in overall Verification Services revenue. In addition, our penetration of peer-to-peer lending space with our employment and income verification services had delivered strong new sources of growth. 
We now have over 4,500 companies contributing their employment and income information into The Work Number database, and this number of companies are growing on a monthly basis. 
The outlook for 2015 continues to be very good. Although mortgage originations are expected to slow, our revenues from various ACA initiatives, further penetration of employment and income verification in non-mortgage markets and our strategic initiatives in Employer Services are expected to offset the mortgage decrease later this year, resulting in full year revenue growth well above the top end of the multiyear range and margin expansion in the range or the neighborhood of 350 basis points or more versus 2014. 
On to PSol. Constant currency revenue growth was at the upper end of the multiyear range and operating margins continued to be strong. In addition, they're making good progress on their strategic transformation. Double-digit growth in indirect Canada and U.K. were the major contributors to growth in the quarter. For our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S., the key operating metric, average revenue per subscriber and churn, continue to improve. 
2015 will be a good transformational year for PSol, as we talked about in the past. They are making good progress on 3 fronts: strengthening the core U.S.-based business; number two, developing a strong market position in the indirect space; and three, growing our international presence in Canada and the U.K. We expect Personal Solutions to end the year with revenue growth comfortably within our multiyear target range. 
Let me go back to corporate and I'll give you some highlights at the corporate level and then turn it over to John for the financials. 
You've often heard us -- I think we've spent about 9 years now talking about how NPI drives growth. In fact, we've talked about 3 points of growth coming from NPI, and NPI delivered those 3 points of growth for us in the first quarter. There's another very important growth driver, which we launched about 3 or 4 years ago we don't talk a lot about. And we launched it across all of our business units, and that's what we call enterprise growth initiatives, EGI for us. It's a very systematic way for managing multimillion dollar revenue initiatives that we overwhelm with resources and process and senior management attention because of their importance to our long-term growth. Now our EGI initiatives had a banner first quarter performance with strong double-digit growth, exceeding our expectations for the quarter, and our outlook for the year continues to be for very strong year-on-year growth coming from EGI. 
Also, at the corporate level, we've been talking about how we've developed a strong reputation with our customers regarding our expertise in LEAN, and we're doing this globally. We're not only leveraging relationships with our existing customers, but continuing to drive incremental revenue growth, but we're also opening doors with non-customers around the world because of the reputation we've developed in some of our very key verticals. It gives us yet another opportunity to grow revenue through strong customer partnerships and really differentiate our offerings to these customers in yet another dimension. Our global fraud initiatives, which cross all of our BU -- all of our B2B business units, delivered solid double-digit growth for the quarter as well. 
In summary, the quarter's performance is the strongest first quarter performance we've experienced in many years. Sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter was up 4.4%, whereas in the past years we would typically experience modest or even declining sequential growth. Adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points from the fourth quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased almost 5% from the fourth quarter when we usually see declining sequential growth. Despite this unprecedented performance, we're still early in the year and there are still some uncertainties out there and macroeconomic challenges around the globe. However, we are more optimistic now than we were when we entered the year. 
I'll turn over to you, John, now for some financials and I'll come back with some closing comments."
175749,290549068,815935,"Equifax Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Equifax Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis.

As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. 
Now during the quarter, we recorded a charge of $23.4 million principally related to the realignment of internal resources to more effectively support our strategic objectives. The actions were primarily driven by the regionalization and consolidation strategies in International, including the integration of TDX; consolidation of functions related to the integration of Commercial into USIS; and then the -- some realignment actions across the remainder of the business. The costs were 2/3 severance but also include related real estate, legal and other costs. The costs are reflected in SG&A and the general corporate expense lines of our financial statements. The actions will occur throughout 2015 and should be completed within 12 months. Ongoing savings, once the actions are complete, are expected to be $10 million to $15 million per year with limited incremental benefit in 2015. 
Now consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we have excluded this charge from our adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The FX impact on revenue and EPS this quarter were consistent with our expectations that we provided to you in February. 
Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $299 million, up 14% when compared to the first quarter. Online Information Solutions revenue was $222 million, up 15% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $31 million, up 28% compared to Q1 2014. These trends compare favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 21% in the first quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $46 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. As Rick mentioned earlier, this slower growth reflects a shift in how financial institutions are originating new accounts to 1:1 online solicitations. 
The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 42.4%, up from 37.2% in the first quarter of 2013. We continue to expect USIS to have operating margins in the low 40s, consistent with our long-term model in 2015. 
International's revenue was $139 million, down 1% on a reported basis but up 10% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $58 million, up 1% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $48 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars but up 3% in local currency. 
For the first quarter, International's operating margin was 20.2%, down slightly from 20.6% in the first quarter of 2014. This reduction in margin was principally due to FX. For the full year, we continue to expect the operating margin to expand slightly compared to 2014. 
Workforce Solutions revenue was $149 million for the quarter, up 24% when compared to the first quarter of 2014. Verification Services with revenue of $86 million was up 34% when compared to the same quarter in 2014. Employer Services revenue was $63 million, up 13% compared to last year. Following the WOTC hiatus in 2014, states began processing their backlog during the first quarter. Also, revenue from our ACA analytical solutions was very strong in the quarter. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 40.3% compared to 32.3% in Q1 of 2014. The margin benefited from the WOTC Renewal, which contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the margin in the quarter. For full year 2015, we continue to expect Workforce Solutions operating margin to be in the range of 36% to 37%. 
Personal Solutions revenue was $66 million, up 4% on a reported basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the first quarter, operating margin was 27.4% compared to 28.5% in Q1 2014. This year-over-year reduction is consistent with our expectations and the guidance we gave for Q1 and the full year. 
In the first quarter, general corporate expense at $78.4 million was up significantly, reflecting the $23.4 million realignment charge I mentioned previously. Excluding this charge, general corporate expense was $55 million, up $8.7 million sequentially and $24.3 million versus 1Q '15 -- versus 1Q '14. This increase was principally due to increased incentive and equity compensation and benefits expense. This reflects the very strong performance in 1Q '15 as well as earlier timing of annual equity expense in 2015 versus 2014. We also saw increased professional, legal and regulatory costs in 1Q '15 versus 1Q '14. Looking at 2Q '15, we expect general corporate expense to be down $10 million sequentially on an adjusted basis, reflecting lower equity expense and at or slightly below the Q2 level in both Q3 and Q4. 
Operating cash flow was $103 million in the first quarter. Cash flow grew faster than earnings, reflecting positive working capital performance. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 1 million shares for $90 million and paying $35 million in dividends to our shareholders. 
Our leverage remains a very conservative 1.75x EBITDA. 
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

A quick outlook for guidance for the second quarter and the total year. Before I give you some numbers, I just want to put into perspective the influence of the mortgage market as it relates to the second quarter and the balance of the year. Again, we expect the market to -- the mortgage market to perform much like we talked about back in February, moderating a bit in the second quarter and then continuing to moderate even further year-on-year in the third and fourth quarter. 
So for the second quarter, we expect organic revenue growth -- organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million. That is a constant currency organic revenue growth rate of 10% to 12%, and it's partially offset by 3 points of FX headwind. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.09 and $1.11, which is up 14% to 16%, excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects  constant currency growth rate of 16% to 18% for the quarter. 
We also expect operating margin to continue to improve and end the quarter in the range of 27.5% to 28%. 
Obviously, there's some uncertainty for the balance of the year. It's macroeconomic uncertainty around the world and it's U.S. economic uncertainty, some uncertainty in the Middle East, uncertainty in Latin America. So -- but against that uncertain backdrop, I'm convinced that this team will continue to execute extremely well and continue driving above-market growth across all of our businesses and all of our verticals through the second quarter and the balance of the year. 
So with that and based upon the current level of domestic and international business activity and the FX rates, we expect 2015 to have revenue in the range of $2.585 billion to $2.635 billion, which is up from our previous guidance. This reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 11% for the year. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by 3 points of negative impact from FX. And again, as before, this is only organic revenue growth at this time. 
2015 adjusted EPS we expect to be in the range of $4.28 and $4.35 per share, also up from our previous guidance. This reflects 10% to 12% growth in 2015. 
FX impact for the year, as we previously stated in the last earnings call, is expected to be about $0.11 for the year, and we have a -- 11% for the year -- $0.11 for the year. We have a $0.02 a share impact in the first quarter, which says we have a remaining $0.09 per share impact for the full year. 
So with that, operator, let's open up for any questions you might have."

And remember, as I mentioned before, Shlomo, we get multiple bites of the apple there. You get some consulting revenue, you get the analytics revenue. And in many cases, the employers who are using that analytics don't give us Work Number records; the only way you can analyze the level of compliance is to get the Work Number records. So that revenue growth, by adding those records to the database, don't show up in Employer. It shows up in Verification once we load it on the system. So you should consider ACA analytics or Workforce Analytics as being a long-term, sustainable growth piece of EWS' strategy. Also, within the Employer Services, they're building out a really good full suite of compliance-centric products to help our employers ensure they're compliant with many regulatory changes, not just before we'll carry that."

I'll give a couple of examples of where we're attacking EGI today. One is in automotive, and we're couple of years into that now. When we decided to get in automotive heavily, we leveraged EGI discipline to do so. Another I alluded to in EWS a few minutes ago was this Compliance Center, building up more capabilities other than just INI [ph] and W-2 and some others and now ACA Workforce Analytics. The whole suite of new products. So he's leading that one there, we're doing some things in PSol with the new platform and PSol's go-to market. So does it give you explicitly pricing power? It definitely gives you revenue growth, which is a factor in our performance, as you've seen, as we exit 2014 and continue in 2015. I think anytime you can build products that differentiate what you do versus your competition, it does -- you add more value. The discussion goes away from price and more to share gain you spend."

We'll push up to any tax credit contract which we monetized in the first quarter this year. We did last year as well. It doesn't repeat. It's -- really, it's a 1-quarter -- largely a 1-quarter activity. So that's the nuances, if you will, for the second quarter. And then for the balance of the year, the third and fourth quarter, when you look at the growth rate there, which is still very solid, I think you'd agree, it's really the uncertainty on a macro basis: interest rate environment, regulatory environment around the world, economic environment, so on and so forth, geopolitical issues.

So I don't expect much revenue from that large contract. You got to understand, the investment we've made in this business has been on 2 fronts. One is standing up DMI [ph], and the other is the typical stuff we invest in when we acquire a company, and that's security, that's compliance. We're in the process of applying for a license in the U.K. for this organization and so on and so forth just to make sure it's fully, fully [indiscernible]. So this is a year of fairly heavy, broad-based investment in TDX, also investment to make it -- to run a global -- in more countries. So as far as margin expansions for TDX specifically and then for International, I expect modest improvement for International for this year but then more significant improvement as we go into 2016, because the level of spend comes down, the core TDX business continues to grow strong at double digits and you get the monetization of DMI [ph]."

Good morning, everyone. Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning. By now you've seen the results and you can agree our company continues to benefit from our unique and very diversified business model, also benefits from our high level of execution across all the BUs in the Centers of Excellences, and we continue to reap benefits from the new product innovation that we've launched back in 2006. The quarter, both revenue and adjusted EPS, exceeded the upper end of our guidance range of 4 business units, and they grew revenue growth ahead of our expectations. This reflected both our continued execution of new products and market expansions as well as a stronger-than-expected U.S. mortgage market. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $678 million, up 10% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis from the second quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-on-year headwind, up from the headwind we experienced in the first quarter of $17 million. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.8%, up from 27.3% in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.15, up 20% from $0.96 [ph] a share last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range. As always, before John gives you some finish details, I'll go through the some of the business unit highlights as well as some of the corporate highlights and I'll go into the details of the financials with John. 
The power of our Decision 360 initiative, which you by now or are very well aware of, combined with our enterprise selling strategy and our mortgage market success enabled USIS to once again deliver very strong, broad-based 12% growth. Our recently launched data and analytics environment, which we've introduced to you and we call it Cambrian has positioned us to develop and deliver new D360 products at speed that once took weeks now take us minutes. This is something you will recall we've talked about now for probably 2 years, and that is now fully introduction in the U.S. and making a big difference. The primary goal of Cambrian is the source and integrate structured and unstructured data from any industrially anywhere in the world and proactively deliver action and insights valued by our customers. What's particularly compelling is that we can now create transformational solutions like combining traditional, trusted data with other Big Data sources and cutting-edge analytical capabilities with greater ease and speed. Cambrian will help us discover new data assets for our research and/or partnerships that will further broaden and deepen our portfolio of data assets and fuel new product innovation. Personally for Cambrian, the environment is focused on our U.S.-based data assets and market opportunities. However, as we've talked in the past, we'll be developing significant domain expertise that will enable us to expand into our International geographies over the next 6 to 12 months. 
Moving on in the auto vertical in the U.S. we recently launched the first of 3 products in the power lead suite, which leverages our data assets to help auto dealers be more effective in their marketing activities and leverage third-party service providers or connectors as we call them. We help dealers leverage their website performance by turning anonymous borrowers into known high-quality leads. Consumers are now more empowered by getting their credit score online after being authenticated with our eID Verifier services, and all this information is with the consumer authorization and then shared with the dealers. Our partnership with Credit Karma, I think we've talked to you about that back in the very end of 2013, nearly 2014. That continues to be -- '14, '15, very end of '14, sorry about that, that continues to be a very important driver contributor to USIS and is also a great start this year. We now expect the revenue and relationship with Credit Karma for 2015 to exceed our original expectations. 
Explaining the USIS in the utility sector, we launched the first of our 4 market-specific insight tools, leveraging third-party data alongside our credit information in our telco and utility database. These insights will help utilities optimize their deposit strategies to better manage and control portfolio loss rates. 
Our Commercial Solutions business within USIS, the product offerings and business unit had a very strong performance in the quarter, with both accelerating revenue growth and improved operating margins when compared to the first quarter of the year. Mortgage origination activity exceeded our expectations for the quarter and driven by our strong market position, contributed nicely to USIS' growth and margin expansion. Our fraud and property valuations product offerings continue to deliver very strong double-digit growth in the mortgage market as well. We'll talk on these in the Q&A more about mortgage and where that's headed. 
Finally, our partnership with [indiscernible] which we talked to you about in the past, has secured first mobile commerce authentication service with a major telco. The application includes validation of an end-user's photo ID, along with facial biometrics, a first for us. While we expect the mortgage growth to decelerate for the remainder of the year, we expect USIS 2 end 2015 with double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%. 
So on to International. They continue to make very good progress on their critical strategic growth initiatives, including the integration of TDX, implementation of the U.K. government contract and continue to drive innovation through new products around the globe. Revenue in International's 3 largest verticals, which are the financial institutions, telcos and SMEs grew 13% for the quarter. The decisioning platforms, analytic services and debt management revenue grew 17% for the quarter. 
TDX delivered another quarter of 20%-plus revenue growth, a trend we expect to continue as we move into the third quarter. Also, we are in the process of entering the Canadian and Brazilian markets with TDX products and services. We're also meeting all of our operational commitments within TDX over the U.K. contract we've talked about in the past. Equifax data has been integrated into the TDX workflow and developing the consumer insights and appropriate selection strategies. The IT infrastructure build has been completed, and security penetration testing is largely completed. 20 debt collection agency contracts have been signed after bidding with the U.K. government. And as we've mentioned in the past, we expect this to be operational late fourth quarter, early fourth quarter, a modest revenue this year and ramping up nicely in 2016. 
Moving on Latin America. We've identified opportunities to start up exchanges just like we do in the U.S., where critical data assets are not currently available. We've already received approval in one country and will be finalizing our plans by the end of the year. As you know, the exchanges have been very successful in the U.S. with good margins and good competitive differentiation, helping our customers in ways we couldn't help before. We're really excited about what this might bring the one country successful there bringing to other Latin American countries. 
In Canada, we launched a 6-month pilot for e-commerce site to provide online delivery for our business and consumer credit product offerings. This distribution channel will be very attractive to our SME customers while also addressing a growing market demand in other verticals and potentially other geographies. 
And then we recently signed a global agreement with a large International telecom to create new analytical insights using telecom usage data. Ultimately, analytical insights will be so the financial institutions, retailers and other customers in our served markets to facilitate decisioning on consumers who have limited or low credit information. This partnership is significant for Equifax as a new source of rich data for consumers in Latin America, which is typically a negative-data-only geography. We're starting with at risk awards that are developed from our telecom data to address the painful filing and no debt at the point of acquisition. Over time, we'll expand this beyond the kind of acquisition to other decisioning needs. 
For the full year, we expect the International revenue growth to be solidly in the upper end of their long-term growth range, which is 7% to 10% while we continue to grow -- invest in their long-term growth initiatives. On the Workforce Solutions, they again delivered an outstanding broad-based 23% revenue growth and a operating margin of 38.3%, and then they're doing a great job of executing with precision on their strategic objectives. Revenue from all of our Affordable Care Act initiatives continue to accelerate nicely. And with the recent spring court decision, we anticipate continued strong demand from our product offerings in this area. In our ACA platform solution, which enables companies to know the extent of their compliance with the Affordable Care Act, continued to benefit from very strong interest. We now have contracts with numerous employers who in aggregate now have 10 million employees on their payroll. In June alone, we signed 62 new customer contracts. We're uniquely positioned to add value in the healthcare vertical, and we will be making important investments to drive further long-term revenue growth and market penetration. 
Strong growth in Verification Services was driven by continuing to add records, new records with our database, also double-digit growth in mortgage originations and continued penetration of non-mortgage market verticals. In the quarter, our non-mortgage market verification revenue grew 21%, virtually every vertical growing strong double-digit for the quarter, outstanding performance. Growth in mortgage-related revenues decelerated in the second quarter. It's a trend that will continue for the remainder of the year. However, Workforce Solutions' success on many of the strategic initiatives should continue to drive very [indiscernible] growth for the full year, we now expect revenue growth to be in the upper teens with margin expansion over 2014 of at least 400 basis points to approximately 37%. 
On the PSOL, the PSol's growth exceeded our expectation, driven by double-digit growth in our indirect channels and our International segments in addition to winning 2 bridge contracts. Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. continues to be driven by higher average revenue per subscriber and lower churn. They've been a great job on both [indiscernible] PSol is making good progress on their transformation efforts, and we expect full year organic revenue growth to be at the upper end of a long-term range of 4% to 6% and operating margins for the full year solidly in the range of 25% to 30%. 
So again, before I go to Jon with the financial details, let me give you some highlights at the corporate level quickly things we talked about in the past that are very critical to our existing organic growth. You've heard me talk about NPI 2.0 and you heard me talk about EGI. That's critically important growth initiatives. In NPI 2.0, we developed detailed metrics to better manage our pipeline of opportunities to more effectively allocate our resources and track our success on product launches and to minimize time to revenue. Midway to the year, we're now 10% overall revenue target, so the team is doing a great job of executing again in NPI. Our product growth initiatives, we call the EGI. We were focused on larger, more complex projects where we frequently engage multiple parts of the organization. We also have much bigger impact to the revenue growth. EGI is delivering again 1 to 2 points of revenue growth annually for us. 
In global operations, that continues to make important contributions to our bottom line. Within the operation you've heard us talk about Lean initiatives, which traditionally been used internally. We'll talk a lot about that. However, with increased level of competition and regulatory requirements in many of our industrial verticals, there are many new opportunities for incremental revenue growth, and we leveraged LEAN within our customers' operations. Our global Lean team is now -- are currently engaged with over 20 great customers, helping to drive operational improvements that are critical to their success while adding yet another element of differentiation for our business in the marketplace. So our customers become stronger, more efficient, and it helps us differentiate versus competition and secure incremental revenue. 
On to our fraud and identity management business. They're presently broadening to incorporate biometrics in mobile device resolution. We have partnerships. We're also looking -- taking our more successful products and launching them in other geographies. It's a practice we've done in other parts of the business. Now we're intentionally taking Fraud and ID products in all parts of the world, other geographies where it makes sense. 
In summary, the business is off to a solid start this year, with high levels of execution across many of our strategic initiatives. And we're well down the path of changing Equifax from a credit bureau into a truly diversified Information Solutions company. Our domain expertise and analytics and technology enable us to increasing powerful insights to our customers and enhance their decision-making. All of our business units continue to work hard to deliver on their commitments to the company, our customers, employees and shareholders. And as we move into the second half of 2015 and start to look at 2016, I strongly believe the prospects for consumer credit in the developed markets, which we operate, especially the U.S., were very good. The dynamics were shaping up as a sweet spot now for consumer credit growth. 
And with that, let me turn it over to John the financials. John?"

As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $14.8 million or $9.8 million after-tax",626,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $14.8 million or $9.8 million after-tax related to our cost method investment in BBS. The impairment is, in general, a result of the weakened economic situation in Brazil. We also recorded and $8.6 million after-tax gain due to a state income tax benefit resulting from a state tax law change enacted during the quarter. The net of these 2 unusual items was negative $0.01 per share. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. 
Now let me turn to business units' financial performance of for the second quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $316 million, up 12% when compared to the second quarter of '14. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 13% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $33 million, up 20% compared to Q2 of 2014. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 16% in the second quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $50 million, up 4% when compared to the year-ago quarter. And the operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 42.1%, up from 39.5% in the second quarter of 2014. International revenue was $148 million, down 1% on a reported basis but up 11% on a local currency basis. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $63 million, down 1% in U.S. dollars but up 12% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $51 million, up 6% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Canada revenue was $35 million, down 10% in U.S. dollars but up 2% in local currency. For the second quarter, International's operating margin was 19.9%, down from 21.9% in the second quarter of 2014. Although the operating margin fell shorter of our expectations, we have a number of very exciting growth opportunities that were discuss that were incremental investment and management focus. Workforce Solutions revenue was $146 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the second quarter of '14. Verification Services, with revenue of $94 million, was up 30% when compared to the same quarter of last year. Employer Services revenue with $52 million, up 11% compared to last year. Growth was aided by ACA analytical solutions and further progress with Compliance Center. The workforce Solutions operating margin was 38.3% compared to 33.9% in Q2 of '14. Personal Solutions revenue was $68 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 8% on a local currency basis. For the second quarter, operating margin was 27.6% compared to 30.9% in Q2 of 2014. This margin is consistent with our longer-term expectations for this business as it's primarily driven by increased marketing expense during the quarter. 
In the second quarter, general corporate expense at $48.5 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last year. The increase versus our guidance and from the $36.6 million in 2Q of 2014 was principally due to increased incentive compensation expense due to our very strong performance in 2015. We also had increased salaries and benefits and other investment expense primarily related to our key strategic initiatives. 
Looking at the third and fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be approximately $45 million for the quarter, consistent with 2014 levels. Operating margin at 27.8% was very strong. Operating cash flow was $187 million in the quarter. We continue our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 0.9 million shares for $92 million and paying $34 million in dividends to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rick."

Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect continued favorable economic conditions in the U.S., spending the majority of our non-mortgage verticals and mortgage in second. International, we expect economic conditions across Europe and Latin America. And our view of the U.S. mortgage market in the second half of 2015 is roughly consistent with our prior guidance as we expect U.S. mortgage market originations to be up slightly in the second half of 2015 versus the same period in 2014. And we are, however, increasing our full year view for 2015 mortgage originations to be up somewhere between 11% and 13% versus 2014. The U.S. mortgage market was stronger than our expectations in the first half of the year, with originations up approximately 20% versus last year. And again, we'll talk about the nuances and impact moving from refinancing mortgage market to a purchase market, which we're in the process of doing and the benefits that has for our company. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue -- organic revenue growth to be -- organic revenue to be $655 million and $670 million, reflecting constant currency organic growth between 10% and 12%, partially offset by about 3% FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.08 and $1.11 a share, which is up 7% to 10% excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 15%. We also expect operating margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the quarter. For the full year, we have again increased our guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We expect now 2015 revenue to be between $2.645 billion and $2.67 billion, up from our previous guidance of which was $2.585 billion to $2.635 billion and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the year. This strong revenue growth is partially offset again by approximately 3% negative FX impact. And as before, this is all organic revenue growth. 2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3 -- $4.38 to $4.42 a share, also up from our previous guidance, and this reflects 13% of 14% EPS growth for the year. On a constant currency basis, excluding $0.10 per share negative impact of FX at current rates, this reflects 15% to 16% growth for the year when compared to 1% [ph] growth in 2011. 
In summary, we're also more intently focused now on strategic inorganic growth as we've developed a more robust pipeline of potential opportunities now that we have fully integrated the TDX into our operations. So as I've talked to you in the past, the attempt was to be more focused on -- as we exited 2015 and into 2016, we're ready to do just that. 
So that's all the prepared comments. So operator, if you could please open up for Q&A for John and I, that would be great."

So that's pretty preemployment, that's collection, that's automotive, that's card, I can go on and on and on, extremely strong. And then as you mentioned, Workforce Analytics, we continue to have customers there. I said 10 million consumers are now being -- employees are now being monitored and 62 clients alone in the month of June.

So that could be the auto vertical within International but also the auto vertical within all the countries in International performing extremely well. It's very, very broad-based, and the execution are extremely high level. Let me use your question to respond something I briefly alluded to in my comments, which is the nuances of mortgage and how mortgage impacts our thinking for the balance of the year and next year. And you guys know this as well as we do. The world is going -- of the U.S. market is going from a heavily refinancing distribution and now back to more than normal distribution, which is heavily skewed towards purchases and less and less towards refinancing. And while the overall mortgage market will soften, I think it clearly is going to soften in second half of this year versus the first half of 2015 will be less than 2,000 or modestly up from 2015. The nuance is positive for us is that when you go from the refinancing market to a home purchase market, it's actually a benefit. In many cases, individual bank policies may not require them to pull give you a verification income. When do a purchase, they pull a VOI. Secondly, when you go to a refinancing -- from refinancing to purchase, you're going to pull, as we told you in the past, far more credit files. Your broker may pull a credit file using the consumers shop to 4 different banks, 5 different banks, they start pulling the file. In refinancing, you don't do that. They may pull 1 file. So even though the mortgage market growth rates will slow as we go forward, including third quarter, we think there's some hidden gem there for us as we rebalance the purchase marketing."

Specific your question, though, there are 2 things we're investing in International, which I firmly believe benefit us long term. One is the government contract we've talked about in the U.K. That is a large complicated investment that we've had to make the required resources from around the globe stand up this environment to be ready to go live end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter. And I think we've talked about now as a group for a few quarters. So that's one. The other has been with our ability now to standardize platforms, we're now going to regional standards in International. And there's a cost associated with moving from replicating processes in every country to regionalizing those processes in fewer countries. So there's an investment required to get -- those are the 2 things we're investing now as well as NPI, but we always do that and will bode well long term nn create some headwinds in margin in the short term."

By now you've seen the results and I think you'd agree our company continues to benefit from our unique and very diversified business model, also benefits from our high",2274,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning. By now you've seen the results and I think you'd agree our company continues to benefit from our unique and very diversified business model, also benefits from our high level of execution across all the BUs in the centers of excellences, and we continue to reap benefits from the new product innovation that we've launched back in 2006. For the quarter, both revenue and adjusted EPS exceeded the upper end of our guidance range for all 4 business units, and they delivered revenue growth ahead of our expectations. This reflected both our continued execution of new products and market expansions as well as a stronger-than-expected U.S. mortgage market. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $678 million, up 10% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis from the second quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-on-year headwind, up from the headwind we experienced in the first quarter of $17 million. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.8%, up from 27.3% in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.15, up 20% from $0.96 a share last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range. As always [indiscernible] before John gives us some financial details, I'll go through some of the business unit highlights as well as some of the corporate highlights, and I'll go into the details of the financials with John. 
The power of our Decision 360 initiative, which you, by now, are very well aware of, combined with our enterprise selling strategy and our mortgage market success enabled USIS to once again deliver very strong, broad-based 12% growth. Our recently launched data and analytics environment, which we've introduced to you and we call it Cambrian, has positioned us to develop and deliver new D360 products at speed that once took weeks, now take us minutes. This is something you'll recall we've talked about now for probably 2 years, and that is now fully in production in the U.S. and making a big difference. 
The primary goal of Cambrian is to source and integrate structured and unstructured data from any industry anywhere in the world and proactively deliver actual [ph] insights valued by our customers. What's particularly compelling is that we can now create transformational solutions like combining traditional, trusted data with other Big Data sources and cutting-edge analytical capabilities with greater ease and speed. Cambrian will help us discover new data assets for our research and/or partnerships that will further broaden and deepen our portfolio of data assets and fuel new product innovation. 
Specially for Cambrian, the environment is focused on our U.S.-based data assets and market opportunities. However, as we've talked in the past, we'll be developing significant domain expertise that will enable us to expand into our International geographies over the next 6 to 12 months. 
Moving on. And in the auto vertical in the U.S., we recently launched the first of 3 products in the power lead suite, which leverages our data assets to help auto dealers be more effective in their marketing activities in leveraging third-party service providers or connectors, as we call them. We help dealers leverage their website performance by turning anonymous borrowers into known high-quality leads. Consumers are now more empowered by getting their credit score online after being authenticated with our eIDverifier services, and all this information is with the consumer authorization it's then shared with the dealers. 
Our partnership with Credit Karma, I think we've talked to you about that back in the very end of 2013, nearly 2014. That continues to be -- is that right? '14, '15, yes, very end of '14, sorry about that. That continues to be a very important revenue contributor to USIS and is off to a great start this year. We now expect the revenue in relationship with Credit Karma for 2015 to exceed our original expectations. 
Staying in the USIS, in the utility sector, we launched our -- the first of our 4 market-specific insight tools, leveraging third-party data alongside our credit information in our telco and utility database. These insights will help utilities optimize their deposit strategies to better manage and control portfolio loss rates. 
Our Commercial Solutions business within USIS, the product offerings and business unit had a very strong performance in the quarter, with both accelerating revenue growth and improved operating margins when compared to the first quarter of the year. Mortgage origination activity exceeded our expectations for the quarter and driven by our strong market position, contributed nicely to USIS' growth and margin expansion. Our fraud and property valuation product offerings continue to deliver very strong double-digit growth in the mortgage market as well. We'll talk on these in the Q&A, more about mortgage and where we think that's headed. 
Finally, our partnership with Jumio, which we talked to you about in the past, has secured first mobile commerce authentication service with a major telco. The application includes validation of an end-user's photo ID, along with facial biometrics, a first for us. While we expect the mortgage growth to decelerate for the remainder of the year, we expect USIS to end 2015 with double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%. 
So on to International. They continue to make very good progress on their critical strategic growth initiatives, including the integration of TDX, implementation of the U.K. government contract and continue to drive innovation through new products around the globe. Revenue in International's 3 largest verticals, which are the financial institutions, telcos and SMEs, grew 13% for the quarter. The decisioning platforms, analytic services and debt management revenue grew 17% for the quarter. 
TDX delivered another quarter of 20%-plus revenue growth, a trend we expect to continue as we move into the third quarter. Also, we are in the process of entering the Canadian and Brazilian markets with TDX products and services. We're also meeting all of our operational readiness commitments within TDX over the U.K. contract that we've talked about in the past. 
Equifax data has been integrated into the TDX workflow. We're developing the consumer insights and appropriate collection strategies. The IT infrastructure build has been completed and security penetration testing is largely completed. 20 debt collection agency contracts have been signed after bidding with the U.K. government. And as we mentioned in the past, we expect this to be operational late fourth quarter, early fourth quarter, a modest revenue this year and ramping up nicely in 2016. 
Moving on Latin America. We've identified opportunities to set up exchanges just like we do in the U.S., where critical data assets are not currently available. We've already received regulatory approval in one country and we'll be finalizing our plans by the end of the year. As you know, the exchanges have been very successful in the U.S. with good margins and good competitive differentiation, helping our customers in ways we couldn't help before. We're really excited about what this might bring us in this 1 country, if it's successful there, we'll bring it across other Latin American countries. 
In Canada, we launched a 6-month pilot for e-commerce site to provide online delivery for our business and consumer credit product offerings. This distribution channel will be very attractive to our SME customers while also addressing a growing market demand in other verticals and potentially other geographies. 
And we recently signed a global agreement with a large international telecom to create new analytical insights using telecom usage data. Ultimately, the analytical insights will be sold to financial institutions, retailers and other customers in our served markets to facilitate decisioning on consumers who have limited or no credit information. This partnership is significant for Equifax as a new source of rich data for consumers in Latin America, which is typically a negative-data-only geography. We're starting with the risk scores that are developed from our telecom data to address the pain point of FIN file and no hit at the point of acquisition. Over time, we'll expand this beyond account acquisition to other decisioning needs. 
For the full year, we expect the International revenue growth to be solidly in the upper end of their long-term growth range, which is 7% to 10% while we continue to grow -- invest in their long-term growth initiatives. On the Workforce Solutions, they again delivered an outstanding broad-based 23% revenue growth and a operating margin of 38.3%, and they're doing a great job of executing with precision on their strategic objectives. Revenue from all of our Affordable Care Act initiatives continue to accelerate nicely. And with the recent Supreme Court decision, we anticipate continued strong demand for our product offerings in this area. 
In our ACA platform solution, which enables companies to know the extent of their compliance with the Affordable Care Act, we continue to benefit from very strong interest. We now have contracts with numerous employers who, in aggregate, now have 10 million employees on their payroll. In June alone, we signed 62 new customer contracts. We're uniquely positioned to add value in the healthcare vertical, and we will be making important investments to drive further long-term revenue growth and market penetration. 
Strong growth in Verification Services was driven by continuing to add records, new records to The Work Number database, also double-digit growth in mortgage originations and continued penetration of non-mortgage market verticals. In the quarter, our non-mortgage market verification revenue grew 21%, virtually every vertical growing strong double digit for the quarter, outstanding performance. 
Growth in mortgage-related revenues decelerated in the second quarter, a trend that will continue for the remainder of the year. However, Workforce Solutions' success on many of their strategic initiatives should continue to drive very attractive revenue growth. For the full year, we now expect revenue growth to be in the upper teens with margin expansion over 2014 of at least 400 basis points to approximately 37%. 
On the PSOL, the PSOL's growth exceeded our expectation, driven by double-digit growth in our indirect channels and our International segments in addition to winning 2 bridge contracts. Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. continues to be driven by higher average revenue per subscriber and lower churn. They've done a great job on both ARPU in churn. PSOL is making good progress on their transformation efforts, and we expect full year organic revenue growth to be at the upper end of a long-term range of 4% to 6% and operating margins for the full year solidly in the range of 25% to 30%. 
So again, before I go to John with the financial details, let me give you some highlights at the corporate level quickly, some things we've talked about in the past that are very critical to our sustained organic growth. You've heard me talk about NPI 2.0 and you heard me talk about EGI, that's critically important growth initiatives. In NPI 2.0, we developed detailed metrics to better manage our pipeline of opportunities, more effectively allocate our resources and track our success on product launches and to minimize time to revenue. Midway to the year, we are now 10% overall revenue target, so the team is doing a great job of executing again in NPI. 
Our enterprise growth initiatives, we call it EGI, where we're focused on larger, more complex projects and frequently engage multiple parts of the organization. We also have much bigger impact on the revenue growth. EGI is delivering, again, 1 to 2 points of revenue growth annually for us. 
In global operations, that COE continues to make important contributions to our bottom line. Within the operations COE, you've heard us talk about LEAN initiatives, which traditionally have been used internally. We've talked a lot about that. However, with the increased level of competition and regulatory requirements in many of our industry verticals, there are many new opportunities for incremental revenue growth, and we leveraged LEAN within our customers' operations. Our global LEAN team is now -- are currently engaged with over 20 great customers, helping to drive operational improvements that are critical to their success while adding yet another element of differentiation for our business in the marketplace. So our customers have become stronger, more efficient and it helps us differentiate versus competition and secure incremental revenue. 
On to our fraud and identity management business. They're presently broadening to incorporate biometrics in mobile device resolution. We have partnerships. We're also looking -- taking a more successful product and launching them in other geographies. It's a practice we've done in other parts of the business. Now we're intentionally taking Fraud and ID products in all parts of the world to other geographies where it makes sense. 
In summary, the business is off to a solid start this year, with high levels of execution across many of our strategic initiatives. And we're well down the path of changing Equifax from a credit bureau into a truly diversified Information Solutions company. Our domain expertise in analytics and technology enabled us to increasingly deliver powerful insights to our customers and enhance their decision-making. All of our business units continue to work hard to deliver on their commitments to the company, our customers, employees and shareholders. And as we move into the second half of 2015 and start to look at 2016, I strongly believe the prospects for consumer credit in the developed markets, which we operate, especially the U.S., look very good. The dynamics are shaping up as a sweet spot now for consumer credit growth. 
And with that, let me turn it over to John with the financials. John?"

As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $14.8 million or $9.8 million after-tax",631,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $14.8 million or $9.8 million after-tax related to our cost method investment in BBS. The impairment is, in general, a result of the weakened economic situation in Brazil. We also recorded an $8.6 million after-tax gain due to a state income tax benefit resulting from a state tax law change enacted during the quarter. The net of these 2 unusual items was negative $0.01 per share. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded these items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. 
Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the second quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $316 million, up 12% when compared to the second quarter of '14. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 13% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $33 million, up 20% compared to Q2 of 2014. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 16% in the second quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $50 million, up 4% when compared to the year-ago quarter. And the operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 42.1%, up from 39.5% in the second quarter of 2014. International revenue was $148 million, down 1% on a reported basis but up 11% on a local currency basis. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $63 million, down 1% in U.S. dollars but up 12% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $51 million, up 6% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Canada revenue was $35 million, down 10% in U.S. dollars but up 2% in local currency. For the second quarter, International's operating margin was 19.9%, down from 21.9% in the second quarter of 2014. Although the operating margin fell short of our expectations, we have a number of very exciting growth opportunities Rick has discussed that were an incremental investment and management focus. Workforce Solutions revenue was $146 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the second quarter of '14. Verification Services, with revenue of $94 million, was up 30% when compared to the same quarter of last year. Employer Services revenue was $52 million, up 11% compared to last year. Growth was aided by our ACA analytical solutions and the further progress with Compliance Center. 
The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 38.3% compared to 33.9% in Q2 of '14. Personal Solutions revenue was $68 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 8% on a local currency basis. For the second quarter, operating margin was 27.6% compared to 30.9% in Q2 of 2014. This margin is consistent with our longer-term expectations for this business as we primarily -- driven by increased marketing expense during the quarter. 
In the second quarter, general corporate expense at $48.5 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last year. The increase versus our guidance, and from the $36.6 million in 2Q of 2014, was principally due to increased incentive compensation expense due to our very strong performance in 2015. We also had increased salaries and benefits and other investment expense primarily related to our key strategic initiatives. 
Looking at the third and fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be approximately $45 million for the quarter, consistent with 2014 levels. Operating margin at 27.8% was very strong. Operating cash flow was $187 million in the quarter. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 0.9 million shares for $92 million and paying $34 million in dividends to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rick."

Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect continued favorable economic conditions in the U.S., span the majority of our non-mortgage verticals. I'll talk about mortgage in a second. International, we continue to expect uneven economic conditions across Europe and Latin America. And our view of the U.S. mortgage market in the second half of 2015 is roughly consistent with our prior guidance as we expect U.S. mortgage market originations to be up slightly in the second half of 2015 versus the same period in 2014. And we are, however, increasing our full year view for 2015 mortgage originations to be up somewhere between 11% and 13% versus 2014. The U.S. mortgage market was stronger than our expectations in the first half of the year, with originations up approximately 20% versus last year. And again, we'll talk about the nuances and the impact of moving from a refinancing mortgage market to a purchase market, which we're in the process of doing, the benefits that has for our company. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue -- organic revenue growth to be -- organic revenue to be between $655 million and $670 million, reflecting constant currency organic growth between 10% and 12%, partially offset by about 3% FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.08 and $1.11 a share, which is up 7% to 10% excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 15%. We also expect operating margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the quarter. For the full year, we have again increased our guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We expect now 2015 revenue to be between $2.645 billion and $2.67 billion, up from our previous guidance which was $2.585 billion to $2.635 billion and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the year. 
This strong revenue growth is partially offset again by approximately 3% negative FX impact. And as before, this is all organic revenue growth. 2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3 -- $4.38 to $4.42 a share, also up from our previous guidance, and this reflects 13% to 14% EPS growth for the year. On a constant currency basis, excluding $0.10 per share negative impact of FX at current rates, this reflects 15% to 16% growth for the year when compared to 11% growth in 2011. 
In summary, we're also more intently focused now on strategic inorganic growth as we've developed a more robust pipeline of potential opportunities now that we have fully integrated TDX into our operations. So as I've talked to you in the past, the intent was to be more focused on that as we exit 2015 and into 2016. We're ready to do just that. 
So that's all the prepared comments. So operator, if you could please open up for Q&A for John and I, that would be great."

So that could be the auto vertical within International but also the auto vertical within all the countries in International performing extremely well. It's very, very broad-based, and their execution is at extremely high level. Let me use your question to respond to something I briefly alluded to in my comments, which is the nuances of mortgage and how mortgage impacts our thinking for the balance of the year and next year. And you guys know this as well as we do. The world is going -- the U.S. market is going from a heavily refinancing distribution to now back to more the normal distribution, which is heavily skewed towards purchases and less and less towards refinancing. And while the overall mortgage market will soften, I think it clearly is going to soften in second half of this year versus the first half 2015 will be less than 2,000 or maybe modestly up from 2015. The nuance that's positive for us is that when you go from a refinancing market to a home purchase market, it's actually a benefit. In many cases, individual bank policies may not require them to pull a VOE/VOI verification income. When you do a purchase, they pull a VOE/VOI. Secondly, when you go to a refinancing -- from refinancing to purchase, you're going to pull, as we told you in the past, far more credit files. Your broker may pull a credit file. Usually, a consumer may shop to 4 different banks, 5 different banks, each time pulling a file. In refinancing, you don't do that. They may pull 1 file. So even though the mortgage market growth rates will slow as we go forward, including third quarter, we think there's some hidden gems in there for us as you rebalance to a purchase marketing."

I think generically, in the U.S., I think I said this in some of my comments, we were expecting improved economic environment. I'm talking about moving to a sweet spot of consumer credit as you exit this year and going to 2016. It's not robust yet in the U.S. It's improving. The nuance and difference there would be the automotive, obviously very strong. And we benefited from that but we also benefit -- we're growing at rates, multiples of the automotive growth rates, as you know, Shlomo, through our connector strategy with our partners and new product introduction, card using prescreen pick-up, which is encouraging. And that should lead to more card revenue going forward. Insurance is strong. Retail banking is strong. So it's fairly broad-based. But the heart of your question is, other than automotive, the majority of the USIS growth that we're experiencing is not economic -- some of it is economically driven, the mortgage driven by New product innovation, more spend with our customers, leveraging D360 things like that versus the market itself."

We told you, we'll accelerate the growth there from our competitors but the margin will come down 25% to 30%. We also told you we're going to invest in International for long-term growth and profitability. We can do those things and still give you what we told you we're going to do which is a 25 to 50 basis points corporate margin expansion, we've done that. And I think margins were up 120 basis points in the first quarter and 50 basis points in the second quarter. Specific to your question, though, there are 2 things we're investing in, in International, which I firmly believe benefit us long term. One is the government contract we've talked about in the U.K. That is a large complicated investment that we've had to make, there's required resources from around the globe to stand up in this environment, to be ready to go live end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter. And I think we've talked about that now as a group for a few quarters. So that's one. The other has been with our ability now to standardize platforms, we're now going to regional standards in International. And there's a cost associated with moving from replicating processes in every country to regionalizing those processes in fewer countries. So there's an investment required to get those. Those are 2 things we're investing in now as well as NPI, but we always do that, and it will bode well long term, it creates some headwinds in margin short term."

There's a cloud over that possibility. It's likely or possible that the positive bureau is, in fact, controlled and built by the banks, much like Serasa, if you remember Serasa of old, on the negative data was built. So I'm not sure strategically what that does to the Brazilian market long term. So right now, and I've always said before, I get aggressive in doing to step up my -- our ownership in Brazil.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning. By now you've seen the results and I think you'd agree our company continues to benefit from our unique and very diversified business model, also benefits from our high level of execution across all the BUs in the centers of excellences, and we continue to reap benefits from the new product innovation that we've launched back in 2006. For the quarter, both revenue and adjusted EPS exceeded the upper end of our guidance range for all 4 business units, and they delivered revenue growth ahead of our expectations. This reflected both our continued execution of new products and market expansions as well as a stronger-than-expected U.S. mortgage market. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $678 million, up 10% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis from the second quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-on-year headwind, up from the headwind we experienced in the first quarter of $17 million. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.8%, up from 27.3% in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.15, up 20% from $0.96 a share last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range. As I always do before John gives you some financial details, I'll go through some of the business unit highlights as well as some of the corporate highlights, and then we'll go into the details of the financials with John. 
The power of our Decision 360 initiative, which you, by now, are very well aware of, combined with our enterprise selling strategy and our mortgage market success enabled USIS to once again deliver very strong, broad-based 12% growth. Our recently launched data and analytics environment, which we've introduced to you and we call it Cambrian, has positioned us to develop and deliver new D360 products at speed that once took weeks, now take us minutes. This is something you'll recall we've talked about now for probably 2 years, and that is now fully in production in the U.S. and making a big difference. 
The primary goal of Cambrian is to source and integrate structured and unstructured data from any industry anywhere in the world and proactively deliver actionable insights valued by our customers. What's particularly compelling is that we can now create transformational solutions by combining traditional, trusted data with other Big Data sources and cutting-edge analytical capabilities with greater ease and speed. Cambrian will help us discover new data assets through our research and/or partnerships that will further broaden and deepen our portfolio of data assets and fuel new product innovation. 
Especially for Cambrian, the environment is focused on our U.S.-based data assets and market opportunities. However, as we've talked in the past, we'll be developing significant domain expertise that will enable us to expand into our International geographies over the next 6 to 12 months. 
Moving on. And in the auto vertical in the U.S., we recently launched the first of 3 products in the power lead suite, which leverages our data assets to help auto dealers be more effective in their marketing activities in leveraging third-party service providers or connectors, as we call them. We help dealers leverage their website performance by turning anonymous borrowers into known high-quality leads. Consumers are now more empowered by getting their credit score online after being authenticated with our eIDverifier services, and all this information is with the consumer authorization it's then shared with the dealers. 
Our partnership with Credit Karma, I think we've talked to you about that back in the very end of 2013, early 2014. That continues to be -- is that right? '14, '15, yes, very end of '14, sorry about that. That continues to be a very important revenue contributor to USIS and is off to a great start this year. We now expect the revenue in relationship with Credit Karma for 2015 to exceed our original expectations. 
Staying in USIS, in the utility sector, we launched our -- the first of our 4 market-specific insight tools, leveraging third-party data alongside our credit information in our telco and utility database. These insights will help utilities optimize their deposit strategies to better manage and control portfolio loss rates. 
Our Commercial Solutions business within USIS, the product offerings and business unit had a very strong performance in the quarter, with both accelerating revenue growth and improved operating margins when compared to the first quarter of the year. Mortgage origination activity exceeded our expectations for the quarter and driven by our strong market position, contributed nicely to USIS' growth and margin expansion. Our fraud and property valuation product offerings continue to deliver very strong double-digit growth in the mortgage market as well. We'll talk obviously in the Q&A, more about mortgage and where we think that's headed. 
Finally, our partnership with Jumio, which we talked to you about in the past, has secured its first mobile commerce authentication service with a major telco. The application includes validation of an end-user's photo ID, along with facial biometrics, a first for us. While we expect the mortgage growth to decelerate for the remainder of the year, we expect USIS to end 2015 with double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%. 
So on to International. They continue to make very good progress on their critical strategic growth initiatives, including the integration of TDX, implementation of the U.K. government contract and continue to drive innovation through new products around the globe. Revenue in International's 3 largest verticals, which are the financial institutions, telcos and SMEs, grew 13% for the quarter. The decisioning platforms, analytic services and debt management revenue grew 17% for the quarter. 
TDX delivered another quarter of 20%-plus revenue growth, a trend we expect to continue as we move into the third quarter. Also, we are in the process of entering the Canadian and Brazilian markets with TDX products and services. We're also meeting all of our operational readiness commitments within TDX over the U.K. contract that we've talked to you about in the past. 
Equifax data has been integrated into the TDX workflow. We're developing the consumer insights and appropriate collection strategies. The IT infrastructure build has been completed and security penetration testing is largely completed. 20 debt collection agency contracts have been signed after vetting with the U.K. government. And as we mentioned to you in the past, we expect this to be operational late fourth quarter, early fourth quarter, a modest revenue this year and ramping up nicely in 2016. 
Moving on to Latin America. We've identified opportunities to set up exchanges much like we do in the U.S., where critical data assets are not currently available. We've already received regulatory approval in one country and we'll be finalizing our plans by the end of the year. As you know, the exchanges have been very successful in the U.S. with good margins and good competitive differentiation, helping our customers in ways we couldn't help before. We're really excited about what this might bring us in this one country, if it's successful there, we'll bring it across other Latin American countries. 
In Canada, we launched a 6-month pilot for e-commerce site to provide online delivery for our business and consumer credit product offerings. This distribution channel will be very attractive to our SME customers, while also addressing a growing market demand in other verticals and potentially other geographies. 
And we recently signed a global agreement with a large international telecom to create new analytical insights using telecom usage data. Ultimately, the analytical insights will be sold to financial institutions, retailers and other customers in our served markets to facilitate decisioning on consumers who have limited or no credit information. This partnership is significant for Equifax as a new source of rich data for consumers in Latin America, which is typically a negative data-only geography. We're starting with risk scores that are developed from our telecom data to address the pain point of FIN file and no hit at the point of acquisition. Over time, we'll expand this beyond account acquisition to other decisioning needs. 
For the full year, we expect the International revenue growth to be solidly in the upper end of their long-term growth range, which is 7% to 10% while we continue to grow -- invest in their long-term growth initiatives. On to Workforce Solutions, they again delivered an outstanding broad-based 23% revenue growth and a operating margin of 38.3%, and they're doing a great job of executing with precision on their strategic objectives. Revenue from all of our Affordable Care Act initiatives continue to accelerate nicely. And with the recent Supreme Court decision, we anticipate continued strong demand for our product offerings in this area. 
In our ACA platform solutions, which enables companies to know the extent of their compliance with the Affordable Care Act, we continue to benefit from very strong interest. We now have contracts with numerous employers who, in aggregate, now have 10 million employees on their payroll. In June alone, we signed 62 new customer contracts. We're uniquely positioned to add value in the healthcare vertical, and we will be making important investments to drive further long-term revenue growth and market penetration. 
Strong growth in Verification Services was driven by continuing to add records, new records to The Work Number database, also double-digit growth in mortgage originations and continued penetration of non-mortgage market verticals. In the quarter, our non-mortgage market verification revenue grew 21%, virtually every vertical growing strong double digit for the quarter, outstanding performance. 
Growth in mortgage-related revenues decelerated in the second quarter, a trend that will continue for the remainder of the year. However, Workforce Solutions' success on many of their strategic initiatives should continue to drive very attractive revenue growth. For the full year, we now expect revenue growth to be in the upper teens with margin expansion over 2014 of at least 400 basis points to approximately 37%. 
On the PSOL, the PSOL's growth exceeded our expectation, driven by double-digit growth in our indirect channels and our International segments in addition to winning 2 breach contracts. Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. continues to be driven by higher average revenue per subscriber and lower churn. They've done a great job on both ARPU and churn. PSOL is making good progress on their transformation efforts, and we expect full year organic revenue growth to be at the upper end of a long-term range of 4% to 6% and operating margins for the full year solidly in the range of 25% to 30%. 
So again, before I go to John with the financial details, let me give you some highlights at the corporate level quickly, some things we've talked about in the past that are very critical to our sustained organic growth. You've heard me talk about NPI 2.0 and you've heard me talk about EGI, that's critically important growth initiatives. In NPI 2.0, we developed detailed metrics to better manage our pipeline of opportunities, to more effectively allocate our resources and track our success on product launches and to minimize time till revenue. Midway into the year, we are now 10% over our revenue target, so the team is doing a great job of executing again in NPI. 
Our enterprise growth initiatives, we call it EGI, where we're focused on larger, more complex projects that frequently engage multiple parts of the organization. We also have much bigger impact on the revenue growth. EGI is delivering, again, 1 to 2 points of revenue growth annually for us. 
In global operations, that COE continues to make important contributions to our bottom line. Within the operations COE, you've heard us talk about LEAN initiatives, which traditionally have been used internally. We've talked a lot about that. However, with the increased level of competition and regulatory requirements in many of our industry verticals, there are many new opportunities for incremental revenue growth, when we leveraged LEAN within our customers' operations. Our global LEAN team is now -- are currently engaged with over 20 great customers, helping to drive operational improvements that are critical to their success while adding yet another element of differentiation for our business in the marketplace. So our customers have become stronger, more efficient and it helps us differentiate versus competition and secure incremental revenue. 
On to our fraud and identity management business. They're presently broadening to incorporate biometrics in mobile device resolution. We have partnerships. We're also looking -- taking our more successful products and launching them in other geographies. It's a practice we've done in other parts of the business. Now we're intentionally taking Fraud and ID products in one part of the world to other geographies where it makes sense. 
In summary, the business is off to a solid start this year, with high levels of execution across many of our strategic initiatives. And we're well down the path of changing Equifax from a credit bureau into a truly diversified Information Solutions company. Our domain expertise in analytics and technology enabled us to increasingly deliver powerful insights to our customers and enhance their decision-making. All of our business units continue to work hard to deliver on their commitments to the company, our customers, employees and shareholders. And as we move into the second half of 2015 and start to look at 2016, I strongly believe the prospects for consumer credit in the developed markets, in which we operate, especially the U.S., look very good. The dynamics are shaping up as a sweet spot now for consumer credit growth. 
And with that, let me turn it over to John with the financials. John?"

As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $14.8 million or $9.8 million after-tax",630,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $14.8 million or $9.8 million after-tax related to our cost method investment in BBS. The impairment is, in general, a result of the weakened economic situation in Brazil. We also recorded an $8.6 million after-tax gain due to a state income tax benefit resulting from a state tax law change enacted during the quarter. The net of these 2 unusual items was negative $0.01 per share. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded these items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. 
Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the second quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $316 million, up 12% when compared to the second quarter of '14. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 13% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $33 million, up 20% compared to Q2 of 2014. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 16% in the second quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $50 million, up 4% when compared to the year-ago quarter. And the operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 42.1%, up from 39.5% in the second quarter of 2014. International revenue was $148 million, down 1% on a reported basis but up 11% on a local currency basis. 
By region, Europe's revenue was $63 million, down 1% in U.S. dollars but up 12% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $51 million, up 6% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Canada revenue was $35 million, down 10% in U.S. dollars but up 2% in local currency. For the second quarter, International's operating margin was 19.9%, down from 21.9% in the second quarter of 2014. Although the operating margin fell short of our expectations, we have a number of very exciting growth opportunities Rick has discussed that were an incremental investment and management focus. Workforce Solutions revenue was $146 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the second quarter of '14. Verification Services, with revenue of $94 million, was up 30% when compared to the same quarter of last year. Employer Services revenue was $52 million, up 11% compared to last year. Growth was aided by our ACA analytical solutions and the further progress with Compliance Center. 
The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 38.3% compared to 33.9% in Q2 of '14. Personal Solutions revenue was $68 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 8% on a local currency basis. For the second quarter, operating margin was 27.6% compared to 30.9% in Q2 of 2014. This margin is consistent with our longer-term expectations for this business as we primarily -- driven by increased marketing expense during the quarter. 
In the second quarter, general corporate expense at $48.5 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last year. The increase versus our guidance, and from the $36.6 million in 2Q of 2014, was principally due to increased incentive compensation expense due to our very strong performance in 2015. We also had increased salaries and benefits and other investment expense primarily related to our key strategic initiatives. 
Looking at the third and fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be approximately $45 million per quarter, consistent with 2014 levels. Operating margin at 27.8% was very strong. Operating cash flow was $187 million in the quarter. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 0.9 million shares for $92 million and paying $34 million in dividends to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rick."

Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect continued favorable economic conditions in the U.S., spanning the majority of our non-mortgage verticals. I'll talk about mortgage in a second. International, we continue to expect uneven economic conditions across Europe and Latin America. And our view of the U.S. mortgage market in the second half of 2015 is roughly consistent with our prior guidance as we expect U.S. mortgage market originations to be up slightly in the second half of 2015 versus the same period in 2014. And we are, however, increasing our full year view for 2015 mortgage originations to be up somewhere between 11% and 13% versus 2014. The U.S. mortgage market was stronger than our expectations in the first half of the year, with originations up approximately 20% versus last year. And again, we'll talk about the nuances and the impact of moving from a refinancing mortgage market to a purchase market, which we're in the process of doing, the benefits that has for our company. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue -- organic revenue growth to be -- organic revenue to be between $655 million and $670 million, reflecting constant currency organic growth between 10% and 12%, partially offset by about 3% FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.08 and $1.11 a share, which is up 7% to 10% excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 13%. We also expect operating margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the quarter. For the full year, we have again increased our guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We expect now 2015 revenue to be between $2.645 billion and $2.67 billion, up from our previous guidance which was $2.585 billion to $2.635 billion and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the year. 
This strong revenue growth is partially offset again by approximately 3% negative FX impact. And as before, this is all organic revenue growth. 2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3 -- $4.38 to $4.42 a share, also up from our previous guidance, and this reflects 13% to 14% EPS growth for the year. On a constant currency basis, excluding $0.10 per share negative impact of FX at current rates, this reflects 15% to 16% growth for the year compared to 11% growth in 2011. 
In summary, we're also more intently focused now on strategic inorganic growth as we've developed a more robust pipeline of potential opportunities now that we have fully integrated TDX into our operations. So as I've talked to you in the past, the intent was to be more focused on that as we exit 2015 and into 2016. We're ready to do just that. 
So that's all the prepared comments. So operator, if you could please open up for Q&A for John and I, that would be great."

So that could be the auto vertical within International but also the auto vertical within all the countries in International performing extremely well. It's very, very broad-based, and their execution is at extremely high level. Let me use your question to respond to something I briefly alluded to in my comments, which is the nuances of mortgage and how mortgage impacts our thinking for the balance of the year and next year. And you guys know this as well as we do. The world is going -- the U.S. market is going from a heavily refinancing distribution to now back to more the normal distribution, which is heavily skewed towards purchases and less and less towards refinancing. And while the overall mortgage market will soften, I think it clearly is going to soften in second half of this year versus the first half  2016 will be less than 2,000 or maybe modestly up from 2015. The nuance that's positive for us is that when you go from a refinancing market to a home purchase market, it's actually a benefit. In many cases, individual bank policies may not require them to pull a VOE/VOI verification income. When you do a purchase, they pull a VOE/VOI. Secondly, when you go to a refinancing -- from refinancing to purchase, you're going to pull, as we told you in the past, far more credit files. Your broker may pull a credit file. You, as a consumer may shop to 4 different banks, 5 different banks, each time pulling a file. In refinancing, you don't do that. They may pull 1 file. So even though the mortgage market growth rates will slow as we go forward, including third quarter, we think there's some hidden gems in there for us as you rebalance to a purchase marketing."

And what the beauty is, Shlomo, before I give you the 2 things we're doing is John and I have the luxury to invest in areas where we need to invest, and PSOL is one of them we've been investing in now for a couple of years, as an example. We told you, we'll accelerate the growth there from our competitors but the margin will come down 25% to 30%. We also told you we're going to invest in International for long-term growth and profitability. We can do those things and still give you what we told you we're going to do which is a 25 to 50 basis points corporate margin expansion, we've done that. And I think margins were up 120 basis points in the first quarter and 50 basis points in the second quarter. Specific to your question, though, there are 2 things we're investing in, in International, which I firmly believe benefit us long term. One is the government contract we've talked about in the U.K. That is a large complicated investment that we've had to make, there's required resources from around the globe to stand up in this environment, to be ready to go live end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter. And I think we've talked to you about that now as a group for a few quarters. So that's one. The other has been with our ability now to standardize platforms, we're now going to regional standards in International. And there's a cost associated with moving from replicating processes in every country to regionalizing those processes in fewer countries. So there's an investment required to get those. Those are 2 things we're investing in now as well as NPI, but we always do that, and it will bode well long term, and creates some headwinds in margin short term."

There's a cloud over that possibility. It's likely or possible that the positive bureau is, in fact, controlled and built by the banks, much like Serasa, if you remember Serasa of old, on the negative data was built. So I'm not sure strategically what that does to the Brazilian market long term. So right now, and I've always said before, I get aggressive in doing to step up my -- our ownership in Brazil. I've got to really understand what the economy is going to do and how long it's going to be in this downtrodden environment, and where does the positive bureau go.

Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.
During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin. They will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2015, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, income from the settlement of certain escrow amounts and an accrual for certain legal claims. Adjusted operating margin excludes the accrual for certain legal claims.
In the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax will also exclude due diligence transaction and integration costs related to the proposed acquisition of beta group.
These non-GAAP measures are detailed in our reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investors Relations section of our website for further details. Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick."

Our strong first half momentum continued throughout the third quarter with very solid broad-based growth across most of our key market segments and countries. The mome",2193,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for joining us this morning. Our strong first half momentum continued throughout the third quarter with very solid broad-based growth across most of our key market segments and countries. The momentum combined with good solid execution from the team and one of the deepest NPI pipelines we've had in over the past 10 years positions us well to move into the fourth quarter and in 2016. In my comments later this morning, I'll give you a further look at both the fourth quarter as we always do and 2016 as well.
The Equifax strategy is clearly resonating well with our customers, our core disciplines in New Product Innovation, LEAN, IT simplification, regulatory compliance and talent assessment are enabling stronger, more consistent execution across all of our initiatives. 
For the quarter, total revenue was up -- was $667 million, up 9% on a reported basis and up 12% on local currency basis in the third quarter of 2014 and at the high-end of our guidance. In the quarter Equifax had a $22 million year-over-year headwind, up from the second quarter headwind, which was $19 million. Adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up nicely from 26.4% in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 13% from $1.01 last year last year and above the upper end of our guidance range that we provided back a few months ago.
As always, before John gives you the financial details, I'd like to briefly cover some key highlights for the third quarter. USIS has continued to power forward with 12% revenue growth and has a robust pipeline of opportunities, provide continued unique insights incorporating our multiple data assets. USIS delivered very solid broad-based growth in fraud and identity management solutions and commercial information. Both those businesses were up double digits versus 2014. Mortgage, direct-to-consumer and automotive were also very strong growth drivers for the quarter. And like the rest of the company, USIS is also benefiting from broad-based growth from NPI and our enterprise growth initiatives. A little more in NPI. There are 4 strategic levers to USIS efforts around New Product Innovation. They are: one, accelerating growth by linking those relevant data with expanded analytic capabilities; two, investing in vertical expertise to drive unparalleled insights; three, focusing on customer experience to optimize enterprise distribution; and four diversifying portfolio growth across the value chain. An interesting point is that almost 60% of the anticipated 3-year NPI revenue is focused on opportunities beyond the more traditional credit risk solutions that you know us for. 
Finally, this week, we announced a very exciting opportunity for Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae will begin incorporating Equifax credit data in addition to our verified employment and income on The Work Number database. The credit data provides new insights to lenders by expanding the credit information to aid the assessment of risk using updated analytical tools. Integrating The Work Number in the Fannie Mae system will make the process simple for consumers and reduce potential for fraud. We believe this will be a win-win for the consumers as well as the mortgage industry. There is work to be done on our side. And as a result, the revenue opportunities are expected to start sometime in the second or third quarter of next year. It will be a nice impact for both USIS and EWS. USIS is having an outstanding year in 2015. For the full year, we expect them to deliver double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%.
On to International, we delivered 14% local currency revenue growth leveraging the diversity in score customer verticals, New Product Innovation and unique platforms in fraud and debt management. As you know, we're now in the midst of starting up the U.K. government project we talked to you about now for a few quarters. We have provided Equifax consumer data to 1 government agency and have now received approximately GBP 265 million of past due receivables that we're now loading and analyzing and will soon move on to the collection agencies. As we've mentioned before, we expect nominal revenue growth in the fourth quarter this year, and we expect that to ramp up nicely in 2016. In summary, as it relates to that project, it is on track, on pace and meeting our expectations.
In addition, we are currently exceeding our expectations for the TDX business in places like Australia and relaunching that across many other countries throughout the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. In fact, purely making a point, as you think about the TDX platform, the debt management platform in 2016, it will then be dispersed through multiple countries as opposed to 1 central P&L that you're used to seeing or can see like we talked about in the U.K. Also, International new product innovation continues to be a very important contributor to International's long-term growth. Their focus is in area of analytical insights, enhanced decision solutions, new verticals and distribution channels and broadening their data assets. in International's 3 largest verticals: financial institutions, telcos and SMEs grew 17% in the third quarter versus a healthy 13% in the second quarter of 2015. platforms analytical services and our debt management revenue grew 19% in the quarter, accelerating from 17% in the second quarter of the year. In 2015, International successfully executed on the strategic initiatives, and very important business opportunities that will transform growth profile in the coming years. For the full year, we expect International revenue growth to be above the long-term range we talked about of 7% to 10% growth.
Workforce Solutions, which has had a solid performance, and I think you'll agree for the year, grew 13% revenue from its continued traction in its compliance solution products, broadening market penetration for verification in employment and income and some very sophisticated analytical insights. Employer interest in our workforce analytic solutions for the Affordable Care Act remains extremely strong. Our subscription-based ACA platform solution, which enables companies to better understand their level of compliance with the requirements of ACA, is one of our most successful NPI initiatives in my 10 years here. We're now expecting to have over 700 clients by the end of this year, and we're still getting a large number of interest -- inbound request, which bodes well for EWS in the employer services business within EWS for 2016 and beyond.
In addition to our core product offering focused on compliance, we're also exploring other opportunities that will enable us to address evolving market needs including fines and penalties under the act and any related appeals that follow. We believe this will further enhance our position in the marketplace and make us an even more valuable partner to all our customers. New Product Innovation continues to make meaningful contribution to revenue growth for EWS. We now expect to end the year with a vitality index of over 11% versus our target of 10% at the beginning of the year. Earlier this week, EWS was honored for the second year in a row with the Product of the Year award by the editors of Sherman Resource Magazine. Our I-9 anywhere product is a cutting-edge service that enables organizations to streamline their 4 9 9 integration form completion process using remote entry for applicants. We're also exceeding our year-to-date targets for both actives and historical records in The Work Number database and expect to end the year over our full year targets. Verification Services growth is -- was in excess of 20% and continues to be driven by adding records to The Work Number database and strong growth in key market verticals including auto, mortgage, consumer finance, government.
Workforce Solutions has an outstanding year in 2015 by almost any measure, driving very healthy double-digit revenue growth across multiple product offerings. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper teens and operating margins to settle in the upper 30s.
Against the backdrop of the changing operating environment, PSOL is consistently delivering growth in the upper end of the multiyear target range of 4% to 6%. We continue to make good progress in key metrics for our direct-to-consumer product offerings. In indirect, we have a broad and diverse set of opportunity in the pipeline, much of which is outside of the banking sector. We expect indirect to make meaningful contributions to weather growth again in 2016, and we continue to generate good growth in our International segments. As you know, that includes Canada and the U.K. Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. was largely driven by higher average revenue for per subscriber in the quarter. For the full year, we expect Personal Solutions organic revenue growth to be within their long-term range of 4% to 6% with all the operating margins in the upper 20s. 
Let me transition back just for a second a few highlights that we talked about in the past at the corporate level level and NPI and EGI that continue to make very important contributions to our long-term growth model, provide strong discipline around the allocation of both financial capital resources enable us to execute with position. Year-to-date, our new product pipeline is expected to deliver 3-year revenue as 50% greater than the 2014 pipeline. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, that is probably the strongest I've seen since I've been here 10 years, and that bodes well obviously for 2016 and beyond. All our enterprise growth initiatives leverage our operating and project management disciplines. These disciplines ensure that we'll develop effective plans through execution and then deliver on the goals we set for ourselves. Our current view for our 2015 portfolio of EGI projects suggests that we'll exceed our full year target by almost 20%. And much like NPI, EGI is becoming a big part of our DNA in every geography and vertical we operate. Our insight strategy to global strategy is heavily dependent upon having contemporary IT platforms that can be implemented globally. In the past, you've heard us talk about the interconnect platform that was first developed in the U.S. and is now used in Canada, U.K. and Latin America. We're now in the process of taking a fraud platforming exchange that was originally deployed in U.K. and successful -- successfully deployed in Canada a few years ago and expanding around the U.S. and across Latin America. This solution provides advanced analytics and workflow as well as a known exchange focused primarily on account opening process. The skills and project management expertise our global operations COE is widely regarded and respected internally and by our customers. This organization was heavily involved in up the U.K. government opportunity for TDX, ensuring that we successfully meet all of our contractual obligation while positioning us to deliver performance, above the portfolio thresholds and collection effectiveness. More recently, we have conducted a number of customer journeys we work directly with customers on the end-to-end process with the objective of improving both the cost effectiveness of our interactions and importantly, their overall experience with us.
I'm sure you're all interested in an update on our offer to acquire the Veda Group in Australia. I'll share a few thoughts with you there. We believe this opportunity is  a nice strategic fit for Equifax, expands our geographic footprint in the core segment we know very well. Veda is a strong market -- has a strong market position, great products and data assets. They're very profitable, and they give us a strong management team in Asia. We believe Equifax' strength in advanced analytics, enterprise growth initiative, New Product Innovation and others can act to make Veda even stronger. We're currently  in the early process for Veda. And at this point, our agreements with Veda include a purchase price of AUD 2.08 to AUD 2.5 [ph]. They're not binding. As you can appreciate the transaction this time, we'll take considerable time to negotiate and finalize. We plan to conduct our usual thorough and disciplined due diligence. Simultaneously, we will negotiate the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement. Subject to successful completion of these steps, we would anticipate signing a binding agreement later this year. The final transaction is subject to the approval of the respected boards of directors, regulatory approval in Australia as well as Veda shareholders' approval. If the transaction ultimately goes forward, we anticipate completion sometime between late February and early April of 2016. At this point, I'm very confident in our ability to effectively integrate Veda should we have the opportunity to do so. 
2015 is turning out to be the strongest performance in my time with the company. As many of you know, we started the journey of transforming Equifax into a global leader in Information Solutions back in 2005. I believe we can say we have successfully transformed the culture invest our capital to support that vision, strengthen our talent base while continuously our commitments to our shareholders, customers, employees and consumers. I remain optimistic about the opportunities we have for growth in 2016 and beyond.
And with that, let me turn it over to John. John?"

During the quarter, we reported income of $12 million from settlement of certain escrow amounts related to an acquisition outside of the measurement period. We also recorded an expense of $8 million related to the settlement of certain specific legal claims. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded these items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The after-tax effect of these 2 unusual items was positive $0.05 a share.
Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $312 million, up 12% when compared to the third quarter of 2014, another very strong quarter for USIS. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 13% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 12% compared to Q3 2014. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 20% in the quarter, and mortgage-related revenue for the total company was up 24%. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 17% in the second quarter. We currently expect total mortgage originations in the fourth quarter to be down year-over-year. For 2016, our current outlook is for mortgage originations to be about flat when compared to the full year of 2015.
On to Financial Marketing Services where revenue was $47 million, up 6% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.9%, up from 40.3% in the third quarter of 2014. Internationals revenue was $149 million, flat on a reported basis but up 14% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe revenue was $64 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars but up 16% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $52 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 20% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 13% in U.S. dollars but up 5% in local currency. For the third quarter, International's operating margin was about 20%, which is flat when compared to the second quarter of 2015. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect International operating margins to remain at about 20% throughout 2015. We expect margins to increase throughout 2016, reflecting continued strong local currency revenue growth including TDX the U.K. government contract begins to contribute as well as the benefits of regionalization and other contracts. Workforce Solutions revenue was $139 million for the quarter, up 13% when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Growth for Workforce Solutions at 13% was very strong and continue to be above our long-term model of 7% to 10%. This reflects continued very strong growth in Verification Services, up 22% year-to-year. The solid growth also reflects the following: Employer Services revenue, principally from unemployment claims, compensation claims, work opportunity tax credit and other related Employer Services declined slightly year-to-year. This reflects the continued very low levels of years unemployment as well as the timing of several authorizations in 1Q '15. Our Workforce Analytics solution for ACA compliance, which is part of our Employer Services business, continues to perform well ahead of our expectations, as Rick mentioned earlier, and now has 700-plus clients in various stages of boarding preparing for 2016 ACA reporting. However, as this is a subscription-based service in which the boarding services are offered as part of the service, all of the revenue associated with boarding and subscription service fees prior to customer production go-live is deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the agreement. As such, this brings tremendous growth in customers of activity in the second half of 15. Revenue realization will not begin until very late in 2015 and principally, 2016. Long term, we believe the subscription-based model will be greatly beneficial both in terms of customer retention and revenue profitability. It's also additive to our expectations that Workforce Solutions will continue to grow faster than our long-term 7% to 10% model. In the remainder of 2015, it will put pressure on Employer Services growth rates. In 3Q overall, Employer Services activity was more heavily skewed to ACA compliance, and that revenue was deferred and we indicated, deferred until very late 2015 and predominantly 2016. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 35.9%, up almost 350 basis points from 3Q '14. Workforce Solutions continues to make great progress toward achieving margins consistently near 40%. Personal Solutions revenue was $67 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the third quarter, operating margin was 26.9%, consistent with our long-term expectation for operating margins to be in the upper 20s. The year-over-year decline in operating margins is primarily driven by marketing spend at levels more consistent with our long-term expectations. In the third quarter, general corporate expense at $47 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be up slightly from the $47 million in 3Q '15. The adjusted operating margin at 27.2% was up from 26.4% in 2014 and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.8%. This was benefited by 1.8 percentage points by the very low tax rate on the income from the settlement of the escrow we discussed earlier. Both the income from the settlement of the escrow and the related tax expense was excluded from our adjusted EPS. Excluding this 1.8 percentage point benefit, our 3Q effective tax rate was slightly higher than our effective tax rate of 32.5% in 3Q '14 and approximately consistent with the guidance we gave for the third quarter. It was also consistent with historical pattern of our third quarter effective tax rate being below the effective tax rate for the year.
Our current expectation for the effective tax rate for the full year is to be slightly less than 34%. Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $247 million. With pending M&A activity, we reduced our level of stock repurchases in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million and year-to-date were $94 million. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $120 million to $125 million. This is above the approximately $100 million we discussed at the beginning of 2015. To support our continued acceleration and enterprise growth and new product innovation initiatives, we've accelerated our investments in global analytics, decisioning, broaden and change platforms and supporting network and data center infrastructure as well as internal systems. We are confident these investments will support both revenue growth and margin enhancement. At this level of investment, our capital spending continues to be at a modest 5% of revenue.
Earlier, Rick gave you an update on our proposal to acquire the Veda Group. This would be Equifax' largest acquisition in its history. And given the size of the acquisition and the upfront cost associated with the transaction and its integration, we will be excluding all acquisition-specific transaction and due diligence expense as well as integration expenses incurred in the first 12 months following the closure of the acquisition from our adjusted EPS.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

For the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and partially offset by 2% of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in",604,"Thanks, John. For the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and partially offset by 2% of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in July that the fourth quarter organic growth would be at the high-end of our long-term range, which we talked about being 6% to 8% growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be from $1.10 and $1.12, which is up 8% -- 8% to 10% for the quarter. Excluding $0.02 per share negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the quarter. Our year-to-date performance results -- our strong year-to-date performance results in an increase of our full year guidance. We can model that outlook for the fourth quarter 2015 represents an outstanding year for our shareholders, our customers, employees and consumers. And for the full year, we expect 2015 revenue to be somewhere between $2.652 billion and $2.662 billion consistent with our guidance in July and up nicely from our guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion at the beginning of the year and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of a healthy 12% for 2015. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by 3% negative impact from FX. As before, this is only organic revenue growth, and we'll talk more about next year getting back into the M&A game. As we expect, the operating margin to be somewhere in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the full year, which is up 80 basis points over 2014. 2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.46 to $4.48 per share, up from the $4.38 to $4.42 per share we guided in July and up significantly from the $4.20 to $4.30 per share guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. That growth reflects -- that reflects a 15% growth in EPS for the year. On a constant currency basis excluding $0.11 per share of negative impact from FX, at current rates, this reflects a very strong 17% to 18% growth for the year compared to 11% growth in 2014.
Now it's early but I thought I'd give you some color on how we're thinking about 2016. And as we always do, we'll come back to give you a lot more clarity and depth on the February earnings call. As we share a look at 2016, we fully expect to be towards the upper end of our organic growth target range, which is 6% to 8% with additional growth coming from successful completion of our current M&A activities communicated -- committed to you add over time 1, 2 points of growth coming from inorganic growth, if you exclude Veda because of the size of that, our pipeline is strong, and we clearly see contributing to our organic growth of 6% to 8% and incremental 1 to 2 points coming from M&A. Veda will be incremental to that 1, 2 points. We also expect operating margins in 2016 when we exclude the impact of acquisitions to expand nicely, given the higher growth expectations we have, and this is against the backdrop of an outstanding organic growth rate in 2015. So -- and we also expect, as John said, mortgage to be relatively flat in 2016. So in summary, I think you'll agree 2015 is shaping up to be another outstanding year in 2016. Where we sit today, we're expecting another outstanding year in 2016. So operator, with that, we'd like to open up to any questions our audience may have."

And I'm also very, very intrigued with the concept on trended data of bringing that we're looking at now is a technology requirement as well bring EWS. The concept of taking one of the many different attributes we have in The Work Number database, that attribute being income and showing an underwriter, a marketeer, whoever a historical look a trended look at their income intellectually excites myself and the team.

Again, I think the rest of my comments probably the most impactful, largest meaningful we had in my 10 years here. As far as margins on International, yes, I clearly see 2015 as being the trough, if you will, on margins. That was intentional. We're integrating a big acquisition for that we're investing heavily in the U.K. business unit, U.K. government opportunity talked about. Also, as John alluded to in our comments, investing heavily in technology analytics and platforms around the International operations to fuel growth short, medium and the long term. So we clearly expect 2015 to drop margins nicely in 2016 and beyond. Will they get back to 29% [ph] ? Theres one caveat for that I think they can over time and period over time is the team is working diligently now to regionalize big pockets of cost within International, and that requires technology investment to take things from countries to regions and so on and so forth.

I'd like to think of it as a remote lending, unsecured remote lending rather than peer-to-peer lending club or green sky or business credit or others. One point I think is that is a market placement that will exist. I think that the strip the marketplace for the traditional banking sector the banks participate themselves I think it's you're mistaken think it's got good momentum, good legs. As we mentioned before, they are a user of our data. Today, they use both the verification deployment and in some database many times as well as core credit scores. and we expect that to continue going forward. So right now I view that as being yet another -- if that sector can allow maybe other people to get access to credit, the normal system that's incremental to us if that's just displacement bank would underwrite today, a nonevent for us. The bigger question we're thinking about strategically is how else can we play that ecosystem? In 5, 10 years is a big robust part of the market and how do we participate in the market right now."

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin. They will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2015, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, income from the settlement of certain escrow amounts and an accrual for certain legal claims. Adjusted operating margin excludes the accrual for certain legal claims.
In fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax will also exclude due diligence transaction and integration costs related to the proposed acquisition of Veda Group.  These non-GAAP measures are detailed in our reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investors Relations section of our website for further details.

Good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for joining us this morning. Our strong first half momentum continued throughout the third quarter with very solid broad-based growth across most of our key market segments and countries. The momentum combined with solid execution from the team and one of the deepest NPI pipelines we've had in over the past 10 years, positions us well to move into the fourth quarter and in 2016. In my comments later this morning, I'll give you a further look at both the fourth quarter as we always do and 2016 as well.
The Equifax strategy is clearly resonating well with our customers, our core disciplines in New Product Innovation, LEAN, IT simplification, regulatory compliance and talent assessment are enabling stronger, more consistent execution across all of our initiatives. 
For the quarter, total revenue was up -- was $667 million, up 9% on a reported basis and up 12% on local currency basis in the third quarter of 2014, and at the high end of our guidance. In the quarter Equifax created a $22 million year-over-year headwind, up from the second quarter headwind, which was $19 million. Adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up nicely from 26.4% in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 13% from $1.01 last year and above the upper end of our guidance range that we provided back a few months ago.
As always, before John gives you the financial details, I'd like to briefly cover some key highlights for the third quarter. USIS has continued to power forward with 12% revenue growth and has a robust pipeline of opportunities to provide continued unique insights incorporating our multiple data assets. USIS delivered very solid broad-based growth in Fraud and Identity Management Solutions and Commercial Information. Both those business units were up double digits versus 2014. Mortgage, direct-to-consumer and automotive were also very strong growth drivers for the quarter. And like the rest of the company, USIS is also benefiting from broad-based growth from NPI and our enterprise growth initiatives. 
A little more in NPI. There are 4 strategic levers to USIS efforts around New Product Innovation. They are: one, accelerating growth by linking those relevant data with expanded analytic capabilities; two, investing in vertical expertise to drive unparalleled insights; three, focusing on customer experience through optimize enterprise distribution; and four, diversifying portfolio growth across the value chain. An interesting point is that almost 60% of the anticipated 3-year NPI revenue is focused on opportunities beyond the more traditional credit risk solutions that you know us for. 
Finally, this week, we announced a very exciting opportunity for Fannie Mae, you may have read that. Fannie Mae will begin incorporating Equifax credit data in addition to our verified employment and income on The Work Number database. The credit data provides new insights to lenders by expanding the credit information to aid their assessment of risk using updated analytical tools. Integrating The Work Number into Fannie Mae's underwriting system will make the process simpler for consumers and reduce potential for fraud. We believe this will be a win-win for the consumers as well as the mortgage industry. 
There's more to be done on our side. And as a result, the revenue opportunity is expected to start sometime in the second or third quarter of next year. It will be a nice impact for both USIS and EWS. USIS is having an outstanding year in 2015. For the full year, we expect them to deliver double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%.
On to International, they delivered 14% local currency revenue growth leveraging the diversity in its core customer verticals, New Product Innovation and unique platforms in decisioning, fraud and debt management. As you know, we're now in the midst of starting up the U.K. government project that we talked to you about now for a few quarters. We have provided Equifax consumer data to one government agency and have now received approximately GBP 265 million of past due receivables that we're now loading and analyzing and will soon move on to the collection agencies. As we've mentioned before, we expect nominal revenue growth in the fourth quarter this year, and we expect that to ramp up nicely in 2016. In summary, as it relates to that project, it is on track, on pace and meeting our expectations.
In addition, we are currently exceeding our expectations for the TDX business in places like Australia. And we're launching that platform across many other countries throughout the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. And in fact, it's -- we're already making a point here, as you think about the TDX platform, the debt management platform in 2016, it will then be dispersed through multiple countries as opposed to one central P&L that you're used to seeing or can see like we talked about in the U.K. 
Also in International, New Product Innovation continues to be a very important contributor to International's long-term growth. Their focus is in areas of analytical insights, enhanced decision solutions, new verticals and distribution channels and broadening their data assets. International's 3 largest verticals: financial institutions, telcos and SMEs, grew 17% in the third quarter versus a healthy 13% in the second quarter of 2015. The decisioning platforms, our analytical services and our debt management revenue grew 19% in the quarter, accelerating from 17% in the second quarter of the year. In 2015, International successfully executed on its strategic initiatives and captured some very important business opportunities that will transform and further broaden its growth profile in the coming years. For the full year, we expect International revenue growth to be above their long-term range that we've talked about of 7% to 10% growth.
Workforce Solutions, which just had a stellar performance [indiscernible] for the year, grew 13% revenue from its continued traction in its compliance solution products, broadening market penetration for verification of employment and income and some very sophisticated analytical insights. Employer interest in our workforce analytic solutions for the Affordable Care Act remains extremely strong. Our subscription-based ACA platform solution, which enables companies to better understand their level of compliance with the requirements of ACA, is one of our most successful NPI initiatives in my 10 years here. We're now expecting to have over 700 clients by the end of this year and we're still getting a large number of interest -- inbound request, which bodes well for EWS and the Employer Services business within EWS for 2016 and beyond.
In addition to our core product offering focused on compliance, we're also exploring other opportunities that will enable us to address evolving market needs including fines and penalties under the act and any related appeals that follow. We believe this will further enhance our position in the marketplace and make us an even more valuable partner to our good customers. New Product Innovation continue to make a very meaningful contribution to revenue growth for EWS. We now expect to end the year with a vitality index of over 11% versus our target of 10% at the beginning of the year. 
Earlier this week, EWS was honored for the second year in a row with the product of the year award by the editors of Human Resource Magazine Resource Magazine. Our I-9 anywhere product is a cutting-edge service that enables organizations to streamline their form I-9 integration form completion process using remote entry for applicants. We're also exceeding our year-to-date targets for both active and historical records in The Work Number database, and expect to end the year over our full year targets. Verification Services growth was in excess of 20% and continues to be driven by adding records to The Work Number database and strong growth in key market verticals including auto, mortgage, consumer finance, government and preemployment.
Workforce Solutions has an outstanding year in 2015 by almost any measure, driving very healthy double-digit revenue growth across multiple product offerings. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper teens and operating margins to settle in the upper 30s.
Against the backdrop of a changing operating environment, PSOL is consistently delivering growth in the upper end of the multiyear target range of 4% to 6%. We continue to make good progress in key metrics for our direct-to-consumer product offerings. In indirect, we have a broad and diverse set of opportunities in the pipeline, much of which is outside of the banking sector. We expect indirect to make meaningful contributions to weather growth, again, in 2016. And we continue to generate good growth in our International segments. As you know, that includes Canada and the U.K. Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. was largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the quarter. For the full year, we expect Personal Solutions organic revenue growth to be within their long-term range of 4% to 6% with healthy operating margins in the upper 20s. 
Let me transition back, just for a second, to a few highlights that we talked about in the past at the corporate level rather than the BU level, and those are NPI and EGI. They continue to make very important contributions to our long-term growth model, provide strong discipline around the allocation of both financial and human capital resources, enabling us to execute with precision. Year-to-date, our new product pipeline is expected to deliver 3-year revenue as 50% greater than the 2014 pipeline. 
As I mentioned earlier in my comments, that this is probably the strongest I've seen since I've been here in 10 years. And that bodes well, obviously, for 2016 and beyond. All of our enterprise growth initiatives leverage our operating and project management disciplines. These disciplines ensure that we'll develop effective plans through execution and then deliver on the goals we set for ourselves. Our current view for our 2015 portfolio of EGI projects suggests that we'll exceed our full year target by almost 20%. And much like NPI, EGI is becoming a big part of our DNA in every geography and vertical in which we operate. 
Our insight to strategy, the global strategy, is heavily dependent upon having contemporary IT platforms that can be implemented globally. In the past, you've heard us talk about interconnect platforms that was first developed in the U.S. and is now used in Canada, U.K. and Latin America. We're now in the process of taking a fraud platforming exchange that was originally deployed in U.K. and successfully deployed in Canada a few years ago, and expanding now into the U.S. and across Latin America. This solution provides advanced analytics and workflow as well as a known product strength -- exchange focused primarily on account opening process. 
The skills and project management expertise in our global operations COE is widely regarded and respected internally and by our customers. This organization was heavily involved in standing up the U.K. government opportunity for TDX, ensuring that we successfully met all of our contractual obligations while positioning us to deliver performance, above the portfolio of thresholds and for collection effectiveness. More recently, we have conducted a number of customer journeys while we work directly with customers on the end-to-end process with the objective of improving both the cost effectiveness of our interactions and importantly, their overall experience with us.
By now I'm sure you're all interested in update on our offer to acquire the Veda Group in Australia. I'll share a few thoughts with you there. We believe this opportunity is a nice strategic fit for Equifax and expands our geographic footprint in the core segment that we know very well. Veda is a strong market -- has a strong market position, great products and data assets. They're very profitable and they give us a strong management team in Asia. We believe Equifax's strength in advanced analytics, enterprise growth initiative, New Product Innovation and others, can act to make Veda even stronger. 
We're currently in the early process for Veda. And at this point, our agreements with Veda include a purchase price of AUD 2.825. They're nonbinding. As you can appreciate the transaction this time, we'll take considerable time to negotiate and finalize. We plan to conduct our usual thorough and disciplined due diligence. Simultaneously, we will negotiate the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement. Subject to successful completion of these steps, we would anticipate signing a binding agreement later this year. 
The final transaction is subject to the approval of the respected Boards of Directors, regulatory approval in Australia as well as Veda shareholders' approval. If the transaction ultimately goes forward, we anticipate completion sometime between late February and early April of 2016. At this point, I'm very confident in our ability to effectively integrate Veda should we have the opportunity to do so. 
2015 is turning out to be the strongest performance in my time with the company. As many of you know, we started the journey of transforming Equifax into a global leader in Information Solutions back in 2005. I believe we can say we have successfully transformed the culture, positively invested in our capital to support that vision, strengthen our talent base while continuously honoring our commitments to our shareholders, customers, employees and consumers. I remain optimistic about the opportunities we have for growth in 2016 and beyond.
And with that, let me turn it over to John. John?"

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded income of $12 million from settlement of certain escrow amounts related to an acquisition outside of the measurement period. We also recorded an expense of $8 million related to the settlement of certain specific legal claims. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded these items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The after-tax effect of these 2 unusual items was positive $0.05 a share.
Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $312 million, up 12% when compared to the third quarter of 2014, another very strong quarter for USIS. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 13% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 12% compared to Q3 2014. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 20% in the quarter and mortgage-related revenue for the total company was up 24%. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 17% in the second quarter. We currently expect total mortgage originations in the fourth quarter to be down year-over-year. For 2016, our current outlook is for mortgage originations to be about flat when compared to the full year of 2015.
On to Financial Marketing Services where revenue was $47 million, up 6% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.9%, up from 40.3% in the third quarter of 2014. Internationals revenue was $149 million, flat on a reported basis but up 14% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $64 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars but up 16% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $52 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 20% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 13% in U.S. dollars but up 5% in local currency. 
For the third quarter, International's operating margin was about 20%, which is flat when compared to the second quarter of 2015. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect International operating margins to remain at about 20% throughout 2015. We expect margins to increase throughout 2016, reflecting continued strong local currency revenue growth including TDX that the U.K. government contract begins to contribute, as well as the benefits of regionalization and other costs factors.
Workforce Solutions revenue was $139 million for the quarter, up 13% when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Growth for Workforce Solutions at 13% was very strong and continue to be above our long-term model of 7% to 10%. This reflects continued very strong growth in Verification Services, up 22% year-to-year. The solid growth also reflects the following: Employer Services revenue, principally from unemployment claims, compensation claims, work opportunity tax credit and other related Employer Services, declined slightly year-to-year. This reflects the continued very low levels of U.S. unemployment as well as the timing of federal authorizations in 1Q '15. Our Workforce Analytics solution for ACA compliance, which is part of our Employer Services business, continues to perform well ahead of our expectations, as Rick mentioned earlier, and now has 700-plus clients in various stages of boarding preparing for 2016 ACA reporting. 
However, as this is a subscription-based service in which the boarding services are offered as part of the service, all of the revenue associated with boarding and subscription service fees, prior to customer production go-live, is deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the agreement. As such, despite tremendous growth in customers and activity in the second half of 15, revenue realization will not begin until very late in 2015 and principally, 2016. Long term, we believe the subscription-based model will be greatly beneficial both in terms of customer retention and revenue predictability. It's also additive to our expectations that Workforce Solutions will continue to grow faster than our long-term 7% to 10% model. In the remainder of 2015, it will put pressure on Employer Services growth rates. In 3Q, overall Employer Services activity was more heavily skewed to ACA compliance. And that revenue was deferred, and as we indicated, deferred until very late 2015 and predominantly 2016. 
The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 35.9%, up almost 350 basis points from 3Q '14. Workforce Solutions continues to make great progress toward achieving margins consistently near 40%. Personal Solutions revenue was $67 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the third quarter, operating margin was 26.9%, consistent with our long-term expectation for operating margins to be in the upper 20s. The year-over-year decline in operating margin is primarily driven by marketing spend at levels more consistent with our long-term expectations. 
In the third quarter, general corporate expense at $47 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be up slightly from the $47 million in 3Q '15. The adjusted operating margin at 27.2% was up from 26.4% in 2014 and in line with our expectations for the quarter. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.8%. This was benefited by 1.8 percentage points by the very low tax rate on the income from the settlement of the escrow we discussed earlier. Both the income from the settlement of the escrow and the related tax expense was excluded from our adjusted EPS. Excluding this 1.8 percentage point benefit, our 3Q effective tax rate was slightly higher than our effective tax rate of 32.5% in 3Q '14 and approximately consistent with the guidance we gave for the third quarter. It was also consistent with the historical pattern of our third quarter effective tax rate being below the effective tax rate for the year. Our current expectation for the effective tax rate for the full year is to be slightly less than 34%. 
Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $247 million. With pending M&A activity, we reduced our level of stock repurchases in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million and year-to-date, were $94 million. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $120 million to $125 million. This is above the approximately $100 million we discussed at the beginning of 2015. To support our continued acceleration and enterprise growth and new product innovation initiatives, we've accelerated our investments in global analytics, decisioning, broaden exchange platforms and supporting network and data center infrastructure, as well as internal systems. We are confident these investments will support both revenue growth and margin enhancement. At this level of investment, our capital spending continues to be at a modest 5% of revenue.
Earlier, Rick gave you an update on our proposal to acquire the Veda Group. This would be Equifax's largest acquisition in its history. And given the size of the acquisition and the upfront cost associated with the transaction and its integration, we will be excluding all acquisition-specific transaction and due diligence expense as well as integration expenses incurred in the first 12 months following the closure of the acquisition from our adjusted EPS.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

This is consistent with our comments in",625,"Thanks, John. For the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and partially offset by 2% of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in July that the fourth quarter organic growth would be at the high end of our long-term range, which we talked about being 6% to 8% growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.12, which is up 8% -- 8% to 10% for the quarter. Excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the quarter. 
Our year-to-date performance results -- our strong year-to-date performance results in an increase of our full year guidance combined with our outlook for the fourth quarter 2015 represents an outstanding year for our shareholders, our customers, employees and consumers. And for the full year, we expect 2015 revenue to be somewhere between $2.652 billion and $2.662 billion consistent with our guidance in July and up nicely from our guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion at the beginning of the year, and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of a healthy 12% for 2015. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by 3% negative impact from FX. As before, this is only organic revenue growth and we'll talk more about it next year while getting back into the M&A game. 
As we expect, the operating margin to be somewhere in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the full year, which is up a nice 80 basis points over 2014. 2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.46 to $4.48 per share, up from the $4.38 to $4.42 per share we've guided in July, and up significantly from the $4.20 to $4.30 per share guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. That growth reflects -- that reflects a 15% growth in EPS for the year. On constant currency basis, excluding $0.11 per share of negative impact from FX at current rates, this reflects a very strong 17% to 18% growth for the year compared to 11% growth in 2014.
Now it's early but I thought I'd give you some color on how we're thinking about 2016. And as we always do, we'll come back to give you a lot more clarity and depth on the February earnings call. As we share, I'd say a look at 2016, we fully expect to be towards the upper end of our organic growth target range, which is 6% to 8%, with additional growth coming from successful completion of our current M&A activities. Our model that we've communicated to you and committed to you is to add, over time, 1 to 2 points of growth coming from inorganic growth. If you exclude Veda, because of the size of that, our pipeline is strong. We clearly see contributing to our organic growth of 6% to 8%, an incremental 1 to 2 points coming from M&A, Veda will be incremental with that 1 to 2 points. 
We also expect operating margins in 2016 when you exclude the impact of acquisitions to expand nicely, given the higher growth expectations we have. And this is against the backdrop of an outstanding organic growth rate in 2015. So -- and we also expect, as John said, the mortgage market to be relatively flat in 2016. So in summary, I think you'll agree 2015 is shaping up to be yet another outstanding year for the team. And 2016, where we sit today, we're expecting another outstanding year in 2016. 
So operator, with that, we'd like to open up to any questions our audience may have."

It's a great one for consumers, it's a great one for the underwriters and it's going to be a great one for our business unit -- business units of USIS and EWS. As I mentioned I think in my comments earlier on, we expect that to ramp up probably late second quarter, early third quarter, some work we've got to do into building with that fine tune to bring that to market for Fannie Mae, and to be a meaningful impact for the business units next year. I'm not going to give you an exact number, but trust it will be meaningful for us at the BU level. Two, if you think of trended data in general terms, I think maybe 2 years ago, we started talking to you about trended data and there was an interest in getting a historical look versus a snapshot look. And the first thing we did is build the capabilities for our batch offline, we called it internally CMS, and that ramped up nicely. We then threw a technology investment we made in USIS, and Rick Smith brought that capability to go online, and that's now ramping up nicely. And I'm also very, very intrigued with the concept on trended data that bringing that, we're looking at it now, is a technology requirement as well. Bringing EWS the concept of taking one of the many different attributes we have in The Work Number database, that attribute being income and showing an underwriter, a marketeer, whoever, a historical look, a trended look at their income intellectually excites myself and the team. So as I think of trended data, it will be a next evolution that we'll invest and it's bringing trended data towards verification of income."

One, the caveat I'll give you is we've always -- it will be very meaningful for EWS, very meaningful, and it's exceeding my expectations.

John mentioned, I mentioned over 700-plus accounts, strong interest level already brewing for 2016. if you follow the ACA dynamics to -- in the level of and how those increased over the years and the appeal process and -- that's going to have a tail that's for many years as we see there today and looking out. Secondly, and I alluded to it, is getting into this ACA is going to open up other doors and avenues of opportunity we haven't thought about yet, and in the IRS appeals process, so on and so forth. So I'm not going to give you a number, but it is meaningful and very, very, very important to us long term. And again, as I think much of my comments, probably the most impactful, largest, meaningful NPI we had in my 10 years here. As far as margins on international, yes, I clearly see 2015 as being the trough, if you will, on margins, that was intentional. We're integrating a big acquisition for that BU, investing heavily in the U.K. business unit, U.K. government opportunity we talked about. We're also, as John and I alluded to in our comments, investing heavily in technology analytics and platforms around the international operations to fuel growth short, medium and long term. So I -- we clearly expect 2015, the trough in margins that start to ramp up nicely in 2016 and beyond. Will they get back to 29%? There's one caveat for that. I think they can over time, but I can't tell you what period of time, is the team is working diligently now to regionalize big pockets of costs within international, and that requires technology investments to take things from countries to regions and so on and so forth. That will be a big benefactor. If we are fortunate enough to close the acquisition of Veda, we clearly expect that on EBITDA margin basis, that will also be a nice lift to the EBITDA margins of international."

It's been an organization that we've tried to get to know each other for quite some time. Two, philosophically, it's important to know that when we think of acquisitions in Equifax, we are driven by a view of what we can bring to that company that makes that company even better, rather than what does that company bring to us that makes Equifax better? I think studies will show and as the many studies with many consultants, when you take the path of how they help you as a core business, you oftentimes fail. So with that -- having said that, other than the geographical footprint, I think what we can bring there is some of the processes and capabilities that have made Equifax successful the last 10 years in the countries that we operate now, things like our LEAN process, things like LEAN as the customer, things like NPI, things like EGI and price growth initiatives, our Cambrian technology platform, which is fabulous. And as you know, and we've been investing enough for a number of years, bringing that platform to the countries in which they operate to link together unstructured Internet data, if you will, third-party customer data and our data and build more products we could build in the past. I think that's a great capability, so it's really deploying some of the things you know so well, Shlomo, that we can put here into their footprint. And I do think that over time and one of the things that we'll have to determine is clearly not baked into any pro forma assumptions that we have now. Over time, if we have a really good business in that part of the world, we've got really good people which they do, our ability to think about expanding to other geographies now that the 2 businesses are much bigger business doing a lot more EBITDA, it makes some investments organically and inorganically. I think when you're closer to those geographies, I want to make those bets. Sitting here in Atlanta, Georgia, trying to think about making investments in midsized countries around Southeast Asia as the hub is a risk I'm not willing to take, but we've got a good footprint in Australia, New Zealand, and a few other countries. That's a risk we're willing to take as a company, and that would evolve over the next few years."

Foreign exchange has gone from roughly 1.1: 1-point something to 1:0.68 to 0.72, 0.73:1. There is the legislation that is passed into law, the move from just using negative data to positive data, and I think you understand there's been studies in all over the world about the IMF and others to talk about how that catalyzes risk-based pricing, risk-based pricing catalyzes growth of lending.

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our core business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin. They will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2015, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, income from the settlement of certain escrow amounts and an accrual for certain legal claims. Adjusted operating margin excludes the accrual for certain legal claims.
In fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax will also exclude due diligence, transaction and integration costs related to the proposed acquisition of Veda Group.  These non-GAAP measures are detailed in our reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investors Relations section of our website for further details.

As always, thank you for joining us this morning. Our strong first half momentum continued throughout the third quarter with very solid broad-based growth across most of our key market segments and countries. The mome",2243,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for joining us this morning. Our strong first half momentum continued throughout the third quarter with very solid broad-based growth across most of our key market segments and countries. The momentum combined with solid execution from the team and one of the deepest NPI pipelines we've had in over the past 10 years, positions us well to move into the fourth quarter and in 2016. As I end my comments later this morning, I'll give you a further look at both the fourth quarter as we always do and 2016 as well.
The Equifax strategy is clearly resonating well with our customers, our core disciplines in New Product Innovation, LEAN, IT simplification, regulatory compliance and talent assessment are enabling stronger, more consistent execution across all of our initiatives. 
For the quarter, total revenue was up -- was $667 million, up 9% on a reported basis and up 12% on local currency basis in the third quarter of 2014, and at the high end of our guidance. In the quarter FX created a $22 million year-over-year headwind, up from the second quarter headwind, which was $19 million. Adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up nicely from 26.4% in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 13% from $1.01 last year and above the upper end of our guidance range that we provided back a few months ago.
As always, before John gives you the financial details, I'd like to briefly cover some key highlights for the third quarter. USIS has continued to power forward with 12% revenue growth and has a robust pipeline of opportunities to provide continued unique insights incorporating our multiple data assets. USIS delivered very solid broad-based growth in Fraud and Identity Management Solutions and Commercial Information. Both those business units were up double digits versus 2014. Mortgage, direct-to-consumer and automotive were also very strong growth drivers for the quarter. And like the rest of the company, USIS is also benefiting from broad-based growth from NPI and our enterprise growth initiatives. 
A little more in NPI. There are 4 strategic levers to USIS efforts around New Product Innovation. They are: one, accelerating growth by linking the most relevant data with expanded analytic capabilities; two, investing in vertical expertise to drive unparalleled insights; three, focusing on customer experience through optimized enterprise distribution; and four, diversifying portfolio growth across the value chain. An interesting point is that almost 60% of the anticipated 3-year NPI revenue is focused on opportunities beyond the more traditional credit risk solutions that you know us for. 
Finally, this week, we announced a very exciting opportunity for Fannie Mae, you may have read that. Fannie Mae will begin incorporating Equifax trended data in addition to our verified employment and income on The Work Number database. The trended data provides new insights to lenders by expanding the credit information to aid their assessment of risk using updated analytical tools. Integrating The Work Number into Fannie Mae's underwriting system will make the process simpler for consumers and reduce potential for fraud. We believe this will be a win-win for the consumers as well as the mortgage industry. 
There's more to be done on our side. And as a result, the revenue opportunity is expected to start sometime in the second or third quarter of next year. It will be a nice impact for both USIS and EWS. USIS is having an outstanding year in 2015. For the full year, we expect them to deliver double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%.
On to International, they delivered 14% local currency revenue growth leveraging the diversity in its core customer verticals, New Product Innovation and unique platforms in decisioning, fraud and debt management. As you know, we're now in the midst of starting up the U.K. government project that we talked to you about now for a few quarters. We have provided Equifax consumer data to one government agency and have now received approximately GBP 265 million of past due receivables that we're now loading and analyzing and will soon move on to the collection agencies. As we've mentioned before, we expect nominal revenue growth in the fourth quarter this year, and we expect that to ramp up nicely in 2016. In summary, as it relates to that project, it is on track, on pace and meeting our expectations.
In addition, we are currently exceeding our expectations for the TDX business in places like Australia. And we're launching that platform across many other countries throughout the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. And in fact, it's worthy of making a point here, as you think about the TDX platform, the debt management platform in 2016, it will then be dispersed through multiple countries as opposed to one central P&L that you're used to seeing or can see like we talked about in the U.K. 
Also in International, New Product Innovation continues to be a very important contributor to International's long-term growth. Their focus is in areas of analytical insights, enhanced decision solutions, new verticals and distribution channels and broadening their data assets. Revenue in international's 3 largest verticals: financial institutions, telcos and SMEs, grew 17% in the third quarter versus a healthy 13% in the second quarter of 2015. The decisioning platforms, our analytical services and our debt management revenue grew 19% in the quarter, accelerating from 17% in the second quarter of the year. In 2015, International successfully executed on its strategic initiatives and captured some very important business opportunities that will transform and further broaden its growth profile in the coming years. For the full year, we expect International revenue growth to be above their long-term range that we've talked about of 7% to 10% growth.
Workforce Solutions, which just had a stellar performance, which I think you'll agree, for the year, grew 13% revenue from its continued traction in its compliance solution products, broadening market penetration for verification of employment and income and some very sophisticated analytical insights. Employer interest in our workforce analytic solutions for the Affordable Care Act remains extremely strong. Our subscription-based ACA platform solution, which enables companies to better understand their level of compliance with the requirements of ACA, is one of our most successful NPI initiatives in my 10 years here. We're now expecting to have over 700 clients by the end of this year and we're still getting a large number of interest -- inbound request, which bodes well for EWS and the Employer Services business within EWS for 2016 and beyond.
In addition to our core product offering focused on compliance, we're also exploring other opportunities that will enable us to address evolving market needs including fines and penalties under the act and any related appeals that follow. We believe this will further enhance our position in the marketplace and make us an even more valuable partner to our good customers. New Product Innovation continues to make a very meaningful contribution to revenue growth for EWS. We now expect to end the year with a vitality index of over 11% versus our target of 10% at the beginning of the year. 
Earlier this week, EWS was honored for the second year in a row with the product of the year award by the editors of Human Resource Magazine Resource Magazine. Our I-9 anywhere product is a cutting-edge service that enables organizations to streamline their form I-9 integration form completion process using remote entry for applicants. We're also exceeding our year-to-date targets for both active and historical records in The Work Number database, and expect to end the year over our full year targets. Verification Services growth was in excess of 20% and continues to be driven by adding records to The Work Number database and strong growth in key market verticals including auto, mortgage, consumer finance, government and preemployment.
Workforce Solutions has an outstanding year in 2015 by almost any measure, driving very healthy double-digit revenue growth across multiple product offerings. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper teens and operating margins to settle in the upper 30s.
Against the backdrop of a changing operating environment, PSOL is consistently delivering growth in the upper end of the multiyear target range of 4% to 6%. We continue to make good progress in key metrics for our direct-to-consumer product offerings. In indirect, we have a broad and diverse set of opportunities in the pipeline, much of which is outside of the banking sector. We expect indirect to make meaningful contributions to other growth, again, in 2016. And we continue to generate good growth in our International segments. As you know, that includes Canada and the U.K. Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. was largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the quarter. For the full year, we expect Personal Solutions organic revenue growth to be within their long-term range of 4% to 6% with healthy operating margins in the upper 20s. 
Let me transition back, just for a second, to a few highlights that we talked about in the past at the corporate level rather than the BU level, and those are NPI and EGI. They continue to make very important contributions to our long-term growth model, provide strong discipline around the allocation of both financial and human capital resources, enabling us to execute with precision. Year-to-date, our new product pipeline is expected to deliver 3-year revenue as 50% greater than the 2014 pipeline. 
As I mentioned earlier in my comments, that this is probably the strongest I've seen since I've been here in 10 years. And that bodes well, obviously, for 2016 and beyond. All of our enterprise growth initiatives leverage our operating and project management disciplines. These disciplines ensure that we'll develop effective plans through execution and then deliver on the goals we set for ourselves. Our current view for our 2015 portfolio of EGI projects suggests that we'll exceed our full year target by almost 20%. And much like NPI, EGI is becoming a big part of our DNA in every geography and vertical in which we operate. 
Our insight driven strategy, the global strategy, is heavily dependent upon having contemporary IT platforms that can be implemented globally. In the past, you've heard us talk about interconnect platforms that was first developed in the U.S. and is now used in Canada, U.K. and Latin America. We're now in the process of taking a fraud platforming exchange that was originally deployed in U.K. and successfully deployed in Canada a few years ago, and expanding now into the U.S. and across Latin America. This solution provides advanced analytics and workflow as well as a known product strength -- exchange focused primarily on account opening process. 
The skills and project management expertise in our global operations COE is widely regarded and respected internally and by our customers. This organization was heavily involved in standing up the U.K. government opportunity for TDX, ensuring that we successfully met all of our contractual obligations while positioning us to deliver performance, above the portfolio of thresholds and for collection effectiveness. More recently, we have conducted a number of customer journeys while we work directly with customers on the end-to-end process with the objective of improving both the cost effectiveness of our interactions and importantly, their overall experience with us.
By now I'm sure you're all interested in update on our offer to acquire the Veda Group in Australia. I'll share a few thoughts with you there. We believe this opportunity is a nice strategic fit for Equifax and expands our geographic footprint in the core segment that we know very well. Veda is a strong market -- has a strong market position, great products and data assets. They're very profitable and they give us a strong management team in Asia. We believe Equifax's strength in advanced analytics, enterprise growth initiative, New Product Innovation and others, can act to make Veda even stronger. 
We're currently in the early process for Veda. And at this point, our agreements with Veda include a purchase price of AUD 2.825. They're nonbinding. As you can appreciate the transaction this size, we'll take considerable time to negotiate and finalize. We plan to conduct our usual thorough and disciplined due diligence. Simultaneously, we will negotiate the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement. Subject to successful completion of these steps, we would anticipate signing a binding agreement later this year. 
The final transaction is subject to the approval of the respected Boards of Directors, regulatory approval in Australia as well as Veda shareholders' approval. If the transaction ultimately goes forward, we anticipate completion sometime between late February and early April of 2016. At this point, I'm very confident in our ability to effectively integrate Veda should we have the opportunity to do so. 
2015 is turning out to be the strongest performance in my time with the company. As many of you know, we started the journey of transforming Equifax into a global leader in Information Solutions back in 2005. I believe we can say we have successfully transformed the culture, thoughtfully invested our capital to support that vision, strengthened our talent base while continuously honoring our commitments to our shareholders, customers, employees and consumers. I remain optimistic about the opportunities we have for growth in 2016 and beyond.
And with that, let me turn it over to John. John?"

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded income of $12 million from settlement of certain escrow amounts related to an acquisition outside of the measurement period. We also recorded an expense of $8 million related to the settlement of certain specific legal claims. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded these items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The after-tax effect of these 2 unusual items was positive $0.05 a share.
Now let me turn to the business unit’s financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $312 million, up 12% when compared to the third quarter of 2014, another very strong quarter for USIS. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 13% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 12% compared to Q3 2014. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 20% in the quarter and mortgage-related revenue for the total company was up 24%. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 17% in the second quarter. We currently expect total mortgage originations in the fourth quarter to be down year-over-year. For 2016, our current outlook is for mortgage originations to be about flat when compared to the full year of 2015.
On to Financial Marketing Services where revenue was $47 million, up 6% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.9%, up from 40.3% in the third quarter of 2014. Internationals revenue was $149 million, flat on a reported basis but up 14% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $64 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars but up 16% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $52 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 20% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 13% in U.S. dollars but up 5% in local currency. 
For the third quarter, International's operating margin was about 20%, which is flat when compared to the second quarter of 2015. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect International operating margins to remain at about 20% throughout 2015. We expect margins to increase throughout 2016, reflecting continued strong local currency revenue growth including TDX that the U.K. government contract begins to contribute, as well as the benefits of regionalization and other costs actions.
Workforce Solutions revenue was $139 million for the quarter, up 13% when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Growth for Workforce Solutions at 13% was very strong and continue to be above our long-term model of 7% to 10%. This reflects continued very strong growth in Verification Services, up 22% year-to-year. The solid growth also reflects the following: Employer Services revenue, principally from unemployment claims, compensation claims, work opportunity tax credit and other related Employer Services, declined slightly year-to-year. This reflects the continued very low levels of U.S. unemployment as well as the timing of federal WOTC authorizations in 1Q '15. Our Workforce Analytics solution for ACA compliance, which is part of our Employer Services business, continues to perform well ahead of our expectations, as Rick mentioned earlier, and now has 700-plus clients in various stages of boarding preparing for 2016 ACA reporting. 
However, as this is a subscription-based service in which the boarding services are offered as part of the service, all of the revenue associated with boarding and subscription service fees, prior to customer production go-live, is deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the agreement. As such, despite tremendous growth in customers and activity in the second half of 15, revenue realization will not begin until very late in 2015 and principally, 2016. Long term, we believe the subscription-based model will be greatly beneficial both in terms of customer retention and revenue predictability. It's also additive to our expectations that Workforce Solutions will continue to grow faster than our long-term 7% to 10% model. In the remainder of 2015, it will put pressure on Employer Services growth rates. In 3Q, overall Employer Services activity was more heavily skewed to ACA compliance. And that revenue was deferred, and as we indicated, deferred until very late 2015 and predominantly 2016. 
The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 35.9%, up almost 350 basis points from 3Q '14. Workforce Solutions continues to make great progress toward achieving margins consistently near 40%. Personal Solutions revenue was $67 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the third quarter, operating margin was 26.9%, consistent with our long-term expectation for operating margins to be in the upper 20s. The year-over-year decline in operating margin is primarily driven by marketing spend at levels more consistent with our long-term expectations. 
In the third quarter, general corporate expense at $47 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be up slightly from the $47 million in 3Q '15. The adjusted operating margin at 27.2% was up from 26.4% in 2014 and in line with our expectations for the quarter. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.8%. This was benefited by 1.8 percentage points by the very low tax rate on the income from the settlement of the escrow we discussed earlier. Both the income from the settlement of the escrow and the related tax expense was excluded from our adjusted EPS. Excluding this 1.8 percentage point benefit, our 3Q effective tax rate was slightly higher than our effective tax rate of 32.5% in 3Q '14 and approximately consistent with the guidance we gave for the third quarter. It was also consistent with the historical pattern of our third quarter effective tax rate being below the effective tax rate for the year. Our current expectation for the effective tax rate for the full year is to be slightly less than 34%. 
Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $247 million. With pending M&A activity, we reduced our level of stock repurchases in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million and year-to-date, were $94 million. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $120 million to $125 million. This is above the approximately $100 million we discussed at the beginning of 2015. To support our continued acceleration in enterprise growth and new product innovation initiatives, we've accelerated our investments in global analytics, decisioning, broaden exchange platforms and supporting network and data center infrastructure, as well as internal systems. We are confident these investments will support both revenue growth and margin enhancement. At this level of investment, our capital spending continues to be at a modest 5% of revenue.
Earlier, Rick gave you an update on our proposal to acquire the Veda Group. This would be Equifax's largest acquisition in its history. And given the size of the acquisition and the upfront cost associated with the transaction and its integration, we will be excluding all acquisition-specific transaction and due diligence expense as well as integration expenses incurred in the first 12 months following the closure of the acquisition from our adjusted EPS.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

For the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and partially offset by 2% of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in July that the fourth quarter organic growth would be at the high end of our long-term range, which we talked about being 6% to 8% growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.12, which is up 8% -- 8% to 10% for the quarter. Excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the quarter. 
Our year-to-date performance results -- our strong year-to-date performance results in an increase of our full year guidance combined with our outlook for the fourth quarter 2015 represents an outstanding year for our shareholders, our customers, employees and consumers. And for the full year, we expect 2015 revenue to be somewhere between $2.652 billion and $2.662 billion consistent with our guidance in July and up nicely from our guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion at the beginning of the year, and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of a healthy 12% for 2015. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by 3% negative impact from FX. As before, this is only organic revenue growth and we'll talk more about it next year while getting back into the M&A game. 
As we expect, the operating margin to be somewhere in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the full year, which is up a nice 80 basis points over 2014. 2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.46 to $4.48 per share, up from the $4.38 to $4.42 per share we've guided in July, and up significantly from the $4.20 to $4.30 per share guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. That growth reflects -- that reflects a 15% growth in EPS for the year. On constant currency basis, excluding $0.11 per share of negative impact from FX at current rates, this reflects a very strong 17% to 18% growth for the year compared to 11% growth in 2014.
Now it's early, but I thought I'd give you some color on how we're thinking about 2016. And as we always do, we'll come back to give you a lot more clarity and depth on the February earnings call. As we sit here today and look at 2016, we fully expect to be towards the upper end of our organic growth target range, which is 6% to 8%, with additional growth coming from successful completion of our current M&A activities. Our model that we've communicated to you and committed to you is to add, over time, 1 to 2 points of growth coming from inorganic growth. If you exclude Veda, because of the size of that, our pipeline is strong. We clearly see contributing to our organic growth of 6% to 8%, an incremental 1 to 2 points coming from M&A, Veda will be incremental with that 1 to 2 points. 
We also expect operating margins in 2016 when you exclude the impact of acquisitions to expand nicely, given the higher growth expectations we have. And this is against the backdrop of an outstanding organic growth rate in 2015. So -- and we also expect, as John said, the mortgage market to be relatively flat in 2016. So in summary, I think you'll agree 2015 is shaping up to be yet another outstanding year for the team. And 2016, where we sit today, we're expecting another outstanding year in 2016. 
So operator, with that, we'd like to open up to any questions our audience may have."

And we're assuming, David, in that 2016 early look, economies, GDP growth and the economies we participate in, to be relatively in line with what we're seeing this year, which is modest and these struggling economies in South America, modest growth in GDP in U.K., Canada and U.S. at 2%, 2.5% range. So we're not expecting significant GDP or market-based improvement.

We also view, after a lot of work, David, with outside consultants come in, there will always be a place for the paid products that we offer, and we've done a number of interviews through third-party consultants that talked to consumers and a big cross-section of that consumer base wants to and we believe will buy the free products rather the pay-for products. Having said that, free is here to stay. It's carved out a nice piece. We're winning, as you know, in the free channel. Right now, through our USIS business, but Trey in his old job had a heavy hand working with Rudy devising a strategy for the Credit Karmas and others in that arena. So simply said, I see the free business is here to stay. I'm convinced the core business can grow in the mid-single digits with upper 20% margin.

I'm not going to give you an exact number, but trust it will be meaningful for us at the BU level. Two, if you think of trended data in general terms, I think maybe 2 years ago, we started talking to you about trended data and there was an interest in getting a historical look versus a snapshot look. And the first thing we did is build the capabilities for our batch offline, we called it internally CMS, and that ramped up nicely. We then through a technology investment we made in USIS, and recently brought that capability to go online, and that's now ramping up nicely. And I'm also very, very intrigued with the concept on trended data that bringing that, we're looking at it now, is a technology requirement as well. Bringing EWS the concept of taking one of the many different attributes we have in The Work Number database, that attribute being income and showing an underwriter, a marketer, whoever, a historical look, a trended look at their income intellectually excites myself and the team. So as I think of trended data, it will be a next evolution that we'll invest and it's bringing trended data towards verification of income."

One, the caveat I'll give you is we've always -- it will be very meaningful for EWS, very meaningful, and it's exceeding my expectations.

John mentioned, I mentioned over 700-plus accounts, strong interest level already brewing for 2016. if you follow the ACA dynamics to -- in the level of fines and how those increased over the years and the appeal process and -- that's going to have a tail that's for many years as we see there today and looking out. Secondly, and I alluded to it, is getting into this ACA is going to open up other doors and avenues of opportunity we haven't thought about yet, and in the IRS appeals process, so on and so forth. So I'm not going to give you a number, but it is meaningful and very, very, very important to us long term. And again, as I think much of my comments, probably the most impactful, largest, meaningful NPI we had in my 10 years here. As far as margins on international, yes, I clearly see 2015 as being the trough, if you will, on margins, that was intentional. We're integrating a big acquisition for that BU, investing heavily in the U.K. business unit, U.K. government opportunity we talked about. We're also, as John and I alluded to in our comments, investing heavily in technology analytics and platforms around the international operations to fuel growth short, medium and long term. So I -- we clearly expect 2015, the drop in margins that start to ramp up nicely in 2016 and beyond. Will they get back to 29%? There's one caveat for that. I think they can over time, but I can't tell you what period of time, is the team is working diligently now to regionalize big pockets of costs within international, and that requires technology investments to take things from countries to regions and so on and so forth. That will be a big benefactor. If we are fortunate enough to close the acquisition of Veda, we clearly expect that on EBITDA margin basis, that will also be a nice lift to the EBITDA margins of international."

The banks may or may not choose to participate themselves in it, but I think it's here to stay. I think it's got good momentum, good legs. As you've mentioned before, they are a user of our data today. They -- and use both the verification employment and income database many times as well as core credit file and credit scores, and we expect that to continue going forward. So right now, I view that as being yet another -- if that sector can allow maybe other people to get access to credit who couldn't get credit in the normal system that's incremental to us, if that's just displacement of bank would underwrite today, I see it as a nonevent for us.

One, notice that we have -- Shlomo, we've known each other for a number of years and you know our philosophy on acquisitions, so this won't surprise maybe the rest of you or you, all right? We have been talking with Veda now where it dates back maybe 4 years, so it's not like this thing just dropped out of the sky one day when we said this going to be an interesting acquisition. It's been an organization that we've tried to get to know each other for quite some time. Two, philosophically, it's important to know that when we think of acquisitions in Equifax, we are driven by a view of what we can bring to that company that makes that company even better, rather than what does that company bring to us that makes Equifax better? I think studies will show and as the many studies with many consultants, when you take the path of how they help you as a core business, you oftentimes fail. So with that -- having said that, other than the geographical footprint, I think what we can bring there is some of the processes and capabilities that have made Equifax successful the last 10 years in the countries that we operate now, things like our LEAN process, things like LEAN as the customer, things like NPI, things like EGI and price growth initiatives, our Cambrian technology platform, which is fabulous. And as you know, and we've been investing enough for a number of years, bringing that platform to the countries in which they operate to link together unstructured Internet data, if you will, third-party customer data and our data and build more products than we could build in the past. I think that's a great capability, so it's really deploying some of the things you know so well, Shlomo, that we can put here into their footprint. And I do think that over time and one of the things that we'll have to determine is clearly not baked into any pro forma assumptions that we have now. Over time, if we have a really good business in that part of the world, we've got really good people which they do, our ability to think about expanding to other geographies now that the 2 businesses are much bigger business doing a lot more EBITDA, it makes some investments organically and inorganically. I think when you're closer to those geographies, I want to make those bets. Sitting here in Atlanta, Georgia, trying to think about making investments in midsized countries around Southeast Asia as the hub is a risk I'm not willing to take, but we've got a good footprint in Australia, New Zealand, and a few other countries. That's a risk we're willing to take as a company, and that would evolve over the next few years."

During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our core business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin. They will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.
For the third quarter of 2015, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, income from the settlement of certain escrow amounts and an accrual for certain legal claims. Adjusted operating margin excludes the accrual for certain legal claims.
In fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax will also exclude due diligence, transaction and integration costs related to the proposed acquisition of Veda Group. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in our reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investors Relations section of our website for further details.

As always, thank you for joining us this morning. Our strong first half momentum continued throughout the third quarter with very solid broad-based growth across most of our key market segments and countries. The mome",2243,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for joining us this morning. Our strong first half momentum continued throughout the third quarter with very solid broad-based growth across most of our key market segments and countries. The momentum combined with solid execution from the team and one of the deepest NPI pipelines we've had in over the past 10 years, positions us well to move into the fourth quarter and in 2016. As I end my comments later this morning, I'll give you a further look at both the fourth quarter as we always do and 2016 as well.
The Equifax strategy is clearly resonating well with our customers, our core disciplines in New Product Innovation, LEAN, IT simplification, regulatory compliance and talent assessment are enabling stronger, more consistent execution across all of our initiatives. 
For the quarter, total revenue was up -- was $667 million, up 9% on a reported basis and up 12% on local currency basis in the third quarter of 2014, and at the high end of our guidance. In the quarter FX created a $22 million year-over-year headwind, up from the second quarter headwind, which was $19 million. Adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up nicely from 26.4% in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 13% from $1.01 last year and above the upper end of our guidance range that we provided back a few months ago.
As always, before John gives you the financial details, I'd like to briefly cover some key highlights for the third quarter. USIS has continued to power forward with 12% revenue growth and has a robust pipeline of opportunities to provide continued unique insights incorporating our multiple data assets. USIS delivered very solid broad-based growth in Fraud and Identity Management Solutions and Commercial Information. Both those business units were up double digits versus 2014. Mortgage, direct-to-consumer and automotive were also very strong growth drivers for the quarter. And like the rest of the company, USIS is also benefiting from broad-based growth from NPI and our enterprise growth initiatives. 
A little more in NPI. There are 4 strategic levers to USIS efforts around New Product Innovation. They are: one, accelerating growth by linking the most relevant data with expanded analytic capabilities; two, investing in vertical expertise to drive unparalleled insights; three, focusing on customer experience through optimized enterprise distribution; and four, diversifying portfolio growth across the value chain. An interesting point is that almost 60% of the anticipated 3-year NPI revenue is focused on opportunities beyond the more traditional credit risk solutions that you know us for. 
Finally, this week, we announced a very exciting opportunity for Fannie Mae, you may have read that. Fannie Mae will begin incorporating Equifax trended data in addition to our verified employment and income on The Work Number database. The trended data provides new insights to lenders by expanding the credit information to aid their assessment of risk using updated analytical tools. Integrating The Work Number into Fannie Mae's underwriting system will make the process simpler for consumers and reduce potential for fraud. We believe this will be a win-win for the consumers as well as the mortgage industry. 
There's more to be done on our side. And as a result, the revenue opportunity is expected to start sometime in the second or third quarter of next year. It will be a nice impact for both USIS and EWS. USIS is having an outstanding year in 2015. For the full year, we expect them to deliver double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%.
On to International, they delivered 14% local currency revenue growth leveraging the diversity in its core customer verticals, New Product Innovation and unique platforms in decisioning, fraud and debt management. As you know, we're now in the midst of starting up the U.K. government project that we talked to you about now for a few quarters. We have provided Equifax consumer data to one government agency and have now received approximately GBP 265 million of past due receivables that we're now loading and analyzing and will soon move on to the collection agencies. As we've mentioned before, we expect nominal revenue growth in the fourth quarter this year, and we expect that to ramp up nicely in 2016. In summary, as it relates to that project, it is on track, on pace and meeting our expectations.
In addition, we are currently exceeding our expectations for the TDX business in places like Australia. And we're launching that platform across many other countries throughout the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. And in fact, it's worthy of making a point here, as you think about the TDX platform, the debt management platform in 2016, it will then be dispersed through multiple countries as opposed to one central P&L that you're used to seeing or can see like we talked about in the U.K. 
Also in International, New Product Innovation continues to be a very important contributor to International's long-term growth. Their focus is in areas of analytical insights, enhanced decision solutions, new verticals and distribution channels and broadening their data assets. Revenue in international's 3 largest verticals: financial institutions, telcos and SMEs, grew 17% in the third quarter versus a healthy 13% in the second quarter of 2015. The decisioning platforms, our analytical services and our debt management revenue grew 19% in the quarter, accelerating from 17% in the second quarter of the year. In 2015, International successfully executed on its strategic initiatives and captured some very important business opportunities that will transform and further broaden its growth profile in the coming years. For the full year, we expect International revenue growth to be above their long-term range that we've talked about of 7% to 10% growth.
Workforce Solutions, which just had a stellar performance, which I think you'll agree, for the year, grew 13% revenue from its continued traction in its compliance solution products, broadening market penetration for verification of employment and income and some very sophisticated analytical insights. Employer interest in our workforce analytic solutions for the Affordable Care Act remains extremely strong. Our subscription-based ACA platform solution, which enables companies to better understand their level of compliance with the requirements of ACA, is one of our most successful NPI initiatives in my 10 years here. We're now expecting to have over 700 clients by the end of this year and we're still getting a large number of interest -- inbound request, which bodes well for EWS and the Employer Services business within EWS for 2016 and beyond.
In addition to our core product offering focused on compliance, we're also exploring other opportunities that will enable us to address evolving market needs including fines and penalties under the act and any related appeals that follow. We believe this will further enhance our position in the marketplace and make us an even more valuable partner to our good customers. New Product Innovation continues to make a very meaningful contribution to revenue growth for EWS. We now expect to end the year with a vitality index of over 11% versus our target of 10% at the beginning of the year. 
Earlier this week, EWS was honored for the second year in a row with the product of the year award by the editors of Human Resource Magazine Resource Magazine. Our I-9 anywhere product is a cutting-edge service that enables organizations to streamline their form I-9 integration form completion process using remote entry for applicants. We're also exceeding our year-to-date targets for both active and historical records in The Work Number database, and expect to end the year over our full year targets. Verification Services growth was in excess of 20% and continues to be driven by adding records to The Work Number database and strong growth in key market verticals including auto, mortgage, consumer finance, government and preemployment.
Workforce Solutions has an outstanding year in 2015 by almost any measure, driving very healthy double-digit revenue growth across multiple product offerings. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper teens and operating margins to settle in the upper 30s.
Against the backdrop of a changing operating environment, PSOL is consistently delivering growth in the upper end of the multiyear target range of 4% to 6%. We continue to make good progress in key metrics for our direct-to-consumer product offerings. In indirect, we have a broad and diverse set of opportunities in the pipeline, much of which is outside of the banking sector. We expect indirect to make meaningful contributions to other growth, again, in 2016. And we continue to generate good growth in our International segments. As you know, that includes Canada and the U.K. Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. was largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the quarter. For the full year, we expect Personal Solutions organic revenue growth to be within their long-term range of 4% to 6% with healthy operating margins in the upper 20s. 
Let me transition back, just for a second, to a few highlights that we talked about in the past at the corporate level rather than the BU level, and those are NPI and EGI. They continue to make very important contributions to our long-term growth model, provide strong discipline around the allocation of both financial and human capital resources, enabling us to execute with precision. Year-to-date, our new product pipeline is expected to deliver 3-year revenue as 50% greater than the 2014 pipeline. 
As I mentioned earlier in my comments, that this is probably the strongest I've seen since I've been here in 10 years. And that bodes well, obviously, for 2016 and beyond. All of our enterprise growth initiatives leverage our operating and project management disciplines. These disciplines ensure that we'll develop effective plans through execution and then deliver on the goals we set for ourselves. Our current view for our 2015 portfolio of EGI projects suggests that we'll exceed our full year target by almost 20%. And much like NPI, EGI is becoming a big part of our DNA in every geography and vertical in which we operate. 
Our insight driven strategy, the global strategy, is heavily dependent upon having contemporary IT platforms that can be implemented globally. In the past, you've heard us talk about interconnect platforms that was first developed in the U.S. and is now used in Canada, U.K. and Latin America. We're now in the process of taking a fraud platforming exchange that was originally deployed in U.K. and successfully deployed in Canada a few years ago, and expanding now into the U.S. and across Latin America. This solution provides advanced analytics and workflow as well as a known product strength -- exchange focused primarily on account opening process. 
The skills and project management expertise in our global operations COE is widely regarded and respected internally and by our customers. This organization was heavily involved in standing up the U.K. government opportunity for TDX, ensuring that we successfully met all of our contractual obligations while positioning us to deliver performance, above the portfolio of thresholds and for collection effectiveness. More recently, we have conducted a number of customer journeys while we work directly with customers on the end-to-end process with the objective of improving both the cost effectiveness of our interactions and importantly, their overall experience with us.
By now I'm sure you're all interested in update on our offer to acquire the Veda Group in Australia. I'll share a few thoughts with you there. We believe this opportunity is a nice strategic fit for Equifax and expands our geographic footprint in the core segment that we know very well. Veda is a strong market -- has a strong market position, great products and data assets. They're very profitable and they give us a strong management team in Asia. We believe Equifax's strength in advanced analytics, enterprise growth initiative, New Product Innovation and others, can act to make Veda even stronger. 
We're currently in the early process for Veda. And at this point, our agreements with Veda include a purchase price of AUD 2.825. They're nonbinding. As you can appreciate the transaction this size, we'll take considerable time to negotiate and finalize. We plan to conduct our usual thorough and disciplined due diligence. Simultaneously, we will negotiate the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement. Subject to successful completion of these steps, we would anticipate signing a binding agreement later this year. 
The final transaction is subject to the approval of the respected Boards of Directors, regulatory approval in Australia as well as Veda shareholders' approval. If the transaction ultimately goes forward, we anticipate completion sometime between late February and early April of 2016. At this point, I'm very confident in our ability to effectively integrate Veda should we have the opportunity to do so. 
2015 is turning out to be the strongest performance in my time with the company. As many of you know, we started the journey of transforming Equifax into a global leader in Information Solutions back in 2005. I believe we can say we have successfully transformed the culture, thoughtfully invested our capital to support that vision, strengthened our talent base while continuously honoring our commitments to our shareholders, customers, employees and consumers. I remain optimistic about the opportunities we have for growth in 2016 and beyond.
And with that, let me turn it over to John. John?"

As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded income of $12 million from settlement of certain escrow amounts related to an acquisition outside of the measurement period. We also recorded an expense of $8 million related to the settlement of certain specific legal claims. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded these items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The after-tax effect of these 2 unusual items was positive $0.05 a share.
Now let me turn to the business unit’s financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $312 million, up 12% when compared to the third quarter of 2014, another very strong quarter for USIS. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 13% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 12% compared to Q3 2014. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 20% in the quarter and mortgage-related revenue for the total company was up 24%. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 17% in the second quarter. We currently expect total mortgage originations in the fourth quarter to be down year-over-year. For 2016, our current outlook is for mortgage originations to be about flat when compared to the full year of 2015.
On to Financial Marketing Services where revenue was $47 million, up 6% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.9%, up from 40.3% in the third quarter of 2014. Internationals revenue was $149 million, flat on a reported basis but up 14% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $64 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars but up 16% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $52 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 20% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 13% in U.S. dollars but up 5% in local currency. 
For the third quarter, International's operating margin was about 20%, which is flat when compared to the second quarter of 2015. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect International operating margins to remain at about 20% throughout 2015. We expect margins to increase throughout 2016, reflecting continued strong local currency revenue growth including TDX that the U.K. government contract begins to contribute as well as the benefits of regionalization and other costs actions.
Workforce Solutions revenue was $139 million for the quarter, up 13% when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Growth for Workforce Solutions at 13% was very strong and continue to be above our long-term model of 7% to 10%. This reflects continued very strong growth in Verification Services, up 22% year-to-year. The solid growth also reflects the following: Employer Services revenue, principally from unemployment claims, compensation claims, work opportunity tax credit and other related Employer Services, declined slightly year-to-year. This reflects the continued very low levels of U.S. unemployment as well as the timing of federal WOTC authorizations in 1Q '15. Our Workforce Analytics solution for ACA compliance, which is part of our Employer Services business, continues to perform well ahead of our expectations, as Rick mentioned earlier, and now has 700-plus clients in various stages of boarding preparing for 2016 ACA reporting. 
However, as this is a subscription-based service in which the boarding services are offered as part of the service, all of the revenue associated with boarding and subscription service fees, prior to customer production go-live, is deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the agreement. As such, despite tremendous growth in customers and activity in the second half of 15, revenue realization will not begin until very late in 2015 and principally, 2016. Long term, we believe the subscription-based model will be greatly beneficial both in terms of customer retention and revenue predictability. It's also additive to our expectations that Workforce Solutions will continue to grow faster than our long-term 7% to 10% model. In the remainder of 2015, it will put pressure on Employer Services growth rates. In 3Q, overall Employer Services activity was more heavily skewed to ACA compliance. And that revenue was deferred, and as we indicated, deferred until very late 2015 and predominantly 2016. 
The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 35.9%, up almost 350 basis points from 3Q '14. Workforce Solutions continues to make great progress toward achieving margins consistently near 40%. Personal Solutions revenue was $67 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the third quarter, operating margin was 26.9%, consistent with our long-term expectation for operating margins to be in the upper 20s. The year-over-year decline in operating margin is primarily driven by marketing spend at levels more consistent with our long-term expectations. 
In the third quarter, general corporate expense at $47 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be up slightly from the $47 million in 3Q '15. The adjusted operating margin at 27.2% was up from 26.4% in 2014 and in line with our expectations for the quarter. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.8%. This was benefited by 1.8 percentage points by the very low tax rate on the income from the settlement of the escrow we discussed earlier. Both the income from the settlement of the escrow and the related tax expense was excluded from our adjusted EPS. Excluding this 1.8 percentage point benefit, our 3Q effective tax rate was slightly higher than our effective tax rate of 32.5% in 3Q '14 and approximately consistent with the guidance we gave for the third quarter. It was also consistent with the historical pattern of our third quarter effective tax rate being below the effective tax rate for the year. Our current expectation for the effective tax rate for the full year is to be slightly less than 34%. 
Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $247 million. With pending M&A activity, we reduced our level of stock repurchases in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million and year-to-date, were $94 million. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $120 million to $125 million. This is above the approximately $100 million we discussed at the beginning of 2015. To support our continued acceleration in enterprise growth and new product innovation initiatives, we've accelerated our investments in global analytics, decisioning, broaden exchange platforms and supporting network and data center infrastructure as well as internal systems. We are confident these investments will support both revenue growth and margin enhancement. At this level of investment, our capital spending continues to be at a modest 5% of revenue.
Earlier, Rick gave you an update on our proposal to acquire the Veda Group. This would be Equifax's largest acquisition in its history. And given the size of the acquisition and the upfront cost associated with the transaction and its integration, we will be excluding all acquisition-specific transaction and due diligence expense as well as integration expenses incurred in the first 12 months following the closure of the acquisition from our adjusted EPS.
Now let me turn it back to Rick."

For the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and partially offset by 2% of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in",625,"Thanks, John. For the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and partially offset by 2% of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in July that the fourth quarter organic growth would be at the high end of our long-term range, which we talked about being 6% to 8% growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.12, which is up 8% -- 8% to 10% for the quarter. Excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the quarter. 
Our year-to-date performance results -- our strong year-to-date performance results in an increase of our full year guidance combined with our outlook for the fourth quarter 2015 represents an outstanding year for our shareholders, our customers, employees and consumers. And for the full year, we expect 2015 revenue to be somewhere between $2.652 billion and $2.662 billion consistent with our guidance in July and up nicely from our guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion at the beginning of the year, and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of a healthy 12% for 2015. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by 3% negative impact from FX. As before, this is only organic revenue growth and we'll talk more about it next year while getting back into the M&A game. 
As we expect, the operating margin to be somewhere in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the full year, which is up a nice 80 basis points over 2014. 2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.46 to $4.48 per share, up from the $4.38 to $4.42 per share we've guided in July, and up significantly from the $4.20 to $4.30 per share guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. That growth reflects -- that reflects a 15% growth in EPS for the year. On constant currency basis, excluding $0.11 per share of negative impact from FX at current rates, this reflects a very strong 17% to 18% growth for the year compared to 11% growth in 2014.
Now it's early, but I thought I'd give you some color on how we're thinking about 2016. And as we always do, we'll come back to give you a lot more clarity and depth on the February earnings call. As we sit here today and look at 2016, we fully expect to be towards the upper end of our organic growth target range, which is 6% to 8%, with additional growth coming from successful completion of our current M&A activities. Our model that we've communicated to you and committed to you is to add, over time, 1 to 2 points of growth coming from inorganic growth. If you exclude Veda, because of the size of that, our pipeline is strong. We clearly see contributing to our organic growth of 6% to 8%, an incremental 1 to 2 points coming from M&A, Veda will be incremental with that 1 to 2 points. 
We also expect operating margins in 2016 when you exclude the impact of acquisitions to expand nicely, given the higher growth expectations we have. And this is against the backdrop of an outstanding organic growth rate in 2015. So -- and we also expect, as John said, the mortgage market to be relatively flat in 2016. So in summary, I think you'll agree 2015 is shaping up to be yet another outstanding year for the team. And 2016, where we sit today, we're expecting another outstanding year in 2016. 
So operator, with that, we'd like to open up to any questions our audience may have."

I'm not going to give you an exact number, but trust it will be meaningful for us at the BU level. Two, if you think of trended data in general terms, I think maybe 2 years ago, we started talking to you about trended data and there was an interest in getting a historical look versus a snapshot look. And the first thing we did is build the capabilities for our batch offline, we called it internally CMS, and that ramped up nicely. We then through a technology investment we made in USIS, and recently brought that capability to go online, and that's now ramping up nicely. And I'm also very, very intrigued with the concept on trended data that bringing that, we're looking at it now, is a technology requirement as well. Bringing EWS the concept of taking one of the many different attributes we have in The Work Number database, that attribute being income and showing an underwriter, a marketer, whoever, a historical look, a trended look at their income intellectually excites myself and the team.

We're integrating a big acquisition for that BU, investing heavily in the U.K. business unit, U.K. government opportunity we talked about. We're also, as John and I alluded to in our comments, investing heavily in technology analytics and platforms around the international operations to fuel growth short, medium and long term. So I -- we clearly expect 2015, the drop in margins that start to ramp up nicely in 2016 and beyond. Will they get back to 29%? There's one caveat for that. I think they can over time, but I can't tell you what period of time, is the team is working diligently now to regionalize big pockets of costs within international, and that requires technology investments to take things from countries to regions and so on and so forth. That will be a big benefactor.

We spent a lot of time thinking about that strategically and many do refer to that, that ecosystem is evolving as you had this peer-to-peer. I'd like to think of it as more kind of remote lending -- unsecured remote lending rather than peer-to-peer, because it tends to be a bank involved in many cases when you're looking at a lending club or Green Sky [ph] or business credit or others. One point -- point one, I think that, that is a marketplace that will exist -- I think it's a disruptive marketplace for the traditional banking sector. The banks may or may not choose to participate themselves in it, but I think it's here to stay. I think it's got good momentum, good legs. As you've mentioned before, they are a user of our data today. They -- and use both the verification employment and income database many times as well as core credit file and credit scores, and we expect that to continue going forward. So right now, I view that as being yet another -- if that sector can allow maybe other people to get access to credit who couldn't get credit in the normal system that's incremental to us, if that's just displacement of bank would underwrite today, I see it as a nonevent for us. The bigger question we're thinking about strategically is how else can we play in that ecosystem? That, and truly in 5, 10 years is a big robust part of the market and how do we participate in the market, we're looking at it right now."

In spite of what you're talking about and kind of investing in and ACA standing up with revenue being a subscription model, which is earned out over a period of time. Secondly, and more importantly is, John alluded to in his prepared comments that this business is on a path to 40%-plus margins. And so I think you put it in context on where it's come from and where it's going, the incremental impact drag or otherwise of ACA is a nonevent. John, maybe you want to add to that?"

So as we gave an early look at revenue of 6% to 8% organically next year is with the expectation of mortgage being in that range. And once again, our team, being EWS and USIS, performing at levels greater than that last year, and as you know by market penetration and new product introduction in the mortgage market. So that's how we think about 2016. John, is -- do you want to add that?"

One, notice that we have -- Shlomo, we've known each other for a number of years and you know our philosophy on acquisitions, so this won't surprise maybe the rest of you or you, all right? We have been talking with Veda now where it dates back maybe 4 years, so it's not like this thing just dropped out of the sky one day when we said this going to be an interesting acquisition. It's been an organization that we've tried to get to know each other for quite some time. Two, philosophically, it's important to know that when we think of acquisitions in Equifax, we are driven by a view of what we can bring to that company that makes that company even better, rather than what does that company bring to us that makes Equifax better? I think studies will show and as the many studies with many consultants, when you take the path of how they help you as a core business, you oftentimes fail. So with that -- having said that, other than the geographical footprint, I think what we can bring there is some of the processes and capabilities that have made Equifax successful the last 10 years in the countries that we operate now, things like our LEAN process, things like LEAN as the customer, things like NPI, things like EGI and price growth initiatives, our Cambrian technology platform, which is fabulous. And as you know, and we've been investing enough for a number of years, bringing that platform to the countries in which they operate to link together unstructured Internet data, if you will, third-party customer data and our data and build more products than we could build in the past. I think that's a great capability, so it's really deploying some of the things you know so well, Shlomo, that we can put here into their footprint. And I do think that over time and one of the things that we'll have to determine is clearly not baked into any pro forma assumptions that we have now. Over time, if we have a really good business in that part of the world, we've got really good people which they do, our ability to think about expanding to other geographies now that the 2 businesses are much bigger business doing a lot more EBITDA, it makes some investments organically and inorganically. I think when you're closer to those geographies, I want to make those bets. Sitting here in Atlanta, Georgia, trying to think about making investments in midsized countries around Southeast Asia as the hub is a risk I'm not willing to take, but we've got a good footprint in Australia, New Zealand, and a few other countries. That's a risk we're willing to take as a company, and that would evolve over the next few years."

Foreign exchange has gone from roughly 1.1: 1-point something to 1:0.68 to 0.72, 0.73:1. There is the legislation that is passed into law, the move from just using negative data to positive data, and I think you understand there's been studies in all over the world by the IMF and others to talk about how that catalyzes risk-based pricing, risk-based pricing catalyzes growth of lending. That may be a multiyear look that's going to happen eventually. So -- and maybe last point is we've bought TDX roughly 2 years ago, and we've delevered from TDX.
