Teradata finished the fourth quarter with revenue of $761 million, which was down 1% from prior year and was lower than we had anticipated mainly due to currency. Revenue in constant currency was up 3% over prior",1627,"Thanks, Gregg, and good morning, everyone. Teradata finished the fourth quarter with revenue of $761 million, which was down 1% from prior year and was lower than we had anticipated mainly due to currency. Revenue in constant currency was up 3% over prior year, which was roughly in line with what we were expecting. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.91 was up 3% over prior year, despite the unfavorable impact of currency.  For the full year, revenue growth of 3% constant currency and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.86 were both in line with our guidance.
We had another excellent quarter for adding new data warehouse customers. We set a record in Q4 and for the year, it was our second highest ever. The strength of our new customer wins during the past couple of years has been driven by our investments to go broader in the market and to expand our analytics portfolio, which now includes our IDW, our Data Warehouse Appliances, Aster, Hadoop and the Teradata Cloud.
Turning to the regions. The Americas' Q4 revenue of $456 million was down 2% from prior year and down 1% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was down 1% as reported and flat in constant currency. We saw some improvements with the Americas top 50 customers in 2014. Revenue only declined 4% versus the 11% decline in 2013.  Furthermore, we grew 3% in the top 50 outside of our financial services customers. After driving the highest growth of any industry by far in the Americas from 2010 to 2013, Financial Services revenue declined as expected in 2014.
The Americas had a strong quarter adding new data warehouse customers with Q4 wins being the second highest ever for a fourth quarter. Wins included a leading U.S. health services company, which chose our Teradata Cloud to deliver analytics to their Fortune 500 customers.
One of North America's largest commercial real estate companies also selected our Teradata Cloud. Community Health Systems, one of the largest U.S. hospital groups, selected Teradata to integrate financial data from its many acquisitions into an IDW.
And we added another state government, which is using Teradata to discover unrecognized revenue and to increase tax collections.
Significant upgrades and expansions included, TIAA Aircraft, which added Aster and Hadoop to its Unified Data Architecture for Big Data Analytics. One of the top U.S. cable operators had Aster, Hadoop and Teradata loom for advanced advertising analytics. And one of our airline customers added an IDW.
Turning to our international region. Q4 revenue of $305 million was flat as reported compared to prior year, but it was up 8% in constant currency. For the full year, international revenue was up 5% as reported and up 8% in constant currency. International had another record quarter for new data warehouse customer wins and set a record for new customer wins for the year.
Wins in the fourth quarter included one of the world's largest biotech companies, which is using Teradata to support analytics on real-world data outside of clinical trials. A top telco in China, which chose Aster for its social connections analytic platform. One of the world's largest auto manufacturers that purchased Teradata for cross departmental data analytics, warranty analysis and predictive maintenance. Management located in the Netherlands is implementing Teradata Appliances, Teradata Analytics for SAP and our marketing applications for its customer loyalty programs. And Insurance Group in Hong Kong is using Teradata to integrate centralize insurance, banking and securities data to support its rapid business expansion.
Significant upgrades and expansions included, Metro Group, a top global retailer, added Aster as a recommendation engine to its GDA to support marketing automation. Westpac Banking had Hadoop to its GDA. And one of the world's largest telcos, which is an IDW customer, is consolidating 7 different marketing systems into our Integrated Marketing cloud to enable its marketers and their agencies to better control and manage their marketing efforts.
In 2014, our Aster, Hadoop, UDA and related services had strong revenue growth. And we grew the number of customers using Aster by right around 50%. However, our overall Big Data Analytics revenue, which includes the 1000 Series appliance, came in at $80 million, which was short of our $100 million target for 2014. This is due to the timing of some larger 1000 Series deals. We are looking for strong, Big Data Analytics growth in 2015.
We strengthened our Big Data Analytics portfolio in 2014 through M&As, such as with the acquisitions of Rain Store, Revelytix, Hadapt and Think Big Analytics. And we've been adding to our Big Data Analytics portfolio through investments in R&D with innovations such as Prairie Grid, Craft, Machine Learning, Tax Analytics and more. We have also broadened our strategic partnerships, which now includes Hortonworks, Cloudera and MongoDB.
Now that many of the leading companies have worked with Hadoop and the broader analytical ecosystem, there's now, generally speaking, a more pragmatic lien the marketplace about the capabilities of all these various technologies. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the cost and the complexities of managing the analytic ecosystem.
Our UDA is key to simplifying the architecture, the management of multiple systems and minimizing the costs and complexities. It is also clear, the IDW will play a key role in the analytic ecosystem going forward. This week, the Information Difference Annual Data of Warehousing Landscape report grant Teradata the strongest overall technology in 2014 and noted that our customers were ranked the happiest of those survey.
Going forward, we will continue to enhance our data warehouse technologies, our UDA capabilities and to add to our Big Data Analytics portfolio.
Turning to our Applications business. We finished the year with revenue of $244 million and recurring revenue growth of only 2%. We are not happy with these results. On the one hand, we have done a pretty good job selling into our existing data warehouse customer base where most of these are larger enterprise customers that have been implementing our on-premise applications. On the other hand, we have not been focusing in investing at the appropriate levels to take advantage of the faster growing Integrated Marketing Cloud opportunity that we have in the broader market.
To better address this opportunity, we created an integrated business unit for our marketing applications at the start of the year that now includes R&D, sales, marketing, consulting and services. In addition, we moved our non-marketing applications to Teradata Labs so we can make this business 100% focused on marketing applications. We believe this will enable us to have a better focus and alignment for operational decisions and execution and also for longer-term strategic decision-making. This in turn will help us to better serve our customers and to grow our revenues.  We will continue to increase our marketing demand creation investments to reach the broader market that we started last year. 
We're already generating significantly higher leads and expect this to convert to higher orders and revenue over time. And the continue to increase our R&D investments for our marketing cloud as well as add capabilities through M&As.
In Q4, we acquired the mobile marketing provider, Apoxy, which provides us with mobile push capabilities. And earlier this year, we acquired a social media monitoring company as well as the digital marketing consultancy.
The good news is that we have leaving marketing application solutions as evidenced by the various industry analyst reports and we continue to enhance them. Just this week, Gartner again named Teradata as the leader in marketing resource management, noting our broad and deep solution, the advanced maturity of our MRM customers, our focus on client value and our continued market traction.
In 2014, we made good progress with our Teradata Analytics Cloud. In the fourth quarter, we added our first customers in Canada, Latin America and in the U.K. Teradata provides a wide range of cloud analytics solutions from a fully functional IDW to a warehouse, to Discovery Analytics with Aster and Hadoop, to doing specific functions such as disaster recovery and test and development.
Turning to guidance. Given the currency and other headwinds, we are expecting revenue growth as reported to be flat to down 2% in 2015 and up 3% to 5% in constant currency at this point in time. Currency is estimated to have a negative 5% impact on revenue or about $130 million. And we expect a 1% to 2% revenue headwind as we continue to grow our Teradata Cloud and our subscription revenue. 
Our recent top 50 customer survey for 2015 showed that the vast majority of overall IT budgets will be flat or down again this year with security and mobile being top spending priorities. In addition, we are expecting to slow start in 2015 with a revenue decline in Q1, due to currency and also going against the most challenging prior year quarter comparable. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 for 2015, which reflects an estimated $0.22 impact from currency.
2015 will be a year of investment. We are increasing investments by about $50 million, primarily aimed at our high revenue growth opportunities, big Data Analytics, marketing applications and our Teradata Analytics Cloud.
These investments really focus on R&D and demand creation to reach the broader market for all of our solutions. Since the majority of the revenue in these high-growth markets is subscription and services, we will not see a meaningful impact on revenue growth in 2015. So short term, these investments will be impacting our profitability and our earnings per share in 2015, but should meet the higher revenue growth and higher earnings per share in 2016 and beyond.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide more financial details."

Fourth quarter product revenue of $360 million was down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, down 1% in constant currency. For the full year, product revenue was flat, up 1% in constant currency. In the quarter, services rev",2075,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Fourth quarter product revenue of $360 million was down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, down 1% in constant currency. For the full year, product revenue was flat, up 1% in constant currency. In the quarter, services revenue of $401 million was up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2013 and up 6% in constant currency. For the full year, Services revenue is up 3%, up 5% in constant currency. 
Within Services revenue, in the quarter, Consulting Services revenue was $225 million, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2013, up 5% in constant currency. Maintenance Services revenues was $176 million, which was up 2% from Q4 2013 and up 6% in constant currency. For the full year, consulting services was flat, but up 2% in constant currency and maintenance revenue was up 7%, up 8% in constant currency.
Overall, currency created a 4-point headwind on the reported revenue growth for the quarter, which was 2 points higher than what we have previously assumed.  For the Full year, currency created a 2-point headwind, which is twice as much as the 1 percentage point impact we expected on our full year results when we provided our commentary at the time we announced our third quarter results. Not only does the currency have a meaningfully back on our year-over-year revenue comparisons, but it also negatively impacted our profitability as approximately 1/3 of the currency impact on revenue hits our operating income.
At this time, I'll provide color on the global 2014 revenue contribution by industry vertical to our Data Warehouse, Big Data and Consulting Services revenue. These contributions do not include maintenance or applications revenue.
The following significant industry verticals contributed the same percentage of revenue in 2014 and 2013. Financial services 31%, communications 19%. Retail 14% and manufacturing 13%. With respect to the other industries, healthcare contributes 6% of our revenue versus 8% in 2013. Government was 7% of our revenue, up from 6% in 2013. Travel and transportation also contributed approximately 7%, up from 6% in 2013. Energy and utilities generated a little more than 1% of revenue in each year, while other accounted for the remaining 2% in both years.
In terms of year-over-year revenue change, all industries are up 1% to down 3%, except travel and transportation up 20%, government up 14%, energy and utilities up 8%, and healthcare down 17%.
During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based composition and other special items. 
Product gross margin in the fourth quarter returned to the mid-60s as anticipated, specifically 65.8% compared to last year's Q4 product margin of 68.5%. The primary drivers of the change were deal mix and product mix. For the full year, product gross margin was 65.2% compared to 66.2% in 2013. The lower margin in 2014 was primarily the net result of increased FAS 86 amortization. Services gross margin in the quarter was 48.9%, up 200 basis points from the 46.9% in Q4 2013. The increase was driven by improved maintenance and consulting yields.
Services gross margin for the full year was 47.6%, similar to last year's 47.5%. Overall gross margin was 56.9% in the fourth quarter versus 57.3% in the fourth quarter 2013. For the full year, gross margin was 55.5% compared to 56% in 2013, the net decrease was largely due to the increase amortization of FAS 86. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $198 million was only $1 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year, SG&A was $715 million, a modest 2% increase from the 2013 level. Research and development expense in the quarter was $48 million, up $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. For the year, R&D increased 9% to $180 million. For both the quarter and the full year, the increase in R&D expense was primarily due to additional investments, including acquisitions in our Big Data and Marketing Analytics Solutions.
Total R&D spend for the fourth quarter, which includes the R&D expense just described, plus the additions to capitalize software costs from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally developed software was $64 million. This compared to $60 million in Q4 2013. Year-to-date, total R&D spend was $248 million or 20% of our product revenue versus $237 million in 2013.
As a reminder, this capitalized costs when amortized are classified in the income statement as product cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin.
As a result of these items, operating margin for the quarter was 24.6% versus 26.7% in Q4 2013. For the full year, operating margin was 22.7% versus 23.8% in 2013.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.1% versus 29.4% for the same period in 2013. The difference was due to a higher proportion of foreign pretax earnings in 2014 versus the prior year period and the $4 million discrete tax benefit for the retroactive restatement of the 2014 U.S. federal research and development tax credit recognized during the fourth quarter of 2014. 
The full year 2014 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27.2%, a point lower than the 2013 tax rate, due to higher proportion of foreign pretax earnings in 2014 versus the prior period.
Looking forward, for 2015, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27% to 28%, with the actual rate being heavily dependent on our earnings mix. In addition, both tax rates presume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be reinstated in 2015. However, our quarterly effective tax rates will be negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points until such time the credit is reinstated.
In terms of earnings per share. Our Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.77 compared to $0.68 in Q4 2013. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $22 million or $0.14 in the quarter, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.91 compared to $0.88 in Q4 2013.
For the full year, GAAP EPS was $2.33 compared to $2.27 in 2013. Stock-based compensation and other special items negatively impacted our full year GAAP net income by $85 million or $0.53 per share in 2014 versus $82 million or $0.49 per share in 2013.  Adjusting for these items, 2014 full year non-GAAP EPS was $2.86 versus $2.76 in 2013. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in Q4 was better than expected at $97 million in Q4 2013. This was a meaningful increase over the $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The strong cash flow performance was primarily due to net changes in accounts receivable due to timing of collections.
After $35 million of capital expenditures, which include additions of capitalized software development cost and expenditures for property and equipment versus $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, we generated $62 million of free cash flow versus the $25 million of free cash flow generated in Q4 2013. 
Free cash flow in 2014 was $551 million versus $372 million in 2013. The timing of accounts receivable collections led to the higher free cash flow versus 2013.
Going forward, due to the expected differences between free cash flow and net income such as stock-based compensation and acquired intangible amortization, we now expect full year free cash flow to be within our range that is up $250 million higher than GAAP net income.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $834 million of cash as of December 31, 2014, up $139 million from December 31, 2013. Of this balance, over 90% is held offshore. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares for $268 million. For 2014, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares of our stock for $560 million.
To fund a portion of these share repurchases in the fourth quarter, we drew down $220 million on our credit facility as of 12/31/2014. As of December 31, 2014, we have approximately $394 million of share repurchase authorization remaining available for additional share repurchases. Additionally, we repurchased 2.1 million shares in the first quarter of 2015 at a cost of $92 million. As a result, we have now approximately $300 million of share repurchases authorization remaining.
We also used approximately $20 million for tuck-in acquisitions during the quarter, $69 million during the year. With respect to accounts receivable, Accounts Receivable decreased $98 million in Q4 2014 versus Q4 2013. Day sales outstanding was 83 days as of December 31, 2014, compared to 97 days at December 31, 2013. And finally, total deferred revenue was $388 million as of December 31, 2014, which was down $27 million from December 31, 2013.
As I transition into the guidance discussion, I just want to highlight a few items. As the market and our business continues to evolve, we are stepping up our investments in our Big Data Analytics and application businesses in 2015. We expect to increase our investments by approximately $50 million during the year in various aspects of our business, which should lead to an improving situation in 2016. Even though our operating income and EPS will be negatively impacted in 2015 by these investments, we expect revenue, operating income, recurring revenue and EPS to see improvement in 2016 and beyond.
However, for 2015, as it relates to currency, assuming the currency exchange rates as of January 30, we expect currency to create a 5% headwind to our full year revenue comparisons in 2015 with also a 5% headwind in Q1 2015.
As it relates to revenue, we expect reported revenue to grow in the range of minus 2% to 0% or 3% to 5% when measured in constant currency. This would translate into a full year reported revenue in the approximate range of $2.677 billion to $2.732 billion. Of course, finally in terms of EPS, we expect GAAP EPS in the $1.91 to $2.11 range, which translates to $2.50 to $2.70 on a non-GAAP basis when excluding stock-based compensation expense and special items. Currency is obviously having a big impact on many U.S. based companies that have a high percentage of their business internationally. For Teradata, approximately half our business is done outside of the U.S. 
As a result of the currency impact we see on our top line revenue growth, we expect about 1/3 will flow through the impact operating income. If you adjust for currency, our 2015 constant currency non-GAAP EPS would be in the $2.72 to $2.92 range. However, to reiterate, our non-GAAP reported EPS guidance range for 2015 is $2.50 to $2.70.
Other specific items impacting our 2015 guidance include the following: One, decrease in FAS 86 capitalization of $5 billion to $10 million incurring in 2015, especially pronounced in the first part of the year with $7 million decrease expected in Q1. As a reminder, decreased FAS 86 to capitalization has the effect of increasing the amount of R&D expense reported on the income statement. 
Second, increasing incentive variable compensation cost due to not achieving our bonus thresholds in 2014, but assuming in our plan we reached the thresholds in 2015, thereby creating an increase in incentive comp of approximately $30 million. 
Third, full year GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 26% and non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 27% to 28% and is heavily dependent upon earnings mix. In addition, both rates presume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be reinstated in 2015, however, until such time the credit is officially reenacted, our effective tax rate for each quarter will be negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points.
Fourth, weighted average shares outstanding for the full year is expected approximately $146 million, but naturally higher in Q1. And finally, specifically as it relates to Q1 2015, we expect reported revenue to decline as our international region will face an approximately 13 point currency headwind in our Americas region compares against an 8% growth rate in Q1 2013. As a result of these factors, we anticipate our Q1 revenue mix and including our increased expenses, operating income will be significantly below Q1 2013's results. 
In closing, we are proactively investing in our businesses, including stepped-up R&D initiatives, sales support and demand creation resources for both our Data Warehouse, Analytics business as well as our Applications business in order to drive future revenue growth and further enhance our technology leadership position. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

Basically, when we look at 2015, there are a couple of additional headwinds such as our Cloud and Subscription business for our Data Warehouse Analytic business will continue to grow and have an impact of percentage point or 2 points on growth. We see improvement in 2014 in a good trend in the top 50. We feel we're in the Americas, we feel we're pretty stable there. We basically have a lot of good things going if you look at it going into 2015. So we actually -- we have the guidance at 3% to 5%. You could look at it outside of some headwinds of transitioning some of the business to subscription and cloud. We're looking at 4% to 6%. And I think the more difficult thing when you look at the 3% to 5% guidance is we're making the investments and we're playing offense in a very difficult environment and those investments are going in to our high-growth opportunities, which are Big Data Analytics or applications business and our cloud, which basically is more of a subscription model. The bulk of the revenue is in a subscription model and we kind of recoup the revenue over 3 years. So we can't move the dial a lot in 2015, but what we're looking at doing is building up our recurring revenue file for all those businesses during the year and exit the year with a larger increase in our annual recurring revenue final value that will set the stage in 2016 for further growth. So just to make sure on being a little clear, we're making investments in something where the revenue come slower, but we're going to build up the file value of it in 2015, which will benefit us in 2016."

So that's how we modeled 2015. Regarding the top 50 stabilizing, I do think we have a good shot that the top 50 could be flat and stabilized in 2015. I'm not exactly counting on it, but I do think this there's a good opportunity that it could be flat or it could even grow in 2015. I think your last question, Wamsi, was around the Big Data revenue of which we missed this year, finished at $80 million. There, we have a target for 2015 of about $150 million in revenue. So in that neighborhood of $150 million in revenue. And I believe that's a very reasonable target and we could come up plus or minus $10 million, but we've got our sights at $150 million."

But from a product gross margin side, this year, we had about 100 basis points impact on our product gross margin due to the FAS 86. I see a 50 basis point headwind on that in '15. So product gross margins, we finished the year at about 65 plus. We could be in that plus or minus at 65 range of that FAS 86 headwind for product gross margin. On the services gross margin, that's where our Big Data consulting Think Big is captured. We're going to, as Mike indicated, continue to make investments in that capability from a cost side. So the services gross margin, we finished probably around 47.5% for the year, we could be down because of those investments, 100 basis points, really focused on that Think Big consulting resources expenses, which gets captured, reflected in our services gross margin. So if you look at the overall gross margin, you could see we're basically at 55.5% for the year. We could be down under that, call it 100 basis points plus because of those investments on Think Big, Big Data consulting and that FAS 86 headwind of 50 basis points for 2015.

It is mostly a subscription kind of model. But overtime, it is going to contribute meaningfully to growth and I like the opportunity, we have to get back on track with our marketing applications.

First of all, 2014 was a mixed bag. Steve gave the results globally for the industries and when you look at it from geographies, international and the Americas, there were some pretty good swings out there. So financial services was down, low double digits in the Americas, but it was up double digits in international. Retail was up a lot in international, down in the Americas. So I think I would give you a different answer when you look at that by geography. I do think retail is in a tough environment here in the U.S. and I would expect that to be a big uptick when we look at 2015. I think financial services, we had a tough year in the Americas, but I think it won't hurt us to the degree it did in 2014. A lot of the spending in the priorities is moving to securities and things like that. But in some of these other industries where we're underpenetrated like manufacturing, I expect continued good growth. Communications industry, media and entertainment has been a good growth market for us here in the U.S. in 2014 and I would expect that would be a good one in 2015. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag, but generally speaking, when you view it by industry segments, generally, we have pretty good chance going."

So when you look at an aggregate, the dollar uptick we're getting in revenue is smaller than when if the mix stayed stagnant with the number of large customers we're winning. So the number of large customers we're winning, it's not like it's decreased meaningfully or anything else like that, but we do have a different mix of customers. The other thing is, in this environment the past couple of years, the spending is coming a little bit slower on the IDWs, whether it's an existing customer, some of our newer customers.

For the full year, revenue was down 1% as reported and flat in constant currency. We saw some improvements with the Americas top 50 customers in 2014. Revenue only declined 4% versus the 11% decline in 2013. Furthermore, we grew 3% in the top 50 outside of our financial services customers. After driving the highest growth of any industry by far in the Americas from 2010 to 2013, financial services revenue declined as expected in 2014.
The Americas had a strong quarter adding new data warehouse customers, with Q4 wins being the second highest ever for a fourth quarter. Wins included a leading U.S. health services company, which chose our Teradata Cloud to deliver analytics to their Fortune 500 customers. One of North America's largest commercial real estate companies also selected our Teradata Cloud. Community Health Systems, one of the largest U.S. hospital groups, selected Teradata to integrate financial data from its many acquisitions into an IDW. And we added another state government, which is using Teradata to discover unrecognized revenue and to increase tax collections.
Significant upgrades and expansions included TIAA-CREF which added Aster and Hadoop to its Unified Data Architecture for Big Data Analytics. One of the top U.S. cable operators added Aster, Hadoop and Teradata Loom to its UDA for advanced advertising analytics. And one of our airline customers added an IDW.
Turning to our international region. Q4 revenue of $305 million was flat as reported compared to prior year, but it was up 8% in constant currency. For the full year, international revenue was up 5% as reported and up 8% in constant currency. International had another record quarter for new data warehouse customer wins and set a record for new customer wins for the year.
Wins in the fourth quarter included one of the world's largest biotech companies, which is using Teradata to support analytics on real-world data outside of clinical trials. A top telco in China, which chose Aster for its social connections analytic platform. One of the world's largest auto manufacturers that purchased Teradata for cross departmental data analytics, warranty analysis and predictive maintenance. Loyalty Management, located in the Netherlands, is implementing Teradata Appliances, Teradata Analytics for SAP and our Marketing Applications for its customer loyalty programs. And Anbang Insurance Group in Hong Kong is using Teradata to integrate centralize insurance, banking and securities data to support its rapid business expansion.
Significant upgrades and expansions included, METRO GROUP, a top global retailer, added Aster as a recommendation engine to its UDA to support marketing automation. Westpac Banking added Hadoop to its UDA. And one of the world's largest telcos, which is an IDW customer, is consolidating 7 different marketing systems into our Integrated Marketing Cloud to enable its marketers and their agencies to better control and manage their marketing efforts.
In 2014, our Aster, Hadoop, UDA and related services had strong revenue growth. And we grew the number of customers using Aster by right around 50%. However, our overall Big Data Analytics revenue, which includes the 1000 Series appliance, came in at $80 million, which was short of our $100 million target for 2014. This was due to the timing of some larger 1000 Series deals. We are looking for strong, Big Data Analytics growth in 2015.
We strengthened our Big Data Analytics portfolio in 2014 through M&As, such as with the acquisitions of RainStor, Revelytix, Hadapt and Think Big Analytics. And we've been adding to our Big Data Analytics portfolio through investments in R&D with innovations such as query grid, graph, machine learning, tax analytics and more. We have also broadened our strategic partnerships, which now includes Hortonworks, Cloudera, MapR and MongoDB.
Now that many of the leading companies have worked with Hadoop and the broader analytical ecosystem, there's now, generally speaking, a more pragmatic view in the marketplace about the capabilities of all these various technologies. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the cost and the complexities of managing the analytic ecosystem.
Our UDA is key to simplifying the architecture, the management of multiple systems and minimizing the costs and complexities. It is also clear the IDW will play a key role in the analytic ecosystem going forward. This week, The Information Difference annual Data of Warehousing Landscape report ranked Teradata the strongest overall technology in 2014 and noted that our customers were ranked the happiest of those survey. Going forward, we will continue to enhance our data warehouse technologies, our UDA capabilities and to add to our Big Data Analytics portfolio.
Turning to our Applications business. We finished the year with revenue of $244 million and recurring revenue growth of only 2%. We are not happy with these results. On the one hand, we have done a pretty good job selling into our existing data warehouse customer base, where most of these are larger enterprise customers that have been implementing our on-premise applications. On the other hand, we have not been focusing and investing at the appropriate levels to take advantage of the faster growing Integrated Marketing Cloud opportunity that we have in the broader market.
To better address this opportunity, we created an integrated business unit for our Marketing Applications at the start of the year that now includes R&D, sales, marketing, consulting and services. In addition, we moved our non-marketing applications to Teradata Labs so that we can make this business 100% focused on marketing applications. We believe this will enable us to have a better focus and alignment for operational decisions and execution and also for longer-term strategic decision making. This in turn will help us to better serve our customers and to grow our revenues. 
We will continue to increase our marketing demand creation investments to reach the broader market that we started last year. We are already generating significantly higher leads and expect this to convert to higher orders and revenue over time. And we continue to increase our R&D investments for our Marketing Cloud as well as add capabilities through M&As.
In Q4, we acquired the mobile marketing provider, Appoxee, which provides us with mobile push capabilities. And earlier this year, we acquired a social media monitoring company as well as a digital marketing consultancy. The good news is that we have leading marketing application solutions as evidenced by the various industry analyst report, sand we continue to enhance them. Just this week, Gartner again named Teradata as the leader in marketing resource management, noting our broad and deep solution, the advanced maturity of our MRM customers, our focus on client value and our continued market traction.
In 2014, we made good progress with our Teradata Analytics Cloud. In the fourth quarter, we added our first customers in Canada, Latin America and in the U.K. Teradata provides a wide range of cloud analytics solutions from a fully functional IDW to a data warehouse, to discovery analytics with Aster and Hadoop, to doing specific functions such as disaster recovery and test and development.
Turning to guidance. Given the currency and other headwinds, we are expecting revenue growth as reported to be flat to down 2% in 2015 and up 3% to 5% in constant currency at this point in time. Currency is estimated to have a negative 5% impact on revenue or about $130 million. And we expect a 1% to 2% revenue headwind as we continue to grow our Teradata Cloud and our subscription revenue. 
Our recent top 50 customer survey for 2015 showed that the vast majority of overall IT budgets will be flat or down again this year, with security and mobile being top spending priorities. In addition, we are expecting a slow start in 2015 with a revenue decline in Q1 due to currency and also going against the most challenging prior year quarter comparable. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 for 2015, which reflects an estimated $0.22 impact from currency.
2015 will be a year of investment. We are increasing investments by about $50 million, primarily aimed at our high revenue growth opportunities, Big Data Analytics, Marketing Applications and our Teradata Analytics Cloud. These investments will be focused on R&D and demand creation to reach the broader market for all of our solutions. Since the majority of the revenue in these high-growth markets is subscription and services, we will not see a meaningful impact on revenue growth in 2015. So short term, these investments will be impacting our profitability and our earnings per share in 2015, but should lead the higher revenue growth and the higher earnings per share in 2016 and beyond.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide more financial details. Steve?"

Fourth quarter product revenue of $360 million was down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, down 1% in constant currency. For the full year, product revenue was flat, up 1% in constant currency. In the quarter, services rev",2076,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Fourth quarter product revenue of $360 million was down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, down 1% in constant currency. For the full year, product revenue was flat, up 1% in constant currency. In the quarter, services revenue of $401 million was up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2013 and up 6% in constant currency. For the full year, services revenue was up 3%, up 5% in constant currency. 
Within services revenue, in the quarter, Consulting Services revenue was $225 million, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2013, up 5% in constant currency. Maintenance Services revenues was $176 million, which was up 2% from Q4 2013 and up 6% in constant currency. For the full year, consulting services was flat, but up 2% in constant currency and maintenance revenue was up 7%, up 8% in constant currency.
Overall, currency created a 4-point headwind on the reported revenue growth for the quarter, which was 2 points higher than what we have previously assumed.  For the full year, currency created a 2-point headwind, which is twice as much as the 1 percentage point impact we expected on our full year results when we provided our commentary at the time we announced our third quarter results. Not only did currency have a meaningfully impact on our year-over-year revenue comparisons, but it also negatively impacted our profitability as approximately 1/3 of the currency impact on revenue hits our operating income.
At this time, I'll provide color on the global 2014 revenue contribution by industry vertical to our Data Warehouse, Big Data and Consulting Services revenue. These contributions do not include maintenance or applications revenue. The following significant industry verticals contributed the same percentage of revenue in 2014 and 2013. Financial services 31%, communications 19%, retail 14% and manufacturing 13%. With respect to the other industries, healthcare contributed 6% of our revenue versus 8% in 2013; government was 7% of our revenue, up from 6% in 2013; travel and transportation also contributed approximately 7%, up from 6% in 2013; energy and utilities generated a little more than 1% of revenue in each year; while other accounted for the remaining 2% in both years.
In terms of year-over-year revenue change, all industries were up 1% to down 3%, except travel and transportation, up 20%; government, up 14%; energy and utilities, up 8%; and healthcare, down 16%.
During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based composition and other special items. Product gross margin in the fourth quarter returned to the mid-60s, as anticipated, specifically 65.8% compared to last year's Q4 product margin of 68.5%. The primary drivers of the change were deal mix and product mix. For the full year, product gross margin was 65.2% compared to 66.2% in 2013. The lower margin in 2014 was primarily the net result of increased FAS 86 amortization. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was 48.9%, up 200 basis points from the 46.9% in Q4 2013. The increase was driven by improved maintenance and consulting yields. Services gross margin for the full year was 47.6%, similar to last year's 47.5%.  Overall, gross margin was 56.9% in the fourth quarter versus 57.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year, gross margin was 55.5% compared to 56% in 2013. The net decrease was largely due to the increase amortization of FAS 86. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $198 million was only $1 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year, SG&A was $715 million, a modest 2% increase from the 2013 level. Research and development expense in the quarter was $48 million, up $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. For the year, R&D increased 9% to $180 million. For both the quarter and the full year, the increase in R&D expense was primarily due to additional investments, including acquisitions in our Big Data and Marketing Analytics Solutions.
Total R&D spend for the fourth quarter, which includes the R&D expense just described plus the additions to capitalized software costs from the cash flow statement less capitalization of internally developed software, was $64 million. This compared to $60 million in Q4 2013. Year-to-date, total R&D spend was $248 million or 20% of our product revenue versus $237 million in 2013. As a reminder, this capitalized costs when amortized are classified in the income statement as product cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin.
As a result of these items, operating margin for the quarter was 24.6% versus 26.7% in Q4 2013. For the full year, operating margin was 22.7% versus 23.8% in 2013. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.1% versus 29.4% for the same period in 2013. The difference was due to a higher proportion of foreign pretax earnings in 2014 versus the prior year period and the $4 million discrete tax benefit for the retroactive restatement of the 2014 U.S. Federal Research and Development Tax Credit recognized during the fourth quarter of 2014.  The full year 2014 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27.2%, a point lower than the 2013 tax rate, due to higher proportion of foreign pretax earnings in 2014 versus the prior period.
Looking forward, for 2015, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27% to 28%, with the actual rate being heavily dependent on our earnings mix. In addition, both tax rates presume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be reinstated in 2015. However, our quarterly effective tax rates will be negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points until such time the credit is reinstated.
In terms of earnings per share. Our Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.77 compared to $0.68 in Q4 2013. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $22 million or $0.14 in the quarter, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.91 compared to $0.88 in Q4 2013. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $2.33 compared to $2.27 in 2013. Stock-based compensation and other special items negatively impacted our full year GAAP net income by $85 million or $0.53 per share in 2014 versus $82 million or $0.49 per share in 2013. Adjusting for these items, 2014 full year non-GAAP EPS was $2.86 versus $2.76 in 2013. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in Q4 was better than expected at $97 million in Q4 2014. This was a meaningful increase over the $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The strong cash flow performance was primarily due to net changes in accounts receivable due to timing of collections.
After $35 million of capital expenditures, which include additions of capitalized software development cost and expenditures for property and equipment, versus $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, we generated $62 million of free cash flow versus the $25 million of free cash flow generated in Q4 2013. Free cash flow in 2014 was $551 million versus $372 million in 2013. The timing of accounts receivable collections led to the higher free cash flow versus 2013.
Going forward, due to the expected differences between free cash flow and net income such as stock-based compensation and acquired intangible amortization, we now expect full year free cash flow to be within our range that is up $250 million higher than GAAP net income.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $834 million of cash as of December 31, 2014, up $139 million from December 31, 2013. Of this balance, over 90% is held offshore. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares for $268 million. For 2014, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares of our stock for $560 million.
To fund a portion of these share repurchases in the fourth quarter, we drew down $220 million on our credit facility as of 12/31/2014. As of December 31, 2014, we have approximately $394 million of share repurchase authorization remaining available for additional share repurchases. Additionally, we repurchased 2.1 million shares in the first quarter of 2015 at a cost of $92 million. As a result, we have now approximately $300 million of share repurchases authorization remaining.
We also used approximately $20 million for tuck-in acquisitions during the quarter, $69 million during the year. With respect to accounts receivable, accounts receivable decreased $98 million in Q4 2014 versus Q4 2013. Days sales outstanding was 83 days as of December 31, 2014, compared to 97 days at December 31, 2013. And finally, total deferred revenue was $388 million as of December 31, 2014, which was down $27 million from December 31, 2013.
As I transition into the guidance discussion, I just want to highlight a few items. As the market and our business continues to evolve, we are stepping up our investments in our Big Data Analytics and application businesses in 2015. We expect to increase our investments by approximately $50 million during the year in various aspects of our business, which should lead to an improving situation in 2016. Even though our operating income and EPS will be negatively impacted in 2015 by these investments, we expect revenue, operating income, recurring revenue and EPS to see improvement in 2016 and beyond.
However, for 2015, as it relates to currency, assuming the currency exchange rates as of January 30, we expect currency to create a 5% headwind to our full year revenue comparisons in 2015, with also a 5% headwind in Q1 2015. As it relates to revenue, we expect reported revenue to grow in the range of minus 2% to 0% or 3% to 5% when measured in constant currency. This would translate into a full year reported revenue in the approximate range of $2.677 billion to $2.732 billion. 
Of course, finally, in terms of EPS, we expect GAAP EPS in the $1.91 to $2.11 range, which translates to $2.50 to $2.70 on a non-GAAP basis when excluding stock-based compensation expense and special items. Currency is obviously having a big impact on many U.S. based companies that have a high percentage of their business internationally. For Teradata, approximately half our business is done outside of the U.S. 
As a result of the currency impact, we see on our top line revenue growth, we expect about 1/3 will flow through to impact operating income. If you adjust for currency, our 2015 constant currency non-GAAP EPS would be in the $2.72 to $2.92 range. However, to reiterate, our non-GAAP reported EPS guidance range for 2015 is $2.50 to $2.70.
Other specific items impacting our 2015 guidance include the following: One, decrease in FAS 86 capitalization of $5 million to $10 million occurring in 2015, especially pronounced in the first part of the year with $7 million decrease expected in Q1. As a reminder, decreased FAS 86 capitalization has the effect of increasing the amount of R&D expense reported on the income statement. Second, increase in incentive variable compensation cost due to not achieving our bonus thresholds in 2014. But assuming in our plan we reached the thresholds in 2015, thereby creating an increase in incentive comp of approximately $30 million. 
Third, full year GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 26% and non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 27% to 28% and is heavily dependent upon the earnings mix. In addition, both rates presume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be reinstated in 2015. However, until such time the credit is officially reenacted, our effective tax rate for each quarter will be negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points. Fourth, weighted average shares outstanding for the full year is expected approximately $146 million, but naturally higher in Q1. 
And finally, specifically as it relates to Q1 2015, we expect reported revenue to decline as our international region will face an approximately 13-point currency headwind in our Americas region compares against an 8% growth rate in Q1 2013. As a result of these factors and our anticipated our Q1 revenue mix and including our increased expenses, operating income will be significantly below Q1 2013's results. 
In closing, we are proactively investing in our businesses, including stepped-up R&D initiatives, sales support and demand creation resources for both our Data Warehouse, Analytics business as well as our Applications business in order to drive future revenue growth and further enhance our technology leadership position. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

Basically, when we look at 2015, there are a couple of additional headwinds such as our cloud and subscription business for our Data Warehouse Analytic business will continue to grow and have an impact of 1 percentage point or 2",301,"Yes. Raimo, this is Mike. Basically, when we look at 2015, there are a couple of additional headwinds such as our cloud and subscription business for our Data Warehouse Analytic business will continue to grow and have an impact of 1 percentage point or 2 points on growth. We see improvement in 2014 in a good trend in the top 50. We feel we're -- in the Americas, we feel we're pretty stable there. We basically have a lot of good things going, if you look at it, going into 2015. So we actually, we have the guidance at a 3% to 5%. You could look at it outside of some headwinds of transitioning some of the business to subscription and cloud, we're looking at 4% to 6%. And I think the more difficult thing when you look at the 3% to 5% guidance is we're making the investments and we're playing offense in a very difficult environment. And those investments are going in to our high-growth opportunities, which are Big Data Analytics or Applications business and our Cloud, which basically is more of a subscription model. The bulk of the revenue is in a subscription model and you kind of recoup the revenue over 3 years. So we can't move the dial a lot in 2015, but what we're looking at doing is building up our recurring revenue file for all those businesses during the year and exit the year with a larger increase in our annual recurring revenue final value that will set the stage in 2016 for further growth. So just to make sure I'm being a little clear, we're making investments in something where the revenue come slower, but we're going to build up the file value of it in 2015 which will benefit us in 2016."

So product gross margins, we finished the year about 65 plus. We could be in that plus or minus at 65 range of that FAS 86 headwind for product gross margin. On the services gross margin, that's where our big data consulting, Think Big, is captured. We're going to, as Mike indicated, continue to make investments in that capability from a cost side. So the services gross margin, we finished probably around 47.5% for the year.

I think if you look where we're headed longer term, I'll start on 2016, I think it's very reasonable, very reasonable with the investments we're making and everything else, that we should be growing mid-single digits or higher, okay, in 2016. And then I think if you look at the business longer term, out beyond 2016, we absolutely have the opportunity to grow high single digits. So we've been making a lot of progress in areas that have been softer the past couple of years with the top 50 and some of these other things we're taking action, we're investing heavily into the big growth opportunities, in the Big Data Analytics. I love our position and how we've solidified our portfolio there and we continue to grow it. It is mostly a subscription kind of model. But over time, it is going to contribute meaningfully to growth. And I like the opportunity, we have to get back on track with our marketing applications. So it's really all about executing right now and the revenues going to set up for good things to come in the years after."

So I think I would give you a different answer when you look at that by geography. I do think retail is in a tough environment here in the U.S. and I wouldn't expect that to be a big uptick when we look at 2015. I think financial services, we had a tough year in the Americas, but I think it won't hurt us to the degree it did in 2014. A lot of the spending and the priorities is moving to securities and things like that, but in some of these other industries where we're underpenetrated like manufacturing, I expect continued good growth. Communications industry, media and entertainment has been a good growth market for us here in the U.S. in 2014 and I would expect that would be a good one in 2015.

What's happening is we've gone very broader in the market and that's what's enabled us to capture a lot more new customers.

So when you look at in aggregate, the dollar uptick we're getting in revenue is smaller than when if the mix have stayed stagnant with the number of large customers we're winning. So the number of large customers we're winning, it's not like it's decreased meaningfully or anything else like that, but we do have a different mix of customers. The other thing is, in this environment the past couple of years, the spending is coming a little bit slower on the IDWs, whether it's an existing customer, some of our newer customers, so we may have to tweak the model a little bit.

Teradata finished the fourth quarter with revenue of $761 million, which was down 1% from prior year and was lower than we had anticipated mainly due to currency. Revenue in constant currency was up 3% over prior year, which was roughly in line with what we were expecting. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.91 was up 3% over prior year despite the unfavorable impact of currency. For the full year, revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.86 were both in line with our guidance.
We had another excellent quarter for adding new data warehouse customers. We set a record in Q4, and for the year, it was our second highest ever. The strength of our new customer wins during the past couple of years has been driven by our investments to go broader in the market and to expand our analytics portfolio, which now includes our IDW, our data warehouse appliances, Aster, Hadoop and the Teradata Cloud.
Turning to the regions. The Americas' Q4 revenue of $456 million was down 2% from prior year and down 1% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was down 1% as reported and flat in constant currency. We saw some improvements with the Americas top 50 customers in 2014. Revenue only declined 4% versus the 11% decline in 2013. Furthermore, we grew 3% in the top 50 outside of our financial services customers. After driving the highest growth of any industry by far in the Americas from 2010 to 2013, financial services revenue declined as expected in 2014.
The Americas had a strong quarter adding new data warehouse customers with Q4 wins being the second highest ever for a fourth quarter. Wins included a leading U.S. health services company, which chose our Teradata Cloud to deliver analytics to their Fortune 500 customers. One of North America's largest commercial real estate companies also selected our Teradata Cloud. Community Health Systems, one of the largest U.S. hospital groups, selected Teradata to integrate financial data from its many acquisitions into an IDW. And we added another state government, which is using Teradata to discover unrecognized revenue and to increase tax collections.
Significant upgrades and expansions included TIAA-CREF, which added Aster and Hadoop to its Unified Data Architecture for Big Data Analytics. One of the top U.S. cable operators added Aster, Hadoop and Teradata Loom to its UDA for advanced advertising analytics. And one of our airline customers added an IDW.
Turning to our international region. Q4 revenue of $305 million was flat as reported compared to prior year, but it was up 8% in constant currency. For the full year, international revenue was up 5% as reported and up 8% in constant currency. International had another record quarter for new data warehouse customer wins and set a record for new customer wins for the year.
Wins in the fourth quarter included: one of the world's largest biotech companies, which is using Teradata to support analytics on real-world data outside of clinical trials; a top telco in China, which chose Aster for its social connections analytic platform; one of the world's largest auto manufacturers that purchased Teradata for cross-departmental data analytics, warranty analysis and predictive maintenance; Loyalty Management, located in the Netherlands, is implementing Teradata Appliances, Teradata Analytics for SAP and our marketing applications for its customer loyalty programs; and Anbang Insurance Group in Hong Kong is using Teradata to integrate and centralize insurance, banking and securities data to support its rapid business expansion.
Significant upgrades and expansions included, METRO GROUP, a top global retailer, added Aster as a recommendation engine to its UDA to support marketing automation. Westpac Banking added Hadoop to its UDA. And one of the world's largest telcos, which is an IDW customer, is consolidating 7 different marketing systems into our Integrated Marketing Cloud to enable its marketers and their agencies to better control and manage their marketing efforts.
In 2014, our Aster, Hadoop, UDA and related services had strong revenue growth. And we grew the number of customers using Aster by right around 50%. However, our overall Big Data Analytics revenue, which includes the 1000 Series appliance, came in at $80 million, which was short of our $100 million target for 2014. This was due to the timing of some larger 1000 Series deals. We are looking for strong big Data Analytics growth in 2015.
We strengthened our Big Data Analytics portfolio in 2014 through M&As, such as with the acquisitions of RainStor, Revelytix, Hadapt and Think Big Analytics. And we've been adding to our Big Data Analytics portfolio through investments in R&D with innovations such as QueryGrid, graph, machine learning, text analytics and more. We have also broadened our strategic partnerships, which now includes Hortonworks, Cloudera, MapR and MongoDB.
Now that many of the leading companies have worked with Hadoop and the broader analytical ecosystem, there's now, generally speaking, a more pragmatic view in the marketplace about the capabilities of all these various technologies. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the costs and the complexities of managing the analytic ecosystem.
Our UDA is key to simplifying the architecture, the management of multiple systems, and minimizing the costs and complexities. It is also clear the IDW will play a key role in the analytic ecosystem going forward. This week, The Information Difference annual Data Warehousing Landscape report ranked Teradata the strongest overall technology in 2014 and noted that our customers were ranked the happiest of those surveyed. Going forward, we will continue to enhance our data warehouse technologies, our UDA capabilities and to add to our Big Data Analytics portfolio.
Turning to our applications business. We finished the year with revenue of $244 million and recurring revenue growth of only 2%. We are not happy with these results. On the one hand, we have done a pretty good job selling into our existing data warehouse customer base, where most of these are larger enterprise customers that have been implementing our on-premise applications. On the other hand, we have not been focusing and investing at the appropriate levels to take advantage of the faster-growing integrated marketing cloud opportunity that we have in the broader market.
To better address this opportunity, we created an integrated business unit for our Marketing Applications at the start of the year that now includes R&D, sales, marketing, consulting and services. In addition, we moved our nonmarketing applications to Teradata Labs so that we can make this business 100% focused on marketing applications. We believe this will enable us to have a better focus and alignment for operational decisions and execution and also for longer-term strategic decision making. This in turn will help us to better serve our customers and to grow our revenues. 
We will continue to increase our marketing demand creation investments to reach the broader market that we started last year. We are already generating significantly higher leads and expect this to convert to higher orders and revenue over time. And we continue to increase our R&D investments for our Marketing Cloud as well as add capabilities through M&As.
In Q4, we acquired the mobile marketing provider, Appoxee, which provides us with mobile push capabilities. And earlier this year, we acquired a social media monitoring company as well as a digital marketing consultancy. The good news is that we have leading marketing application solutions as evidenced by the various industry analyst reports, and we continue to enhance them. Just this week, Gartner again named Teradata as a leader in marketing resource management, noting our broad and deep solution, the advanced maturity of our MRM customers, our focus on client value and our continued market traction.
In 2014, we made good progress with our Teradata Analytics Cloud. In the fourth quarter, we added our first customers in Canada, Latin America and in the U.K. Teradata provides a wide range of cloud analytics solutions from a fully functional IDW to a data warehouse, to discovery analytics with Aster and Hadoop, to doing specific functions, such as disaster recovery and test and development.
Turning to guidance. Given the currency and other headwinds, we are expecting revenue growth as reported to be flat to down 2% in 2015 and up 3% to 5% in constant currency at this point in time. Currency is estimated to have a negative 5% impact on revenue or about $130 million. And we expect a 1% to 2% revenue headwind as we continue to grow our Teradata Cloud and our subscription revenue. 
Our recent top 50 customer survey for 2015 showed that the vast majority of overall IT budgets will be flat or down again this year with security and mobile being top spending priorities. In addition, we are expecting to slow start in 2015 with a revenue decline in Q1 due to currency and also going against the most challenging prior year quarter comparable. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 for 2015, which reflects an estimated $0.22 impact from currency.
2015 will be a year of investment. We are increasing investments by about $50 million, primarily aimed at our high revenue growth opportunities, Big Data Analytics, Marketing Applications and our Teradata Analytics Cloud. These investments will be focused on R&D and demand creation to reach the broader market for all of our solutions. Since the majority of the revenue in these high-growth markets is subscription and services, we will not see a meaningful impact on revenue growth in 2015. So short term, these investments will be impacting our profitability and our earnings per share in 2015 but should lead to higher revenue growth and higher earnings per share in 2016 and beyond.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide more financial details. Steve?"

In the quarter, services rev",2075,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Fourth quarter product revenue of $360 million was down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, down 1% in constant currency. For the full year, product revenue was flat, up 1% in constant currency. In the quarter, services revenue of $401 million was up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2013 and up 6% in constant currency. For the full year, services revenue was up 3%, up 5% in constant currency. 
Within services revenue, in the quarter, consulting services revenue was $225 million, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2013, up 5% in constant currency. Maintenance services revenues was $176 million, which was up 2% from Q4 2013 and up 6% in constant currency. For the full year, consulting services was flat, but up 2% in constant currency and maintenance revenue was up 7%, up 8% in constant currency.
Overall, currency created a 4-point headwind on the reported revenue growth for the quarter, which was 2 points higher than what we had previously assumed.  For the full year, currency created a 2-point headwind, which is twice was much as the 1 percentage point impact we expected on our full year results when we provided our commentary at the time we announced our third quarter results. Not only did currency have a meaningful impact on our year-over-year revenue comparisons, but it also negatively impacted our profitability as approximately 1/3 of the currency impact on revenue hits our operating income.
At this time, I'll provide color on the global 2014 revenue contribution by industry vertical to our Data Warehouse, Big Data and consulting services revenue. These contributions do not include maintenance or applications revenue. The following significant industry verticals contributed the same percentage of revenue in 2014 and 2013: financial services 31%, communications 19%, retail 14% and manufacturing 13%. With respect to the other industries, health care contributed 6% of our revenue versus 8% in 2013; government was 7% of our revenue, up from 6% in 2013; travel and transportation also contributed approximately 7%, up from 6% in 2013; energy and utilities generated a little more than 1% of revenue in each year; while Other accounted for the remaining 2% in both years.
In terms of year-over-year revenue change, all industries were up 1% to down 3% except: travel and transportation, up 20%; government, up 14%; energy and utilities, up 8%; and health care, down 16%.
During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based composition and other special items. Product gross margin in the fourth quarter returned to the mid-60s as anticipated, specifically 65.8% compared to last year's Q4 product margin of 68.5%. The primary drivers of the change were deal mix and product mix. For the full year, product gross margin was 65.2% compared to 66.2% in 2013. The lower margin in 2014 was primarily the net result of increased FAS 86 amortization. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was 48.9%, up 200 basis points from the 46.9% in Q4 2013. The increase was driven by improved maintenance and consulting yields. Services gross margin for the full year was 47.6%, similar to last year's 47.5%.  Overall gross margin was 56.9% in the fourth quarter versus 57.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year, gross margin was 55.5% compared to 56% in 2013. The net decrease was largely due to the increased amortization of FAS 86. 
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $198 million was only $1 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year, SG&A was 1 -- $715 million, a modest 2% increase from the 2013 level. Research and development expense in the quarter was $48 million, up $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. For the year, R&D increased 9% to $180 million. For both the quarter and the full year, the increase in R&D expense was primarily due to additional investments, including acquisitions in our Big Data and Marketing Analytics Solutions.
Total R&D spend for the fourth quarter, which includes the R&D expense just described plus the additions to capitalized software costs from the cash flow statement less capitalization of internally developed software, was $64 million. This compared to $60 million in Q4 2013. Year-to-date, total R&D spend was $248 million or 20% of our product revenue versus $237 million in 2013. As a reminder, these capitalized costs, when amortized, are classified in the income statement as product cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin.
As a result of these items, operating margin for the quarter was 24.6% versus 26.7% in Q4 2013. For the full year, operating margin was 22.7% versus 23.8% in 2013. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.1% versus 29.4% for the same period in 2013. The difference was due to a higher proportion of foreign pretax earnings in 2014 versus the prior period and a $4 million discrete tax benefit for the retroactive restatement of the 2014 U.S. Federal Research and Development Tax Credit recognized during the fourth quarter 2014.  The full year 2014 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27.2%, 1 point lower than the 2013 tax rate due to higher proportion of foreign pretax earnings in 2014 versus the prior period.
Looking forward. For 2015, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27% to 28% with the actual rate being heavily dependent on our earnings mix. In addition, both tax rates presume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be reinstated in 2015. However, our quarterly effective tax rates will be negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points until such time the credit is reinstated.
In terms of earnings per share. Our Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.77 compared to $0.68 in Q4 2013. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $22 million or $0.14 in the quarter, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.91 compared to $0.88 in Q4 2013. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $2.33 compared to $2.27 in 2013. Stock-based compensation and other special items negatively impacted our full year GAAP net income by $85 million or $0.53 per share in 2014 versus $82 million or $0.49 per share in 2013. Adjusting for these items, 2014 full year non-GAAP EPS was $2.86 versus $2.76 in 2013. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in Q4 was better than expected at $97 million in Q4 2014. This was a meaningful increase over the $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The strong cash flow performance was primarily due to net changes in accounts receivable due to timing of collections.
After $35 million of capital expenditures, which include additions of capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment, versus $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, we generated $62 million of free cash flow versus the $25 million of free cash flow generated in Q4 2013. Free cash flow in 2014 was $551 million versus $372 million in 2013. The timing of accounts receivable collections led to the higher free cash flow versus 2013.
Going forward, due to the expected differences between free cash flow and net income, such as stock-based compensation and acquired intangible amortization, we now expect full year free cash flow to be within a range that is up to $50 million higher than GAAP net income.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $834 million of cash as of December 31, 2014, up $139 million from December 31, 2013. Of this balance, over 90% is held offshore. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares for $268 million. For 2014, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares of our stock for $560 million.
To fund a portion of these share repurchases in the fourth quarter, we drew down $220 million on our credit facility as of 12/31/2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $394 million of share repurchase authorization remaining available for additional share repurchases. Additionally, we repurchased 2.1 million shares in the first quarter of 2015 at a cost of $92 million. As a result, we have now approximately $300 million of share repurchases authorization remaining.
We also used approximately $20 million for tuck-in acquisitions during the quarter, $69 million during the year. With respect to accounts receivable, accounts receivable decreased $98 million in Q4 2014 versus Q4 2013. Days sales outstanding was 83 days as of December 31, 2014, compared to 97 days at December 31, 2013. And finally, total deferred revenue was $388 million as of December 31, 2014, which was down $27 million from December 31, 2013.
As I transition into the guidance discussion, I just want to highlight a few items. As the market and our business continues to evolve, we are stepping up our investments in our Big Data Analytics and application businesses in 2015. We expect to increase our investments by approximately $50 million during the year in various aspects of our business, which should lead to an improving situation in 2016. Even though our operating income and EPS will be negatively impacted in 2015 by these investments, we expect revenue, operating income, recurring revenue and EPS to see improvement in 2016 and beyond.
However, for 2015, as it relates to currency, assuming the currency exchange rates as of January 30, we expect currency to create a 5% headwind to our full year revenue comparisons in 2015 with also a 5% headwind in Q1 2015. As it relates to revenue, we expect reported revenue to grow in the range of minus 2% to 0% or 3% to 5% when measured in constant currency. This would translate into a full year reported revenue in the approximate range of $2.677 billion to $2.732 billion. 
Correspondingy, in terms of EPS, we expect GAAP EPS in the $1.91 to $2.11 range, which translates to $2.50 to $2.70 on a non-GAAP basis when excluding stock-based compensation expense and special items. Currency is obviously having a big impact on many U.S.-based companies that have a high percentage of their business internationally. For Teradata, approximately half our business is done outside of the U.S. 
As a result of the currency impact we see on our top line revenue growth, we expect about 1/3 will flow through to impact operating income. If you adjust for currency, our 2015 constant-currency non-GAAP EPS would be in the $2.72 to $2.92 range. However, to reiterate, our non-GAAP reported EPS guidance range for 2015 is $2.50 to $2.70.
Other specific items impacting our 2015 guidance include the following: One, decrease in FAS 86 capitalization of $5 million to $10 million occurring in 2015, especially pronounced in the first part of the year with $7 million decrease expected in Q1. As a reminder, decreased FAS 86 capitalization has the effect of increasing the amount of R&D expense reported on the income statement. Second, increase in incentive variable compensation cost due to not achieving our bonus thresholds in 2014 but assuming in our plan we reach the thresholds in 2015, thereby creating an increase in incentive comp of approximately $30 million. Third, full year GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 26% and non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 27% to 28% that is heavily dependent upon the earnings mix. In addition, both rates presume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be reinstated in 2015. However, until such time the credit is officially reenacted, our effective tax rate for each quarter will be negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points. Fourth, weighted average shares outstanding for the full year is expected to approximate 146 million but naturally higher in Q1. And finally, specifically as it relates to Q1 2015, we expect reported revenue to decline as our international region will face an approximately 13-point currency headwind. And our Americas region compares against an 8% growth rate in Q1 2013. As a result of these factors and our anticipated Q1 revenue mix and including our increased expenses, operating income will be significantly below Q1 2013's results. 
In closing, we are proactively investing in our businesses, including stepped-up R&D initiatives, sales support and demand creation resources for both our Data Warehouse Analytics business as well as our Applications business in order to drive future revenue growth and further enhance our technology leadership position. 
And with that, we are ready to take questions."

Basically, when we look at 2015, there are a couple of additional headwinds, such as our cloud and subscription business for our Data Warehouse Analytic business will continue to grow and have an impact of 1 percentage point or 2",300,"Yes. Raimo, this is Mike. Basically, when we look at 2015, there are a couple of additional headwinds, such as our cloud and subscription business for our Data Warehouse Analytic business will continue to grow and have an impact of 1 percentage point or 2 points on growth. We see improvement in 2014 in a good trend in the top 50. We feel we're -- in the Americas, we feel we're pretty stable there. We basically have a lot of good things going if you look at it going into 2015. So we actually, we have the guidance at a 3% to 5%. You could look at it outside of some headwinds of transitioning some of the business to subscription and cloud, we're looking at 4% to 6%. And I think the more difficult thing when you look at the 3% to 5% guidance is we're making the investments and we're playing offense in a very difficult environment. And those investments are going in to our high-growth opportunities, which are Big Data Analytics, our Applications business and our Cloud, which basically is more of a subscription model. The bulk of the revenue is in a subscription model and you kind of recoup the revenue over 3 years. So we can't move the dial a lot in 2015, but what we're looking at doing is building up our recurring revenue file for all those businesses during the year and exit the year with a larger increase in our annual recurring revenue final value that'll set the stage in 2016 for further growth. So just to make sure I'm being a little clearer, we're making investments in something where the revenue comes slower, but we're going to build up the file value of it in 2015, which will benefit us in 2016."

But from a product gross margin side, this year, we had about 100 basis points impact on our product gross margin due to FAS 86. I see a 50 basis point headwind on that in '15. So product gross margins, we finished the year about 65 plus. We could be in that plus or minus that 65 range of that FAS 86 headwind for product gross margin. On the services gross margin, that's where our Big Data consulting, Think Big, is captured. We're going to, as Mike indicated, continue to make investments in that capability from a cost side. So the services gross margin, we finished probably around 47.5% for the year. We could be down because of those investments 100 basis points, really focused on that Think Big consulting resources expenses, which gets captured -- reflected in our services gross margin.

And when you look at it by geographies, international and the Americas, there were some pretty good swings there. So financial services was down low double digits in the Americas, but it was up double digits in international. Retail was up a lot in international, down in the Americas. So I think I would give you a different answer when you look at it by geography. I do think retail is in a tough environment here in the U.S., and I wouldn't expect that to be a big uptick when we look at 2015. I think financial services, we had a tough year in the Americas, but I think it won't hurt us to the degree it did in 2014. A lot of the spending and the priorities is moving to security and things like that, but in some of these other industries where we're underpenetrated, like manufacturing, I expect continued good growth. Communications industry, media and entertainment has been a good growth market for us here in the U.S. in 2014, and I would expect that would be a good one in 2015. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag. But generally speaking, when you view it by industry segments, generally, we have pretty good trends going."

What's happening is we've gone very broader in the market, and that's what's enabled us to capture a lot more new customers. And in the mix -- so if you look at the mix within the record quarters and years and uptick we're having in new customer wins, we're having a bigger mix of customers as a percentage, I'd say, outside of the Fortune 500 or Fortune 1000. So when you look at it in aggregate, the dollar uptick we're getting in revenue is smaller than when if the mix had stayed stagnant with the number of large customers we're winning. So the number of large customers we're winning, it's not like it's decreased meaningfully or anything else like that, but we do have a different mix of customers. The other thing is, in this environment the past couple years, the spending is coming a little bit slower on the IDWs, whether it's an existing customer, some of our newer customers, so we may have to tweak the model a little bit. But at the end of the day, we're putting more footprints out there and what's laying out there is more opportunity for revenue growth coming from it.

Teradata's first quarter results came in lower than what we had expected. Revenue of $582 million was down 7% as reported and 2% in constant currency.

Revenue of $582 million was down 7% as reported and 2% in constant currency. Our revenue shortfall was mainly due to opportunities in the America's that moved to the second quarter. Normally, the puts and takes with opportunities in a given quarter somewhat offset each other, but this was not the case in Q1.
In addition, currency movement from our last earnings call had an additional negative impact on our reported revenue and profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share declined to $0.30, primarily due to the 7% decline in revenue as reported. And the lower product margins, which were negatively impacted by product revenue mix, currency and lower volume. Steve will be providing more details on this later on the call. 
In addition to the currency impacts, we continue to experience headwinds from the IT spending environment and the pressure it is causing on large IT CapEx transactions, especially in the U.S. Recent third party surveys have reported that many of the 2015 IT budgets are flat to down, which confirms what our surveys have been showing from our larger U.S. customers. Although we are disappointed with our start in 2015, we believe we are still on track to finish 2015 within guidance range as provided at the start of the year, which I'll talk more about later in the call.
We continually make changes to help improve the performance of the company. During the quarter, we announced the appointments of Teradata Copresident, Bob Fare and Herman December, and created 2 divisions: Our Data and Analytics division, led by Herman; and our Marketing Applications division, led by Bob. Each division has its own dedicated resources, including R&D, sales, consulting, customer support and marketing. We are looking to get better focus, alignment and execution and most important, better results with this new model.
We now have reporting segments for each of the divisions, which I'll now provide some commentary on. In Q1, our Data and Analytics division reported revenue of $536 million, which was down 7% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Within the Data and Analytics division, the Americas revenue declined 6% in constant currency due to the opportunities that moved to Q2. International grew 7% in constant currency in the first quarter, led by continued strong growth in Western Europe.
Looking at the second quarter, the Americas has an opportunity for good revenue growth versus prior year. Their funnel and large CapEx opportunities have increased compared to prior year, which were partially aided by the slips from Q1. On the other hand, we are expecting international revenue to lightly decline in constant currency in Q2, mainly due to the prior year comparable when international data and analytics revenue grew 16% in constant currency.
Reported revenue could decline mid-teens in international with currency having an 11 point negative impact in Q2 based on April ending currency rates. We had a good quarter adding new data and analytics customers. Data warehouse, Aster and Teradata Cloud new customer wins included a U.S. national health care delivery company, which is implementing a data warehouse; our Hadoop appliances and QueryGrid; siemens Healthcare, which is installing a data warehouse along with QueryGrid. One of the world's largest telco providers in China is implementing an IDW. LCL, a leading French retail bank, is also implementing an IDW.
In Australia, government agency, which chose Aster and Hadoop for advanced analytics for its Intelligence Community. One of the top U.S. construction companies, which is implementing an IDW on-premise and also, along using our Teradata Cloud for development. Cera Asset Management, a leading Latin American pension management firm, selected our Teradata Cloud for its data warehousing. And a leading U.S. home health care company is replacing a competitor's on-premise data warehouse with our Teradata Cloud data warehouse.
We continue to experience good activity with our big data-related solutions. Our Q1 Big Data revenue was above the quarterly run rate of our 2015 target of $150 million in revenue. Our 1000 Extreme Data Appliance, which is included in our big data revenues results, can create lumpiness in a given quarter due to the size of some of these transactions. The 1000 series helped their Big Data revenue results in Q1, but will most likely not help us in Q2.
Activity with our Teradata Cloud continues to increase, both with new customers, as well as existing customers moving or adding workloads in our cloud, such as for testing and development, discovery and disaster recovery. We continue to enhance and innovate with our core data warehouse platforms. We recently announced our latest 2000 Series data warehouse appoints, giving customers faster in-memory processing and also doubling the power. Customers can analyze twice the amount of data twice as fast while using only half of the data center floor space.
We also announced the Teradata software defined data warehouse, which enables companies to securely create multitenant fee data warehouse environments within a single database. This allows companies to meet various security and privacy needs of different jurisdictions. For example, multinational companies can keep country data separate for regulatory compliance. We also continue to add capabilities through our UDA with emphasis on integration and simplification for our customers. We recently enhanced QueryGrid to connect with 2 additional Hadoop distributions. And Gartner again named Teradata a leader in its recent analytics metric quadrant, calling out the strength of our UDA and our continuous technology enhancements.
Turning to our marketing applications business. Q1 revenue of $46 million was down 10% as reported and 3% in constant currency. The key metrics we are focused on, recurring revenue and annual recurring revenue, each grew low single-digits in constant currency. New marketing application customer wins in the quarter included a top 5 oil company, which selected our marketing resource management or MRM solution; [indiscernible], a large French health insurance group, which is also implementing our MRM solution; a leading gaming company, which chose MRM; and a Fortune 100 financial services company that selected our campaign management solution.
Although we are not happy with the results of our marketing applications business over the past year or so, we have continued to add to our leading solutions. We released our digital marketing center in Q1. This cloud-based solution integrates our digital messaging, campaign management and Marketing Analytics Solutions to enable customers to create more effective campaigns across all channels and to execute them much faster. Digital messaging sender is a key to helping us go broader in the market.
We continue to gain recognition with industry analysts with our marketing applications. In addition to be named the leader in MRM by Gartner in the previous quarter, Teradata was once again named a leader in the Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management this quarter, noting our completeness of vision and our ability to execute.
We feel we have a hand on the key issues that have been impacting our performance and that we are taking the right actions to address them. One action was to go to an integrated business model so that we would have better focus, alignment and execution, and most importantly, better results. We believe this is a big first step in getting our marketing applications business back on track, along with the increased investments we are making. These investments will help us to get better position to go broader in the market, both with our cloud offerings and our demand creation, which we did not do a good job of addressing previously.
Our goal in 2015 is to have annual recurring revenue growth of mid- to high-single digits in constant currency as we exit the year and to position ourselves for higher recurring revenue growth in 2016. As we said on our last call, we are making additional investments in 2015 in Big Data, marketing applications and the Teradata Cloud, all of which are big growth opportunities for Teradata. We believe this is the key for us to get to a mid single-digits growth rate or higher in 2016. At the same time, we have continually optimized our cost structure and resources over the years and we will be even more focused on this in 2015 to help fund these growth investments.
Turning to guidance. We believe we are still on track to meet the 3% to 5% constant currency revenue growth guidance range provided at the start of the year or flat to minus 2% as reported. As a result of our Q1 earnings per share shortfall, we now estimate we will be at the low end of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range of $2.50 to $2.70 for the full year. We expect to make good progress in Q2 and in the second half of the year as well. We currently are seeing higher growth in the second half of the year. Our revenue that has higher visibility or predictability is forecasted to grow mid single-digits in constant currency. This revenue includes all of our marketing applications business and the maintenance subscription and Consulting Services from our Data and Analytics business.
And this accounts for approximately 2/3 of our total revenue. As a note, our recurring revenue continues to grow and is now in the mid-40s as a percent of our total revenue. The remaining 1/3 of our revenue that has lower visibility or predictability in the second half is our data warehousing product revenue. Any growth in our data warehouse product revenue in the second half should result in good overall constant currency revenue growth for Teradata in the second half.
And with that, I'd now turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"

Good morning. During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins, expenses and EPS outlook on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other special items, including acquisition-related and other special items that may arise from time to time. Reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP items are included on the investor page of teradata.com. Additionally, historical information for each of our new business segments is also available on the investor page.
As you are aware, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has become a big headwind for many companies. And in Q1, that was even more than the 5 point impact we had suggested during our last earnings call. Correspondingly, approximately 40% of this revenue impact flow through the operating income, which is slightly more than the third we had estimated at that time due to the amount and rate of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The currency movement impacts our product gross margin, particularly resulting in an estimated 340 basis point reduction as compared to prior year's Q1.
Product gross margin in the quarter -- in the first quarter was 56.4%, as compared to 68.1% in the first quarter of 2014. In addition to the 340 basis point currency impact, product gross margin was also negatively impacted by product mix.
You may recall during the fourth quarter earnings call as part of our big data discussion, we mentioned we had a couple 1000 Series transactions that slipped out of Q4 and into the first part of 2015. Due to the aggregate deal size and naturally lower margin, this had a meaningful negative impact on overall product gross margin in the quarter of over 500 basis points. We also had some large 6000 Series transactions that moved out of Q1, which reduced our product gross margin in Q1 by approximately 150 basis points and a reduction in product volume in Q1 resulting in a 120 basis points decline in product gross margin.
We are forecasting product gross margin to recover significantly in Q2, but we believe it will still be about 200 basis points less than Q2 2014. Services gross margin in the quarter was 44.3%, down from 44.8% in Q1 2014. Services margins were negatively impacted by the timing of working process related to consulting projects and the investments we are making in our applications and Teradata Cloud capabilities. We are anticipating similar service gross margin in Q2 compared to Q1 2015. As a result, overall gross margin was 49.3% in the first quarter compared to 54.9% in the first quarter of 2014.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of 179 was 3% lower than the first quarter 2014, largely due to the benefit of currency as we held line on G&A expenses. We continue to scrutinize and optimize our expense structure to support our strategic initiatives and to improve our long-term operating efficiencies.
In Q1, we incurred incremental costs associated with this strategic investment strategy as we described in our last earnings call, and we expect this to build for Q2. Research and development expense in the quarter was $56 million, a 24% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014, as we increase and shifted investments to Big Data, cloud and marketing applications activity, which includes R&D expense associated with the acquisitions we made in 2014. I would also like to note, we do not capitalize R&D activity related to Big Data, cloud or marketing apps projects like we do for the Teradata -- for the core Teradata software projects, which resulted in higher R&D expense hitting the income statement currently.
We believe that the Q2 increase in R&D expense will be similar to or larger than the Q1 increase. Total R&D spend for the first quarter, which includes R&D expense, plus the additions to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less the capitalization of internally developed software, was $69 million. This compared to the $64 million in Q1 2014. As a result of lower revenue, the lower product gross profit and higher R&D expenses, as well as the hitting currency impact mentioned earlier, operating margin for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 19.9% in Q1 2014. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate in Q1 2015 was 26.7%, 130 basis points lower than the 28% in Q1 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.9% versus 30.4% in the same period 2014. The lower tax rates were primarily driven by a more favorable forecasted foreign earnings mix year-over-year.
Looking forward, for 2015, we expect our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% and our non-GAAP full year effective tax rate to range -- to be approximately 27.5% with the actual tax rate being heavily dependent upon our earnings mix. In addition, both rates presume that the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2014, will be retroactively reinstated at some point during 2015. Until such time this occurs, quarterly effective tax rates will be impacted by approximately 80 basis points.
In terms of earnings per share. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.15 compared to $0.37 in Q1 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $22 million or $0.15 in the first quarter of 2015, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.54 in Q1 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $222 million in Q1 2015, which was $120 million lower than the first quarter 2014. This was expected, as expected since we collected a sizable amount of receivables from Q4 2014 transactions in the fourth quarter, which left fewer receivables to collect in 2015. As you may recall, we described this as a favorable timing item for 2014's free cash flow during our last quarter's earnings call.
After $32 million of capital expenditures versus $33 million in the first quarter 2014, we generated approximately $190 million of free cash flow versus $310 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 2014. Again, the decrease in free cash flow for the first 3 months in 2015 over '14 was primarily a result of a reduction in income from operations, combined with the net changes in ARs that previously just mentioned.
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of equal to, to $50 million higher than GAAP net income. However, as I mentioned during the Q4 earnings call, the year-over-year free cash flow comparisons in the next quarter is expected to be less favorable and the full year 2015 free cash flow is expected to be more than $200 million lower than the 2014 free cash flow, primarily due to the favorable timing of collections of receivables in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Moving onto share repurchases. During Q1, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for approximately $273 million under our open market share repurchase program. We have used over $2 billion to buy back more than 52 million shares since the program's inception in 2008. As of March 31, we had approximately $131 million of remaining authorization in our open market share repurchase program. To provide for sufficient flexibility for future share repurchases, our Board of Directors just authorized another $300 million, resulting in a current authorization of $431 million to repurchase our shares. 
On March 25, we completed a $1 billion refinancing of our credit facilities, whereby, we refinanced our existing term loan with a new 5-year $600 million senior unsecured term loan. At the same time, we also replaced our $300 million revolving credit facility with a new 5-year $400 million revolving credit facility. Both facility is expired in March 2020.
As of March 31, 2015, our total debt outstanding was $600 million with no funds drawn under the new revolving credit facility. With respect to accounts receivable. AR decreased $24 million in Q1 2015 versus Q1 2014. Days sales was 79 days as of March 31, 2015, compared to 81 days as of March 31, 2014. The decrease in AR was primarily due to the currency impact as of March 31, 2015. Total deferred revenue was $508 million as of March 31, 2015, which was down $15 million from March 31, 2014.
Now turning to guidance for the full year. As Mike indicated, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range and flat-to-down 2% as reported. As a result of our Q1 performance, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of our initial $2.50 to $2.70 guidance range. We also expect GAAP EPS to be at the low end of the guidance range.
And I'll provide some added color on our expectations for Q2. We anticipate that reported revenue will be lower than last year's Q2 revenue. And as is always the case, the timing of large transactions have a meaningful impact on our quarterly revenue. We expect product gross margin will improve significantly from Q1, but we anticipate it to be a couple of points below prior year's Q2. We also believe services gross margin will approximate Q1 2015 services gross margin. And we expect R&D expense to be up close to 30% in Q2. The impact of just the projected lower margins and the estimated higher R&D expenses versus prior Q2 is approximately $0.14.
Let me assure you, we are not happy or satisfied with our results. However, we understand the challenges we face and the opportunities we have. And we will continue on the path to improve the performance of the company. In addition to our prior acquisitions to position us in faster growing markets, we have enhanced and advanced our technology in both core data warehousing and big data. We continue to optimize our cost structure, and we are in the process of realigning Teradata into 2 separate, but integrated business units led by 2 copresidentsto address the specific opportunities and challenges for each business.
In closing, we have great technology and a world-class services team, and we are investing to meet the current and future needs of our customers to gain a competitive advantage by leveraging their data assets and as a result, enhance our shareholder value.
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So that's our marketing applications, which is basically subscription model, cloud, Sofware-as-a-Service.

So out of those, professional services has a little bit of variability in it when we look out over full year at this point in time. But the others are all very predictable. It's recurring types of revenue. So when we look at the second half, we're clearly in the mid single-digits. And historically, not that, that predicts the future, but historically, we've been well within a percent or 2 of that more predictable revenue at this juncture of the year looking at the second half, and it could be higher, it could be lower by a point. So we feel very good about that. And that's 2/3 of our revenue. So that leaves the remaining 1/3 of our revenue in the second half being the pure data warehouse product revenue, which basically we've had trouble with our growth. Last year, it declined 2%. And what we've modeled this year is that our data warehouse product revenue would decline 1% for the year and in the second half would basically be flattish or down 1%. So I think what we've modeled in the second half 2/3 of the revenue, it's very solid. I think the wildcard is our product revenue, data product warehouse revenue. And it could be higher. It could be a little lower, but I don't think it will be much lower than that."

We could be possibly 200 basis points lower than last year with this model that we're seeing in 2015. So the color going forward outside of 2015, difficult.

That's the center of gravity with Teradata, is we do extremely well with large enterprises. And having our marketing applications business aligned together with our Teradata data warehouse business, we naturally more towards the large enterprise accounts. And we did good and we've got good leverage, and the opportunities there are big. But what we needed to do was get our marketing applications business lined up, meaning, research and development consulting Services sales and the whole supply chain while going on after the broader market. And in order to do that, we had to separate things out and get the R&D organization closer to the customer, closer to the sales organization and go after the broader mid-market and make investments more in our marketing cloud, digital messaging center's a first step, and get on with that type of a motion. To your point, there might be some sacrifice of synergy and leverage with the Teradata data warehouse field organization. But we do think it's minimal because the analytic applications, the campaign management solutions and everything else, drive usage on the Teradata data warehouse in those customers. So I want to be clear on that. The marketing applications drive volume usage, queries and everything else on the Teradata data warehouse side of the business, which is one of the reasons why we invested heavily to get into the marketing space.
And that was our last question. So in closing, I want to say we're well-positioned with our technology solutions and services, and we have a strong customer base to build upon.

Mike Koehler, Teradata's CEO, will begin today by summarizing Teradata's results. Steve Scheppmann, Teradata's CFO, will then provide more details regarding our financial performance.
Our discussion today includes forecasts and other information that are considered forward-looking statements. While these statements reflects our current outlook, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially. These risk factors are described in Teradata's 10-K and other filings with the SEC.
On today's call, we will also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial information, which excludes such items as stock-based compensation expense and other special items, as well as other non-GAAP items, such as free cash flow and constant currency revenue comparisons.
A reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our reported GAAP results and other information concerning these measures is included in our earnings release and on the Investor page of Teradata's website. A replay of this conference call will also be available later today on that site.  Teradata assumes no obligation to update or revise the information included in this conference call whether as a result of new information or future results.
I'll now turn the call over to Mike."

Our revenue shortfall was mainly due to opportunities in the",1612,"Thanks, Gregg, and good morning, everyone. Teradata's first quarter results came in lower than what we have expected. Revenue of $582 million was down 7% as reported and 2% in constant currency. Our revenue shortfall was mainly due to opportunities in the Americas that moved to the second quarter. Normally, the puts and takes with opportunities in a given quarter somewhat offset each other, but this was not the case in Q1.  In addition, currency movement from our last earnings call had an additional negative impact on our reported revenue and profit. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share declined to $0.30, primarily due to the 7% decline in revenue, as reported, and the lower product margins, which were negatively impacted by product revenue mix, currency and lower volume. Steve will be providing more details on this later on the call. 
In addition to the currency impacts, we continue to experience headwinds from the IT spending environment and the pressure it is causing on large IT CapEx transactions, especially in the U.S. Recent third-party surveys have reported that many of the 2015 IT budgets are flat to down, which confirms what our surveys have been showing from our larger U.S. customers. 
Although we are disappointed with our start in 2015, we believe we are still on track to finish 2015 within the guidance range as provided at the start of the year, which I'll talk more about later on the call.
We continually make changes to help improve the performance of the company. During the quarter, we announced the appointments of Teradata co-presidents, Bob Fair and Hermann Wimmer, and created 2 divisions: our Data and Analytics division, led by Hermann; and our Marketing Applications division, led by Bob. Each division has its own dedicated resources, including R&D, sales, consulting, customer support and marketing. We are looking to get better focus, alignment and execution, and most important, better results with this new model.
We now have reporting segments for each of the divisions, which I'll now provide some commentary on. In Q1, our Data and Analytics division reported revenue of $536 million, which was down 7% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Within the Data and Analytics division, the Americas revenue declined 6% in constant currency due to the opportunities that moved to Q2. International grew 7% in constant currency in the first quarter, led by continued strong growth in Western Europe.
Looking at the second quarter, the Americas has an opportunity for good revenue growth versus prior year. Their funnel and large CapEx opportunities have increased compared to prior year, which were partially aided by the slips from Q1. On the other hand, we are expecting international revenue to lightly decline in constant currency in Q2, mainly due to the prior year comparable, when international data and analytics revenue grew 16% in constant currency.  Reported revenue could decline mid-teens in international, with currency having an 11-point negative impact in Q2 based on April-ending currency rates. 
We had a good quarter adding new data and analytics customers. Data Warehouse, Aster and Teradata Cloud new customer wins included: a U.S. national health care delivery company, which is implementing a data warehouse, our Hadoop appliances and QueryGrid; Siemens Healthcare, which is installing a data warehouse along with QueryGrid; one of the world's largest telco providers in China is implementing an IDW; LCL, a leading French retail bank, is also implementing an IDW; an Australia government agency, which chose Aster and Hadoop for advanced analytics for its intelligence community; one of the top U.S. construction companies, which is implementing an IDW on-premise, and also along, using our Teradata Cloud for development; Sera Asset Management, a leading Latin American pension management firm, selected our Teradata Cloud for its data warehousing; and a leading U.S. home health care company is replacing a competitor's on-premise data warehouse with our Teradata Cloud data warehouse.
We continue to experience good activity with our big data-related solutions. Our Q1 Big Data revenue was above the quarterly run rate of our 2015 target of $150 million in revenue. Our 1000 Extreme Data Appliance, which is included in our Big Data revenues results, can create lumpiness in a given quarter due to the size of some of these transactions. The 1000 Series helped our Big Data revenue results in Q1, but will most likely not help us in Q2.
Activity with our Teradata Cloud continues to increase, both with new customers as well as existing customers moving or adding workloads in our cloud, such as for tests and development, discovery and disaster recovery. 
We continue to enhance and innovate with our core data warehouse platforms. We recently announced our latest 2000 Series data warehouse appliance, giving customers faster in-memory processing and also doubling the power. Customers can analyze twice the amount of data twice as fast while using only 1/2 of the data center floor space.
We also announced the Teradata Software-Defined data warehouse, which enables companies to securely create multi-tenancy data warehouse environments within a single database. This allows companies to meet various security and privacy needs of different jurisdictions. For example, multinational companies can keep country data separate for regulatory compliance. 
We also continue to add capabilities to our UDA, with emphasis on integration and simplification for our customers. We recently enhanced QueryGrid to connect with 2 additional Hadoop distributions. 
And Gartner again named Teradata a leader in its recent  Analytics Magic Quadrant, calling out the strength of our UDA and our continuous technology enhancements.
Turning to our Marketing Applications business. Q1 revenue of $46 million was down 10% as reported and 3% in constant currency. The key metrics we are focused on, recurring revenue and annual recurring revenue, each grew low single digits in constant currency. 
New Marketing Application customer wins in the quarter included: a top-5 oil company, which selected our Marketing Resource Management, or MRM, solution; [indiscernible], a large French health insurance group, which is also implementing our MRM solution; a leading gaming company, which chose MRM; and a Fortune 100 financial services company that selected our campaign management solution.
Although we are not happy with the results of our Marketing Applications business over the past year or so, we have continued to add to our leading solutions. We released our digital marketing center in Q1. This cloud-based solution integrates our digital messaging, campaign management and marketing analytics solutions to enable customers to create more effective campaigns across all channels and to execute them much faster. Digital messaging center is a key to helping us go broader in the market.
We continue to gain recognition with industry analysts with our marketing applications. In addition to being named the leader in MRM by Gartner in the previous quarter, Teradata was once again named a leader in the Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management this quarter, noting our completeness of vision and our ability to execute.
We feel we have a hand on the key issues that have been impacting our performance and that we are taking the right actions to address them. One action was to go to an integrated business model that we would have better focus, alignment and execution, and most importantly, better results. We believe this is a big first step in getting our Marketing Applications business back on track, along with the increased investments we are making. These investments will help us to get better position to go broader in the market, both with our cloud offerings and our demand creation, which we did not do a good job of addressing previously.
Our goal in 2015 is to have annual recurring revenue growth of mid- to high-single digits in constant currency as we exit the year and to position ourselves for higher recurring revenue growth in 2016. 
As we said on our last call, we are making additional investments in 2015 in Big Data, Marketing Applications and the Teradata Cloud, all of which are big growth opportunities for Teradata. We believe this is the key for us to get to a mid-single-digits growth rate or higher in 2016.  At the same time, we have continually optimized our cost structure and resources over the years, and we will be even more focused on this in 2015 to help fund these growth investments.
Turning to guidance. We believe we are still on track to meet the 3% to 5% constant currency revenue growth guidance range provided at the start of the year or flat to minus 2% as reported. As a result of our Q1 earnings per share shortfall, we now estimate we will be at the low end of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range of $2.50 to $2.70 for the full year. We expect to make good progress in Q2 and in the second half of the year as well. We currently are seeing higher growth in the second half of the year. Our revenue that has higher visibility, or predictability, is forecasted to grow mid-single digits in constant currency. This revenue includes all of our Marketing Applications business and the maintenance, subscription and consulting services from our Data and Analytics business.  And this accounts for approximately 2/3 of our total revenue. 
As a note, our recurring revenue continues to grow and is now in the mid-40s as a percent of our total revenue. The remaining 1/3 of our revenue that has lower visibility, or predictability, in the second half is our data warehousing product revenue. Any growth in our data warehouse product revenue in the second half should result in good overall constant currency revenue growth for Teradata in the second half.
And with that, I'd now turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"

Good morning. During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins, expenses and EPS outlook on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other special items, including acquisition-related and other special items that may arise from time to time. Reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP items are included on the Investor page of teradata.com. Additionally, historical information for each of our new business segments is also available on the Investor page.
As you are aware, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has become a big headwind for many companies, and in Q1, it was even more than the 5 point impact we have suggested during our last earnings call. Correspondingly, approximately 40% of this revenue impact flow through the operating income, which was slightly more than the third we had estimated at that time, due to the amount and rate of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The currency movement impacts our product gross margin particularly resulting in an estimated 340 basis point reduction as compared to prior year's Q1.
Product gross margin in the first quarter was 56.4% as compared to 68.1% in the first quarter of 2014. In addition to the 340 basis point currency impact, product gross margin was also negatively impacted by product mix.
You may recall, during the fourth quarter earnings call, as part of our Big Data discussion, we mentioned we had a couple of 1000 Series transactions that slipped out of Q4 and into the first part of 2015. Due to the aggregate deal size and naturally lower margin, this had a meaningful negative impact on overall product gross margin in the quarter of over 500 basis points. We also had some large 6000 Series transactions that moved out of Q1, which reduced our product gross margin in Q1 by approximately 150 basis points. And a reduction in product volume in Q1 resulted in a 120 basis point decline in product gross margin.  We are forecasting product gross margin to recover significantly in Q2, but we believe it'll still be about 200 basis points less than Q2 2014. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was 44.3%, down from 44.8% in Q1 2014. Services margins were negatively impacted by the timing of work-in-process-related consulting projects and the investments we are making in our applications and Teradata Cloud capabilities. We are anticipating similar service gross margin in Q2 compared to Q1 2015. As a result, overall gross margin was 49.3% in the first quarter compared to 54.9% in the first quarter of 2014.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of 179 was 3% lower than the first quarter 2014, largely due to the benefit of currency, as we held line on G&A expenses. 
We continue to scrutinize and optimize our expense structure to support our strategic initiatives and to improve our long-term operating efficiencies.  In Q1, we incurred incremental costs associated with this strategic investment strategy, as we described on our last earnings call, and we expect this to build for Q2. 
Research and development expense in the quarter was $56 million, a 24% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014, as we increase and shifted investments to Big Data, Cloud and Marketing Applications activity, which includes R&D expense associated with the acquisitions we made in 2014. I would also like to note, we do not capitalize R&D activity related to Big Data, Cloud or Marketing Apps projects like we do for the Teradata -- for the core Teradata software projects, which resulted in higher R&D expense hitting the income statement currently.  We believe that the Q2 increase in R&D expense will be similar to or larger than the Q1 increase. 
Total R&D spend for the first quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the addition to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less the capitalization of internally developed software, was $69 million. This compared to the $64 million in Q1 2014. As a result of lower revenue, the lower product gross profit and higher R&D expenses as well as the currency impact mentioned earlier, operating margin for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 19.9% in Q1 2014. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate in Q1 2015 was 26.7%, 130 basis points lower than the 28% in Q1 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.9% versus 30.4% in the same period 2014. The lower tax rates were primarily driven by more favorable forecasted foreign earnings mix year-over-year.
Looking forward, for 2015, we expect our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% and our non-GAAP full year effective tax rate to range -- to be approximately 27.5%, with the actual tax rate being heavily dependent upon our earnings mix. In addition, both rates presume that the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2014, will be retroactively reinstated at some point during 2015. Until such time this occurs, quarterly effective tax rates will be impacted by approximately 80 basis points.
In terms of earnings per share. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.15 compared to $0.37 in Q1 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $22 million or $0.15 in the first quarter of 2015, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.54 in Q1 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $222 million in Q1 2015, which was $120 million lower than the first quarter of 2014. This was expected -- as expected, since we collected a sizable amount of receivables from Q4 2014 transactions in the fourth quarter, which left fewer receivables to collect in 2015. As you may recall, we described this as a favorable timing item for 2014's free cash flow during our last quarter's earnings call.
After $32 million of capital expenditures versus $33 million in the first quarter 2014, we generated approximately $190 million of free cash flow versus $310 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 2014. Again, the decrease in free cash flow for the first 3 months in 2015 over '14 was primarily a result of the reduction in income from operations, combined with the net changes in AR, as I previously just mentioned.
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of equal to, to $50 million higher than GAAP net income. However, as I mentioned during the Q4 earnings call, the year-over-year free cash flow comparisons in the next quarter is expected to be less favorable and the full year 2015 free cash flow is expected to be more than $200 million lower than the 2014 free cash flow, primarily due to the favorable timing of collections of receivables in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Moving on to share repurchases. During Q1, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for approximately $273 million under our open-market share repurchase program. We have used over $2 billion to buy back more than 52 million shares since the program's inception in 2008. As of March 31, we had approximately $131 million of remaining authorization in our open-market share repurchase program. To provide for sufficient flexibility for future share repurchases, our Board of Directors just authorized another $300 million, resulting in a current authorization of $431 million to repurchase our shares. 
On March 25, we completed a $1 billion refinancing of our credit facilities, whereby we refinanced our existing term loan with a new 5-year $600 million senior unsecured term loan. At the same time, we also replaced a $300 million revolving credit facility with a new 5-year $400 million revolving credit facility. Both facilities expire in March 2020.  As of March 31, 2015, our total debt outstanding was $600 million, with no funds drawn under the new revolving credit facility. 
With respect to accounts receivable, AR decreased $24 million in Q1 2015 versus Q1 2014. Days sales was 79 days as of March 31, 2015, compared to 81 days as of March 31, 2014. The decrease in AR was primarily due to the currency impact as of March 31, 2015. 
Total deferred revenue was $508 million as of March 31, 2015, which was down $15 million from March 31, 2014.
Now turning to guidance for the full year. As Mike indicated, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range and flat to down 2% as reported. As a result of our Q1 performance, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of our initial $2.50 to $2.70 guidance range. We also expect GAAP EPS to be at the low end of the guidance range.
And I'll provide some added color on our expectations for Q2. We anticipate that reported revenue will be lower than last year's Q2 revenue. And as is always the case, the timing of large transactions have a meaningful impact on our quarterly revenue. We expect product gross margin will improve significantly from Q1, but we anticipate it to be a couple of points below prior year's Q2. We also believe services gross margin will approximate Q1 2015 services gross margin. And we expect R&D expense to be up close to 30% in Q2. The impact of just the projected lower margins and the estimated higher R&D expenses versus prior Q2 is approximately $0.14.
Let me assure you, we are not happy or satisfied with our results. However, we understand the challenges we face and the opportunities we have, and we will continue on the path to improve the performance of the company. 
In addition to our prior acquisitions to position us in faster-growing markets, we have enhanced and advanced our technology in both core data warehousing and big data. We continue to optimize our cost structure, and we are in the process of realigning Teradata into 2 separate but integrated business units, led by 2 co-presidents, to address the specific opportunities and challenges for each business.
In closing, we have great technology and a world-class services team, and we are investing to meet the current and future needs of our customers to gain a competitive advantage by leveraging their data assets and, as a result, enhance our shareholder value.
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

The confidence in the second half basically comes from our more predictable revenue, the revenue we have visibility to. So that's our Marketing Applications, which is basically subscription model, cloud, Software-as-a-Service; and then in the Data and Analytics part of the company, it comes from our maintenance, our subscription as well as our professional services. So out of those, professional services has a little bit of variability in it when we look out over a full year at this point in time, but the others are all very predictable. It's recurring types of revenue. So when you look at the second half, we're clearly in the mid-single-digits. And historically, not that predicts the future, but historically, we've been well within 1% or 2% of that more predictable revenue at this juncture of the year looking at the second half, and it could be higher, it could be lower by 1 point. So we feel very good about that. And that's 2/3 of our revenue. So that leaves the remaining 1/3 of our revenue in the second half being the pure data warehouse product revenue, which basically we've had trouble with our growth. Last year, it declined 2%. And what we've modeled this year is that our data warehouse product revenue would decline 1% for the year and in the second half would basically be flattish or down 1%. So I think, and what we've modeled in the second half, 2/3 of the revenue, it's very solid. I think the wildcard is our product revenue, data product warehouse revenue, and it could be higher. It could be a little lower, but I don't think it would be much lower than that."

That's the center of gravity with Teradata is we do extremely well with large enterprises. And having our Marketing Applications business aligned together with our Teradata Data Warehouse business, we're naturally more towards the large enterprise accounts. And we did good, and we've got good leverage, and the opportunities there are big. But what we needed to do was get our Marketing Applications business lined up. Meaning, research and development, consulting services sales and the whole supply chain on going on after the broader market. And in order to do that, we had to separate things out and get the R&D organization closer to the customer, closer to the sales organization and go after the broader mid-market and make investments more in our marketing cloud, digital messaging center as a first step, and get on with that type of a motion. To your point, there might be some sacrifice of synergy and leverage with the Teradata Data Warehouse field organization, but we do think it's minimal, because the analytic applications, the campaign management solutions and everything else, drive usage on the Teradata Data Warehouse in those customers. So I want to be clear on that. The Marketing Applications drive volume usage, queries and everything else on the Teradata Data Warehouse side of the business, which is one of the reasons why we invested heavily to get into the marketing space.
And that was our last question. So in closing, I want to say we're well positioned with our technology solutions and services, and we have a strong customer base to build upon. We're going to continue to realign and invest in our company to optimize results and shareholder value. And we're going to be balancing the short term with the long term, as always. 
With that, I'd like to wish all of you a good day. Thank you."

Teradata's first quarter results came in lower than what we had expected. Revenue of $582 million was down 7% as reported and 2% in constant currency.

Revenue of $582 million was down 7% as reported and 2% in constant currency. Our revenue shortfall was mainly due to opportunities in the Americas that moved to the second quarter. Normally, the puts and takes with opportunities in a given quarter somewhat offset each other, but this was not the case in Q1. In addition, currency movement from our last earnings call had an additional negative impact on our reported revenue and profit. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share declined to $0.30, primarily due to the 7% decline in revenue as reported, and the lower product margins which were negatively impacted by product revenue mix, currency and lower volume. Steve will be providing more details on this later on the call. 
In addition to their currency impacts, we continue to experience headwinds from the IT spending environment and the pressure it is causing on large IT CapEx transactions, especially in the U.S. Recent third-party surveys have reported that many of the 2015 IT budgets are flat to down, which confirms what our surveys have been showing from our larger U.S. customers. 
Although we are disappointed with our start in 2015, we believe we are still on track to finish 2015 within the guidance range as provided at the start of the year, which I'll talk more about later on the call.
We continually make changes to help improve the performance of the company. During the quarter, we announced the appointments of Teradata co-presidents, Bob Fair and Hermann Wimmer, and created 2 divisions: our Data and Analytics division, led by Hermann; and our Marketing Applications division, led by Bob. Each division has its own dedicated resources, including R&D, sales, consulting, customer support and marketing. We are looking to get better focus, alignment and execution, and most important, better results with this new model.
We now have reporting segments for each of the divisions, which I'll now provide some commentary on. In Q1, our Data and Analytics division reported revenue of $536 million, which was down 7% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Within the Data and Analytics division, the Americas revenue declined 6% in constant currency due to the opportunities that moved to Q2. International grew 7% in constant currency in the first quarter, led by continued strong growth in Western Europe.
Looking at the second quarter, the Americas has an opportunity for good revenue growth versus prior year. Their funnel and large CapEx opportunities have increased compared to prior year, which were partially aided by the slips from Q1. On the other hand, we are expecting international revenue to likely decline in constant currency in Q2, mainly due to the prior year comparable, when international data and analytics revenue grew 16% in constant currency. Reported revenue could decline mid-teens in international, with currency having an 11-point negative impact in Q2 based on April-ending currency rates. 
We had a good quarter adding new data and analytics customers. Data Warehouse, Aster and Teradata Cloud new customer wins included: a U.S. national health care delivery company, which is implementing a data warehouse, our Hadoop appliances and QueryGrid; Siemens Healthcare, which is installing a data warehouse along with QueryGrid; one of the world's largest telco providers in China is implementing an IDW; LCL, a leading French retail bank, is also implementing an IDW; an Australia government agency, which chose Aster and Hadoop for advanced analytics for its intelligence community; one of the top U.S. construction companies, which is implementing an IDW on-premise, and also along, using our Teradata Cloud for development; Sera Asset Management, a leading Latin American pension management firm, selected our Teradata Cloud for its data warehousing; and a leading U.S. home health care company is replacing a competitor's on-premise data warehouse with our Teradata Cloud data warehouse.
We continue to experience good activity with our big data-related solutions. Our Q1 Big Data revenue was above the quarterly run rate of our 2015 target of $150 million in revenue. Our 1000 Extreme Data Appliance, which is included in our Big Data revenue results, can create lumpiness in a given quarter due to the size of some of these transactions. The 1000 Series helped our Big Data revenue results in Q1, but will most likely not help us in Q2.
Activity with our Teradata Cloud continues to increase, both with new customers as well as existing customers moving or adding workloads in our cloud, such as for tests and development, discovery and disaster recovery. 
We continue to enhance and innovate with our core data warehouse platforms. We recently announced our latest 2000 Series data warehouse appliance, giving customers faster in-memory processing and also doubling the power. Customers can analyze twice the amount of data twice as fast while using only 1/2 of the data center floor space.
We also announced the Teradata Software-Defined data warehouse, which enables companies to securely create multi-tenancy data warehouse environments within a single database. This allows companies to meet various security and privacy needs of different jurisdictions. For example, multinational companies can keep country data separate for regulatory compliance. 
We also continue to add capabilities to our UDA, with emphasis on integration and simplification for our customers. We recently enhanced QueryGrid to connect with 2 additional Hadoop distributions. 
And Gartner again named Teradata a leader in its recent Analytics Magic Quadrant, calling out the strength of our UDA and our continuous technology enhancements.
Turning to our Marketing Applications business. Q1 revenue of $46 million was down 10% as reported and 3% in constant currency. The key metrics we are focused on, recurring revenue and annual recurring revenue, each grew low single digits in constant currency. 
New Marketing Application customer wins in the quarter included: a top-5 oil company, which selected our Marketing Resource Management, or MRM, solution; [indiscernible], a large French health insurance group which is also implementing our MRM solution; a leading gaming company which chose MRM; and a Fortune 100 financial services company that selected our campaign management solution.
Although we are not happy with the results of our Marketing Applications business over the past year or so, we have continued to add to our leading solutions. We released our digital marketing center in Q1. This cloud-based solution integrates our digital messaging, campaign management and marketing analytics solutions to enable customers to create more effective campaigns across all channels and to execute them much faster. Digital messaging center is a key to helping us go broader in the market.
We continue to gain recognition with industry analysts with our marketing applications. In addition to being named the leader in MRM by Gartner in the previous quarter, Teradata was once again named a leader in the Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management this quarter, noting our completeness of vision and our ability to execute.
We feel we have a hand on the key issues that have been impacting our performance and that we are taking the right actions to address them. One action was to go to an integrated business model that we would have better focus, alignment and execution, and most importantly, better results. We believe this is a big first step in getting our Marketing Applications business back on track, along with the increased investments we are making. These investments will help us to get better position to go broader in the market, both with our cloud offerings and our demand creation, which we did not do a good job of addressing previously.
Our goal in 2015 is to have annual recurring revenue growth of mid- to high-single digits in constant currency as we exit the year and to position ourselves for higher recurring revenue growth in 2016. 
As we said on our last call, we are making additional investments in 2015 in Big Data, Marketing Applications and the Teradata Cloud, all of which are big growth opportunities for Teradata. We believe this is the key for us to get to a mid-single-digits growth rate or higher in 2016. At the same time, we have continually optimized our cost structure and resources over the years, and we will be even more focused on this in 2015 to help fund these growth investments.
Turning to guidance. We believe we are still on track to meet the 3% to 5% constant currency revenue growth guidance range provided at the start of the year or flat to minus 2% as reported. As a result of our Q1 earnings per share shortfall, we now estimate we will be at the low end of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range of $2.50 to $2.70 for the full year. We expect to make good progress in Q2 and in the second half of the year as well. We currently are seeing higher growth in the second half of the year. Our revenue that has higher visibility or predictability, is forecasted to grow mid-single digits in constant currency. This revenue includes all of our Marketing Applications business and the maintenance, subscription and consulting services from our Data and Analytics business. And this accounts for approximately 2/3 of our total revenue. 
As a note, our recurring revenue continues to grow and is now in the mid-40s as a percent of our total revenue. The remaining 1/3 of our revenue that has lower visibility or predictability in the second half, is our data warehousing product revenue. Any growth in our data warehouse product revenue in the second half should result in good overall constant currency revenue growth for Teradata in the second half.
And with that, I'd now turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"

Good morning. During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins, expenses and EPS outlook on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other special items, including acquisition-related and other special items that may arise from time to time. Reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP items are included on the Investor page of teradata.com. Additionally, historical information for each of our new business segments is also available on the Investor page.
As you are aware, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has become a big headwind for many companies, and in Q1, it was even more than the 5 point impact we had suggested during our last earnings call. Correspondingly, approximately 40% of this revenue impact flow through to operating income, which was slightly more than the third we had estimated at that time, due to the amount and rate of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The currency movement impacts our product gross margin particularly resulting in an estimated 340 basis point reduction as compared to prior year's Q1.
Product gross margin in the first quarter was 56.4% as compared to 68.1% in the first quarter of 2014. In addition to the 340 basis point currency impact, product gross margin was also negatively impacted by product mix.
You may recall during the fourth quarter earnings call, as part of our Big Data discussion, we mentioned we had a couple of 1000 Series transactions that slipped out of Q4 and into the first part of 2015. Due to the aggregate deal size and naturally lower margin, this had a meaningful negative impact on overall product gross margin in the quarter of over 500 basis points. We also had some large 6000 Series transactions that moved out of Q1, which reduced our product gross margin in Q1 by approximately 150 basis points. And a reduction in product volume in Q1 resulted in a 120 basis point decline in product gross margin. We are forecasting product gross margin to recover significantly in Q2, but we believe it'll still be about 200 basis points less than Q2 2014. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was 44.3%, down from 44.8% in Q1 2014. Services margins were negatively impacted by the timing of work-in-process-related consulting projects and the investments we are making in our applications and Teradata Cloud capabilities. We are anticipating similar service gross margin in Q2 compared to Q1 2015. As a result, overall gross margin was 49.3% in the first quarter compared to 54.9% in the first quarter of 2014.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $170 million was 3% lower than the first quarter 2014, largely due to the benefit of currency, as we held line on G&A expenses. 
We continue to scrutinize and optimize our expense structure to support our strategic initiatives and to improve our long-term operating efficiencies. In Q1, we incurred incremental costs associated with this strategic investment strategy, as we described on our last earnings call, and we expect this to build for Q2. 
Research and development expense in the quarter was $56 million, a 24% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014, as we increase and shifted investments to Big Data, Cloud and Marketing Applications activity, which includes R&D expenses associated with the acquisitions we made in 2014. I would also like to note, we do not capitalize R&D activity related to Big Data, Cloud or Marketing Apps projects like we do for the Teradata -- for the core Teradata software projects, which resulted in higher R&D expense hitting the income statement currently.  We believe that the Q2 increase in R&D expense will be similar to or larger than the Q1 increase. 
Total R&D spend for the first quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the addition to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less the capitalization of internally developed software, was $69 million. This compared to the $64 million in Q1 2014. As a result of lower revenue, the lower product gross profit and higher R&D expenses as well as the currency impact mentioned earlier, operating margin for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 19.9% in Q1 2014. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate in Q1 2015 was 26.7%, 130 basis points lower than the 28% in Q1 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.9% versus 30.4% in the same period 2014. The lower tax rates were primarily driven by more favorable forecasted foreign earnings mix year-over-year.
Looking forward, for 2015, we expect our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% and our non-GAAP full year effective tax rate to range -- to be approximately 27.5%, with the actual tax rate being heavily dependent upon our earnings mix. In addition, both rates presume that the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2014, will be retroactively reinstated at some point during 2015. Until such time this occurs, quarterly effective tax rates will be impacted by approximately 80 basis points.
In terms of earnings per share. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.15 compared to $0.37 in Q1 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $22 million or $0.15 in the first quarter of 2015, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.54 in Q1 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $222 million in Q1 2015, which was $120 million lower than the first quarter of 2014. This was expected -- as expected, since we collected a sizable amount of receivables from Q4 2014 transactions in the fourth quarter, which left fewer receivables to collect in 2015. As you may recall, we described this as a favorable timing item for 2014's free cash flow during our last quarter's earnings call.
After $32 million of capital expenditures versus $33 million in the first quarter 2014, we generated approximately $190 million of free cash flow versus $310 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 2014. Again, the decrease in free cash flow for the first 3 months in 2015 over '14 was primarily a result of the reduction in income from operations, combined with the net changes in AR, as I previously just mentioned.
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of equal to, to $50 million higher than GAAP net income. However, as I mentioned during the Q4 earnings call, the year-over-year free cash flow comparisons in the next quarters are expected to be less favorable and the full year 2015 free cash flow is expected to be more than $200 million lower than the 2014 free cash flow, primarily due to the favorable timing of collections of receivables in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Moving on to share repurchases. During Q1, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for approximately $273 million under our open-market share repurchase program. We have used over $2 billion to buy back more than 52 million shares since the program's inception in 2008. As of March 31, we had approximately $131 million of remaining authorization in our open-market share repurchase program. To provide for sufficient flexibility for future share repurchases, our Board of Directors just authorized another $300 million, resulting in a current authorization of $431 million to repurchase our shares. 
On March 25, we completed a $1 billion refinancing of our credit facilities, whereby we refinanced our existing term loan with a new 5-year $600 million senior unsecured term loan. At the same time, we also replaced a $300 million revolving credit facility with a new 5-year $400 million revolving credit facility. Both facilities expire in March 2020. As of March 31, 2015, our total debt outstanding was $600 million, with no funds drawn under the new revolving credit facility. 
With respect to accounts receivable, AR decreased $24 million in Q1 2015 versus Q1 2014. Days sales was 79 days as of March 31, 2015, compared to 81 days as of March 31, 2014. The decrease in AR was primarily due to the currency impact as of March 31, 2015. 
Total deferred revenue was $508 million as of March 31, 2015, which was down $15 million from March 31, 2014.
Now turning to guidance for the full year. As Mike indicated, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range and flat to down 2% as reported. As a result of our Q1 performance, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of our initial $2.50 to $2.70 guidance range. We also expect GAAP EPS to be at the low end of the guidance range.
And I'll provide some added color on our expectations for Q2. We anticipate that reported revenue will be lower than last year's Q2 revenue. And as is always the case, the timing of large transactions have a meaningful impact on our quarterly revenue. We expect product gross margin will improve significantly from Q1, but we anticipate it to be a couple of points below prior year's Q2. We also believe services gross margin will approximate Q1 2015 services gross margin. And we expect R&D expense to be up close to 30% in Q2. The impact of just the projected lower margins and the estimated higher R&D expenses versus prior Q2 is approximately $0.14.
Let me assure you, we are not happy or satisfied with our results. However, we understand the challenges we face and the opportunities we have, and we will continue on the path to improve the performance of the company. 
In addition to our prior acquisitions to position us in faster-growing markets, we have enhanced and advanced our technology in both core data warehousing and big data. We continue to optimize our cost structure, and we are in the process of realigning Teradata into 2 separate but integrated business units, led by 2 co-presidents, to address the specific opportunities and challenges for each business.
In closing, we have great technology and a world-class services team, and we are investing to meet the current and future needs of our customers to gain a competitive advantage by leveraging their data assets and as a result, enhance our shareholder value.
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

The confidence in the second half basically comes from our more predictable revenue, the revenue we have visibility to. So that's our Marketing Applications, which is basically subscription model, cloud, Software-as-a-Service; and then in the Data and Analytics part of the company, it comes from our maintenance, our subscriptions as well as our professional services. So out of those, professional services has a little bit of variability in it when we look out over a full year at this point in time, but the others are all very predictable. It's recurring types of revenue. So when you look at the second half, we're clearly in the mid-single-digits. And historically, not that, that predicts the future, but historically, we've been well within 1% or 2% of that more predictable revenue at this juncture of the year looking at the second half, and it could be higher, it could be lower by 1 point. So we feel very good about that. And that's 2/3 of our revenue. So that leaves the remaining 1/3 of our revenue in the second half being the pure data warehouse product revenue, which basically we've had trouble with our growth. Last year, it declined 2%. And what we've modeled this year is that our data warehouse product revenue would decline 1% for the year and in the second half would basically be flattish or down 1%. So I think, and what we've modeled in the second half, 2/3 of the revenue, it's very solid. I think the wildcard is our product revenue, data warehouse product revenue, and it could be higher. It could be a little lower, but I don't think it would be much lower than that."

That's the center of gravity with Teradata is we do extremely well with large enterprises. And having our Marketing Applications business aligned together with our Teradata Data Warehouse business, we're naturally more towards the large enterprise accounts. And we did good, and we got good leverage, and the opportunities there are big. But what we needed to do was get our Marketing Applications business lined up. Meaning, research and development, consulting services sales and the whole supply chain on going after the broader market. And in order to do that, we had to separate things out and get the R&D organization closer to the customer, closer to the sales organization and go after the broader mid-market and make investments more in our marketing cloud, digital messaging center as a first step, and get on with that type of a motion. To your point, there might be some sacrifice of synergy and leverage with the Teradata Data Warehouse field organization, but we do think it's minimal, because the analytic applications, the campaign management solutions and everything else, drive usage on the Teradata Data Warehouse in those customers. So I want to be clear on that. The Marketing Applications drive volume usage, queries and everything else on the Teradata Data Warehouse side of the business, which is one of the reasons why we invested heavily to get into the marketing space.
And that was our last question. So in closing, I want to say we're well positioned with our technology solutions and services, and we have a strong customer base to build upon. We're going to continue to realign and invest in our company to optimize results and shareholder value. And we're going to be balancing the short term with the long term, as always.

Teradata's first quarter results came in lower than what we had expected. Revenue of $582 million was down 7% as reported and 2% in constant currency.

Revenue of $582 million was down 7% as reported and 2% in constant currency. Our revenue shortfall was mainly due to opportunities in the Americas that moved to the second quarter. Normally, the puts and takes with opportunities in a given quarter somewhat offset each other, but this was not the case in Q1. In addition, currency movement from our last earnings call had an additional negative impact on our reported revenue and profit. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share declined to $0.30, primarily due to the 7% decline in revenue as reported, and the lower product margins which were negatively impacted by product revenue mix, currency and lower volume. Steve will be providing more details on this later on the call. 
In addition to their currency impacts, we continue to experience headwinds from the IT spending environment and the pressure it is causing on large IT CapEx transactions, especially in the U.S. Recent third-party surveys have reported that many of the 2015 IT budgets are flat to down, which confirms what our surveys have been showing from our larger U.S. customers. 
Although we are disappointed with our start in 2015, we believe we are still on track to finish 2015 within the guidance range as provided at the start of the year, which I'll talk more about later on the call.
We continually make changes to help improve the performance of the company. During the quarter, we announced the appointments of Teradata co-presidents, Bob Fair and Hermann Wimmer, and created 2 divisions: our Data and Analytics division, led by Hermann; and our Marketing Applications division, led by Bob. Each division has its own dedicated resources, including R&D, sales, consulting, customer support and marketing. We are looking to get better focus, alignment and execution, and most important, better results with this new model.
We now have reporting segments for each of the divisions, which I'll now provide some commentary on. In Q1, our Data and Analytics division reported revenue of $536 million, which was down 7% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Within the Data and Analytics division, the Americas revenue declined 6% in constant currency due to the opportunities that moved to Q2. International grew 7% in constant currency in the first quarter, led by continued strong growth in Western Europe.
Looking at the second quarter, the Americas has an opportunity for good revenue growth versus prior year. Their funnel and large CapEx opportunities have increased compared to prior year, which were partially aided by the slips from Q1. On the other hand, we are expecting international revenue to likely decline in constant currency in Q2, mainly due to the prior year comparable, when international data and analytics revenue grew 16% in constant currency. Reported revenue could decline mid-teens in international, with currency having an 11-point negative impact in Q2 based on April-ending currency rates. 
We had a good quarter adding new data and analytics customers. Data Warehouse, Aster and Teradata Cloud new customer wins included: a U.S. national health care delivery company, which is implementing a data warehouse, our Hadoop appliances and QueryGrid; Siemens Healthcare, which is installing a data warehouse along with QueryGrid; one of the world's largest telco providers in China is implementing an IDW; LCL, a leading French retail bank, is also implementing an IDW; an Australia government agency, which chose Aster and Hadoop for advanced analytics for its intelligence community; one of the top U.S. construction companies, which is implementing an IDW on-premise, and also along, using our Teradata Cloud for development; Sera Asset Management, a leading Latin American pension management firm, selected our Teradata Cloud for its data warehousing; and a leading U.S. home health care company is replacing a competitor's on-premise data warehouse with our Teradata Cloud data warehouse.
We continue to experience good activity with our big data-related solutions. Our Q1 Big Data revenue was above the quarterly run rate of our 2015 target of $150 million in revenue. Our 1000 Extreme Data Appliance, which is included in our Big Data revenue results, can create lumpiness in a given quarter due to the size of some of these transactions. The 1000 Series helped our Big Data revenue results in Q1, but will most likely not help us in Q2.
Activity with our Teradata Cloud continues to increase, both with new customers as well as existing customers moving or adding workloads in our cloud, such as for tests and development, discovery and disaster recovery. 
We continue to enhance and innovate with our core data warehouse platforms. We recently announced our latest 2000 Series data warehouse appliance, giving customers faster in-memory processing and also doubling the power. Customers can analyze twice the amount of data twice as fast while using only 1/2 of the data center floor space.
We also announced the Teradata Software-Defined data warehouse, which enables companies to securely create multi-tenancy data warehouse environments within a single database. This allows companies to meet various security and privacy needs of different jurisdictions. For example, multinational companies can keep country data separate for regulatory compliance. 
We also continue to add capabilities to our UDA, with emphasis on integration and simplification for our customers. We recently enhanced QueryGrid to connect with 2 additional Hadoop distributions. 
And Gartner again named Teradata a leader in its recent Analytics Magic Quadrant, calling out the strength of our UDA and our continuous technology enhancements.
Turning to our Marketing Applications business. Q1 revenue of $46 million was down 10% as reported and 3% in constant currency. The key metrics we are focused on, recurring revenue and annual recurring revenue, each grew low single digits in constant currency. 
New Marketing Application customer wins in the quarter included: a top-5 oil company, which selected our Marketing Resource Management, or MRM, solution; [indiscernible], a large French health insurance group which is also implementing our MRM solution; a leading gaming company which chose MRM; and a Fortune 100 financial services company that selected our campaign management solution.
Although we are not happy with the results of our Marketing Applications business over the past year or so, we have continued to add to our leading solutions. We released our digital marketing center in Q1. This cloud-based solution integrates our digital messaging, campaign management and marketing analytics solutions to enable customers to create more effective campaigns across all channels and to execute them much faster. Digital messaging center is a key to helping us go broader in the market.
We continue to gain recognition with industry analysts with our marketing applications. In addition to being named the leader in MRM by Gartner in the previous quarter, Teradata was once again named a leader in the Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management this quarter, noting our completeness of vision and our ability to execute.
We feel we have a hand on the key issues that have been impacting our performance and that we are taking the right actions to address them. One action was to go to an integrated business model that we would have better focus, alignment and execution, and most importantly, better results. We believe this is a big first step in getting our Marketing Applications business back on track, along with the increased investments we are making. These investments will help us to get better position to go broader in the market, both with our cloud offerings and our demand creation, which we did not do a good job of addressing previously.
Our goal in 2015 is to have annual recurring revenue growth of mid- to high-single digits in constant currency as we exit the year and to position ourselves for higher recurring revenue growth in 2016. 
As we said on our last call, we are making additional investments in 2015 in Big Data, Marketing Applications and the Teradata Cloud, all of which are big growth opportunities for Teradata. We believe this is the key for us to get to a mid-single-digits growth rate or higher in 2016. At the same time, we have continually optimized our cost structure and resources over the years, and we will be even more focused on this in 2015 to help fund these growth investments.
Turning to guidance. We believe we are still on track to meet the 3% to 5% constant currency revenue growth guidance range provided at the start of the year or flat to minus 2% as reported. As a result of our Q1 earnings per share shortfall, we now estimate we will be at the low end of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range of $2.50 to $2.70 for the full year. We expect to make good progress in Q2 and in the second half of the year as well. We currently are seeing higher growth in the second half of the year. Our revenue that has higher visibility or predictability, is forecasted to grow mid-single digits in constant currency. This revenue includes all of our Marketing Applications business and the maintenance, subscription and consulting services from our Data and Analytics business. And this accounts for approximately 2/3 of our total revenue. 
As a note, our recurring revenue continues to grow and is now in the mid-40s as a percent of our total revenue. The remaining 1/3 of our revenue that has lower visibility or predictability in the second half, is our data warehousing product revenue. Any growth in our data warehouse product revenue in the second half should result in good overall constant currency revenue growth for Teradata in the second half.
And with that, I'd now turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"

Additionally, historical information for each of our new business segments is also available on the Investor page.
As you are aware, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has become a big headwind for many companies, and in Q1, it was even more than the 5 point impact we had suggested during our last earnings call. Correspondingly, approximately 40% of this revenue impact flow through to operating income, which was slightly more than the third we had estimated at that time, due to the amount and rate of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The currency movement impacts our product gross margin particularly resulting in an estimated 340 basis point reduction as compared to prior year's Q1.
Product gross margin in the first quarter was 56.4% as compared to 68.1% in the first quarter of 2014. In addition to the 340 basis point currency impact, product gross margin was also negatively impacted by product mix.
You may recall during the fourth quarter earnings call, as part of our Big Data discussion, we mentioned we had a couple of 1000 Series transactions that slipped out of Q4 and into the first part of 2015. Due to the aggregate deal size and naturally lower margin, this had a meaningful negative impact on overall product gross margin in the quarter of over 500 basis points. We also had some large 6000 Series transactions that moved out of Q1, which reduced our product gross margin in Q1 by approximately 150 basis points. And a reduction in product volume in Q1 resulted in a 120 basis point decline in product gross margin. We are forecasting product gross margin to recover significantly in Q2, but we believe it'll still be about 200 basis points less than Q2 2014. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was 44.3%, down from 44.8% in Q1 2014. Services margins were negatively impacted by the timing of work-in-process-related consulting projects and the investments we are making in our applications and Teradata Cloud capabilities. We are anticipating similar service gross margin in Q2 compared to Q1 2015. As a result, overall gross margin was 49.3% in the first quarter compared to 54.9% in the first quarter of 2014.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $170 million was 3% lower than the first quarter 2014, largely due to the benefit of currency, as we held line on G&A expenses. 
We continue to scrutinize and optimize our expense structure to support our strategic initiatives and to improve our long-term operating efficiencies. In Q1, we incurred incremental costs associated with this strategic investment strategy, as we described on our last earnings call, and we expect this to build for Q2. 
Research and development expense in the quarter was $56 million, a 24% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014, as we increase and shifted investments to Big Data, Cloud and Marketing Applications activity, which includes R&D expenses associated with the acquisitions we made in 2014. I would also like to note, we do not capitalize R&D activity related to Big Data, Cloud or Marketing Apps projects like we do for the Teradata -- for the core Teradata software projects, which resulted in higher R&D expense hitting the income statement currently. We believe that the Q2 increase in R&D expense will be similar to or larger than the Q1 increase. 
Total R&D spend for the first quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the addition to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less the capitalization of internally developed software, was $69 million. This compared to the $64 million in Q1 2014. As a result of lower revenue, the lower product gross profit and higher R&D expenses as well as the currency impact mentioned earlier, operating margin for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 19.9% in Q1 2014. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate in Q1 2015 was 26.7%, 130 basis points lower than the 28% in Q1 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.9% versus 30.4% in the same period 2014. The lower tax rates were primarily driven by more favorable forecasted foreign earnings mix year-over-year.
Looking forward, for 2015, we expect our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 26% and our non-GAAP full year effective tax rate to range -- to be approximately 27.5%, with the actual tax rate being heavily dependent upon our earnings mix. In addition, both rates presume that the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2014, will be retroactively reinstated at some point during 2015. Until such time this occurs, quarterly effective tax rates will be impacted by approximately 80 basis points.
In terms of earnings per share. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.15 compared to $0.37 in Q1 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $22 million or $0.15 in the first quarter of 2015, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.54 in Q1 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $222 million in Q1 2015, which was $120 million lower than the first quarter of 2014. This was expected -- as expected, since we collected a sizable amount of receivables from Q4 2014 transactions in the fourth quarter, which left fewer receivables to collect in 2015. As you may recall, we described this as a favorable timing item for 2014's free cash flow during our last quarter's earnings call.
After $32 million of capital expenditures versus $33 million in the first quarter 2014, we generated approximately $190 million of free cash flow versus $310 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 2014. Again, the decrease in free cash flow for the first 3 months in 2015 over '14 was primarily a result of the reduction in income from operations, combined with the net changes in AR, as I previously just mentioned.
For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of equal to, to $50 million higher than GAAP net income. However, as I mentioned during the Q4 earnings call, the year-over-year free cash flow comparisons in the next quarters are expected to be less favorable and the full year 2015 free cash flow is expected to be more than $200 million lower than the 2014 free cash flow, primarily due to the favorable timing of collections of receivables in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Moving on to share repurchases. During Q1, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for approximately $273 million under our open-market share repurchase program. We have used over $2 billion to buy back more than 52 million shares since the program's inception in 2008. As of March 31, we had approximately $131 million of remaining authorization in our open-market share repurchase program. To provide for sufficient flexibility for future share repurchases, our Board of Directors just authorized another $300 million, resulting in a current authorization of $431 million to repurchase our shares. 
On March 25, we completed a $1 billion refinancing of our credit facilities, whereby we refinanced our existing term loan with a new 5-year $600 million senior unsecured term loan. At the same time, we also replaced a $300 million revolving credit facility with a new 5-year $400 million revolving credit facility. Both facilities expire in March 2020. As of March 31, 2015, our total debt outstanding was $600 million, with no funds drawn under the new revolving credit facility. 
With respect to accounts receivable, AR decreased $24 million in Q1 2015 versus Q1 2014. Days sales was 79 days as of March 31, 2015, compared to 81 days as of March 31, 2014. The decrease in AR was primarily due to the currency impact as of March 31, 2015. 
Total deferred revenue was $508 million as of March 31, 2015, which was down $15 million from March 31, 2014.
Now turning to guidance for the full year. As Mike indicated, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range and flat to down 2% as reported. As a result of our Q1 performance, we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of our initial $2.50 to $2.70 guidance range. We also expect GAAP EPS to be at the low end of the guidance range.
And I'll provide some added color on our expectations for Q2. We anticipate that reported revenue will be lower than last year's Q2 revenue. And as is always the case, the timing of large transactions have a meaningful impact on our quarterly revenue. We expect product gross margin will improve significantly from Q1, but we anticipate it to be a couple of points below prior year's Q2. We also believe services gross margin will approximate Q1 2015 services gross margin. And we expect R&D expense to be up close to 30% in Q2. The impact of just the projected lower margins and the estimated higher R&D expenses versus prior Q2 is approximately $0.14.
Let me assure you, we are not happy or satisfied with our results. However, we understand the challenges we face and the opportunities we have, and we will continue on the path to improve the performance of the company. 
In addition to our prior acquisitions to position us in faster-growing markets, we have enhanced and advanced our technology in both core data warehousing and big data. We continue to optimize our cost structure, and we are in the process of realigning Teradata into 2 separate but integrated business units, led by 2 co-presidents, to address the specific opportunities and challenges for each business.
In closing, we have great technology and a world-class services team, and we are investing to meet the current and future needs of our customers to gain a competitive advantage by leveraging their data assets and as a result, enhance our shareholder value.
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So that's our Marketing Applications, which is basically subscription model, cloud, Software-as-a-Service; and then in the Data and Analytics part of the company, it comes from our maintenance, our subscriptions as well as our professional services. So out of those, professional services has a little bit of variability in it when we look out over a full year at this point in time, but the others are all very predictable. It's recurring types of revenue. So when you look at the second half, we're clearly in the mid-single-digits. And historically, not that, that predicts the future, but historically, we've been well within 1% or 2% of that more predictable revenue at this juncture of the year looking at the second half, and it could be higher, it could be lower by 1 point. So we feel very good about that. And that's 2/3 of our revenue. So that leaves the remaining 1/3 of our revenue in the second half being the pure data warehouse product revenue, which basically we've had trouble with our growth. Last year, it declined 2%. And what we've modeled this year is that our data warehouse product revenue would decline 1% for the year and in the second half would basically be flattish or down 1%. So I think, and what we've modeled in the second half, 2/3 of the revenue, it's very solid. I think the wildcard is our product revenue, data warehouse product revenue, and it could be higher. It could be a little lower, but I don't think it would be much lower than that."

That's the center of gravity with Teradata is we do extremely well with large enterprises. And having our Marketing Applications business aligned together with our Teradata Data Warehouse business, we're naturally more towards the large enterprise accounts. And we did good, and we got good leverage, and the opportunities there are big. But what we needed to do was get our Marketing Applications business lined up. Meaning, research and development, consulting services sales and the whole supply chain on going after the broader market. And in order to do that, we had to separate things out and get the R&D organization closer to the customer, closer to the sales organization and go after the broader mid-market and make investments more in our marketing cloud, digital messaging center as a first step, and get on with that type of a motion. To your point, there might be some sacrifice of synergy and leverage with the Teradata Data Warehouse field organization, but we do think it's minimal, because the analytic applications, the campaign management solutions and everything else, drive usage on the Teradata Data Warehouse in those customers. So I want to be clear on that. The Marketing Applications drive volume usage, queries and everything else on the Teradata Data Warehouse side of the business, which is one of the reasons why we invested heavily to get into the marketing space.
And that was our last question. So in closing, I want to say we're well positioned with our technology solutions and services, and we have a strong customer base to build upon. We're going to continue to realign and invest in our company to optimize results and shareholder value. And we're going to be balancing the short term with the long term, as always.

Teradata finished Q2 with revenue of $623 million, which was lower than what we were expecting. Revenue decreased 8% as reported from prior year and was down 2% in constant currency. Product and services margins i",1956,"Thanks, Gregg and good morning, everyone. Teradata finished Q2 with revenue of $623 million, which was lower than what we were expecting. Revenue decreased 8% as reported from prior year and was down 2% in constant currency. Product and services margins improved sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and helped to provide a good non-GAAP earnings per share yield of $0.53 on the smaller-than-expected revenue.
Services revenue grew 5% on a constant-currency basis during the quarter with maintenance revenue growing 6%. We were particularly pleased to see consulting services revenue increased 4% in constant currency, following a decline in Q1, and we expect to see similar growth in the second half. Product revenue declined to 9% in constant currency. Although we closed the major data warehouse opportunities in the U.S. that slipped out of Q1 into Q2, we once again experienced deferrals in the second quarter. 
The environment in the U.S. has not changed regarding the continued pressure on large CapEx transactions, along with the longer sales cycles, deferrals and the smaller deal sizes. This was a key factor in our decision to lower our 2015 guidance. However, our activity in the U.S. is up significantly from last year. This is reflected in the Americas third quarter funnel. A number of opportunities have increased more than 30%, but the dollar amount is roughly flat. That said, we are expecting the return to constant currency revenue growth in the second half, and we continue to believe that mid-single digits revenue growth is a reasonable target for 2016. In addition, we have a number of actions in progress to potentially position ourselves better as we exit 2015, which I will talk about later.
Turning to our segment results for Q2, the data and analytics division revenue declined 8% as reported and was down 1% in constant currency. Within those results, we experienced strong growth with 2 of our key growth initiatives, big data and Teradata Cloud. Big data revenue, which includes our Aster-Hadoop and 1000 Series appliances, along with software tools and related services, continued its strong revenue growth with an increase of more than 50% in constant currency in the quarter. Big data revenue more than doubled during the first half. Aster, our Hadoop appliances and 1000 Series appliances all had strong growth as well as our big data Consulting Services, which includes Think Big. 
Teradata Analytics cloud also grew at a very high rate in the quarter with revenue increasing by more than 80% in constant currency and annual recurring revenue up close to 70% over prior year. Teradata Cloud revenue is currently small, but we see it as a big opportunity for us longer term and continue to enhancing that through our offerings.
Turning to our marketing applications business. Q2 revenue of $48 million was down 3% in constant currency. Recurring revenue declined 1% in constant currency, which was roughly in line with what we had expected. 
We are beginning to make progress. Our digital marketing cloud solution, which will be the cloud platform for all of our marketing applications longer term, grew revenue into the mid-teens on a constant currency basis in the second quarter, and we continue to add new customers across all of our marketing applications solution. 
Overall, Teradata is operating from a position of strength and some very high growth markets. First, in our big data initiative, we are leveraging our long-standing core competencies around integrating data to enable customers to gain better insights for their business and doing it with a broader analytic ecosystem and across the multiple and diverse platforms that reside there.
What we started more than 5 years ago have all pinned to our unit -- Unified Data Architecture and we continue to add software, tools and platforms to make it easier for customers to implement and extract value with our UDA. Today, we have software and tools such as Aster, Unity, QueryGrid, RainStor, Loom and viewpoint as well as our appliances. We recently added a new Hadoop appliance that works with Cloudera or Hortonworks. We have never seen stronger interest in our UDA and in our world-class services to help customers design, implement and support it and our consulting expertise to get value from their data. We are rapidly expanding our Think Big Analytics consulting business internationally as demand is accelerating outside of the U.S. 
Second, as mentioned earlier, our Teradata Analytics cloud initiative is not a large revenue contributor today, but it is growing rapidly. We believe it'll continue to grow longer term and we continue to invest to expand and deepen our offerings. We currently have customers running full function data warehouses in our cloud as well as parts of data warehouse workloads such as subject-specific data marts, custom development, disaster recovery and sandboxes. These cloud offerings all leverage our core data warehouse strength. Other cloud offerings include big data analytics and Hadoop, which leverage our strength with Aster and various other UDA software tools and consulting capabilities. We are experiencing good activity with all of our analytic cloud solutions in the U.S. and we are expanding in international where we have now a handful of customers in production and seeing increased interest from customers and partners there.
Third, although we have experienced challenges with our marketing applications business, we are making good progress and it continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Teradata. Our technology is recognized as among the best for enterprise on premises Marketing Resource Management and campaign management. Last quarter, Teradata was once again named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for multichannel campaign management. And just last week, Forrester named Teradata as one of only 2 leaders in its first wave report for real-time interaction management noting our marketer-focused analytics and cross-channel orchestration.
While we have been recognized for category leadership in Marketing Resource Management and campaign management, we realized that has not translated into the results we should be capable of producing. We continue to take actions to improve our performance. 
As mentioned on last quarter's call, our first action was to go to an integrated business model to enhance focus, speed and execution. At the same time, we've been investing in a major transformation, leveraging our digital marketing cloud platform to become a cloud-based solution provider for omnichannel marketing and also for all of our applications. We have successfully added and integrated mobile and social marketing capabilities from our recent acquisitions, and we are making improvements to our digital data analytics capability and user experience. We are also making investments to add more campaign management capabilities to our digital marketing cloud platform.
Our digital marketing cloud is a key strategic growth initiative for us as more and more marketing applications move to the cloud. However, we believe there will continue to be a large on-premises market opportunity for marketing applications, and we will continue to offer those solutions as well. We believe these key initiatives, along with further refinements in our go-to-market approach, will position our marketing applications business for higher growth. 
And last, we are the leader in the data warehousing in terms of our technology and the expenses services we provide. This is evident from what you here from the industry analysts, our customers and also our win rates. Many of our outstanding base of customers see us as long-term partners in helping them to gain a better understanding of their business and their customers. Our customers include many of the world's most successful companies and they're passionate advocates who share their positive experiences with other companies. The challenge that we have is that customers continue to invest in Teradata data warehouses, but overall, they are buying in smaller amounts, in particular, with major customers here in the U.S. 
From a technology perspective, [indiscernible] platforms have proliferated over the past couple of years to address various new data types and analytic workloads with many of these customers. Some of these customers are now beginning to feel the pain of the complexity and costs associated with these analytic environments and we are starting to see investments coming back to Teradata but in smaller amounts.
In addition, the customer buying behavior for software and technology has changed. Companies want to purchase in smaller increments and have flexibility in how they purchase and how they deploy. To address these challenges, we've been taking actions to make it easier for customers to buy and deploy Teradata and in turn expand our market opportunity. 
I'd like to share with you where we're at with our new core data Warehouse initiatives. First, we've been engineering a software-only version of Teradata for over a year now. This will enable companies with private clouds to run Teradata. We expect to have our software-only version in beta by Q2 2016 and a production version of by Q1 2017. In addition, our software-only offering will enable companies to run Teradata in public clouds. We do not expect their software-only version of Teradata to provide the same levels of performance and SLAs that our fully integrated platforms deliver, but there is only a software-only market opportunity that we believe Teradata can excel at.
Second, we are expanding the options for health companies can purchase Teradata. Previously, we have offered subscription pricing on a custom basis and we are now in the process of standardizing it so we can deploy it more broadly in the market. This enables a customer to pay as they would in our Teradata Cloud when it resides in their own data center, and they can also offer managed services to run it. 
Third, our Teradata Analytics cloud will benefit our core data warehouse business as well as our big data business. For prospective customers, they can experiment with our data warehouse technology, start small and pay as they go, expanded and then eventually decide whether to stay in our cloud or move the data warehouse to their data center. For existing customers, they can move everything to the cloud, specific workloads to the cloud or just do exploratory analytics in the cloud. Overall, our goal with these initiatives is to make it easier to do business with our core data warehouse solution by providing options for deployment and purchasing while extending our market opportunity. These data warehouse initiatives, along with our marketing applications growth, will also increase the percent of recurring revenue in Teradata over time.
To summarize our key initiatives, number one, we are looking to increase growth in our core data warehouse business by providing more options to make it easier to deploy and purchase Teradata. Two, we will continue to scale our big data business while working to increase margins year-on-year. Three, we will continue to scale our Teradata Cloud, which will benefit both our core data business and our big data business and expand our market opportunity. Four, we will continue to scale our marketing applications business while working to increase margins year-on-year. And last, we will continue to optimize our cost structure to help fund these growth initiatives. Currently, our target for operating expenses in 2016 is to increase low single-digits over 2015. We believe that collectively, these actions will improve our overall performance and enhance shareholder value. In addition, we are actively engaged with third party consultants to get an outside view of all this through a different lens. We will provide an update on these key initiatives later in the year when we will be in a better position to provide more details. 
As I said before, we are currently headed in the right direction in the second half of 2015 and into 2016. We have a great opportunity to make it even better. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"
97999,307196711,850598,"Teradata Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Before I discuss our quarterly results, I'd like to address the $340 million noncash goodwill impairment charge we took in the quarter related to our marketing applications business. We performed the goodwill evaluation during the quarter, w",1242,"Thanks, Mike. Before I discuss our quarterly results, I'd like to address the $340 million noncash goodwill impairment charge we took in the quarter related to our marketing applications business. We performed the goodwill evaluation during the quarter, which requires an assessment of the business units' estimated fair value. As a result of this evaluation, we determined that the carrying value of the recently created marketing applications business segment was higher than its fair value, which resulted in a write-down of the goodwill. We remain committed to the improved performance of our marketing applications business segment, and we believe that solutions will play an important role in our growth strategy over the long term.
Now I'll turn to the quarterly results. And as usual, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other special items identified in our earnings release including the impairment of goodwill I just described. 
Product gross margin rebounded from the abnormally low margin in Q1. In the second quarter, product gross margin was 65.6% basically in line with the second quarter of 2014 as mix normalized from the adverse mix in Q1. Adjusting for currency, Q2 product gross margin would have been higher than the prior year.
FAS 86 amortization is still expected to increase approximately $6 million or $0.03 of EPS for 2015 versus 2014. Q2 declined approximately $1 million, and we expect an increase of approximately $2 million in Q3 and $4 million in Q4. As a reminder, FAS 86 amortization impacts product gross margin.
Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.3%, down from a strong 48.1% in Q2 2014. Services margin was impacted by a lower professional services rate as a result of increased work in process as well as investments we are making in our cloud offerings. Overall, gross margin was 54.3% in the second quarter compared to 56.1% in the second quarter of 2014.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $179 million was up $6 million or 3% higher than the second quarter of 2014. The increase was mostly due to investments and demand creation headcount, partially offset by foreign currency movement.
Research and development expense in the quarter was $52 million, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014. The increase is primarily driven by investments in Unified Data Architecture and big data technology as well as marketing applications. In support of our strategic growth initiatives, we expect R&D expense will continue to increase year-over-year, however, not as much as we previously anticipated as we are in the process of optimizing our R&D resources and expenditures. Consequently, we now expect R&D expense for the full year to be up in the mid- to high teens as our investment in R&D continues to be a very key initiative for Teradata. As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 17.2%. This is down from 23.5% yield in Q2 2014. The decline in operating margin was due in a large part to lower revenue, our services gross margin and the investments we are making for future revenue growth.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was for the second quarter was 27.6% versus 28.3% in Q2 2014. The lower non-GAAP tax rate was primarily driven by more favorable forecasted foreign earnings mix year-over-year. Looking forward for 2015, we expect full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27% with the actual tax rate being dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. In addition, this presumes that the U.S. R&D Tax Credit would expire as of December 31, 2014, will be retroactively reinstated at some point during 2015. Until such time this occurs, our quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate will be negatively impacted by approximately 65 basis points.
In terms of earnings per share, we reported GAAP EPS loss of $1.87 in Q2 due to the goodwill impairment charge discussed earlier. This compared to a positive $0.60 in Q2 of 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, including the goodwill charge, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 compared to $0.72 in Q2 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $80 million in Q2 2015 versus $138 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the second quarter, we had $27 million of capital expenditures versus $25 million in the second quarter of 2014, resulting in free cash flow of $53 million versus the $113 million generated in Q2 2014. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower net income as well as the timing of payables. However, we still expect full year free cash flow to equal GAAP net income excluding the $340 million impairment or up to $50 million higher.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $921 million of cash as of June 30, 2015, of which less than 10% was held in the U.S. This is up from the $881 million as of March 31, 2015.
During the second quarter, we bought approximately 700,000 shares of Teradata stock for a total cost of approximately $25 million. During the first half of the year, we bought approximately 7 million shares for a total cost of approximately $300 million. As of June 30, we have approximately $412 million of share repurchase authorization available.
With respect to accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 71 days as of June 30, 2015 compared to 73 days as of June 30, 2014. Total deferred revenue was $461 million as of June 30, 2015, which was down $7 million from June 30, 2014, which was due to foreign currency movement. Deferred revenue grew approximately 5% in constant currency.
Turning to guidance. For the full year, as a result of the deferrals and longer sales cycles, full year 2015 revenue is now expected to be up 0% to 3% in constant currency, down 3% to 6% as reported. Factoring in the goodwill impairment charge, full year GAAP EPS now is expected to be a loss in the $0.32 to $0.62 range, and adjusting for special items, full year non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the $2.20 to $2.50 range. To provide some directional color as to our expectations for Q3, we anticipate that reported revenue will be lower than last year's Q3 revenue, and as is always the case, the timing of larger transactions can have a meaningful impact on our revenue. Due to the current forecast of mix and product revenue, we expect product gross margin in Q3 to be similar to the Q3 2014 product gross margin. We expect services gross margin to be similar to the 2015 year-to-date rate. We expect operating expenses to be approximate Q2 2015. 
To summarize, the potential impact of the items I just referenced could lead to Q3 2015 non-GAAP EPS being approximately $0.15 lower than the Q3 2014.
In closing, the initiatives Mike mentioned will continue over the next several quarters and are expected to favorably impact our business results starting in 2016. We are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies to make it easier for companies to buy Teradata, no matter how they want to purchase Teradata either on premise, in a subscription model or in the cloud. We have the best analytical database in the business and we are altering our models to be also the most flexible and easiest to buy from as well.
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Regarding the Teradata Cloud, think of it this way, we have been maturing it and working with it and learning from it over the last 3 or 4 years. And quite frankly, there isn't a lot of demand out there in the marketplace to go take an on-premise large-scale data warehouse and put it in the cloud. We have done it, okay? So it's not a technology thing. There's other factors around -- sensitivity around certain strategic things customers are doing in the data that resides there and everything else. But what we're seeing is this thing has progressed, is we're seeing more demand for certain workloads. So it might be a specific data mart that's not strategic to run in the cloud. It might be test and development. It might be disaster recovery or it might be grabbing capacity to do sandbox types of analytics. On the subscription model, there, we've been maturing it as well. If you think about it, we've been doing it over time and it's getting more of a standardized type of offer and then it'll go more broadly in the market. But here again, demand isn't huge, but we do think there's an opportunity to make it easier to do business with Teradata as it relates to the data warehousing. But I think, you got to look further down the road, and further the road, there'll be more and more data warehousing in the cloud. And with our software-only, we can go address the market opportunity in the public cloud for customers who want to do it that way. And in the subscription model, over time, this can be a much bigger thing as well. I think, if I net it all out, we're just trying to uncover and do every little thing we can that'll help our core data warehouse business and its adoption in the market."

So it's doubling, it's growing at a big rate and it's becoming a meaningful amount of our business. The core on-premise data warehouse business, if you take a look at that, we're seeing a deceleration occur in major customers in the U.S. And there, it will hit a baseline eventually and then we will grow from there. So once we get settled here on the core business, it's not like the on-premise data warehouses are moving to the clouds or things like that, very little bit of that. We will hit a baseline. We've already had a couple of customers in the first half that hit the wall, if you will, and refreshed their EDWs with 2 floor sweeps in the top 50. We have a very, very old aging base, in particular, in the U.S. So there are some underpinnings here that can point towards a bottoming out in the on-premise data warehouse environment where it'll return to growth. And we're talking about the U.S. International's been growing and the big hit has been in these major customers. Add a little more information. At the same time, if we can't grow the data warehouse, if the customers put down the clamps on the spending on the EDW and then eventually have to refresh it, if that data warehouse isn't going to grow, we're replacing it with something that costs less money and has less maintenance than what they originally purchased it for, okay? Because yet, the impact of Moore's Law. But what's going on is we're starting to have some of the workloads that aren't on Teradata coming back to Teradata. I would like to say and give a specific number where this thing's headed. But all I can say is when you collectively look at it and add it all up, I think the core data warehouse business, on-premise, in the U.S. is going to hit an inflection point.

It should be a tailwind when we get to 2017. The Teradata Cloud, it will present some of the headwind on revenue, of course, the way revenue is recognized, but we don't see -- we see workloads, some new workloads and some new customers going to the Teradata Cloud. We don't see a meaningful impact when we look at 2016 and our goal to get the 5% or mid-single-digits revenue growth. On the subscription model, once again, that will be a headwind, but I think, we have to -- the way revenues are recognized, I think, we have to look at how position this with customers that want to be in that model. We don't have a lot of demand from customers saying they would like to get to that model, but we do think it's our advantage if we have customers that want to go to a subscription model because it makes it easier for them to expand their data warehouses. So even though we don't have a lot of customers in a customized subscription model, what we see is it's much, much easier to expand. It doesn't require a large CapEx transaction. It doesn't require the levels of approval and everything else you get in a license model. So subscription model, yes, that can provide some headwind.

Teradata finished Q2 with revenue of $623 million, which was lower than what we were expecting. Revenue decreased 8% as reported from prior year and was down 2% in constant currency.
Product and services margins improved sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and helped to provide a good non-GAAP earnings per share yield of $0.53 on the smaller-than-expected revenue. Services revenue grew 5% on a constant currency basis during the quarter, with maintenance revenue growing 6%. We were particularly pleased to see consulting services revenue increase 4% in constant currency following a decline in Q1, and we expect to see similar growth in the second half. Product revenue declined 9% in constant currency. Although we closed the major data warehouse opportunities in the U.S. that slipped out of Q1 into Q2, we once again experienced deferrals in the second quarter.
The environment in the U.S. has not changed regarding the continued pressure on large-CapEx transactions, along with the longer sales cycles, deferrals and the smaller deal sizes. This was a key factor in our decision to lower our 2015 guidance. However, our activity in the U.S. is up significantly from last year. This is reflected in the Americas third quarter funnel. The number of opportunities have increased more than 30%, but the dollar amount is roughly flat. That said, we are expecting to return to constant currency revenue growth in the second half, and we continue to believe that mid-single digits revenue growth is a reasonable target for 2016. In addition, we have a number of actions in progress to potentially position ourselves better as we exit 2015, which I will talk about later.
Turning to our segment results for Q2.
The Data and Analytics division revenue declined 8% as reported and was down 1% in constant currency. Within these results, we experienced strong growth with 2 of our key growth initiatives, big data and Teradata Cloud. Big data revenue, which includes our Aster-Hadoop and 1000 Series appliances, along with software tools and related services, continued its strong revenue growth with an increase of more than 50% in constant currency in the quarter. Big data revenue more than doubled during the first half. Aster, our Hadoop appliances and 1000 Series appliances all had strong growth; as well as our big data consulting services, which includes Think Big.
Teradata analytics cloud also grew at a very high rate in the quarter, with revenue increasing by more than 80% in constant currency and annual recurring revenue up close to 70% over prior year. Teradata Cloud revenue is currently small, but we see it as a big opportunity for us longer term and continue to enhancing that through our offerings.
Turning to our Marketing Applications business. Q2 revenue of $48 million was down 3% in constant currency. Recurring revenue declined 1% in constant currency, which was roughly in line with what we had expected.
We are beginning to make progress. Our digital marketing cloud solution, which will be the cloud platform for all of our marketing applications longer term, grew revenue in the mid-teens on a constant currency basis in the second quarter. And we continue to add new customers across all of our Marketing Applications solutions.
Overall, Teradata is operating from a position of strength in some very high-growth markets. First, in our big data initiative, we are leveraging our longstanding core competencies around integrating data to enable customers to gain better insights for their business and doing it with a broader analytic ecosystem and across the multiple and diverse platforms that reside there. What we started more than 5 years ago have all pinned to our unit -- Unified Data Architecture. And we continue to add software, tools and platforms to make it easier for customers to implement and extract value with our UDA. Today, we have software and tools such as Aster, Unity, QueryGrid, RainStor, Loom and Viewpoint; as well as our appliances. We recently added a new Hadoop appliance that works with Cloudera or Hortonworks. We have never seen stronger interest in our UDA and in our world-class services to help customers design, implement and support it and our consulting expertise to get value from their data. We are rapidly expanding our Think Big Analytics consulting business internationally as demand is accelerating outside of the U.S.
Second, as mentioned earlier, our Teradata analytics cloud initiative is not a large revenue contributor today, but it is growing rapidly. We believe it'll continue to grow longer term, and we continue to invest to expand and deepen our offerings. We currently have customers running full-function data warehouses in our cloud; as well as parts of data warehouse workloads such as subject-specific data marts, test and development, disaster recovery and sandboxes. These cloud offerings all leverage our core data warehouse strengths.
Other cloud offerings include Big Data Analytics and Hadoop, which leverage our strengths with Aster and various other UDA software, tools and consulting capabilities. We are experiencing good activity with all of our analytic cloud solutions in the U.S. And we are expanding in international, where we have now a handful of customers in production and seeing increased interest from customers and partners there.
Third, although we have experienced challenges with our Marketing Applications business, we are making good progress and it continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Teradata. Our technology is recognized as among the best for enterprise on-premises Marketing Resource Management and campaign management. Last quarter, Teradata was once again named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management. And just last week, Forrester named Teradata as one of only 2 leaders in its first Wave report for real-time interaction management, noting our marketer-focused analytics and cross-channel orchestration. While we have been recognized for category leadership in Marketing Resource Management and campaign management, we realize that has not translated into the results we should be capable of producing. We continue to take actions to improve our performance.
As mentioned on last quarter's call, our first action was to go to an integrated business model to enhance focus, speed and execution. At the same time, we've been investing in a major transformation, leveraging our digital marketing cloud platform to become a cloud-based solution provider for omnichannel marketing and also for all of our applications. We have successfully added and integrated mobile and social marketing capabilities from our recent acquisitions, and we are making improvements to our digital data analytics capability and user experience. We are also making investments to add more campaign management capabilities to our digital marketing cloud platform. Our digital marketing cloud is a key strategic growth initiative for us, as more and more marketing applications move to the cloud. However, we believe there will continue to be a large on-premises market opportunity for Marketing Applications, and we will continue to offer those solutions as well. We believe these key initiatives, along with further refinements in our go-to-market approach, will position our Marketing Applications business for higher growth.
And last, we are the leader in data warehousing in terms of our technology and the extent of services we provide. This is evident from what you hear from the industry analysts, our customers and also our win rates. Many of our outstanding base of customers see us as long-term partners in helping them to gain a better understanding of their business and their customers. Our customers include many of the world's most successful companies, and they are passionate advocates who share their positive experiences with other companies. The challenge that we have is that customers continue to invest in Teradata data warehouses but overall they are buying in smaller amounts, in particular with major customers here in the U.S.
From a technology perspective, good-enough platforms have proliferated over the past couple of years to address various new data types and analytic workloads with many of these customers. Some of these customers are now beginning to feel the pain of the complexity and costs associated with these analytic environments, and we are starting to see investments coming back to Teradata but in smaller amounts. In addition, the customer buying behavior for software and technology has changed. Companies want to purchase in smaller increments and have flexibility in how they purchase and how they deploy. To address these challenges, we've been taking actions to make it easier for customers to buy and deploy Teradata and in turn expand our market opportunity. I'd like to share with you where we're at with our new core data warehouse initiatives.
First, we have been engineering a software-only version of Teradata for over a year now. This will enable companies with private clouds to run Teradata. We expect to have our software-only version in beta by Q2 2016 and a production version by Q1 2017. In addition, our software-only offering will enable companies to run Teradata in public clouds. We do not expect their software-only version of Teradata to provide the same levels of performance and SLAs that our fully integrated platforms deliver, but there is a software-only market opportunity that we believe Teradata can excel at.
Second, we are expanding the options where health companies can purchase Teradata. Previously, we have offered subscription pricing on a custom basis, and we are now in the process of standardizing it so we can deploy it more broadly in the market. This enables a customer to pay as they would in our Teradata Cloud when it resides in their own data center. And they can also opt for our managed services to run it.
Third, our Teradata analytics cloud will benefit our core data warehouse business as well as our big data business. For prospective customers, they can experiment with our data warehouse technology, start small and pay as they go, expand it and then eventually decide whether to stay in our cloud or move the data warehouse to their data center. For existing customers, they can move everything to the cloud, specific workloads to the cloud; or just do exploratory analytics in the cloud. Overall, our goal with these initiatives is to make it easier to do business with our core data warehouse solution by providing options for deployment and purchasing while extending our market opportunity. These data warehouse initiatives, along with our Marketing Applications growth, will also increase the percent of recurring revenue in Teradata over time.
To summarize our key initiatives. Number one, we are looking to increase growth in our core data warehouse business by providing more options to make it easier to deploy and purchase Teradata. Two, we will continue to scale our big data business while working to increase margins year-on-year. Three, we will continue to scale our Teradata Cloud, which will benefit both our core data warehouse business and our big data business and expand our market opportunity. Four, we will continue to scale our Marketing Applications business while working to increase margins year-on-year. And last, we will continue to optimize our cost structure to help fund these growth initiatives. Currently, our target for operating expenses in 2016 is to increase low single digits over 2015.
We believe that, collectively, these actions will improve our overall performance and enhance shareholder value. In addition, we are actively engaged with third-party consultants to get an outside view of all this through a different lens. We will provide an update on these key initiatives later in the year, when we will be in a better position to provide more details.
As I said before, we are currently headed in the right direction in the second half of 2015 and into 2016. We have a great opportunity to make it even better.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"
97999,307196711,850921,"Teradata Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike.Before I discuss our quarterly results, I'd like to address the $340 million noncash goodwill impairment charge we took in the quarter related to our Marketing Applications business. We performed a goodwill evaluation during the quarter whi",1243,"Thanks, Mike.
Before I discuss our quarterly results, I'd like to address the $340 million noncash goodwill impairment charge we took in the quarter related to our Marketing Applications business. We performed a goodwill evaluation during the quarter which requires an assessment of the business unit's estimated fair value. As a result of this evaluation, we determined that the carrying value of the recently created Marketing Applications business segment was higher than its fair value, which resulted in a write-down of the goodwill. We remain committed to the improved performance of our Marketing Applications business segment, and we believe that solutions will play an important role in our growth strategy over the long term.
Now I'll turn to the quarterly results. And as usual, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other special items identified in our earnings release, including the impairment of goodwill I just described.
Product gross margin rebounded from the abnormally low margin in Q1. In the second quarter, product gross margin was 65.6% basically in line with the second quarter of 2014, as mix normalized from the adverse mix in Q1. Adjusting for currency, Q2 product gross margin would have been higher than the prior year. FAS 86 amortization is still expected to increase approximately $6 million or $0.03 of EPS for 2015 versus 2014. Q2 declined approximately $1 million, and we expect an increase of approximately $2 million in Q3 and $4 million in Q4. As a reminder, FAS 86 amortization impacts product gross margin.
Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.3%, down from a strong 48.1% in Q2 of 2014. Services margin was impacted by a lower professional services rate as a result of increased work in process as well as investments we are making in our cloud offerings.
Overall gross margin was 54.3% in the second quarter compared to 56.1% in the second quarter of 2014.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $179 million was up $6 million or 3% higher than the second quarter of 2014. The increase was mostly due to investments in demand-creation headcount, partially offset by foreign currency movement. Research and development expense in the quarter was $52 million, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014. The increase is primarily driven by investments in Unified Data Architecture and big data technology, as well as Marketing Applications. In support of our strategic growth initiatives, we expect R&D expense will continue to increase year-over-year, however, not as much as we had previously anticipated as we are in the process of optimizing our R&D resources and expenditures. Consequently, we now expect R&D expense for the full year to be up in the mid- to high teens as our investment in R&D continues to be a very key initiative for Teradata. As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 17.2%. This is down from 23.5% yield in Q2 2014. The decline in operating margin was due in a large part to lower revenue, our services gross margin and the investments we are making for future revenue growth.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was for the second quarter was 27.6% versus 28.3% in Q2 2014. The lower non-GAAP tax rate was primarily driven by more favorable forecasted foreign earnings mix year-over-year. Looking forward for 2015, we expect full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, with the actual tax rate being dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. In addition, this presumes that the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2014, will be retroactively reinstated at some point during 2015. Until such time this occurs, our quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate will be negatively impacted by approximately 65 basis points.
In terms of earnings per share, we reported GAAP EPS loss of $1.87 in Q2 due to the goodwill impairment charge discussed earlier. This compared to a positive $0.60 in Q2 of 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, including the goodwill impairment charge, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 compared to $0.72 in Q2 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $80 million in Q2 2015 versus $138 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the second quarter, we had $27 million of capital expenditures versus $25 million in the second quarter of 2014, resulting in free cash flow of $53 million versus the $113 million generated in Q2 2014. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower net income as well as the timing of payables. However, we still expect full year free cash flow to equal GAAP net income excluding the $340 million impairment or up to $50 million higher.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $921 million of cash as of June 30, 2015, of which less than 10% was held in the U.S. This is up from the $881 million as of March 31, 2015.
During the second quarter, we bought approximately 700,000 shares of Teradata stock for a total cost of approximately $25 million. During the first half of the year, we bought approximately 7 million shares, for a total cost of approximately $300 million. As of June 30, we have approximately $412 million of share repurchase authorization available.
With respect to accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 71 days as of June 30, 2015, compared to 73 days as of June 30, 2014. Total deferred revenue was $461 million as of June 30, 2015, which was down $7 million from June 30, 2014, which was due to foreign currency movement. Deferred revenue grew approximately 5% in constant currency.
Turning to guidance.
For the full year, as a result of the deferrals and longer sales cycles, full year 2015 revenue is now expected to be up 0% to 3% in constant currency, down 3% to 6% as reported. Factoring in the goodwill impairment charge, full year GAAP EPS now is expected to be a loss in the $0.32 to $0.62 range. And adjusting for special items, full year non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the $2.20 to $2.50 range.
To provide some directional color as to our expectations for Q3. We anticipate that reported revenue will be lower than last year's Q3 revenue, and as is always the case, the timing of larger transactions can have a meaningful impact on our revenue. Due to the current forecast of mix and product revenue, we expect product gross margin in Q3 to be similar to the Q3 2014 product gross margin. We expect services gross margin to be similar to the 2015 year-to-date rate. We expect operating expenses to approximate Q2 2015.
To summarize, the potential impact of the items I just referenced could lead to Q3 2015 non-GAAP EPS being approximately $0.15 lower than the Q3 2014.
In closing, the initiatives Mike mentioned will continue over the next several quarters and are expected to favorably impact our business results, starting in 2016. We are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies to make it easier for companies to buy Teradata no matter how they want to purchase Teradata, either on premise, in a subscription model or in the cloud. We have the best analytical database in the business, and we are altering our models to be also the most flexible and easiest to buy from as well.
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Regarding the Teradata Cloud, think of it this way: We've been maturing it and working with it and learning from it over the last 3 or 4 years. And quite frankly, there isn't a lot of demand out there in the marketplace to go take an on-premise large-scale data warehouse and put it in the cloud. We have done it, okay? So it's not a technology thing. There's other factors around sensitivity, around certain strategic things customers are doing in the data that resides there and everything else, but what we're seeing is as thing has progressed is we're seeing more demand for certain workloads. So it might be a specific data mart that's not strategic to run in the cloud. It might be test and development. It might be disaster recovery, or it might be grabbing capacity to do sandbox types of analytics. On the subscription model, there we've been maturing it as well, if you think about it. We've been doing it over time. And it's getting to more of a standardized type of offer, and then it'll go more broadly in the market. But here again, demand isn't huge but we do think there's an opportunity to make it easier to do business with Teradata as it relates to the data warehousing. But I think you got to look further down the road, and further the road, there'll be more and more data warehousing in the cloud. And with our software only, we can go address the market opportunity in the public cloud for customers who want to do it that way. And in the subscription model, over time, this can be a much bigger thing as well. I think, if I net it all out, we're just trying to uncover and do every little thing we can that'll help our core data warehouse business and its adoption in the market."

It's growing at a big rate, and it's becoming a meaningful amount of business. The core on-premise data warehouse business, if you take a look at that, the -- we're seeing a deceleration occur in major customers in the U.S. And there it will hit a baseline eventually, and then we will grow from there. So once we get settled here on the core business, it's not like the on-premise data warehouses are moving to the clouds or things like that, very little bit of that, we will hit a baseline. We've already had a couple customers in the first half that hit the wall, if you will, and refreshed their EDWs with 2 floor sweeps in the top 50. We have a very, very old, aging base, in particular in the U.S. So there are some underpinnings here that can point towards a bottoming-out in the on-premise data warehouse environment where it'll return to growth. And we're talking about the U.S. International's been growing, and the big hit has been in these major customers. Add a little more information: At the same time, if we can't grow the data warehouse as the customers that -- put down the clamps on the spending on the EDW and then eventually have to refresh it, if that data warehouse isn't going to grow, we're replacing it with something that costs less money and has less maintenance than what they originally purchased it for, okay? Because you have the impact of Moore's law, but what's going on is we're starting to have some of the workloads that aren't on Teradata coming back to Teradata. I would like to say and give a specific number where this thing's headed, but all I can say is, when you collectively look at it and add it all up, I think the core data warehouse business on premise in the U.S. is going to hit an inflection point.

It should be a tailwind when we get to 2017. The Teradata Cloud, it will present some of the headwind on revenue, of course, the way revenue is recognized, but we don't see -- we see workloads, some new workloads and some new customers going into Teradata Cloud. We don't see a meaningful impact when we look at 2016 and our goal to get to 5% or mid-single digits revenue growth. On the subscription model, once again that will be a headwind, but I think we have to -- the way revenue is recognized, I think we have to look at how to position this with customers that may want to be in that model. We don't have a lot of demand from customers saying they would like to get to that model, but we do think it's our advantage if we have customers that want to go to a subscription model because it makes it easier for them to expand their data warehouses. So even though we don't have a lot of customers in the customized subscription model, what we see is it's much, much easier to expand. It doesn't require a large CapEx transaction. It doesn't require the levels of approval and everything else you get in a license model.

A replay of this conference call will also be available later today on that site. Teradata assumes no obligation to update or revise the information included in this conference call, whether as a result of new information or future results.
I'll now turn the call over to Mike."

And good morning, everyone.Teradata finished Q2 with revenue of $623 million, which was lower than what we were expecting. Revenue decreased 8% as reported from prior year and was down 2% in constant currency.Product and services margin",1953,"Thanks, Gregg. And good morning, everyone.
Teradata finished Q2 with revenue of $623 million, which was lower than what we were expecting. Revenue decreased 8% as reported from prior year and was down 2% in constant currency.
Product and services margins improved sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and helped to provide a good non-GAAP earnings per share yield of $0.53 on the smaller-than-expected revenue. Services revenue grew 5% on a constant currency basis during the quarter, with maintenance revenue growing 6%. We were particularly pleased to see consulting services revenue increase 4% in constant currency following a decline in Q1, and we expect to see similar growth in the second half. Product revenue declined 9% in constant currency. Although we closed the major Data Warehouse opportunities in the U.S. that slipped out of Q1 into Q2, we once again experienced deferrals in the second quarter.
The environment in the U.S. has not changed regarding the continued pressure on large-CapEx transactions, along with the longer sales cycles, deferrals and the smaller deal sizes. This was a key factor in our decision to lower our 2015 guidance. However, our activity in the U.S. is up significantly from last year. This is reflected in the Americas third quarter funnel. The number of opportunities have increased more than 30%, but the dollar amount is roughly flat. That said, we are expecting to return to constant currency revenue growth in the second half, and we continue to believe that mid-single digits revenue growth is a reasonable target for 2016. In addition, we have a number of actions in progress to potentially position ourselves better as we exit 2015, which I will talk about later.
Turning to our segment results for Q2.
The Data and Analytics division revenue declined 8% as reported and was down 1% in constant currency. Within these results, we experienced strong growth with 2 of our key growth initiatives, big data and Teradata Cloud. Big data revenue, which includes our Aster-Hadoop and 1000 Series appliances, along with software tools and related services, continued its strong revenue growth with an increase of more than 50% in constant currency in the quarter. Big data revenue more than doubled during the first half. Aster, our Hadoop appliances and 1000 Series appliances all had strong growth; as well as our big data consulting services, which includes Think Big.
Teradata analytics cloud also grew at a very high rate in the quarter, with revenue increasing by more than 80% in constant currency and annual recurring revenue up close to 70% over prior year. Teradata Cloud revenue is currently small, but we see it as a big opportunity for us longer term and continue to enhance and add to our offerings.
Turning to our Marketing Applications business. Q2 revenue of $48 million was down 3% in constant currency. Recurring revenue declined 1% in constant currency, which was roughly in line with what we had expected.
We are beginning to make progress. Our digital marketing cloud solution, which will be the cloud platform for all of our marketing applications longer term, grew revenue in the mid-teens on a constant currency basis in the second quarter. And we continue to add new customers across all of our Marketing Applications solutions.
Overall, Teradata is operating from a position of strength in some very high-growth markets. First, in our big data initiative, we are leveraging our longstanding core competencies around integrating data to enable customers to gain better insights for their business, and doing it with a broader analytic ecosystem and across the multiple and diverse platforms that reside there. What we started more than 5 years ago evolved into our Unified Data Architecture. And we continue to add software, tools and platforms to make it easier for customers to implement and extract value with our UDA. Today, we have software and tools such as Aster, Unity, QueryGrid, RainStor, Loom and Viewpoint; as well as our appliances. We recently added a new Hadoop appliance that works with Cloudera or Hortonworks. We have never seen stronger interest in our UDA and in our world-class services to help customers design, implement and support it, and our consulting expertise to get value from their data. We are rapidly expanding our Think Big Analytics consulting business internationally as demand is accelerating outside of the U.S.
Second, as mentioned earlier, our Teradata analytics cloud initiative is not a large revenue contributor today, but it is growing rapidly. We believe it'll continue to grow longer term, and we continue to invest to expand and deepen our offerings. We currently have customers running full-function data warehouses in our cloud, as well as parts of data warehouse workloads such as subject-specific data marts, test and development, disaster recovery and sandboxes. These cloud offerings all leverage our core Data Warehouse strengths.
Other cloud offerings include Big Data Analytics and Hadoop, which leverage our strengths with Aster and various other UDA software, tools and consulting capabilities. We are experiencing good activity with all of our analytic cloud solutions in the U.S. And we are expanding in international, where we have now a handful of customers in production and seeing increased interest from customers and partners there.
Third, although we have experienced challenges with our Marketing Applications business, we are making good progress and it continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Teradata. Our technology is recognized as among the best for enterprise on-premises marketing resource management and campaign management. Last quarter, Teradata was once again named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management. And just last week, Forrester named Teradata as one of only 2 leaders in its first Wave report for real-time interaction management, noting our marketer-focused analytics and cross-channel orchestration. While we have been recognized for category leadership in marketing resource management and campaign management, we realize that has not translated into the results we should be capable of producing. We continue to take actions to improve our performance.
As mentioned on last quarter's call, our first action was to go to an integrated business model to enhance focus, speed and execution. At the same time, we've been investing in a major transformation, leveraging our digital marketing cloud platform to become a cloud-based solution provider for omnichannel marketing and also for all of our applications. We have successfully added and integrated mobile and social marketing capabilities from our recent acquisitions, and we are making improvements to our digital data analytics capability and user experience. We are also making investments to add more campaign management capabilities to our digital marketing cloud platform. Our digital marketing cloud is a key strategic growth initiative for us as more and more marketing applications move to the cloud. However, we believe there will continue to be a large on-premises market opportunity for marketing applications, and we will continue to offer those solutions as well. We believe these key initiatives, along with further refinements in our go-to-market approach, will position our marketing applications business for higher growth.
And last, we are the leader in data warehousing in terms of our technology and the extensive services we provide. This is evident from what you hear from the industry analysts, our customers, and also our win rates. Many of our outstanding base of customers see us as long-term partners in helping them to gain a better understanding of their business and their customers. Our customers include many of the world's most successful companies, and they are passionate advocates who share their positive experiences with other companies. The challenge that we have is that customers continue to invest in Teradata data warehouses but overall, they are buying in smaller amounts, in particular with major customers here in the U.S.
From a technology perspective, good-enough platforms have proliferated over the past couple of years to address various new data types and analytic workloads with many of these customers. Some of these customers are now beginning to feel the pain of the complexity and costs associated with these analytic environments, and we are starting to see investments coming back to Teradata, but in smaller amounts. In addition, the customer buying behavior for software and technology has changed. Companies want to purchase in smaller increments and have flexibility in how they purchase and how they deploy. To address these challenges, we've been taking actions to make it easier for customers to buy and deploy Teradata and in turn expand our market opportunity. I'd like to share with you where we're at with our new core Data Warehouse initiatives.
First, we have been engineering a software-only version of Teradata for over a year now. This will enable companies with private clouds to run Teradata. We expect to have our software-only version in beta by Q2 2016 and a production version by Q1 2017. In addition, our software-only offering will enable companies to run Teradata in public clouds. We do not expect our software-only version of Teradata to provide the same levels of performance and SLAs that our fully integrated platforms deliver, but there is a software-only market opportunity that we believe Teradata can excel at.
Second, we are expanding the options for how companies can purchase Teradata. Previously, we have offered subscription pricing on a custom basis, and we are now in the process of standardizing it so we can deploy it more broadly in the market. This enables a customer to pay as they would in our Teradata Cloud when it resides in their own data center. And they can also opt for our managed services to run it.
Third, our Teradata analytics cloud will benefit our core Data Warehouse business as well as our big data business. For prospective customers, they can experiment with our Data Warehouse technology, start small and pay as they go, expand it and then eventually decide whether to stay in our cloud or move the data warehouse to their data center. For existing customers, they can move everything to the cloud, specific workloads to the cloud, or just do exploratory analytics in the cloud. Overall, our goal with these initiatives is to make it easier to do business with our core Data Warehouse solution by providing options for deployment and purchasing while extending our market opportunity. These Data Warehouse initiatives, along with our Marketing Applications growth, will also increase the percent of recurring revenue in Teradata over time.
To summarize our key initiatives. Number one, we are looking to increase growth in our core Data Warehouse business by providing more options to make it easier to deploy and purchase Teradata. Two, we will continue to scale our big data business while working to increase margins year-on-year. Three, we will continue to scale our Teradata Cloud, which will benefit both our core Data Warehouse business and our big data business and expand our market opportunity. Four, we will continue to scale our Marketing Applications business while working to increase margins year-on-year. And last, we will continue to optimize our cost structure to help fund these growth initiatives. Currently, our target for operating expenses in 2016 is to increase low single digits over 2015.
We believe that, collectively, these actions will improve our overall performance and enhance shareholder value. In addition, we are actively engaged with third-party consultants to get an outside view of all this through a different lens. We will provide an update on these key initiatives later in the year, when we will be in a better position to provide more details.
As I said before, we are currently headed in the right direction in the second half of 2015 and into 2016. We have a great opportunity to make it even better.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"
97999,307196711,851188,"Teradata Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike.Before I discuss our quarterly results, I'd like to address the $340 million noncash goodwill impairment charge we took in the quarter related to our Marketing Applications business. We performed a goodwill evaluation during the quarter, wh",1241,"Thanks, Mike.
Before I discuss our quarterly results, I'd like to address the $340 million noncash goodwill impairment charge we took in the quarter related to our Marketing Applications business. We performed a goodwill evaluation during the quarter, which requires an assessment of the business unit's estimated fair value. As a result of this evaluation, we determined that the carrying value of the recently created Marketing Applications business segment was higher than its fair value, which resulted in a write-down of the goodwill. We remain committed to the improved performance of our Marketing Applications business segment, and we believe that solutions will play an important role in our growth strategy over the long term.
Now I'll turn to the quarterly results. And as usual, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other special items identified in our earnings release, including the impairment of goodwill I just described.
Product gross margin rebounded from the abnormally low margin in Q1. In the second quarter, product gross margin was 65.6%, basically in line with the second quarter of 2014, as mix normalized from the adverse mix in Q1. Adjusting for currency, Q2 product gross margin would have been higher than the prior year. FAS 86 amortization is still expected to increase approximately $6 million or $0.03 of EPS for 2015 versus 2014. Q2 declined approximately $1 million, and we expect an increase of approximately $2 million in Q3 and $4 million in Q4. As a reminder, FAS 86 amortization impacts product gross margin.
Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.3%, down from a strong 48.1% in Q2 of 2014. Services margin was impacted by a lower professional services rate as a result of increased work in process, as well as investments we are making in our cloud offerings.
Overall gross margin was 54.3% in the second quarter compared to 56.1% in the second quarter of 2014.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $179 million was up $6 million or 3% higher than the second quarter of 2014. The increase was mostly due to investments in demand-creation headcount, partially offset by foreign currency movement. Research and development expense in the quarter was $52 million, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014. The increase is primarily driven by investments in Unified Data Architecture and big data technology, as well as Marketing Applications. In support of our strategic growth initiatives, we expect R&D expense will continue to increase year-over-year, however, not as much as we had previously anticipated as we are in the process of optimizing our R&D resources and expenditures. Consequently, we now expect R&D expense for the full year to be up in the mid- to high teens, as our investment in R&D continues to be a very key initiative for Teradata. As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 17.2%. This is down from 23.5% yield in Q2 2014. The decline in operating margin was due in a large part to lower revenue, our services gross margin and the investments we are making for future revenue growth.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.6% versus 28.3% in Q2 2014. The lower non-GAAP tax rate was primarily driven by more favorable forecasted foreign earnings mix year-over-year. Looking forward for 2015, we expect full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, with the actual tax rate being dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. In addition, this presumes that the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2014, will be retroactively reinstated at some point during 2015. Until such time this occurs, our quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate will be negatively impacted by approximately 65 basis points.
In terms of earnings per share, we reported GAAP EPS loss of $1.87 in Q2 due to the goodwill impairment charge discussed earlier. This compared to a positive $0.60 in Q2 of 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, including the goodwill impairment charge, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 compared to $0.72 in Q2 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $80 million in Q2 2015 versus $138 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the second quarter, we had $27 million of capital expenditures versus $25 million in the second quarter of 2014, resulting in free cash flow of $53 million versus the $113 million generated in Q2 2014. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower net income as well as the timing of payables. However, we still expect full year free cash flow to equal GAAP net income excluding the $340 million impairment, or up to $50 million higher.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $921 million of cash as of June 30, 2015, of which less than 10% was held in the U.S. This is up from the $881 million as of March 31, 2015.
During the second quarter, we bought approximately 700,000 shares of Teradata stock for a total cost of approximately $25 million. During the first half of the year, we bought approximately 7 million shares, for a total cost of approximately $300 million. As of June 30, we have approximately $412 million of share repurchase authorization available.
With respect to accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 71 days as of June 30, 2015, compared to 73 days as of June 30, 2014. Total deferred revenue was $461 million as of June 30, 2015, which was down $7 million from June 30, 2014, which was due to foreign currency movement. Deferred revenue grew approximately 5% in constant currency.
Turning to guidance.
For the full year, as a result of the deferrals and longer sales cycles, full year 2015 revenue is now expected to be up 0% to 3% in constant currency, down 3% to 6% as reported. Factoring in the goodwill impairment charge, full year GAAP EPS now is expected to be a loss in the $0.32 to $0.62 range. And adjusting for special items, full year non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the $2.20 to $2.50 range.
To provide some directional color as to our expectations for Q3. We anticipate that reported revenue will be lower than last year's Q3 revenue, and as is always the case, the timing of larger transactions can have a meaningful impact on our revenue. Due to the current forecasted mix of product revenue, we expect product gross margin in Q3 to be similar to the Q3 2014 product gross margin. We expect services gross margin to be similar to the 2015 year-to-date rate. We expect operating expenses to approximate Q2 2015.
To summarize, the potential impact of the items I just referenced could lead to Q3 2015 non-GAAP EPS being approximately $0.15 lower than the Q3 2014.
In closing, the initiatives Mike mentioned will continue over the next several quarters and are expected to favorably impact our business results, starting in 2016. We are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies to make it easier for companies to buy Teradata no matter how they want to purchase Teradata, either on premise, in a subscription model or in the cloud. We have the best analytical database in the business, and we are altering our models to be also the most flexible and easiest to buy from as well.
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Regarding the Teradata Cloud, think of it this way: We've been maturing it and working with it and learning from it over the last 3 or 4 years. And quite frankly, there isn't a lot of demand out there in the marketplace to go take an on-premise, large-scale data warehouse and put it in the cloud. We have done it, okay? So it's not a technology thing. There's other factors around sensitivity, around certain strategic things customers are doing in the data that resides there and everything else. But what we're seeing as thing has progressed is we're seeing more demand for certain workloads. So it might be a specific data mart that's not strategic to run in the cloud. It might be test and development. It might be disaster recovery, or it might be grabbing capacity to do sandbox types of analytics. On the subscription model, there we've been maturing it as well, if you think about it. We've been doing it over time. And it's getting to more of a standardized type of offer, and then it'll go more broadly in the market. But here again, demand isn't huge but we do think there's an opportunity to make it easier to do business with Teradata as it relates to the data warehousing. But I think you got to look further down the road, and further down the road, there'll be more and more data warehousing in the cloud. And with our software only, we can go address the market opportunity in the public cloud for customers who want to do it that way. And in the subscription model, over time, this can be a much bigger thing as well. I think, if I net it all out, we're just trying to uncover and do every little thing we can that'll help our core Data Warehouse business and its adoption in the market."

The other thing is our international region in the TDA, Teradata Data and Analytics, unit. Our international region had close to 10% constant currency growth in 2014. And in the first half of the year, we knew we were going to run in the buzzsaw [ph] with some of the prior-year comparables, especially in the second half. And international had a decline in the second quarter, and we felt that. Now when we look at the second half, international's on a pretty good trajectory for high single digits constant currency growth. So we've got international coming back in the second half. We feel good about our services revenue component, which is a little under 60% of total revenue, and it leaves what happens here in the Americas and the U.S. And we've kind of risk-adjusted what we're seeing there, which is a higher amount than kind of what we have in our guidance. I hope that answers the question."

It's growing at a big rate, and it's becoming a meaningful amount of business. The core on-premise Data Warehouse business, if you take a look at that, the -- we're seeing a deceleration occur in major customers in the U.S. And there, it will hit a baseline eventually, and then we will grow from there. So once we get settled here on the core business, it's not like the on-premise data warehouses are moving to the clouds or things like that, very little bit of that, we will hit a baseline. We've already had a couple customers in the first half that hit the wall, if you will, and refreshed their EDWs with 2 floor sweeps in the top 50. We have a very, very old, aging base, in particular in the U.S. So there are some underpinnings here that can point towards a bottoming-out in the on-premise data warehouse environment where it'll return to growth. And we're talking about the U.S. International's been growing, and the big hit has been in these major customers. Add a little more information: At the same time, if we can't grow the data warehouses, the customers that put down the clamps on the spending on the EDW and then eventually have to refresh it, if that data warehouse isn't going to grow, we're replacing it with something that costs less money and has less maintenance than what they originally purchased it for, okay? Because you have the impact of Moore's law, but what's going on is we're starting to have some of the workloads that aren't on Teradata coming back to Teradata. I would like to say and give a specific number where this thing's headed, but all I can say is, when you collectively look at it and add it all up, I think the core Data Warehouse business on premise in the U.S. is going to hit an inflection point.

And it should open doors and be incremental, as far as running in public clouds, for companies that want to go in that direction. So there, not much of a headwind. It should be a tailwind when we get to 2017. The Teradata Cloud, it will present some of the headwind on revenue, of course, the way revenue is recognized, but we don't see -- we see workloads, some new workloads and some new customers going to the Teradata Cloud. We don't see a meaningful impact when we look at 2016 and our goal to get to 5% or mid-single digits revenue growth. On the subscription model, once again, that will be a headwind, but I think we have to -- the way revenue is recognized, but I think we have to look at how to position this with customers that may want to be in that model. We don't have a lot of demand from customers saying they would like to get to that model, but we do think it's our advantage if we have customers that want to go to a subscription model because it makes it easier for them to expand their data warehouses. So even though we don't have a lot of customers in the customized subscription model, what we see is it's much, much easier to expand. It doesn't require a large CapEx transaction. It doesn't require the levels of approval and everything else you get in a license model.

And good morning, everyone.Teradata finished Q2 with revenue of $623 million, which was lower than what we were expecting. Revenue decreased 8% as reported from prior year and was down 2% in constant currency.Product and services margin",1953,"Thanks, Gregg. And good morning, everyone.
Teradata finished Q2 with revenue of $623 million, which was lower than what we were expecting. Revenue decreased 8% as reported from prior year and was down 2% in constant currency.
Product and services margins improved sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and helped to provide a good non-GAAP earnings per share yield of $0.53 on the smaller-than-expected revenue. Services revenue grew 5% on a constant currency basis during the quarter, with maintenance revenue growing 6%. We were particularly pleased to see consulting services revenue increase 4% in constant currency following a decline in Q1, and we expect to see similar growth in the second half. Product revenue declined 9% in constant currency. Although we closed the major data warehouse opportunities in the U.S. that slipped out of Q1 into Q2, we once again experienced deferrals in the second quarter.
The environment in the U.S. has not changed regarding the continued pressure on large-CapEx transactions, along with the longer sales cycles, deferrals and the smaller deal sizes. This was a key factor in our decision to lower our 2015 guidance. However, our activity in the U.S. is up significantly from last year. This is reflected in the Americas third quarter funnel. The number of opportunities have increased more than 30%, but the dollar amount is roughly flat. That said, we are expecting to return to constant currency revenue growth in the second half, and we continue to believe that mid-single digits revenue growth is a reasonable target for 2016. In addition, we have a number of actions in progress to potentially position ourselves better as we exit 2015, which I will talk about later.
Turning to our segment results for Q2.
The Data and Analytics division revenue declined 8% as reported and was down 1% in constant currency. Within these results, we experienced strong growth with 2 of our key growth initiatives, big data and Teradata Cloud. Big data revenue, which includes our Aster-Hadoop and 1000 Series appliances, along with software tools and related services, continued its strong revenue growth with an increase of more than 50% in constant currency in the quarter. Big data revenue more than doubled during the first half. Aster, our Hadoop appliances and 1000 Series appliances all had strong growth; as well as our big data consulting services, which includes Think Big.
Teradata analytics cloud also grew at a very high rate in the quarter, with revenue increasing by more than 80% in constant currency and annual recurring revenue up close to 70% over prior year. Teradata Cloud revenue is currently small, but we see it as a big opportunity for us longer term and continue to enhance and add to our offerings.
Turning to our Marketing Applications business. Q2 revenue of $48 million was down 3% in constant currency. Recurring revenue declined 1% in constant currency, which was roughly in line with what we had expected.
We are beginning to make progress. Our digital marketing cloud solution, which will be the cloud platform for all of our marketing applications longer term, grew revenue in the mid-teens on a constant currency basis in the second quarter. And we continue to add new customers across all of our Marketing Applications solutions.
Overall, Teradata is operating from a position of strength in some very high-growth markets. First, in our big data initiative, we are leveraging our longstanding core competencies around integrating data to enable customers to gain better insights for their business, and doing it with a broader analytic ecosystem and across the multiple and diverse platforms that reside there. What we started more than 5 years ago evolved into our Unified Data Architecture. And we continue to add software, tools and platforms to make it easier for customers to implement and extract value with our UDA. Today, we have software and tools such as Aster, Unity, QueryGrid, RainStor, Loom and Viewpoint; as well as our appliances. We recently added a new Hadoop appliance that works with Cloudera or Hortonworks. We have never seen stronger interest in our UDA and in our world-class services to help customers design, implement and support it, and our consulting expertise to get value from their data. We are rapidly expanding our Think Big Analytics consulting business internationally as demand is accelerating outside of the U.S.
Second, as mentioned earlier, our Teradata analytics cloud initiative is not a large revenue contributor today, but it is growing rapidly. We believe it'll continue to grow longer term, and we continue to invest to expand and deepen our offerings. We currently have customers running full-function data warehouses in our cloud, as well as parts of data warehouse workloads such as subject-specific data marts, test and development, disaster recovery and sandboxes. These cloud offerings all leverage our core data warehouse strengths.
Other cloud offerings include Big Data Analytics and Hadoop, which leverage our strengths with Aster and various other UDA software, tools and consulting capabilities. We are experiencing good activity with all of our analytic cloud solutions in the U.S. And we are expanding in international, where we have now a handful of customers in production and seeing increased interest from customers and partners there.
Third, although we have experienced challenges with our Marketing Applications business, we are making good progress and it continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for Teradata. Our technology is recognized as among the best for enterprise on-premises marketing resource management and campaign management. Last quarter, Teradata was once again named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management. And just last week, Forrester named Teradata as one of only 2 leaders in its first Wave report for real-time interaction management, noting our marketer-focused analytics and cross-channel orchestration. While we have been recognized for category leadership in marketing resource management and campaign management, we realize that has not translated into the results we should be capable of producing. We continue to take actions to improve our performance.
As mentioned on last quarter's call, our first action was to go to an integrated business model to enhance focus, speed and execution. At the same time, we've been investing in a major transformation, leveraging our digital marketing cloud platform to become a cloud-based solution provider for omnichannel marketing and also for all of our applications. We have successfully added and integrated mobile and social marketing capabilities from our recent acquisitions, and we are making improvements to our digital data analytics capability and user experience. We are also making investments to add more campaign management capabilities to our digital marketing cloud platform. Our digital marketing cloud is a key strategic growth initiative for us as more and more marketing applications move to the cloud. However, we believe there will continue to be a large on-premises market opportunity for marketing applications, and we will continue to offer those solutions as well. We believe these key initiatives, along with further refinements in our go-to-market approach, will position our marketing applications business for higher growth.
And last, we are the leader in data warehousing in terms of our technology and the extensive services we provide. This is evident from what you hear from the industry analysts, our customers, and also our win rates. Many of our outstanding base of customers see us as long-term partners in helping them to gain a better understanding of their business and their customers. Our customers include many of the world's most successful companies, and they are passionate advocates who share their positive experiences with other companies. The challenge that we have is that customers continue to invest in Teradata data warehouses but overall, they are buying in smaller amounts, in particular with major customers here in the U.S.
From a technology perspective, good-enough platforms have proliferated over the past couple of years to address various new data types and analytic workloads with many of these customers. Some of these customers are now beginning to feel the pain of the complexity and costs associated with these analytic environments, and we are starting to see investments coming back to Teradata, but in smaller amounts. In addition, the customer buying behavior for software and technology has changed. Companies want to purchase in smaller increments and have flexibility in how they purchase and how they deploy. To address these challenges, we've been taking actions to make it easier for customers to buy and deploy Teradata and in turn expand our market opportunity. I'd like to share with you where we're at with our new core data warehouse initiatives.
First, we have been engineering a software-only version of Teradata for over a year now. This will enable companies with private clouds to run Teradata. We expect to have our software-only version in beta by Q2 2016 and a production version by Q1 2017. In addition, our software-only offering will enable companies to run Teradata in public clouds. We do not expect our software-only version of Teradata to provide the same levels of performance and SLAs that our fully integrated platforms deliver, but there is a software-only market opportunity that we believe Teradata can excel at.
Second, we are expanding the options for how companies can purchase Teradata. Previously, we have offered subscription pricing on a custom basis, and we are now in the process of standardizing it so we can deploy it more broadly in the market. This enables a customer to pay as they would in our Teradata Cloud when it resides in their own data center. And they can also opt for our managed services to run it.
Third, our Teradata analytics cloud will benefit our core data warehouse business as well as our big data business. For prospective customers, they can experiment with our data warehouse technology, start small and pay as they go, expand it and then eventually decide whether to stay in our cloud or move the data warehouse to their data center. For existing customers, they can move everything to the cloud, specific workloads to the cloud, or just do exploratory analytics in the cloud. Overall, our goal with these initiatives is to make it easier to do business with our core data warehouse solution by providing options for deployment and purchasing while extending our market opportunity. These data warehouse initiatives, along with our Marketing Applications growth, will also increase the percent of recurring revenue in Teradata over time.
To summarize our key initiatives. Number one, we are looking to increase growth in our core data warehouse business by providing more options to make it easier to deploy and purchase Teradata. Two, we will continue to scale our big data business while working to increase margins year-on-year. Three, we will continue to scale our Teradata Cloud, which will benefit both our core data warehouse business and our big data business and expand our market opportunity. Four, we will continue to scale our Marketing Applications business while working to increase margins year-on-year. And last, we will continue to optimize our cost structure to help fund these growth initiatives. Currently, our target for operating expenses in 2016 is to increase low single digits over 2015.
We believe that, collectively, these actions will improve our overall performance and enhance shareholder value. In addition, we are actively engaged with third-party consultants to get an outside view of all this through a different lens. We will provide an update on these key initiatives later in the year, when we will be in a better position to provide more details.
As I said before, we are currently headed in the right direction in the second half of 2015 and into 2016. We have a great opportunity to make it even better.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"
97999,307196711,853609,"Teradata Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2015",2015-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike.Before I discuss our quarterly results, I'd like to address the $340 million noncash goodwill impairment charge we took in the quarter related to our Marketing Applications business. We performed a goodwill evaluation during the quarter, wh",1241,"Thanks, Mike.
Before I discuss our quarterly results, I'd like to address the $340 million noncash goodwill impairment charge we took in the quarter related to our Marketing Applications business. We performed a goodwill evaluation during the quarter, which requires an assessment of the business unit's estimated fair value. As a result of this evaluation, we determined that the carrying value of the recently created Marketing Applications business segment was higher than its fair value, which resulted in a write-down of the goodwill. We remain committed to the improved performance of our Marketing Applications business segment, and we believe that solutions will play an important role in our growth strategy over the long term.
Now I'll turn to the quarterly results. And as usual, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other special items identified in our earnings release, including the impairment of goodwill I just described.
Product gross margin rebounded from the abnormally low margin in Q1. In the second quarter, product gross margin was 65.6%, basically in line with the second quarter of 2014, as mix normalized from the adverse mix in Q1. Adjusting for currency, Q2 product gross margin would have been higher than the prior year. FAS 86 amortization is still expected to increase approximately $6 million or $0.03 of EPS for 2015 versus 2014. Q2 declined approximately $1 million, and we expect an increase of approximately $2 million in Q3 and $4 million in Q4. As a reminder, FAS 86 amortization impacts product gross margin.
Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.3%, down from a strong 48.1% in Q2 of 2014. Services margin was impacted by a lower professional services rate as a result of increased work in process, as well as investments we are making in our cloud offerings.
Overall gross margin was 54.3% in the second quarter compared to 56.1% in the second quarter of 2014.
Turning to operating expenses. SG&A expense of $179 million was up $6 million or 3% higher than the second quarter of 2014. The increase was mostly due to investments in demand-creation headcount, partially offset by foreign currency movement. Research and development expense in the quarter was $52 million, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014. The increase is primarily driven by investments in Unified Data Architecture and big data technology, as well as Marketing Applications. In support of our strategic growth initiatives, we expect R&D expense will continue to increase year-over-year, however, not as much as we had previously anticipated as we are in the process of optimizing our R&D resources and expenditures. Consequently, we now expect R&D expense for the full year to be up in the mid- to high teens, as our investment in R&D continues to be a very key initiative for Teradata. As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 17.2%. This is down from 23.5% yield in Q2 2014. The decline in operating margin was due in a large part to lower revenue, our services gross margin and the investments we are making for future revenue growth.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27.6% versus 28.3% in Q2 2014. The lower non-GAAP tax rate was primarily driven by more favorable forecasted foreign earnings mix year-over-year. Looking forward for 2015, we expect full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, with the actual tax rate being dependent upon the ultimate earnings mix. In addition, this presumes that the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2014, will be retroactively reinstated at some point during 2015. Until such time this occurs, our quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate will be negatively impacted by approximately 65 basis points.
In terms of earnings per share, we reported GAAP EPS loss of $1.87 in Q2 due to the goodwill impairment charge discussed earlier. This compared to a positive $0.60 in Q2 of 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, including the goodwill impairment charge, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 compared to $0.72 in Q2 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $80 million in Q2 2015 versus $138 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the second quarter, we had $27 million of capital expenditures versus $25 million in the second quarter of 2014, resulting in free cash flow of $53 million versus the $113 million generated in Q2 2014. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower net income as well as the timing of payables. However, we still expect full year free cash flow to equal GAAP net income excluding the $340 million impairment, or up to $50 million higher.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $921 million of cash as of June 30, 2015, of which less than 10% was held in the U.S. This is up from the $881 million as of March 31, 2015.
During the second quarter, we bought approximately 700,000 shares of Teradata stock for a total cost of approximately $25 million. During the first half of the year, we bought approximately 7 million shares, for a total cost of approximately $300 million. As of June 30, we have approximately $412 million of share repurchase authorization available.
With respect to accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 71 days as of June 30, 2015, compared to 73 days as of June 30, 2014. Total deferred revenue was $461 million as of June 30, 2015, which was down $7 million from June 30, 2014, which was due to foreign currency movement. Deferred revenue grew approximately 5% in constant currency.
Turning to guidance.
For the full year, as a result of the deferrals and longer sales cycles, full year 2015 revenue is now expected to be up 0% to 3% in constant currency, down 3% to 6% as reported. Factoring in the goodwill impairment charge, full year GAAP EPS now is expected to be a loss in the $0.32 to $0.62 range. And adjusting for special items, full year non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the $2.20 to $2.50 range.
To provide some directional color as to our expectations for Q3. We anticipate that reported revenue will be lower than last year's Q3 revenue, and as is always the case, the timing of larger transactions can have a meaningful impact on our revenue. Due to the current forecasted mix of product revenue, we expect product gross margin in Q3 to be similar to the Q3 2014 product gross margin. We expect services gross margin to be similar to the 2015 year-to-date rate. We expect operating expenses to approximate Q2 2015.
To summarize, the potential impact of the items I just referenced could lead to Q3 2015 non-GAAP EPS being approximately $0.15 lower than the Q3 2014.
In closing, the initiatives Mike mentioned will continue over the next several quarters and are expected to favorably impact our business results, starting in 2016. We are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies to make it easier for companies to buy Teradata no matter how they want to purchase Teradata, either on premise, in a subscription model or in the cloud. We have the best analytical database in the business, and we are altering our models to be also the most flexible and easiest to buy from as well.
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Regarding the Teradata Cloud, think of it this way: We've been maturing it and working with it and learning from it over the last 3 or 4 years. And quite frankly, there isn't a lot of demand out there in the marketplace to go take an on-premise, large-scale data warehouse and put it in the cloud. We have done it, okay? So it's not a technology thing. There's other factors around sensitivity, around certain strategic things customers are doing in the data that resides there and everything else. But what we're seeing as thing has progressed is we're seeing more demand for certain workloads. So it might be a specific data mart that's not strategic to run in the cloud. It might be test and development. It might be disaster recovery, or it might be grabbing capacity to do sandbox types of analytics. On the subscription model, there we've been maturing it as well, if you think about it. We've been doing it over time. And it's getting to more of a standardized type of offer, and then it'll go more broadly in the market. But here again, demand isn't huge but we do think there's an opportunity to make it easier to do business with Teradata as it relates to the data warehousing. But I think you got to look further down the road, and further down the road, there'll be more and more data warehousing in the cloud. And with our software only, we can go address the market opportunity in the public cloud for customers who want to do it that way. And in the subscription model, over time, this can be a much bigger thing as well. I think, if I net it all out, we're just trying to uncover and do every little thing we can that'll help our core data warehouse business and its adoption in the market."

We're looking at 6% constant currency growth in the second half, and this is predictable revenue. It includes our maintenance revenue and then our consulting services, professional services that operates with the backlog, so we feel pretty good about getting 5% to 6% there. The other thing is our international region in the TDA, Teradata Data and Analytics, unit. Our international region had close to 10% constant currency growth in 2014. And in the first half of the year, we knew we were going to run in the buzzsaw [ph] with some of the prior-year comparables, especially in the second half. And international had a decline in the second quarter, and we felt that. Now when we look at the second half, international's on a pretty good trajectory for high single digits constant currency growth. So we've got international coming back in the second half. We feel good about our services revenue component, which is a little under 60% of total revenue, and it leaves what happens here in the Americas and the U.S. And we've kind of risk-adjusted what we're seeing there, which is a higher amount than kind of what we have in our guidance.

The core on-premise data warehouse business, if you take a look at that, the -- we're seeing a deceleration occur in major customers in the U.S. And there, it will hit a baseline eventually, and then we will grow from there. So once we get settled here on the core business, it's not like the on-premise data warehouses are moving to the clouds or things like that, very little bit of that, we will hit a baseline. We've already had a couple customers in the first half that hit the wall, if you will, and refreshed their EDWs with 2 floor sweeps in the top 50. We have a very, very old, aging base, in particular in the U.S. So there are some underpinnings here that can point towards a bottoming-out in the on-premise data warehouse environment where it'll return to growth. And we're talking about the U.S. International's been growing, and the big hit has been in these major customers. Add a little more information: At the same time, if we can't grow the data warehouses, the customers that put down the clamps on the spending on the EDW and then eventually have to refresh it, if that data warehouse isn't going to grow, we're replacing it with something that costs less money and has less maintenance than what they originally purchased it for, okay? Because you have the impact of Moore's law, but what's going on is we're starting to have some of the workloads that aren't on Teradata coming back to Teradata.

It should be a tailwind when we get to 2017. The Teradata Cloud, it will present some of the headwind on revenue, of course, the way revenue is recognized, but we don't see -- we see workloads, some new workloads and some new customers going to the Teradata Cloud. We don't see a meaningful impact when we look at 2016 and our goal to get to 5% or mid-single digits revenue growth. On the subscription model, once again, that will be a headwind, but I think we have to -- the way revenue is recognized, but I think we have to look at how to position this with customers that may want to be in that model. We don't have a lot of demand from customers saying they would like to get to that model, but we do think it's our advantage if we have customers that want to go to a subscription model because it makes it easier for them to expand their data warehouses. So even though we don't have a lot of customers in the customized subscription model, what we see is it's much, much easier to expand. It doesn't require a large CapEx transaction. It doesn't require the levels of approval and everything else you get in a license model.

You got to match costs with revenue, which we have not done the past year. So regarding the marketing business and analytics, yes, we've -- historically, we've always done a lot of analytics regardless of having a marketing application. We've done a lot of analytics with marketing organizations around the world. Our campaign management solution that we've had since 1999 has been very successful. And it's -- and multichannel campaign management is very, very closely tied with analytics, very, very, very closely tied, as is digital marketing and the explosion of information coming from new channels like social and so forth. With our Marketing Applications business, there's some good news in it. Number one is we know the market is growing. There's no confusion there. It's going in the right direction. We have strong assets within our marketing applications. And we have a very strong team of people, and a lot of them have come with acquisitions and they're still here, that have founded companies, started companies or -- in this space. We see a great opportunity for us. We haven't delivered on the opportunity. And I'm confident that -- well, we're showing signs of going in the right direction this year, and you'll see it as we get through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter.
Okay, thanks, everyone.
Yes, so basically I want to emphasize we are working hard on these initiatives to improve the Teradata performance as well as the second half, and we have to deliver on the second half. And we've got to work on these initiatives to make Teradata easier to implement, easier to buy, with multiple options of where to deploy it and everything else.
So we look forward to giving you an update on our progress next quarter, and have a good day. Thank you, everyone."

Although our overall",1342,"Thanks, Gregg, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I would like to focus my prepared remarks on a the actions we are taking and the future of Teradata. Then Steve will go over our third quarter results and full year guidance. 
Although our overall third quarter revenue was not what we expected, there were some positives in the quarter with our services and big data businesses that we will continue to build upon for the future as well as some SG&A cost efficiencies that we are beginning to realize.
Over the past year or so, we've been digging more deeply into our internal operations and into the markets we play in. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we have key initiatives underway to improve the performance of our company both the shorter-term and longer-term. While we have not completed of the entire process, we are already starting to take some significant actions. I would like to share some of our thoughts about these actions as well as what the future for Teradata will entail. 
First, after a thorough analysis of Teradata upper portfolio and opportunities, we have included it's in the best interest of the company and our shareholders to focus Teradata on our core data and analytics business and to exit our Marketing Applications business. We believe our Marketing Applications business can thrive under the right ownership. Our Marketing Applications have some solid improvements in 2015 due to a lot of great work by our team. It has the potential for high levels revenue growth and good profitability as reflected in our digital marketing cloud's constant currency revenue growth of 22% in the third quarter and 13% recurring revenue growth year-to-date. We have leading solutions as evidenced by the industry analysts rankings with our marketing resource management solution being the leader in that segment.
Our Marketing Applications portfolio operates in a very attractive market and we are starting to process to find the right owner.
We have had a tremendous opportunity with our core data and analytics business and we will now dedicate all of our energy, resources and investments to it. 
Our overall goal with Teradata going forward is to transform the business to better align ourselves with the evolving marketplace and customer needs. Through this transformation, we plan to drive meaningful revenue growth and improved profitability.
We are pursuing 4 key initiatives to help you build a transformation. Our first initiative is to expand our core data warehouse market opportunity where we are positioned us the leaders today and represents the majority of our revenue. As noted on our last earnings call, we've been re-engineering our core Teradata database for more than a year now to make it available as software only for both public and private clouds.
This expends the market opportunities significantly for our core data warehouse business. We will release our initial software-only version for global deployment on Amazon's cloud in the first quarter of 2016. This initial version can scale up to approximately 20 terabytes and do workloads such as departmental analytics, analytics sandboxes, smaller sized integrated data warehouse as well as test and developments as well as disaster and recovery. As a reminder, we plan to have our full-scale public and private cloud software-only versions available in the first quarter of 2017.
Our software-only offerings will provide customers the flexibility with where and how they deploy Teradata and how they pay such as through subscription and the ability to start or expand their existing Teradata environments in smaller increments. 
Second, we will continue to rationalize our big data portfolio, focusing investments on solutions that can drive revenue growth and to increase our relevance with customers in a the dynamic analytic ecosystem. Solutions such as Aster, where we recently announced that we are making Aster analytics available on Hadoop in the second quarter of 2016 and will expand our market opportunity significantly.
Aster is a market leader for Big Data Analytics and has more than 100 business ready algorithms and industry obligations available, which makes it easier for companies to drive value from big data.
And our Unified Data Architecture, which is strategic to Teradata and our customers. Our UDA helps customers to connect, capture, manage and analyze all data across the analytic ecosystem among other things. It also enables new data types and use cases to lend in our integrated data warehouses.
Other examples include our Hadoop appliance, which is providing customers ease of deployment along with software to help them manage and to connect these environments and our recently released Teradata listener for high-volume, high-speed data ingestion along with dynamic data immigration.
These are all solutions that provide customers a more tightly connected and easier to use analytical ecosystem and enable them to drive a more value from all types and sources of data. 
As big data and the Internet of Things continues to expand and grow and in prominence, we will continue to find new ways to help customers drive value from all of their data. 
Our analytics technology, and just as importantly, our services, have been a key differentiators for Teradata and will continue to be key differentiators going forward.
Our third key initiative is focused on our value added services, which we are enhancing and also extending the market opportunity beyond our Teradata user base. We are seeing a significant opportunity in demand for 3 of our service offerings: big data consulting, advanced analytics services and a managed services. 
Analytic architectures have become increasingly difficult to design, implement and manage and it is becoming increasingly hard for customers to attract the right talent to do this, as well as to doing analytics. We have the talent to do both. We are building good momentum with our Think Big consulting unit and growing our platform agnostic big data Consulting Services.
Think Big helps companies to design, implement, manage and drive value from Hadoop and big data. We will continue to increase investments in this business and expand our presence globally. 
We are also expanding our advanced analytics services to address complex industry analytics opportunities as well as customer specific opportunities that use Teradata and as well as other technologies. The growing demand for skills to do complex analytics is creating an attractive market dynamic for something that is core at Teradata. 
And last, we are increasing our managed services offerings across both our Teradata environments and the broader analytic ecosystem. We will continue to build out skilled resources to manage and optimize our customers end-to-end analytics environment for on-premises and cloud deployments. We recently launched managed services for all major Hadoop distributions from our Think Big consulting team to address the Hadoop portion of the analytic ecosystem and more.
These service offerings will enable Teradata to be a more effective partner to customers while expanding our market opportunity for services. 
Our fourth key initiative is go-to-market. We are in other early stages of this initiative but our overall goal is to flex our demand creation, sales and consumption models and to renew our focus on of the largest under-penetrated market opportunities.
Approximately 3 quarters of the largest 5,000 companies in the world are not using Teradata today. And within that, we now have a sizable opportunity to acquire more new customers in the B2B industries, which are going through a digital transformation with the Internet of Things and sensor data being key drivers.
As we transform our data and analytics business, we are also transforming our cost structure in parallel. Several cost rationalization work streams are in place with actions being taken across the company. Those work streams and actions include realigning the corporate structure for one business, optimizing our go-to-market approach and prioritizing R&D investments based on alignment with our strategic initiatives.
We are also evaluating every process and system within the company to find more efficient and less costly ways to do things.
I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail around our Q3 results, full year guidance and our cost initiatives. Steve?"

Since currency had such a big impact",1741,"Thanks, Mike. As a reminder, currency movement continues to create a significant headwind on reported year-over-year revenue comparisons, 6 percentage points for total revenue and consequently negatively impacting EPS. Since currency had such a big impact, I'll discuss revenue changes in constant currency and you can find a reported information in our earnings release.
Teradata reported revenue of $606 million in the third quarter, which is lower than what we were expecting. Revenues were down 3%. Services revenue grew 6% as we had anticipated but product revenue declined 14% in the quarter. We continue to experience the same headwinds we have been discussing for the past several quarters.
Within services revenue, Consulting Services revenue was up 5% and maintenance services revenue was up 7%. 
Turning to our segment results for Q3. The Date Analytics division saw a revenue of $557 million, which was a decline of 4%. Within Data and Analytics, revenue for the Americas was down 8% while the International is up 4%. Internationals results were led by overall growth in our Asia-Pacific Japan area with China and Japan growing around 20% as well as the U.K., up 25%.
Big data revenue, excluding our 1000 Series, which are part of our larger deal sizes and therefore tend to create their ability when comparing quarters, continue its strong growth in Q3 and we continue to add new big data customers at a rapid rate. Our big data revenue was up 75% in Q3. Our big data Consulting Services revenue, which includes Think Big, was up 30% on a pro forma basis in the quarter and is expected to be approximately the same rate for the year. 
Turning to our Marketing Applications segment. Revenue of $49 million was flat, which is an improvement over Q1 and Q2, which both were down period-over-period. Within that, our digital marketing cloud had strong growth at 22%. Recurring revenue and annual recurring revenue, which are key metrics for this business each grew and improved over Q1 and Q2 but this year. 
During my discussion today, except while otherwise noted, I will be addressing margin expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and special items including impairment, acquisition-related, restructuring integration and other special items identified in our earnings release.
Product gross margin in the third quarter was 60.4% compared to 60.9% in Q3 2014. The lower than normal product risk margin was driven by lower product revenue. Services gross margin recorded was 46.7% compared to 48.3% in Q3 of '14. The year-over-year decline was primarily at due to investments in the big data consulting capabilities and lower margins in other marketing application Consulting Services.
Year-to-date, services gross margin was 45.8% compared to 47.1% for the same period in 2014. Overall gross margin was 52.1% in the third quarter compared to 53.8% in the third quarter 2014. Year-to-date, overall gross margin was 52% versus 54.9% in Q4 in 2014.
Turning to operating expense. SG&A expense of $165 million was down $4 million from the third quarter of 2014 and down $14 million sequentially, reflecting the expected early benefit of cost reduction initiatives that are estimated to show up to a greater extent in 2016.
Research and development expense in the quarter was $44 million, up 10% from the third quarter 2014. Although we are continuing to invest for the future of Teradata, we are also rationalizing in realigning the spending. We now expect our R&D expense for the year to increase between 10% to 15% versus the 25% planned earlier in the year. Even though investing in R&D and road map continues to be a key strategic initiative for Teradata.
Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, plus of the capitalization of internally developed software was $63 million, this compared to $58 million in Q3 2014.
Total expenses in the third quarter were $209 million, the same as Q3 2014. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 17.7%, in line with our expectations but lower than the 22.5% operating margin in Q3 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.7%, in line with the 26% non-GAAP tax rate in Q3 2014. On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.9% versus 28.1% for the same period in 2014. The reduction of the effective rate year-over-year is a result of a more earnings mix period over period. 
We are currently forecasting our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, which assumes that the U.S. R&D Tax Credit will be reinstated retroactively for 2015 before December 31, 2015. If the credit is not restated -- reinstated by December 31, 2015, it would increase our non-GAAP effective tax rate by approximately 200 basis points in the fourth quarter and 75 basis points for the full year 2015.
In terms of earnings per share, our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.55 compared to $0.60 in Q3 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which offset each other in the third quarter as a gain from an equity investment offset the special items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.55 compared to $0.71 in Q3 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $68 million in Q3 2015 versus $102 million in the third quarter of 2014. The decrease in cash from operations for Q3 2015 over 2014 was primarily a result of the reduction in net income. Year-to-date, cash from operating activities was $370 million versus $583 million generated during the same period of 2014. In the third quarter, we had $35 million of capital expenditures including capitalized software versus $36 million in the third quarter 2014 resulting in free cash flow of $33 million versus the $66 million generated in Q3 2014.
Free cash flow for the first 9 months was $276 million versus $489 million generated in the same period in 2014. We still expect our 2015 full year free cash flow to be up to $50 million higher than the GAAP net income, excluding the impact from impairment and gains on equity investments. 
Moving onto the balance sheet. We have $874 million of cash as of September 30, 2015, this is down from then $921million at the end of the third quarter of 2015.
Of the $874 million of cash, approximately 5% was held in the U.S. as we continue to utilize our domestic free cash flow for share repurchases.
During the third quarter, we bought approximately 8.5 million shares of our stock for approximately $250 million. As of September 30, we had approximately $667 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our general share repurchase program.
At the end of the third quarter, we had $710 million of debt on the balance sheet as we borrowed $110 on our $400 million revolving credit facility to fund share repurchases.
With respect to accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2015, accounts receivable decreased $36 million compared to same date in 2014 due to lower volume. But we're only down $3 million in constant currency. 
Days sales outstanding was 69 days as of September 30, 2015 compared to 70 days of September 30, 2014.
Total deferred revenue was $401 million as of September 30, 2015 up 5% on constant currency from September 30, 2014.
Turning to guidance. We are lowering our expectations for the full year 2015 revenue to be flat to down 2% on a constant-currency basis or down 6% to 8% as reported. Correspondingly, full year non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. On a GAAP basis, we expect it to report a loss in the $0.51 to $0.71 range.
I do want to point out that our revised full year guidance does not reflect our intent to exit the Marketing Applications business.
We will provide the financial details on Marketing Applications business as well as of the go forward Teradata financials when we announce our Q4 results. We are finalizing exactly what portion of the Marketing Applications business will remain with Teradata since there is some application business, approximately 20% of the Marketing Applications revenue, that is related to Teradata's Data and Analytics business, which we expect to retain. In order to give you some context of the future changes in Teradata's financials, excluding Marketing Applications, there is approximately $160 million of annualized revenue associated with the exited business, which has a gross margin of approximately 40%. There is approximately $100 million plus of disassociated operating expenses associated with the business.
As I highlighted, in addition to our intent to exit the Marketing Applications business, we have commenced developing meaningful cost rationalization and realignment action plans to not only improve our financial performance but also to better align with the evolving market. All of these actions that will be developed and implemented as a part of this transformational process are currently estimated to have a target benefit to 2016 operating income of approximately $120 million. Although our plans are still being developed with in this estimating operating income benefit target, total operating expense reductions for 2016 versus 2015 total operating expenses, inclusive of TMA, is currently estimated being into the range of $180 million to $200 million.
The annualized estimated cost-savings associated with the transformational initiatives that we are developing, this excludes Marketing Applications, is expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million.
To be clear, these are our best estimates of the benefits from these transformational action items. In 2016, we will still have some year-over-year cost increases such as variable compensation and salary increases. We are not providing absolute guidance on the amount of operating income for 2016 as specific plans are still being developed.
Regarding 2016 and beyond, we are working on a financial road map, which include estimates associated with revenue generation via different consumption models, which we see currently as largely incremental in the shorter-term. This is correctly a work in process. We will provide more information in context regarding this road map when we provide our Q4 full year 2015 results.
Teradata will provide its expectations for 2016 revenue and EPS in its fourth quarter earnings call. Until that time, previous commentary by the company regarding 2016 should not be relied upon.
I will turn the call back to Mike for some closing comments."

What we're seeing is yes, we are being cautious on that revenue number in Q4 but the margin side is really driven from the product gross margin. We still expect about 200 basis points of FX headwind on the product gross margin. Last year it was 65% in Q4 last year. I'm looking at about 62%. And of the other 100 basis points on that, around 62%, another 100 basis points id really the product mix side of it. So that's the big driver.

Also on top of the 2016 operating expense saves on the remaining analytics part of the business and corporate. Now when I referenced the $80 million to $100 million of cost-savings for corporate and the remaining analytics business, that's an annualized target and there's a lesser amount that will be to impact in 2016. We're seeing some of those materializing a little bit in 2015. But the biggest bulk is coming in 2016 and that will be a part of that $80 million to $100 million. Does that help you that are?

And yes, maybe it may not have the SLAs and availability of what we have with our integrated core warehouse offering. It is integrated with design with hardware and industry-standard hardware and the software and everything else, like that. But overall, if you look at this overall the long period of time, we would expect the availability and infrastructure to continue to improve. And we have customers out there today, and perspective customers out there today, where something that is good enough fits their needs in terms of SOA, availability and everything else. That we have other workloads with customers where it needs to be perfect. They cannot operate without a hiccup and they're looking for the almost 100% pure availability that we deliver with our negative data warehouse. And so I think, if you look at this thing going forward, it's broadening our market opportunity. It's providing more flexibility and options for customers that don't have the same requirement and SOA of what we provide today. And they can put stuff up there in small increments. They can do it easily. It can function as a hybrid with our on-premise high-availability offerings with what they're putting up in the Amazon cloud. And for things like custom development and DR, analytic sandboxes, departmental analytics, all those types of things where you don't need the quite the robustness of what we offer today on premise. So we see it as a great fit and ability to expand the market opportunity."

You can see in our new customer wins where the margin for the full several quarters headwinds shifting in getting higher to the 2000. It doesn't necessarily mean that these are small customers but because they want to start into small pieces. So I think this is the changing dynamics in the marketplace. It's actually been there for a while. And we're transforming and moving with it. So the cloud, whether it's a Teradata cloud or public cloud, provides a great opportunity in small increments. To actually in temporary increments. The capacity to do sandbox is the capacity to do whatever. And this is the dynamic going forward. So if look at the mix, overall mix of the cloud, what you want to call it, cloud software only, Teradata Cloud, 2000, 1000 and then you look in the 1000 is a great opportunity to grow quite a bit in this new analytic ecosystem. That all said, over time, yes, the 6000 should be a small part of our revenue. Not that it's going to shrink and decline, not that anyone has discontinued 6000 or left are there or anything like that and in about the 6000 can't grow but as a percent of our total revenue, yes, the 6000 should be lower. Now if I can add, if you look at this whole thing, we're going to get to a road map, a financial road map for everyone, but if you look at the margin, software only brings high-margin, obviously, and 6000 high-margin and then we've got the 1000, the analytic ecosystem lower margins, and that is growing rapidly. And then we have the 2000. So the good news is we've got 2 prongs that will be growing at a higher margin, obviously, software-only and 6000."

And Steve will go over our third quarter results and full year guidance. 
Although our overall third quarter revenue was not what we expected, there were some positives in the quarter with our services and big data businesses that we will continue to build upon for the future, as well as some SG&A cost efficiencies that we are beginning to realize.
Over the past year or so, we have been digging more deeply into our internal operations and into the markets we play in. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we have key initiatives underway to improve the performance of our company both shorter-term and longer-term. While we have not completed of the entire process, we are already starting to take some significant actions. I would like to share some of our thoughts about those actions as well as what the future for Teradata will entail. 
First, after a thorough analysis of Teradata's portfolio and opportunities, we have concluded it's in the best interest of the company and our shareholders to focus Teradata on our core Data and Analytics business and to exit our Marketing Applications business. 
We believe our Marketing Applications business can thrive under the right ownership. Our Marketing Applications has shown solid improvements in 2015 due to a lot of great work by our team. It has the potential for high levels of revenue growth and good profitability, as reflected in our digital marketing cloud's constant-currency revenue growth of 22% in the third quarter and 13% recurring revenue growth year-to-date. We have leading solutions, as evidenced by the industry analyst rankings, with our Marketing Resource Management solution being the leader in its segment. Our Marketing Applications portfolio operates on a very attractive market, and we are starting the process to find the right owner.
We have a tremendous opportunity with our core Data and Analytics business, and we will now dedicate all of our energy, resources and investments to it. 
Our overall goal with Teradata going forward is to transform the business to better align ourselves with the evolving marketplace and customer needs. Through this transformation, we plan to drive meaningful revenue growth and improved profitability.
We are pursuing 4 key initiatives to help fuel the transformation. Our first initiative is to expand our core data warehouse market opportunity, where we are positioned us the leaders today and represents the majority of our revenue. 
As noted on our last earnings call, we have been re-engineering our core Teradata database for more than a year now to make it available as software-only for both public and private clouds. This extends the market opportunities significantly for our core data warehouse business. 
We will release our initial software-only version for global deployment on Amazon's cloud in the first quarter of 2016. This initial version can scale up to approximately 20 terabytes and do workloads such as departmental analytics, analytic sandboxes, smaller sized integrated data warehouse, as well as test and development and disaster recovery. As a reminder, we plan to have our full-scale public and private cloud software-only versions available in the first quarter of 2017.
Our software-only offerings will provide customers the flexibility with where and how they deploy Teradata and how they pay, such as through subscription, and the ability to start or expand their existing Teradata environments in smaller increments. 
Second, we will continue to rationalize our big data portfolio, focusing investments on solutions that can drive revenue growth and to increase our relevance with customers in the dynamic analytic ecosystem. Solutions such as Aster, where we recently announced that we are making Aster analytics available on Hadoop in the second quarter of 2016 and will extend our market opportunity significantly. Aster is a market leader for Big Data Analytics and has more than 100 business-ready algorithms and industry obligations available, which makes it easier for companies to drive value from big data.
And our Unified Data Architecture, which is strategic to Teradata and our customers. Our UDA helps customers to connect, capture, manage and analyze all data across the analytic ecosystem among other things. It also enables new data types and use cases to land in our integrated data warehouses.
Other examples include our Hadoop appliance, which is providing customers ease of deployment along with software to help them manage and to connect these environments, and our recently released Teradata listener for high-volume, high-speed data ingestion along with dynamic data immigration.
These are all solutions that provide customers a more tightly connected and easier to use analytical ecosystem and enable them to drive more value from all types and sources of data. 
As big data and the Internet of Things continues to expand and grow in prominence, we will continue to find new ways to help customers drive value from all of their data. Our analytics technology, and just as importantly, our services, have been a key differentiators for Teradata and will continue to be key differentiators going forward.
Our third key initiative is focused on our value-added services, which we are enhancing and also extending the market opportunity beyond our Teradata user base. We are seeing a significant opportunity in demand for 3 of our service offerings: Big data consulting, advanced analytic services and managed services. 
Analytic architectures have become increasingly difficult to design, implement and manage, and it is becoming increasingly hard for customers to attract the right talent to do this, as well as to do analytics. We have the talent to do both. We are building good momentum with our Think Big consulting unit and growing our platform-agnostic big data consulting services.
Think Big helps companies to design, implement, manage and drive value from Hadoop and big data. We will continue to increase investments in this business and expand our presence globally. 
We are also expanding our advanced analytics services to address complex industry analytics opportunities, as well as customer-specific opportunities that use Teradata and as well as other technologies. The growing demand for skills to do complex analytics is creating an attractive market dynamic for something that is core at Teradata. 
And last, we are increasing our managed services offerings across both our Teradata environments and the broader analytic ecosystem. We will continue to build out skilled resources to manage and optimize our customers' end-to-end analytics environment for on-premises and cloud deployments. We recently launched managed services for all major Hadoop distributions from our Think Big consulting team to address the Hadoop portion of the analytic ecosystem and more. These service offerings will enable Teradata to be a more effective partner to customers while expanding our market opportunity for services. 
Our fourth key initiative is go-to-market. We are in the early stages of this initiative, but our overall goal is to flex our demand creation, sales and consumption models and to renew our focus on of the largest under-penetrated market opportunities.
Approximately 3/4 of the largest 5,000 companies in the world are not using Teradata today. And within that, we now have a sizable opportunity to acquire more new customers in the B2B industries which are going through a digital transformation, with the Internet of Things and sensor data being key drivers.
As we transform our data and analytics business, we are also transforming our cost structure in parallel. Several cost rationalization work streams are in place with actions being taken across the company. Those work streams and actions include realigning the corporate structure for one business, optimizing our go-to-market approach and prioritizing R&D investments based on alignment with our strategic initiatives. We are also evaluating every process and system within the company to find more efficient and less costly ways to do things.
I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail around our Q3 results, full year guidance and our cost initiatives. Steve?"
97999,312130397,893504,"Teradata Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike.

As a reminder, currency movement continues to create a significant headwind on reported year-over-year revenue comparisons, 6 percentage points for total revenue, and consequently negatively impacting EPS. Since currency had such a big impact, I will discuss revenue changes in constant currency, and you can find a reported information in our earnings release.
Teradata reported revenue of $606 million in the third quarter, which is lower than what we were expecting. Revenue was down 3%. Services revenue grew 6%, as we had anticipated, but product revenue declined 14% in the quarter. We continue to experience the same headwinds we have been discussing for the past several quarters.
Within services revenue, consulting services revenue was up 5% and maintenance services revenue was up 7%. 
Turning to our segment results for Q3. The Date Analytics division saw revenue of $557 million, which was a decline of 4%. Within Data and Analytics, revenue for the Americas was down 8% while International was up 4%. International's results were led by overall growth in our Asia-Pacific Japan area, with China and Japan growing around 20%; as well as the U.K., up 25%.
Big data revenue, excluding our 1000 Series which are a part of our larger deal sizes and therefore tend to create variability when comparing quarters, continued its strong growth in Q3. And we continue to add new big data customers at a rapid rate. Our big data revenue is up 75% in Q3. Our big data consulting services revenue, which includes Think Big, was up 30% on a pro forma basis in the quarter and is expected to be approximately the same rate for the year. 
Turning to our Marketing Applications segment. Revenue of $49 million was flat, which is an improvement over Q1 and Q2, which both were down period-over-period. Within that, our digital marketing cloud had strong growth at 22%. Recurring revenue and annual recurring revenue, which are key metrics for this business, each grew and improved over Q1 and Q2 but this year. 
During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and special items, including impairment, acquisition-related restructuring integration and other special items identified in our earnings release.
Product gross margin in the third quarter was 60.4% compared to 60.9% in Q3 2014. The lower-than-normal product gross margin was driven by lower product revenue. Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.7% compared to 48.3% in Q3 '14. The overall -- the year-over-year decline was primarily due to investments in the big data consulting capabilities and lower margins in other marketing application consulting services.
Year-to-date, services gross margin was 45.8% compared to 47.1% for the same period in 2014. Overall gross margin was 52.1% in the third quarter compared to 53.8% in the third quarter 2014. Year-to-date, overall gross margin was 52% versus 54.9% in Q4 -- in 2014.
Turning to operating expense. SG&A expense of $165 million was down $4 million from the third quarter of 2014 and down $14 million sequentially, reflecting the expected early benefit of cost reduction initiatives that are estimated to show up to a greater extent in 2016.
Research and development expense in the quarter was $44 million, up 10% from the third quarter 2014. Although we are continuing to invest for the future of Teradata, we are also rationalizing and realigning the spending. We now expect our R&D expense for the year to increase between 10% to 15% versus the 25% planned earlier in the year. Even though, investing in R&D in roadmap continues to be a key strategic initiative for Teradata.
Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less the capitalization of internally developed software, was $63 million. This compared to $58 million in Q3 2014.
Total expenses in the third quarter were $209 million, the same as Q3 2014. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 17.7%, in line with our expectations but lower than the 22.5% operating margin in Q3 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.7%, in line with the 26% non-GAAP tax rate in Q3 2014. On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.9% versus 28.1% for the same period in 2014. The reduction of the effective rate year-over-year is a result of a more favorable earnings mix period over period. 
We are currently forecasting our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, which assumes that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be reinstated retroactively for 2015 before December 31, 2015. If the credit is not restated -- reinstated by December 31, 2015, it would increase our non-GAAP effective tax rate by approximately 200 basis points in the fourth quarter and 75 basis points for the full year 2015.
In terms of earnings per share, our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.55 compared to $0.60 in Q3 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which offset each other in the third quarter as a gain from an equity investment, offset the special items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.55 compared to $0.71 in Q3 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $68 million in Q3 2015 versus $102 million in the third quarter of 2014. The decrease in cash from operation for Q3 in 2015 over 2014 was primarily a result of the reduction in net income. Year-to-date, cash from operating activities was $370 million versus $583 million generated during the same period of 2014. In the third quarter, we had $35 million of capital expenditures, including capitalized software, versus $36 million in the third quarter 2014, resulting in free cash flow of $33 million versus the $66 million generated in Q3 2014.
Free cash flow for the 9 month -- first 9 months was $276 million versus $489 million generated during the same period in 2014. We still expect our 2015 full year free cash flow to be up to $50 million higher than GAAP net income, excluding the impact from impairment and gains on equity investments. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $874 million of cash as of September 30, 2015, this is down from then $921 million at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Of the $874 million of cash, approximately 5% was held in the U.S. as we continue to utilize our domestic free cash flow for share repurchases. 
During the third quarter, we bought approximately 8.5 million shares of our stock for approximately $250 million. As of September 30, we had approximately $667 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our general share repurchase program.
At the end of the third quarter, we had $710 million of debt on the balance sheet as we borrowed $110 on our $400 million revolving credit facility to fund share repurchases.
With respect to accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2015, accounts receivable decreased $36 million compared to the same date in 2014 due to lower volume. But we were only down $3 million in constant currency. 
Days sales outstanding was 69 days as of -- at September 30, 2015, compared to 70 days at September 30, 2014. Total deferred revenue was $401 million as of September 30, 2015, up 5% on constant currency from September 30, 2014.
Turning to guidance. We are lowering our expectations for the full year 2015 revenue to be flat to down 2% on a constant-currency basis or down 6% to 8% as reported. Correspondingly, full year non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. On a GAAP basis, we expect to report a loss in the $0.51 to $0.71 range.
I do want to point out that our revised full year guidance does not reflect our intent to exit the Marketing Applications business.
We will provide the financial details on Marketing Applications business as well as the go-forward Teradata financials when we announce our Q4 results. We are finalizing exactly what portion of the Marketing Applications business will remain with Teradata, since there is some application business, approximately 20% of the Marketing Applications revenue, that is related to Teradata's Data and Analytics business, which we expect to retain. 
In order to give you some context of the future changes in Teradata's financials, excluding Marketing Applications, there is approximately $160 million of annualized revenue associated with the exited business, which has a gross margin of approximately 40%. There is approximately $100 million plus of associated operating expenses associated with the business.
As Mike highlighted, in addition to our intent to exit the Marketing Applications business, we have commenced developing meaningful cost rationalization and realignment action plans to not only improve our financial performance but also to better align with the evolving market. All of these actions that will be developed and implemented as a part of this transformational process are currently estimated to have a target benefit to 2016 operating income of approximately $120 million. Although our plans are still being developed within this estimating operating income benefit target, total operating expense reduction for 2016 versus 2015 total operating expenses, inclusive of TMA, is currently estimated to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million.
The annualized estimated cost savings associated with the transformational initiatives that we are developing, this excludes Marketing Applications, is expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million.
To be clear, these are our best estimates of the benefits from these transformational action items. In 2016, we will still have some year-over-year cost increases, such as variable compensation and salary increases. We are not providing absolute guidance on the amount of operating income for 2016, as specific plans are still being developed.
Regarding 2016 and beyond. We are working on a financial road map which include estimates associated with revenue generation via different consumption models, which we see currently as largely incremental in the shorter term. This is correctly a work in process. We will provide more information and context regarding this road map when we provide our Q4 full year 2015 results.
Teradata will provide its expectations for 2016 revenue and EPS in its fourth quarter earnings call. Until that time, previous commentary by the company regarding 2016 should not be relied upon.
I will turn the call back to Mike for some closing comments."

With respect to the cost saves that you referenced on, yes, the income -- operating income benefit of that we're looking at for '16 that I -- that we're targeting, that $120 million, that's a the benefit -- that's the a target for 2016. Now that's inclusive of the benefit that we'll be getting from the Marketing Apps business coming out in '16, also on top of the 2016 operating expense saves on the remaining analytics part of the business and corporate. Now when I referenced the $80 million to $100 million of cost saves for corporate and the remaining analytics business, that's an annualized target, and there is a lesser then -- there's a lesser amount that will be -- to impact in 2016. We're seeing some of those materializing a little bit in 2015, but the biggest bulk is coming in 2016, and that will be a part of that $80 million to $100 million. Does that help you there? It's basically a step process on those cost takeouts sequentially throughout the year. Did that help on there?"

And then we have other workloads with customers where it needs to be perfect. They cannot operate without a hiccup, and they're looking for the almost 100% pure availability that we deliver with our integrated data warehouses.

It's providing more flexibility and options for customers that don't have the same requirement and SLA of what we provide today. And they can put stuff up there in small increments. They can do it easily. It can function as a hybrid with our on-premise high-availability offerings with what they're putting up in the Amazon cloud.

You can see in our new customer wins, where the majority for the past several quarters have been shifting and getting higher to the 2000. It doesn't necessarily mean these are small customers, but the customers want to start in small pieces. So I think this is the changing dynamics in the marketplace. Actually have been there for a while. And we're transforming and moving with it. So the cloud, whether it's the Teradata cloud or public cloud, provides a great opportunity to add in small increments, to actually in temporary increments. Capacity to do sandbox is the capacity to do whatever. And this is the dynamic going forward. So when look at the mix, overall mix of cloud -- whatever you want to call it, cloud, software-only, Teradata Cloud, 2000, 1000. And then you look in the 1000 is a great opportunity to grow quite a bit in this new analytic ecosystem. When you -- that all said, over time, yes, the 6000 should be a smaller part of our revenue. Not that it's going to shrink or decline, not that anyone has discontinued 6000 or left Teradata or anything like that, and not that the 6000 can't grow. But as a percent of our total revenue, yes, the 6000 should be lower. Now if I can add, if you look at this whole thing -- we're going to get to a road map, a financial road map for everyone, but if you look at the margin on this, software-only brings with it high margin, obviously, and 6000 high-margin. And then we've got the 1000, the analytic ecosystem, lower margins and that growing rapidly. And then we have the 2000.

And we started coming back in baby steps in constant currency growth in '13 and '14. And so this is something that is a long-term thought-out thing."

And Steve will go over our third quarter results and full year guidance. 
Although our overall third quarter revenue was not what we expected, there were some positives in the quarter with our services and big data businesses that we will continue to build upon for the future, as well as some SG&A cost efficiencies that we are beginning to realize.
Over the past year or so, we have been digging more deeply into our internal operations and into the markets we play in. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we have key initiatives underway to improve the performance of our company both shorter-term and longer-term. While we have not completed of the entire process, we are already starting to take some significant actions. I would like to share some of our thoughts about those actions as well as what the future for Teradata will entail. 
First, after a thorough analysis of Teradata's portfolio and opportunities, we have concluded it's in the best interest of the company and our shareholders to focus Teradata on our core Data and Analytics business and to exit our Marketing Applications business. 
We believe our Marketing Applications business can thrive under the right ownership. Our Marketing Applications has shown solid improvements in 2015 due to a lot of great work by our team. It has the potential for high levels of revenue growth and good profitability, as reflected in our digital marketing cloud's constant-currency revenue growth of 22% in the third quarter and 13% recurring revenue growth year-to-date. We have leading solutions, as evidenced by the industry analyst rankings, with our Marketing Resource Management solution being the leader in its segment. Our Marketing Applications portfolio operates on a very attractive market, and we are starting the process to find the right owner.
We have a tremendous opportunity with our core Data and Analytics business, and we will now dedicate all of our energy, resources and investments to it. 
Our overall goal with Teradata going forward is to transform the business to better align ourselves with the evolving marketplace and customer needs. Through this transformation, we plan to drive meaningful revenue growth and improved profitability.
We are pursuing 4 key initiatives to help fuel the transformation. Our first initiative is to expand our core data warehouse market opportunity, where we are positioned us the leaders today and represents the majority of our revenue. 
As noted on our last earnings call, we have been re-engineering our core Teradata database for more than a year now to make it available as software-only for both public and private clouds. This extends the market opportunities significantly for our core data warehouse business. 
We will release our initial software-only version for global deployment on Amazon's cloud in the first quarter of 2016. This initial version can scale up to approximately 20 terabytes and do workloads such as departmental analytics, analytic sandboxes, smaller sized integrated data warehouse, as well as test and development and disaster recovery. As a reminder, we plan to have our full-scale public and private cloud software-only versions available in the first quarter of 2017.
Our software-only offerings will provide customers the flexibility with where and how they deploy Teradata and how they pay, such as through subscription, and the ability to start or expand their existing Teradata environments in smaller increments. 
Second, we will continue to rationalize our big data portfolio, focusing investments on solutions that can drive revenue growth and increase our relevance with customers in the dynamic analytic ecosystem. Solutions such as Aster, where we recently announced that we are making Aster analytics available on Hadoop in the second quarter of 2016 and will extend our market opportunity significantly. Aster is a market leader for Big Data Analytics and has more than 100 business-ready algorithms and industry obligations available, which makes it easier for companies to drive value from big data.
And our Unified Data Architecture, which is strategic to Teradata and our customers. Our UDA helps customers to connect, capture, manage and analyze all data across the analytic ecosystem among other things. It also enables new data types and use cases to land in our integrated data warehouses.
Other examples include our Hadoop appliance, which is providing customers ease of deployment along with software to help them manage and to connect these environments, and our recently released Teradata listener for high-volume, high-speed data ingestion along with dynamic data immigration.
These are all solutions that provide customers a more tightly connected and easier to use analytical ecosystem and enable them to drive more value from all types and sources of data. 
As big data and the Internet of Things continues to expand and grow in prominence, we will continue to find new ways to help customers drive value from all of their data. Our analytics technology, and just as importantly, our services, have been a key differentiators for Teradata and will continue to be key differentiators going forward.
Our third key initiative is focused on our value-added services, which we are enhancing and also extending the market opportunity beyond our Teradata user base. We are seeing a significant opportunity in demand for 3 of our service offerings: Big data consulting, advanced analytic services and managed services. 
Analytic architectures have become increasingly difficult to design, implement and manage, and it is becoming increasingly hard for customers to attract the right talent to do this, as well as to do analytics. We have the talent to do both. We are building good momentum with our Think Big consulting unit and growing our platform-agnostic big data consulting services.
Think Big helps companies to design, implement, manage and drive value from Hadoop and big data. We will continue to increase investments in this business and expand our presence globally. 
We are also expanding our advanced analytics services to address complex industry analytics opportunities, as well as customer-specific opportunities that use Teradata and as well as other technologies. The growing demand for skills to do complex analytics is creating an attractive market dynamic for something that is core at Teradata. 
And last, we are increasing our managed services offerings across both our Teradata environments and the broader analytic ecosystem. We will continue to build out skilled resources to manage and optimize our customers' end-to-end analytics environment for on-premises and cloud deployments. We recently launched managed services for all major Hadoop distributions from our Think Big consulting team to address the Hadoop portion of the analytic ecosystem and more. These service offerings will enable Teradata to be a more effective partner to customers while expanding our market opportunity for services. 
Our fourth key initiative is go-to-market. We are in the early stages of this initiative, but our overall goal is to flex our demand creation, sales and consumption models and to renew our focus on of the largest under-penetrated market opportunities.
Approximately 3/4 of the largest 5,000 companies in the world are not using Teradata today. And within that, we now have a sizable opportunity to acquire more new customers in the B2B industries which are going through a digital transformation, with the Internet of Things and sensor data being key drivers.
As we transform our data and analytics business, we are also transforming our cost structure in parallel. Several cost rationalization work streams are in place with actions being taken across the company. Those work streams and actions include realigning the corporate structure for one business, optimizing our go-to-market approach and prioritizing R&D investments based on alignment with our strategic initiatives. We are also evaluating every process and system within the company to find more efficient and less costly ways to do things.
I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail around our Q3 results, full year guidance and our cost initiatives. Steve?"
97999,312130397,894032,"Teradata Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike.

As a reminder, currency movement continues to create a significant headwind on reported year-over-year revenue comparisons, 6 percentage points for total revenue, and consequently negatively impacting EPS. Since currency had such a big impact, I will discuss revenue changes in constant currency, and you can find a reported information in our earnings release.
Teradata reported revenue of $606 million in the third quarter, which is lower than what we were expecting. Revenue was down 3%. Services revenue grew 6%, as we had anticipated, but product revenue declined 14% in the quarter. We continue to experience the same headwinds we have been discussing for the past several quarters.
Within services revenue, consulting services revenue was up 5% and maintenance services revenue was up 7%. 
Turning to our segment results for Q3. The Date Analytics division saw revenue of $557 million, which was a decline of 4%. Within Data and Analytics, revenue for the Americas was down 8% while International was up 4%. International's results were led by overall growth in our Asia-Pacific Japan area, with China and Japan growing around 20%; as well as the U.K., up 25%.
Big data revenue, excluding our 1000 Series which are a part of our larger deal sizes and therefore tend to create variability when comparing quarters, continued its strong growth in Q3. And we continue to add new big data customers at a rapid rate. Our big data revenue is up 75% in Q3. Our big data consulting services revenue, which includes Think Big, was up 30% on a pro forma basis in the quarter and is expected to be approximately the same rate for the year. 
Turning to our Marketing Applications segment. Revenue of $49 million was flat, which is an improvement over Q1 and Q2, which both were down period-over-period. Within that, our digital marketing cloud had strong growth at 22%. Recurring revenue and annual recurring revenue, which are key metrics for this business, each grew and improved over Q1 and Q2 but this year. 
During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and special items, including impairment, acquisition-related restructuring integration and other special items identified in our earnings release.
Product gross margin in the third quarter was 60.4% compared to 60.9% in Q3 2014. The lower-than-normal product gross margin was driven by lower product revenue. Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.7% compared to 48.3% in Q3 '14. The overall -- the year-over-year decline was primarily due to investments in the big data consulting capabilities and lower margins in the marketing application consulting services.
Year-to-date, services gross margin was 45.8% compared to 47.1% for the same period in 2014. Overall gross margin was 52.1% in the third quarter compared to 53.8% in the third quarter 2014. Year-to-date, overall gross margin was 52% versus 54.9% in Q4 -- in 2014.
Turning to operating expense. SG&A expense of $165 million was down $4 million from the third quarter of 2014 and down $14 million sequentially, reflecting the expected early benefit of cost reduction initiatives that are estimated to show up to a greater extent in 2016.
Research and development expense in the quarter was $44 million, up 10% from the third quarter 2014. Although we are continuing to invest for the future of Teradata, we are also rationalizing and realigning the spending. We now expect our R&D expense for the year to increase between 10% to 15% versus the 25% planned earlier in the year. Even though, investing in R&D in roadmap continues to be a key strategic initiative for Teradata.
Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development costs from the cash flow statement, less the capitalization of internally developed software, was $63 million. This compared to $58 million in Q3 2014.
Total expenses in the third quarter were $209 million, the same as Q3 2014. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 17.7%, in line with our expectations but lower than the 22.5% operating margin in Q3 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.7%, in line with the 26% non-GAAP tax rate in Q3 2014. On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.9% versus 28.1% for the same period in 2014. The reduction of the effective rate year-over-year is a result of a more favorable earnings mix period over period. 
We are currently forecasting our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, which assumes that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be reinstated retroactively for 2015 before December 31, 2015. If the credit is not restated -- reinstated by December 31, 2015, it would increase our non-GAAP effective tax rate by approximately 200 basis points in the fourth quarter and 75 basis points for the full year 2015.
In terms of earnings per share, our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.55 compared to $0.60 in Q3 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which offset each other in the third quarter as a gain from an equity investment, offset the special items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.55 compared to $0.71 in Q3 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $68 million in Q3 2015 versus $102 million in the third quarter of 2014. The decrease in cash from operation for Q3 in 2015 over 2014 was primarily a result of the reduction in net income. Year-to-date, cash from operating activities was $370 million versus $583 million generated during the same period of 2014. In the third quarter, we had $35 million of capital expenditures, including capitalized software, versus $36 million in the third quarter 2014, resulting in free cash flow of $33 million versus the $66 million generated in Q3 2014.
Free cash flow for the 9 month -- first 9 months was $276 million versus $489 million generated during the same period in 2014. We still expect our 2015 full year free cash flow to be up to $50 million higher than GAAP net income, excluding the impact from impairment and gains on equity investments. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $874 million of cash as of September 30, 2015, this is down from then $921 million at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Of the $874 million of cash, approximately 5% was held in the U.S. as we continue to utilize our domestic free cash flow for share repurchases. 
During the third quarter, we bought approximately 8.5 million shares of our stock for approximately $250 million. As of September 30, we had approximately $667 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our general share repurchase program.
At the end of the third quarter, we had $710 million of debt on the balance sheet as we borrowed $110 on our $400 million revolving credit facility to fund share repurchases.
With respect to accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2015, accounts receivable decreased $36 million compared to the same date in 2014 due to lower volume. But we were only down $3 million in constant currency. 
Days sales outstanding was 69 days as of -- at September 30, 2015, compared to 70 days at September 30, 2014. Total deferred revenue was $401 million as of September 30, 2015, up 5% on constant currency from September 30, 2014.
Turning to guidance. We are lowering our expectations for the full year 2015 revenue to be flat to down 2% on a constant-currency basis or down 6% to 8% as reported. Correspondingly, full year non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. On a GAAP basis, we expect to report a loss in the $0.51 to $0.71 range.
I do want to point out that our revised full year guidance does not reflect our intent to exit the Marketing Applications business.
We will provide the financial details on Marketing Applications business as well as the go-forward Teradata financials when we announce our Q4 results. We are finalizing exactly what portion of the Marketing Applications business will remain with Teradata, since there is some application business, approximately 20% of the Marketing Applications revenue, that is related to Teradata's Data and Analytics business, which we expect to retain. 
In order to give you some context of the future changes in Teradata's financials, excluding Marketing Applications, there is approximately $160 million of annualized revenue associated with the exited business, which has a gross margin of approximately 40%. There is approximately $100 million plus of associated operating expenses associated with the business.
As Mike highlighted, in addition to our intent to exit the Marketing Applications business, we have commenced developing meaningful cost rationalization and realignment action plans to not only improve our financial performance but also to better align with the evolving market. All of these actions that will be developed and implemented as a part of this transformational process are currently estimated to have a target benefit to 2016 operating income of approximately $120 million. Although our plans are still being developed within this estimating operating income benefit target, total operating expense reduction for 2016 versus 2015 total operating expenses, inclusive of TMA, is currently estimated to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million.
The annualized estimated cost savings associated with the transformational initiatives that we are developing, this excludes Marketing Applications, is expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million.
To be clear, these are our best estimates of the benefits from these transformational action items. In 2016, we will still have some year-over-year cost increases, such as variable compensation and salary increases. We are not providing absolute guidance on the amount of operating income for 2016, as specific plans are still being developed.
Regarding 2016 and beyond. We are working on a financial road map which include estimates associated with revenue generation via different consumption models, which we see currently as largely incremental in the shorter term. This is correctly a work in process. We will provide more information and context regarding this road map when we provide our Q4 full year 2015 results.
Teradata will provide its expectations for 2016 revenue and EPS in its fourth quarter earnings call. Until that time, previous commentary by the company regarding 2016 should not be relied upon.
I will turn the call back to Mike for some closing comments."

To recap what we have covered today, our overall goal with Teradata going forward is to transform our core business to fully align with the evolving marketplace and to drive meaningful revenue growth and profitability. 
In order to achieve this, we are launching 4 key transformational initiatives, namely: First, to expand our core data warehouse market opportunity, such as with our software-only solutions for public and private clouds; second, focus on big data solutions that can contribute revenue growth and increase our relevance in the analytic ecosystem; third, enhance our value-added services and extend the market opportunity; fourth, evolve our go-to-market approach. In addition, we are also undertaking a major cost transformation to provide a cost structure going forward that enables the investments needed to be leaders in data and analytics.
Our customer franchise consists of some of the largest and most successful companies in the world, which positions us to address their growing data needs and to capture more of the broader market opportunity. 
We have the best technology, domain knowledge and expertise and people in the analytics industry. These and our customers are our most important assets going forward. 
And with that, operator, we are ready for Q&A."

But the margin side is really driven from the product gross margin. We still expect about 200 basis points of FX headwind on that product gross margin. Last year, it was 65% in Q4 last year. I'm looking at about 62%. And of the other 100 basis points on that -- around 62%, the other 100 basis points is really the product mix side of it. So that's the big driver. On the OpEx expenses, I still see OpEx going up seasonally quarter-over-quarter sequentially. Increase in Q4, but less than the increase in -- Q4 has increased last year. So that's where I see the make up on Q4.

Now that's inclusive of the benefit that we'll be getting from the Marketing Apps business coming out in '16, also on top of the 2016 operating expense saves on the remaining analytics part of the business and corporate. Now when I referenced the $80 million to $100 million of cost saves for corporate and the remaining analytics business, that's an annualized target, and there is a lesser then -- there's a lesser amount that will be -- to impact in 2016.

You can see in our new customer wins, where the majority for the past several quarters have been shifting and getting higher to the 2000. It doesn't necessarily mean these are small customers, but the customers want to start in small pieces. So I think this is the changing dynamics in the marketplace. Actually have been there for a while. And we're transforming and moving with it. So the cloud, whether it's the Teradata cloud or public cloud, provides a great opportunity to add in small increments, to actually in temporary increments. Capacity to do sandbox is the capacity to do whatever. And this is the dynamic going forward. So when look at the mix, overall mix of cloud -- whatever you want to call it, cloud, software-only, Teradata Cloud, 2000, 1000. And then you look in the 1000 is a great opportunity to grow quite a bit in this new analytic ecosystem. When you -- that all said, over time, yes, the 6000 should be a smaller part of our revenue. Not that it's going to shrink or decline, not that anyone has discontinued 6000 or left Teradata or anything like that, and not that the 6000 can't grow. But as a percent of our total revenue, yes, the 6000 should be lower. Now if I can add, if you look at this whole thing -- we're going to get to a road map, a financial road map for everyone, but if you look at the margin on this, software-only brings with it high margin, obviously, and 6000 high-margin. And then we've got the 1000, the analytic ecosystem, lower margins and that growing rapidly. And then we have the 2000.

I want to drill down on that comment. What factor changed the most relative to your thinking over the last 3 months? Was it a competitive change? Was it just the large deals not materializing? Help me kind of understand your thinking on what changed now versus 3 months ago."

When we were looking at the second half of the year, 60% of our revenue is services. And we have a good handle on services, it's maintenance and professional services, we have managed services. And we were looking at 6% growth in the second half -- and we had 6% constant currency, to be clear. Constant-currency growth in Q3. And we were seeing high single-digit revenue growth in international entering into the second half. And the one variable that we always have that we've experienced is the large CapEx, the product revenue in the Americas. And we took out a significant hedge. We risk adjusted, we did all that. Right? So tactically, what happened is we actually had international, as strong as it was in APJ and Western Europe, it came in lower than we were expecting in the third quarter. That really doesn't have -- that can happen any quarter. But it came in lower. And then the Americas, we just had an unbelievable amount of deferrals. Now look, this sounds like a broken record and it has been going on for several quarters, okay? So in -- what we've been working on and looking at more strategically is what are we going to do about this longer term? And the -- when you lower the guidance and you slip and miss, and you lower the guidance and you slip and miss, it brings to light, what are we going to do? So we've done the due diligence, we've done the work, we know the business, we know the industry, we know what we're capable of. And you reach a point where you got to get on with it for the longer term. So we're going to get on with that for the longer term. We've got to evolve some of our solutions. We've got to evolve similarly how we go to market. A lot of this is all in flight. The big thing we got to do is we got to get our cost structure right. Because if you look at the initiatives I went -- we went through here and what we're working on, a lot of these really don't have meaningful impact or revenue until 2017. We'll get some benefit in 2016. But we got to get after, which we're doing, our cost structure and everything else we could do operationally to show up with a meaningful 2016. And that is to work -- that's what we're doing. So very [indiscernible] there."

And Steve will go over our third quarter results and full year guidance. 
Although our overall third quarter revenue was not what we expected, there were some positives in the quarter with our services and big data businesses that we will continue to build upon for the future as well as some SG&A cost efficiencies that we are beginning to realize.
Over the past year or so, we have been digging more deeply into our internal operations and into the markets we play in. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we have key initiatives underway to improve the performance of our company both shorter-term and longer-term. While we have not completed of the entire process, we are already starting to take some significant actions. I would like to share some of our thoughts about those actions as well as what the future for Teradata will entail. 
First, after a thorough analysis of Teradata's portfolio and opportunities, we have concluded it's in the best interest of the company and our shareholders to focus Teradata on our core Data and Analytics business and to exit our Marketing Applications business. 
We believe our Marketing Applications business can thrive under the right ownership. Our Marketing Applications has shown solid improvements in 2015 due to a lot of great work by our team. It has the potential for high levels of revenue growth and good profitability, as reflected in our digital marketing cloud's constant-currency revenue growth of 22% in the third quarter and 13% recurring revenue growth year-to-date. We have leading solutions, as evidenced by the industry analyst rankings, with our Marketing Resource Management solution being the leader in its segment. Our Marketing Applications portfolio operates on a very attractive market, and we are starting the process to find the right owner.
We have a tremendous opportunity with our core Data and Analytics business, and we will now dedicate all of our energy, resources and investments to it. 
Our overall goal with Teradata going forward is to transform the business to better align ourselves with the evolving marketplace and customer needs. Through this transformation, we plan to drive meaningful revenue growth and improved profitability.
We are pursuing 4 key initiatives to help fuel the transformation. Our first initiative is to expand our core data warehouse market opportunity, where we are positioned us the leaders today and represents the majority of our revenue. 
As noted on our last earnings call, we have been re-engineering our core Teradata database for more than a year now to make it available as software-only for both public and private clouds. This extends the market opportunities significantly for our core data warehouse business. 
We will release our initial software-only version for global deployment on Amazon's cloud in the first quarter of 2016. This initial version can scale up to approximately 20 terabytes and do workloads such as departmental analytics, analytic sandboxes, smaller sized integrated data warehouse as well as test and development and disaster recovery. As a reminder, we plan to have our full-scale public and private cloud software-only versions available in the first quarter of 2017.
Our software-only offerings will provide customers the flexibility with where and how they deploy Teradata and how they pay, such as through subscription, and the ability to start or expand their existing Teradata environments in smaller increments. 
Second, we will continue to rationalize our big data portfolio, focusing investments on solutions that can drive revenue growth and increase our relevance with customers in the dynamic analytic ecosystem. Solutions such as Aster, where we recently announced that we are making Aster analytics available on Hadoop in the second quarter of 2016 and will extend our market opportunity significantly. Aster is a market leader for Big Data Analytics and has more than 100 business-ready algorithms and industry obligations available, which makes it easier for companies to drive value from big data.
And our Unified Data Architecture, which is strategic to Teradata and our customers. Our UDA helps customers to connect, capture, manage and analyze all data across the analytic ecosystem among other things. It also enables new data types and use cases to land in our integrated data warehouses.
Other examples include our Hadoop appliance, which is providing customers ease of deployment along with software to help them manage and to connect these environments, and our recently released Teradata listener for high-volume, high-speed data ingestion along with dynamic data immigration.
These are all solutions that provide customers a more tightly connected and easier to use analytical ecosystem and enable them to drive more value from all types and sources of data. 
As big data and the Internet of Things continues to expand and grow in prominence, we will continue to find new ways to help customers drive value from all of their data. Our analytics technology, and just as importantly, our services, have been a key differentiators for Teradata and will continue to be key differentiators going forward.
Our third key initiative is focused on our value-added services, which we are enhancing and also extending the market opportunity beyond our Teradata user base. We are seeing a significant opportunity in demand for 3 of our service offerings: Big data consulting, advanced analytic services and managed services. 
Analytic architectures have become increasingly difficult to design, implement and manage, and it is becoming increasingly hard for customers to attract the right talent to do this as well as to do analytics. We have the talent to do both. We are building good momentum with our Think Big consulting unit and growing our platform-agnostic big data consulting services.
Think Big helps companies to design, implement, manage and drive value from Hadoop and big data. We will continue to increase investments in this business and expand our presence globally. 
We are also expanding our advanced analytics services to address complex industry analytics opportunities as well as customer-specific opportunities that use Teradata and as well as other technologies. The growing demand for skills to do complex analytics is creating an attractive market dynamic for something that is core at Teradata. 
And last, we are increasing our managed services offerings across both our Teradata environments and the broader analytic ecosystem. We will continue to build out skilled resources to manage and optimize our customers' end-to-end analytics environment for on-premises and cloud deployments. We recently launched managed services for all major Hadoop distributions from our Think Big consulting team to address the Hadoop portion of the analytic ecosystem and more. These service offerings will enable Teradata to be a more effective partner to customers while expanding our market opportunity for services. 
Our fourth key initiative is go-to-market. We are in the early stages of this initiative, but our overall goal is to flex our demand creation, sales and consumption models and to renew our focus on of the largest under-penetrated market opportunities.
Approximately 3/4 of the largest 5,000 companies in the world are not using Teradata today. And within that, we now have a sizable opportunity to acquire more new customers in the B2B industries which are going through a digital transformation, with the Internet of Things and sensor data being key drivers.
As we transform our data and analytics business, we are also transforming our cost structure in parallel. Several cost rationalization work streams are in place with actions being taken across the company. Those work streams and actions include realigning the corporate structure for one business, optimizing our go-to-market approach and prioritizing R&D investments based on alignment with our strategic initiatives. We are also evaluating every process and system within the company to find more efficient and less costly ways to do things.
I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail around our Q3 results, full year guidance and our cost initiatives. Steve?"

As a reminder, currency movement continues to create a significant headwind on reported year-over-year revenue comparisons, 6 percentage points for total revenue, and consequently negatively impacting EPS. Since currency had such a big impact, I will discuss revenue changes in constant currency, and you can find a reported information in our earnings release.
Teradata reported revenue of $606 million in the third quarter, which is lower than what we were expecting. Revenue was down 3%. Services revenue grew 6%, as we had anticipated, but product revenue declined 14% in the quarter. We continue to experience the same headwinds we have been discussing for the past several quarters.
Within services revenue, consulting services revenue was up 5% and maintenance services revenue was up 7%. 
Turning to our segment results for Q3. The Date Analytics division saw revenue of $557 million, which was a decline of 4%. Within Data and Analytics, revenue for the Americas was down 8% while International was up 4%. International's results were led by overall growth in our Asia-Pacific Japan area, with China and Japan growing around 20%; as well as the U.K., up 25%.
Big data revenue, excluding our 1000 Series which are a part of our larger deal sizes and therefore tend to create variability when comparing quarters, continued its strong growth in Q3. And we continue to add new big data customers at a rapid rate. Our big data revenue is up 75% in Q3. Our big data consulting services revenue, which includes Think Big, was up 30% on a pro forma basis in the quarter and is expected to be approximately the same rate for the year. 
Turning to our Marketing Applications segment. Revenue of $49 million was flat, which is an improvement over Q1 and Q2, which both were down period-over-period. Within that, our digital marketing cloud had strong growth at 22%. Recurring revenue and annual recurring revenue, which are key metrics for this business, each grew and improved over Q1 and Q2 but this year. 
During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and special items, including impairment, acquisition-related restructuring integration and other special items identified in our earnings release.
Product gross margin in the third quarter was 60.4% compared to 60.9% in Q3 2014. The lower-than-normal product gross margin was driven by lower product revenue. Services gross margin in the quarter was 46.7% compared to 48.3% in Q3 '14. The overall -- the year-over-year decline was primarily due to investments in the big data consulting capabilities and lower margins in the marketing application consulting services.
Year-to-date, services gross margin was 45.8% compared to 47.1% for the same period in 2014. Overall gross margin was 52.1% in the third quarter compared to 53.8% in the third quarter 2014. Year-to-date, overall gross margin was 52% versus 54.9% in Q4 -- in 2014.
Turning to operating expense. SG&A expense of $165 million was down $4 million from the third quarter of 2014 and down $14 million sequentially, reflecting the expected early benefit of cost reduction initiatives that are estimated to show up to a greater extent in 2016.
Research and development expense in the quarter was $44 million, up 10% from the third quarter 2014. Although we are continuing to invest for the future of Teradata, we are also rationalizing and realigning the spending. We now expect our R&D expense for the year to increase between 10% to 15% versus the 25% planned earlier in the year. Even though, investing in R&D in roadmap continues to be a key strategic initiative for Teradata.
Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development costs from the cash flow statement, less the capitalization of internally developed software, was $63 million. This compared to $58 million in Q3 2014.
Total expenses in the third quarter were $209 million, the same as Q3 2014. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 17.7%, in line with our expectations but lower than the 22.5% operating margin in Q3 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.7%, in line with the 26% non-GAAP tax rate in Q3 2014. On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.9% versus 28.1% for the same period in 2014. The reduction of the effective rate year-over-year is a result of a more favorable earnings mix period over period. 
We are currently forecasting our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, which assumes that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be reinstated retroactively for 2015 before December 31, 2015. If the credit is not restated -- reinstated by December 31, 2015, it would increase our non-GAAP effective tax rate by approximately 200 basis points in the fourth quarter and 75 basis points for the full year 2015.
In terms of earnings per share, our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.55 compared to $0.60 in Q3 2014. Adjusting for stock-based compensation and other special items, which offset each other in the third quarter as a gain from an equity investment, offset the special items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.55 compared to $0.71 in Q3 2014.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $68 million in Q3 2015 versus $102 million in the third quarter of 2014. The decrease in cash from operation for Q3 in 2015 over 2014 was primarily a result of the reduction in net income. Year-to-date, cash from operating activities was $370 million versus $583 million generated during the same period of 2014. In the third quarter, we had $35 million of capital expenditures, including capitalized software, versus $36 million in the third quarter 2014, resulting in free cash flow of $33 million versus the $66 million generated in Q3 2014.
Free cash flow for the 9 month -- first 9 months was $276 million versus $489 million generated during the same period in 2014. We still expect our 2015 full year free cash flow to be up to $50 million higher than GAAP net income, excluding the impact from impairment and gains on equity investments. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We had $874 million of cash as of September 30, 2015, this is down from then $921 million at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Of the $874 million of cash, approximately 5% was held in the U.S. as we continue to utilize our domestic free cash flow for share repurchases. 
During the third quarter, we bought approximately 8.5 million shares of our stock for approximately $250 million. As of September 30, we had approximately $667 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our general share repurchase program.
At the end of the third quarter, we had $710 million of debt on the balance sheet as we borrowed $110 on our $400 million revolving credit facility to fund share repurchases.
With respect to accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2015, accounts receivable decreased $36 million compared to the same date in 2014 due to lower volume. But we were only down $3 million in constant currency. 
Days sales outstanding was 69 days as of -- at September 30, 2015, compared to 70 days at September 30, 2014. Total deferred revenue was $401 million as of September 30, 2015, up 5% on constant currency from September 30, 2014.
Turning to guidance. We are lowering our expectations for the full year 2015 revenue to be flat to down 2% on a constant-currency basis or down 6% to 8% as reported. Correspondingly, full year non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. On a GAAP basis, we expect to report a loss in the $0.51 to $0.71 range.
I do want to point out that our revised full year guidance does not reflect our intent to exit the Marketing Applications business.
We will provide the financial details on Marketing Applications business as well as the go-forward Teradata financials when we announce our Q4 results. We are finalizing exactly what portion of the Marketing Applications business will remain with Teradata, since there is some application business, approximately 20% of the Marketing Applications revenue, that is related to Teradata's Data and Analytics business, which we expect to retain. 
In order to give you some context of the future changes in Teradata's financials, excluding Marketing Applications, there is approximately $160 million of annualized revenue associated with the exited business, which has a gross margin of approximately 40%. There is approximately $100 million plus of associated operating expenses associated with the business.
As Mike highlighted, in addition to our intent to exit the Marketing Applications business, we have commenced developing meaningful cost rationalization and realignment action plans to not only improve our financial performance but also to better align with the evolving market. All of these actions that will be developed and implemented as a part of this transformational process are currently estimated to have a target benefit to 2016 operating income of approximately $120 million. Although our plans are still being developed within this estimating operating income benefit target, total operating expense reduction for 2016 versus 2015 total operating expenses, inclusive of TMA, is currently estimated to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million.
The annualized estimated cost savings associated with the transformational initiatives that we are developing, this excludes Marketing Applications, is expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million.
To be clear, these are our best estimates of the benefits from these transformational action items. In 2016, we will still have some year-over-year cost increases, such as variable compensation and salary increases. We are not providing absolute guidance on the amount of operating income for 2016, as specific plans are still being developed.
Regarding 2016 and beyond. We are working on a financial road map which include estimates associated with revenue generation via different consumption models, which we see currently as largely incremental in the shorter term. This is correctly a work in process. We will provide more information and context regarding this road map when we provide our Q4 full year 2015 results.
Teradata will provide its expectations for 2016 revenue and EPS in its fourth quarter earnings call. Until that time, previous commentary by the company regarding 2016 should not be relied upon.
I will turn the call back to Mike for some closing comments."

To recap what we have covered today, our overall goal with Teradata going forward is to transform our core business to fully align with the evolving marketplace and to drive meaningful revenue growth and profitability. 
In order to achieve this, we are launching 4 key transformational initiatives, namely: First, to expand our core data warehouse market opportunity, such as with our software-only solutions for public and private clouds; second, focus on big data solutions that can contribute revenue growth and increase our relevance in the analytic ecosystem; third, enhance our value-added services and extend the market opportunity; fourth, evolve our go-to-market approach. In addition, we are also undertaking a major cost transformation to provide a cost structure going forward that enables the investments needed to be leaders in data and analytics.
Our customer franchise consists of some of the largest and most successful companies in the world, which positions us to address their growing data needs and to capture more of the broader market opportunity. 
We have the best technology, domain knowledge and expertise and people in the analytics industry. These and our customers are our most important assets going forward. 
And with that, operator, we are ready for Q&A."

But the margin side is really driven from the product gross margin. We still expect about 200 basis points of FX headwind on that product gross margin. Last year, it was 65% in Q4 last year. I'm looking at about 62%. And of the other 100 basis points on that -- around 62%, the other 100 basis points is really the product mix side of it. So that's the big driver. On the OpEx expenses, I still see OpEx going up seasonally quarter-over-quarter sequentially. Increase in Q4, but less than the increase in -- Q4 has increased last year. So that's where I see the make up on Q4. With respect to the cost saves that you referenced on, yes, the income -- operating income benefit of that we're looking at for '16 that I -- that we're targeting, that $120 million, that's a the benefit -- that's the a target for 2016. Now that's inclusive of the benefit that we'll be getting from the Marketing Apps business coming out in '16, also on top of the 2016 operating expense saves on the remaining analytics part of the business and corporate. Now when I referenced the $80 million to $100 million of cost saves for corporate and the remaining analytics business, that's an annualized target, and there is a lesser then -- there's a lesser amount that will be -- to impact in 2016. We're seeing some of those materializing a little bit in 2015, but the biggest bulk is coming in 2016, and that will be a part of that $80 million to $100 million. Does that help you there? It's basically a step process on those cost takeouts sequentially throughout the year. Did that help on there?"

And then we have other workloads with customers where it needs to be perfect. They cannot operate without a hiccup, and they're looking for the almost 100% pure availability that we deliver with our integrated data warehouses.

It's providing more flexibility and options for customers that don't have the same requirement and SLA of what we provide today. And they can put stuff up there in small increments. They can do it easily. It can function as a hybrid with our on-premise high-availability offerings with what they're putting up in the Amazon cloud.

You can see in our new customer wins, where the majority for the past several quarters have been shifting and getting higher to the 2000. It doesn't necessarily mean these are small customers, but the customers want to start in small pieces. So I think this is the changing dynamics in the marketplace. Actually have been there for a while. And we're transforming and moving with it. So the cloud, whether it's the Teradata cloud or public cloud, provides a great opportunity to add in small increments, to actually in temporary increments. Capacity to do sandbox is the capacity to do whatever. And this is the dynamic going forward. So when look at the mix, overall mix of cloud -- whatever you want to call it, cloud, software-only, Teradata Cloud, 2000, 1000. And then you look in the 1000 is a great opportunity to grow quite a bit in this new analytic ecosystem. When you -- that all said, over time, yes, the 6000 should be a smaller part of our revenue. Not that it's going to shrink or decline, not that anyone has discontinued 6000 or left Teradata or anything like that, and not that the 6000 can't grow. But as a percent of our total revenue, yes, the 6000 should be lower. Now if I can add, if you look at this whole thing -- we're going to get to a road map, a financial road map for everyone, but if you look at the margin on this, software-only brings with it high margin, obviously, and 6000 high-margin. And then we've got the 1000, the analytic ecosystem, lower margins and that growing rapidly. And then we have the 2000. So the good news is we've got 2 prongs that will be growing at a higher margin, obviously, software-only and the 6000."

But we haven't benefited as much as we have in the past because simultaneously, we need to grow these environments so that when we do the floor sweeps, we're putting in more capacity than obviously what they had before. And the CapEx pressures are really causing the customers to button it -- button down the hatch. So listen, this has been -- we've been saying this for too many quarters and everything else like that. And really, the important thing is what we're going to do about it. And what we've got to do about it is we're working in an environment, and it'll probably continue this for the foreseeable future, of customers buying in smaller increments. And we've got to evolve there. And you can see it on our results. Even though we had the product declines that you saw in the third quarter, the number of transactions, deals we had in the quarter for our data warehouse products was up 23%. And that's the new world. We just got to keep growing and making it easier for customers to buy more of these smaller increments. And we've got the opportunity to do it. And we're over-penetrated -- under-penetrated in so many verticals. And when you look at the fortune 5000, we have a huge opportunity. But we've got to learn to run hard in a new world of smaller deal sizes and smaller increments."

When we were looking at the second half of the year, 60% of our revenue is services. And we have a good handle on services, it's maintenance and professional services, we have managed services. And we were looking at 6% growth in the second half -- and we had 6% constant currency, to be clear. Constant-currency growth in Q3. And we were seeing high single-digit revenue growth in international entering into the second half. And the one variable that we always have that we've experienced is the large CapEx, the product revenue in the Americas. And we took out a significant hedge. We risk adjusted, we did all that. Right? So tactically, what happened is we actually had international, as strong as it was in APJ and Western Europe, it came in lower than we were expecting in the third quarter. That really doesn't have -- that can happen any quarter. But it came in lower. And then the Americas, we just had an unbelievable amount of deferrals. Now look, this sounds like a broken record and it has been going on for several quarters, okay? So in -- what we've been working on and looking at more strategically is what are we going to do about this longer term? And the -- when you lower the guidance and you slip and miss, and you lower the guidance and you slip and miss, it brings to light, what are we going to do? So we've done the due diligence, we've done the work, we know the business, we know the industry, we know what we're capable of. And you reach a point where you got to get on with it for the longer term. So we're going to get on with that for the longer term. We've got to evolve some of our solutions. We've got to evolve similarly how we go to market. A lot of this is all in flight. The big thing we got to do is we got to get our cost structure right.
