With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2015 on a good note, and we did so in spite of sluggish conditions in the global farm economy, which are reducing demand for agricultural machinery, particular",2211,"Thank you, Tony. With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2015 on a good note, and we did so in spite of sluggish conditions in the global farm economy, which are reducing demand for agricultural machinery, particularly for larger models. As a result, both sales and profits for our Agriculture & Turf equipment operations were lower for the quarter and are forecast to be down for the year as well. At the same time, our Construction & Forestry and Financial Services businesses had higher profits, showing the value of a well-rounded business lineup.
Deere's results for the quarter also demonstrated the progress we've made managing costs and creating a more flexible, responsive cost structure.
One other item worth emphasizing in today's earnings reports is the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. It is putting significant pressure on reported sales made outside the United States, a fact reflected in both our first quarter results and our full year forecast.
Now let's take a closer look at the first quarter in detail beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 17% to $6.383 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $387 million. EPS was $1.12 in the quarter.
On Slide 4. Total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 19% to $5.6 billion. In the quarter-over-quarter comparison of net sales, Landscapes and Water accounted for 2 points of the change. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was negative by 2 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Sales were down 27%, due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada and lower sales in Europe and Brazil. Operating profit was $268 million. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 35%.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts, which in spite of lower grain prices remained at historically high levels, thanks to help from record livestock receipts. As a result, we now see 2014 cash receipts at about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013 and the highest level ever recorded.
Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently, the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6%. Of note, crop receipts for 2015 are forecast to be down about 23% lower than the levels in 2012, which was the record.
On Slide 7. Global grain stocks-to-use ratios remained at somewhat sensitive levels even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong while supplies appear to be fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension could lower production, reduce the stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Economic growth continues in the region, although at a slow pace. Grain prices have declined but appears to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average. While livestock margins remain at good levels, dairy margins are being squeezed especially in the U.K. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In the CIS, increasing economic pressure and further tightening of credit availability continue to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, Western equipment manufacturers are being heavily impacted by geopolitical uncertainties.
In China, the government continues its investment in ag equipment subsidies, but the growth rate has slowed. This, among other things, has led to a decrease in industry sales.
Turning to India. The monsoon season rainfall was below normal, which could result in lower overall agriculture output.
Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness in Brazil. Ag production is expected to decrease about 12% in 2015 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices and the decline in the Brazilian real. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamentals remain positive for grains, and sugar margins are expected to improve in the coming year. On balance though, farmer confidence in Brazil is lower as a result of economic uncertainty and political concerns in the country. This is leading to lower equipment purchases despite positive ag fundamentals.
Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for ag equipment in Brazil. FINAME PSI has been the primary financing source for ag producers from 2009 through 2014. For the first half of 2015, last year's favorable interest rates remain in place for the agriculture sector through the Moderfrota program. While agricultural producers are able to utilize the more attractive Moderfrota rates, construction equipment financing continues through PSI and will be subject to increased rates in 2015.
Our 2015 ag and turf industry outlook are summarized on Slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm income are putting pressure on demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are more positive, providing support to sales of small and mid-sized tractors. As a result, we continue to expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down 25% to 30% for 2015. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter due to lower crop prices and farm income as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2015, mainly as a result of economic uncertainty in Brazil. This follows a 13% decline in 2014 compared with the extremely strong levels of 2013.
Shifting to the CIS. We now expect industry sales to be down significantly due to economic concerns and limited credit availability. In Asia, we continue to expect sales to be down slightly.
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.
Putting this all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 23%. Currency translation is now forecast to be a negative 4 points. Though this outlook reflects about 1 point less volume than our prior guidance. The ag and turf division's operating margin is now forecast to be about 7%. Technically, that is 1 point less than we said in our prior guidance with the difference mainly due to foreign exchange. However, without the impact of rounding, the difference is closer to half a point.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were up 13% in the quarter. Operating profit was up 55%, the result of higher shipment volumes. The division's incremental margin was about 30%.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues to move forward. GDP growth is improving, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. In contrast, we are seeing weakening conditions in the energy sector and energy-producing regions. Based on these factors, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales forecast remains up about 5% in 2015. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 2 points. Global forestry markets are expected to be about flat on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 11%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows Financial Services' annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio was 2 basis points at the end of January. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 17 basis points, down about 7 basis points from our previous guidance. The year-over-year increase in the provision is a reflection of the unsustainability -- unsustainably low loss levels on last 4 years. For reference, the 10-year average is 26 basis points and the 15-year average is 43 basis points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $157 million in the first quarter versus $142 million last year. 2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $630 million.
Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.4 billion. That was equal to 24.9% of prior 12-month sales compared to 26.4% a year ago. The decrease, which came entirely from ag and turf, is reflective of the aggressive way we have cut production in line with our 2015 outlook. We expect to end 2015 with total receivables and inventories up about $100 million, with the increase coming from the C&F division.
Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 19 is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price of about 2 points; favorable raw material costs; and unfavorable mix of product; and Tier 4 product costs.
Looking at our R&D expense on Slide 20. R&D was up about 3% in the first quarter, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. Our 2015 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 2 points of negative currency translation.
SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 16% in the first quarter as you'll see on Slide 21. Landscapes, Water and negative currency translation accounted for about 10 points of the change. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 9%, with Landscapes, Water and currency accounting for about 5 points of the change in the year-over-year comparison.
Turning to Slide 22. Pension and OPEB expense was up about $20 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $80 million in 2015.
On Slide 23, the equipment operations tax rate was approximately 28% in the quarter, primarily due to discrete items. While it is not our practice to provide specifics on discrete items, we note that the R&D tax credit for 2014 was extended through the end of the calendar year. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 24 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.3 billion in 2015.
The company's second quarter financial outlook is on Slide 25. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 19% compared with 2014. This includes about 2 points of price realization, with unfavorable currency translation of about 4 points.
Turning to Slide 26 in the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 17%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative, about 3 points. Finally, our full year 2015 net income forecast is now about $1.8 billion, a decline of approximately $100 million compared with our previous guidance. The change is primarily attributable to foreign currency translation.
Now on Slide 27. There's no doubt Deere ag business is facing a challenger year. The large ag industry in the United States and Canada defined on this slide is tractors greater than 220 horsepower and combines is forecast to be down about 50% from 2013 levels. Yet, as Sam Allen noted in today's press release, our forecast reflects a level of results much better than we've experienced in previous downturns. With a 50% decline in large ag, Deere net sales are forecast to be down 22% with net income down 49%, again from 2013 levels. This is much better than the 2 other recent downturn shown on the slide. Why the improvement? Because we reacted early to this pullback in the ag sector, controlling costs and assets and aligning production levels with demand.
But more importantly, today's John Deere is more than a large ag company. Our 2015 outlook illustrates the power of our portfolio with a wider range of revenue sources as well as a more durable FDA and OROA business model.
As a final note, it should be stressed that Deere's future continues to hold great promise for our customers and investors. That's because the trends underlying our businesses, such as global population growth and rising living standards, are very much intact and largely unaffected by swings in the farm economy. All in all, we remain confident Deere is positioned to deliver value throughout the business cycle and to benefit from the world's increasing need for advanced equipment in the quarters and years ahead.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

As you think about the early order program in the order book in general, I would tell you, from a large prospective, we would say it's kind of coming in line with what our expectations were, have plus and minuses here and there. And that's again why you didn't see much really any change in our outlook on the U.S. and Canada side. The combines, we did and that program in early January, and it was down roughly 30% year-over-year, which again was maybe slightly better than what we had anticipated. And we've had some others that are going a little bit different direction. But all in all, very much in line with our expectations. And you've seen that reflected in our outlook. If you think about tractors, again, if you look year-over-year, and I want to make sure I point out obviously, we have much lower daily order -- our daily production in our Waterloo factory on those large tractors, the 1 that lower production schedule are availability on large tractors are pretty much in line with where we were last year. 8R tractors would be a little lighter. Our availability this year is in June. Keep in mind June too, last year, there was some impact from Tier 4 transition as well. But if you think about the 8R tractor, this year availability into June, last year would have been a little further out into August. But 9R tractors were in early June, last year was actually early May. So we're a little further out on availability there. And our 7R tractors, again, we're very much in line. Last year was late June, this year is very early July. And again, that was as of the first week in February. So again, very much in line year-over-year -- are very much in line with our expectation. Thank you."

And I would point out and remind people that yes, while we're expecting some lower production in the year, we took a dramatic amount of inventory and receivables out of the system in fourth quarter last year, which is why you didn't see a significant continued reduction this year and really more, we set up the year so that we could be more in line with that lower production.

But used inventory in particular continued to be at high levels. I think it's important to point out, however, as we indicated last quarter, relative to competition, our used inventory as a percent of sales continues to be in a much better position than the competition. So we feel like we're in good position in that regard, but certainly have a lot of work to do with our dealers and continuing to bring used inventory down as we move through the year. And that will continue to be our focus as we talked about at the beginning of the year. Thank you."

So we",390,"Yes, I would point out, as you think about the first quarter increased sales versus the outlook, remember as you think about the comparison for 2014, we have much tougher comps as we move through the year, especially in the third and fourth quarter. So we had a relatively light first and second quarter. And we also do have some Q4 [ph] transitions that's going to create some moves from 1 quarter to the other, in some cases that contributed to the very strong first quarter. So there are a lot of things along that line. As it relates to the incentives, and I mentioned this on an earlier question, I want to be clear, this isn't an increased incentive for the full year. It's really a timing issue as it relates to an accrual that was booked for some of the changes and some of the incentive structures that will largely reverse itself as we go through the year. In fact, you'll see a lot of that reversed in the second quarter. So it should not indicate a higher level of year-over-year. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, if you look at the total budget, incentive as a percent of sales are flat year-over-year for that division. But specific to energy, certainly, the expectation is that you'll start to see some slowing in terms of quarters. For dealers that are in regions that are heavily impacted by energy, yes, we've seen a little bit of slowdown in replenishment orders, as one would expect, again, in those specific regions. But some of that being offset by strength in other areas. The overall economy continues to improve. We see some strength there as well. And we would tell you, longer term, as we think about lower oil prices, certainly in the short term, that's going to have an impact on the business from an energy sector perspective. But longer term, if they stay at these levels, it could have a more positive impact on the overall economy, which could help offset the strength longer term in other parts of the business. So it's a little bit of give and take, but certainly on the short term, the lower oil prices would be a little bit more take than give for us. But from a longer-term perspective, not necessarily a bad deal."

I think the first and maybe last thing I'll say on it is it's very premature really to talk about market conditions beyond 2015. As we all know, that will largely be impacted by the upcoming growing season, and it's just very, very early. That being said, as we talked about previously, if you look at -- and assume more normal weather patterns, and we've talked about an analysis that our Chief Economist has completed. If you look at normal weather patterns trend yields with the expected lower acreage that most are in anticipating for corn as we go into some upcoming growing season, that would result in production slightly less than usage and you would see stocks brought down and pricing being more supportive. If that would transpire, we would certainly expect to see some improvement next year. Now again, that's based on assumed assumptions of weather, and that's always risky. And while we've had 2 very good years in a row now for growing, especially last year had pretty much ideal growing conditions, that doesn't mean we won't see it again this year. And so that's the risk to the outlook. So again, we'll be watching closely as planting season approaches and what actually gets planted in terms of various crops as well as through the summer what happens with the growing conditions. And that will largely drive what we'd expect to see as we move into 2016. Again, I'll end where I started, it's really very premature to talk about things beyond 2015. Thank you."

If for some reason -- and again, it would be a rare occurrence that you would see a longer downturn without any kind of the increase if you move into 2016. It's not -- it wouldn't be unprecedented, but it would be very, very rare. You'd have to go back much further than the '80s to find that kind of consistent kind of downturn. But if that would happen, certainly we're positioning ourselves as we move through the year such that if the downturn persists, we can be in a good strong position to be able to continue to perform well during that downturn, but also believe that we're in a good position to react quickly and if we need to bring reduction back up and so on. And one example I would point out in that regard is, as you know, with our UAW contacts, we have the ability to utilize inventory adjustment shutdowns or indefinite layoff. And certainly, as you've noted, I'm sure, we have largely utilized indefinite layoffs in our UAW facilities, our large ag facilities versus choosing to keep a higher level of workforce and leveraging a little more heavily the inventory adjustment shutdowns. So that does put us, again, in a bit better footing as we move towards 2016 from a workforce perspective. So while we would argue, if you wanted to play percentages, that there's probably a greater likelihood that 2015 would be the lowest year, and again, there's always risk that we could see a further downturn, we are explaining that risk internally and how we're managing the businesses with full assumption that we'll see that return in 2016.

And that's really the biggest strength of the Certified Pre-Owned program provides. I think our dealers are embracing that. It's growing, and I think there's a fair amount of confidence from the dealer organization around this being a very useful tool for them. So again, I think all very positive signs as we move forward with that program.

It's not that sales are expected to fall off in the back half of the year. It's just the year-over-year comparison. So the growth year-over-year is what would be challenged as we go through the year. So I think that's probably the key there as you think about that. From an energy perspective, certainly in recent years, that's been a stronger portion of our business, a stronger portion of the industry. We've seen a lot of strength in the energy business across the industry. And I would tell you if we look at the machines that go directly into things like pipeline, oil, gas, fracking, those sort of things, we would estimate roughly 10% to 15% again in recent years. Deere would not be out of line from where the industry was in that regard. So -- but I would also point out that in those regions that are heavily influenced by energy, you have the residual impact as well on the overall economy and other types of construction that occurs in support of the strength of energy. So in terms of overall business, for some could be a bit heavier than that. So that would be our view on that. Thank you."

There are a couple of areas where you see some margins compressing a bit. Dairy is -- it would be one area. I would point out that as the herd expanded to 2015, you're likely to see some squeezing of margins. Today, they would be close to breakeven roughly, but still slightly profitable. Poultry, again coming off of a very strong margins last year, we believe those strong margins will continue to the first half of the year, but production is up. And so that's a part of the industry that can recover fairly quickly, and so we would expect to see perhaps some margin squeezing there. And pork of course, again, we would expect to see some growth in the herd and some reduction as we move through the year, second half in particular could be a challenge from a margin perspective there. So we are seeing squeezing there. Beef, of course that takes a while to rebuilt herd so profitability is still expected to be relatively strong, especially for cow calf producers. And so overall, we're still looking at small ag, which tends to be a little more closely tied to livestock, to be relatively strong versus certainly large ag as we move through 2015, again coming off of some pretty strong years for livestock producers.

We talk a lot about the lever studies we have and plans that we have in place to make sure we do that as we move down the line.

The best example I would point out is that in our C&F position in 2009. We certainly went to levels that were far lower than what most would have anticipated they could have gone. And additional levers were pulled in that regard in order to try to compensate for that. So we would -- again, as we look into 2016, we're trying to position ourselves for whatever the market brings, and we'll make further changes as we need to."

And as you think about SA&G, I would tell you the same thing from a SA&G reduction comparison is what I talked about with C&F sales. It becomes more and more challenging as you go through the year. So certainly, as you put together a forecast, there are a lot of assumptions in there. And certainly, we try to put our best estimates that we can in that regard. So it's some of the big questions candidly too will be what continues to happen with material costs. We've seen some positive move there, which has certainly helped, at least in the short term. Those lower costs, especially in things like steel, if oil prices remain at low levels, that flows through not just our logistics but a lot of other oil-related type of input. And that certainly would be beneficial as well. So we'll just have to see where those things go. But at this point, we are forecasting similar decrementals for the year as what we've seen in the first quarter.

266112,278540609,767372,"Deere & Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 20, 2015",2015-02-20,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Thank you, Tony. With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2015 on a good note, and we did so in spite of sluggish conditions in the global farm economy, which are reducing demand for agricultural machinery, particular",2211,"Thank you, Tony. With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2015 on a good note, and we did so in spite of sluggish conditions in the global farm economy, which are reducing demand for agricultural machinery, particularly for larger models. As a result, both sales and profit for our Agriculture & Turf equipment operations were lower for the quarter and are forecast to be down for the year as well. At the same time, our Construction & Forestry and Financial Services businesses had higher profits, showing the value of a well-rounded business lineup. Deere's results for the quarter also demonstrated the progress we've made managing costs and creating a more flexible, responsive cost structure.
One other item worth emphasizing in today's earnings report is the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. It is putting significant pressure on reported sales made outside of the United States, a fact reflected in both our first quarter results and our full year forecast.
Now let's take a closer look at the first quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 17% to $6.383 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $387 million. EPS was $1.12 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 19% to $5.6 billion. In the quarter-over-quarter comparison of net sales, Landscapes and Water accounted for 2 points of the change. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was negative by 2 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Sales were down 27% due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada and lower sales in Europe and Brazil. Operating profit was $268 million. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 35%.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts, which, in spite of lower grain prices, remain at historically high levels, thanks to help from record livestock receipts. As a result, we now see 2014 cash receipts at about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013 and the highest level ever recorded.
Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently, the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6%. Of note, crop receipts for 2015 are forecast to be down about 23% lower than the levels in 2012, which was the record.
On Slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong, while supplies appear to be fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension could lower production, reduce the stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Economic growth continues in the region, although at a slow pace. Grain prices have declined but appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average. While livestock margins remain at good levels, dairy margins are being squeezed, especially in the U.K. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In the CIS, increasing economic pressure and further tightening of credit availability continue to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, Western equipment manufacturers are being heavily impacted by geopolitical uncertainties.
In China, the government continues its investment in ag equipment subsidies, but the growth rate has slowed. This, among other things, has led to a decrease in industry sales.
Turning to India. The monsoon season rainfall was below normal, which could result in lower overall agriculture output.
Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness in Brazil. Ag production is expected to decrease about 12% in 2015 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices and the decline in the Brazilian real. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamentals remain positive for grains, and sugar margins are expected to improve in the coming year. On balance, though, farmer confidence in Brazil is lower as a result of economic uncertainty and political concerns in the country. This is leading to lower equipment purchases despite positive ag fundamentals.
Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for ag equipment in Brazil. FINAME PSI has been the primary financing source for ag producers from 2009 through 2014. For the first half of 2015, last year's favorable interest rates remain in place for the agriculture sector through the Moderfrota program. While agricultural producers are able to utilize the more attractive Moderfrota rates, construction equipment financing continues through PSI and will be subject to increased rates in 2015.
Our 2015 ag and turf industry outlook are summarized on Slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm income are putting pressure on demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are more positive, providing support to sales of small and mid-sized tractors. As a result, we continue to expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down 25% to 30% for 2015. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter, due to lower crop prices and farm income as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2015 mainly as a result of economic uncertainty in Brazil. This follows a 13% decline in 2014 compared with the extremely strong levels of 2013.
Shifting to the CIS. We now expect industry sales to be down significantly due to economic concerns and limited credit availability. In Asia, we continue to expect sales to be down slightly.
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.
Putting this all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 23%. Currency translation is now forecast to be negative 4 points, though this outlook reflects about 1 point less volume than our prior guidance. The ag and turf division operating margin is now forecast to be about 7%. Technically, that is 1 point less than we said in our prior guidance, with the difference mainly due to foreign exchange. However, without the impact of rounding, the difference is closer to 0.5 point.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were up 13% in the quarter. Operating profit was up 55%, the result of higher shipment volumes. The division's incremental margin was about 30%.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues to move forward. GDP growth is improving, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. In contrast, we are seeing weakening conditions in the energy sector and energy-producing regions. Based on these factors, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales forecast remains up about 5% in 2015. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 2 points. Global forestry markets are expected to be about flat on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 11%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows Financial Services annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio was 2 basis points at the end of January. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 17 basis points, down about 7 basis points from our previous guidance. The year-over-year increase in the provision is a reflection of the unsustainability -- unsustainably low loss levels of the last 4 years. For reference, the 10-year average is 26 basis points and the 15-year average is 43 basis points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $157 million in the first quarter versus $142 million last year. 2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $630 million.
Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventory. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventory ended the quarter down $1.4 billion. That was equal to 24.9% of prior 12-month sales compared to 26.4% a year ago. The decrease, which came entirely from ag and turf, is reflective of the aggressive way we have cut production in line with our 2015 outlook. We expect to end 2015 with total receivables and inventory up about $100 million, with the increase coming from the C&F division.
Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 19, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price of about 2 points, favorable raw material costs and unfavorable mix of product and Tier 4 product costs.
Looking at R&D expense on Slide 20. R&D was up about 3% in the first quarter, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. Our 2015 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 2 points of negative currency translation.
SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 16% in the first quarter, as you'll see on Slide 21. Landscapes, Water and negative currency translation accounted for about 10 points of the change. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 9%, with Landscapes, Water and currency accounting for about 5 points of the change in the year-over-year comparison.
Turning to Slide 22. Pension and OPEB expense was up about $20 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $80 million in 2015.
On Slide 23, the equipment operations tax rate was approximately 28% in the quarter primarily due to discrete items. While it is not our practice to provide specifics on discrete items, we note that the R&D tax credit for 2014 was extended through the end of the calendar year. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 24 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.3 billion in 2015.
The company's second quarter financial outlook is on Slide 25. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 19% compared with 2014. This includes about 2 points of price realization, with unfavorable currency translation of about 4 points.
Turning to Slide 26 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 17%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative, about 3 points. Finally, our full year 2015 net income forecast is now about $1.8 billion, a decline of approximately $100 million compared with our previous guidance. The change is primarily attributable to foreign currency translation.
Now on Slide 27. There's no doubt Deere's ag business is facing a challenging year. The large ag industry in the United States and Canada, defined on this slide as tractors greater than 220 horsepower and combines, is forecast to be down about 50% from 2013 levels. Yet, as Sam Allen noted in today's earnings release, our forecast reflects a level of results much better than we've experienced in previous downturns. With a 50% decline in large ag, Deere net sales are forecast to be down 22%, with net income down 49%, again, from 2013 levels. This is much better than the 2 other recent downturns shown on the slide. Why the improvement? Because we reacted early to this pullback in the ag sector, controlling costs and assets and aligning production levels with demand.
But more importantly, today's John Deere is more than a large ag company. Our 2015 outlook illustrates the power of our portfolio with a wider range of revenue sources as well as a more durable SVA and OROA business model.
As a final note, it should be stressed that Deere's future continues to hold great promise for our customers and investors. That's because the trends underlying our businesses, such as global population growth and rising living standards, are very much intact and largely unaffected by swings in the farm economy. All in all, we remain confident that Deere is positioned to deliver value throughout the business cycle and to benefit from the world's increasing need for advanced equipment in the quarters and years ahead.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

At this point, we really haven't made significant shifts in the ending inventory and receivable as it relates to that, as you point out, the breakdown between large and small. But thank you."

And that's, again, why you didn't see much -- really, any change in our outlook on the U.S. and Canada side. The combines, we did end that program in early January, and it was down roughly 30% year-over-year, which, again, was maybe slightly better than what we had anticipated. And we've had some others that are going a little bit different direction, but all in all, very much in line with our expectations. And you've seen that reflected in our outlook. As you think about tractors, again, if you look year-over-year, and I want to make sure I point out, obviously, we have much lower daily order -- or daily production in our Waterloo factory on those large tractors. So on that lower production schedule, our availability on large tractors are pretty much in line with where we were last year. 8R tractors would be a little lighter. Our availability this year is in June. Keep in mind, too, last year, there was some impact from Tier 4 transition as well. But if you think about the 8R tractor, this year availability is out into June. Last year would have been a little further out into August. But 9R tractors were in early June. Last year was actually early May, so we're a little further out on availability there. And on 7R tractors, again, we're very much in line. Last year was late June. This year is very early July. And again, that was as of the first week in February. So again, very much in line year-over-year -- or very much in line with our expectation. Thank you."

Yes, I would point out, as you think about the first quarter increased sales versus the outlook, remember, as you think about the comparison for 2014, we have much tougher comps as we moved through the year, especially in the third and fourth quarter. So we had a relatively light first and second quarter. And we also do have some FT4 transition that's going to create some moves from one quarter to the other. In some cases, that contributed to the very strong first quarter. So there are a lot of things along that line. As it relates to the incentives, and I mentioned this on an earlier question, I want to be clear. This isn't an increased incentive for the full year. It's really a timing issue as it relates to an accrual that was booked for some changes in some of the incentive structures that will largely reverse itself as we go through the year. In fact, you'll see a lot of that reversed in the second quarter. So it should not indicate a higher level of year-over-year incentives. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, if you look at the total budget, incentive as a percent of sales are flat year-over-year for that division. But specific to energy, certainly, the expectation is that you'll start to see some slowing in terms of orders. For dealers that are in regions that are heavily impacted by energy, yes, we've seen a little bit of slowdown in replenishment orders, as one would expect, again, in those specific regions, but some of that being offset by strength in other areas. The overall economy continues to improve, and so you're seeing some strength there as well. And we would tell you, longer term -- as you think about lower oil prices, certainly, in the short term, that's going to have a negative impact on the business from an energy sector perspective. But longer term, if they stay at these levels, it could have a more positive impact on the overall economy, which could help with some offsetting strength, longer term, in other parts of the business. So it's a little bit of give and take, but certainly, in the short term, the lower oil prices would be a little bit more take than give for us, but from a longer-term perspective, not necessarily a bad deal."

And so I think that the advantage we have with having a Financial Services organization like we do is that we can evaluate those things both from a short-term potential and risk as well as a longer-term potential positive as well as risk and act accordingly. And that's really what we're doing. I would not say that we're aggressively pursuing leasing necessarily, certainly not participating in some of the very aggressive leasing programs that are rumored to be in the market, and that wouldn't be our expectation going forward.

I think the first and maybe the last thing I'll say on it is it's very premature, really, to talk about market conditions beyond 2015. As we all know, that will largely be impacted by the upcoming growing season, and it's just very, very early. That being said, as we talked about previously, if you look at and assume more normal weather patterns, and we've talked about an analysis that our Chief Economist has completed, if you look at normal weather patterns, trend yields, with the expected lower acreage that most are anticipating for corn as we go into the upcoming growing season, that would result in production slightly less than usage, and you would see stocks brought down and pricing being more supportive. If that would transpire, we would certainly expect to see some improvement next year. Now again, that's based on assumptions of weather, and that's always risky. And while we've had 2 very good years in a row now for growing, especially last year had pretty much ideal growing conditions, that doesn't mean we won't see it again this year. And so that's the risk to the outlook. So again, we'll be watching closely as planting season approaches and what actually gets planted in terms of various crops as well as, of course, as we move through the summer, what happens with the growing conditions. And that will largely drive what we'd expect to see as we move into 2016. So again, I'll end where I started. It's really very premature to talk about things beyond 2015."

If for some reason -- and again, it would be a rare occurrence that you would see a longer downturn without any kind of increase as you move into 2016. It's not -- it wouldn't be unprecedented, but it'd be very, very rare. You'd have to go back much further than the '80s to find that kind of consistent kind of downturn. But if that would happen, certainly, we're positioning ourselves as we move through the year such that if the downturn persists, we can be in a good, strong position to be able to continue to perform well during that downturn but also believe that we're in a good position to react quickly and if we need to bring reduction back up and so on. And one example I would point out in that regard is, as you know, with our UAW contacts, we have the ability to utilize inventory adjustment shutdowns or indefinite layoff. And certainly, as you've noted, I'm sure we have largely utilized indefinite layoffs in our UAW facilities, our large ag facilities, versus choosing to keep a higher level of workforce and leveraging a little more heavily the inventory adjustment shutdown. So that does put us, again, in a bit better footing as we move towards 2016 from a workforce perspective. So while we would argue, if you wanted to play percentages, that there's probably a greater likelihood that 2015 would be the lowest year. And again, recognizing there's always a risk that we could see a further downturn, we aren't playing that risk internally in how we're managing the businesses, with full assumption that we'll see that return in 2016. So we're playing it conservatively internally, even though we're optimistic as we look forward."

And again, that was a pool, really, from our dealer organization requesting that. So I think that alone indicates the confidence they have on the program. I do want to make sure we clarify as we talk about this. We do not want to characterize the Certified Pre-Owned program as some sort of silver bullet. But it certainly is beneficial, especially as our dealers look to market some of these newer used John Deere equipment, in a lot of cases, marketing against brand-new competitive equipment. And that's really the biggest strength that the Certified Pre-Owned program provides. I think our dealers are embracing that. It's growing, and I think there's a fair amount of confidence from the dealer organization around this being a very useful tool for them. So again, I think all very positive signs as we move forward with that program. As far as other products being added, I think it'd be premature to talk about that. But certainly, if that's an area where our dealers feel that it would be beneficial to them, that would certainly be something we would consider in conjunction with them. So thank you."

And much easier comparison in the second quarter, and that should get tougher in third quarter and fourth quarter. Two questions are: one, can you maintain the profitability numbers in the second half of the year that you will average in the first half of the year? Or do they begin to weaken? And an associate with it, you indicated that your inventories and stuff are mostly going up because of C&F. Would you begin to rethink your C&F inventories and maybe want to trim them, particularly if the energy market get softer? And can you add what percent of your business is related to the energy markets in C&F?"

But certainly, we talked about 10% margins in the first quarter. And I'll note that for the full year, it's 11%, so 1 point higher. And again, I want to be clear. It's not that sales are expected to fall off in the back half of the year. It's just the year-over-year comparison. So the growth year-over-year is what would be challenged as we go through the year. So I think that's probably the key there as you think about that. From an energy perspective, certainly, in recent years, that's been a stronger portion of our business, a stronger portion of the industry. We've seen a lot of strength in the energy business across the industry. And we would tell you, if you look at the machines that go directly into things like pipeline, oil, gas, fracking, those sorts of things, we would estimate roughly 10% to 15%, again, in recent years. Deere would not be out of line from where the industry was in that regard. But I would also point out that in those regions that are heavily influenced by energy, you have the residual impact as well on the overall economy and other types of construction that occurs in support of the strength of energy. So in terms of overall business, for some, it could be a bit heavier than that. So that would be our view on that. Thank you."

So again, we believe that there's certainly available credit. People are beginning to utilize the Moderfrota program. Really, if you think about differences between the 2, to be fair, rates are the same as you switch to Moderfrota, but there is a slightly higher down payment under PSI last year. It would have been 0% down payment, and it's 10% under Moderfrota. So there is a slightly higher down payment. But from a funding perspective, it leads through the middle of the year, which is where we have the rates available. The belief is that there will be adequate funding for that."

There are a couple of areas where we see some margins compressing a bit. Dairy, it would be one area. I would point out that as the herd expanded through 2015, you're likely to see some squeezing of margins. Today, they would be close to breakeven, roughly, but still slightly profitable. Poultry, again, coming off of a very strong margins last year, we believe those strong margins will continue through the first half of the year. But production is up, and so that's a part of the industry that can recover fairly quickly, and so we would expect to see, perhaps, some margin squeezing there. And pork, of course, again, we would expect to see some growth in the herd and some reduction as we move through the year. Second half, in particular, could be a challenge from a margin perspective there. So we are seeing some squeezing there. Beef, of course, that takes a while to rebuild herds, and so profitability is expected to still be relatively strong, especially for cow-calf producers. And so overall, we're still looking at small ag, which tends to be a little more closely tied to livestock, to be relatively strong versus, certainly, large ag as we move through 2015, again, coming off of some pretty strong years for livestock producers.

Now certainly, we're well down the line, especially if you think about large ag. But that doesn't mean that as you continue down the line, you don't find additional levers that you can pull. The best example I would point out to that is in our C&F division in 2009. We certainly went to levels that were far lower than what most would have anticipated they could have gone. And additional levers were pulled in that regard in order to try to compensate for that.

It becomes more and more challenging as you go through the year. So certainly, as you put together a forecast, there are a lot of assumptions in there, and certainly, we try to put our best estimates that we can in that regard. So some of the big questions candidly, too, will be what continues to happen with material costs. We've seen some positive move there, which has certainly helped, at least in the short term. And those lower costs, especially in things like steel, if oil prices remain at low levels, that flows through not just our logistics but a lot of other oil-related type of input. And that certainly would be beneficial as well. So we'll just have to see where those things go. But at this point, we are forecasting similar decrementals for the year as what we've seen in the first quarter.

With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2015 on a good note, and we did so in spite of sluggish conditions in the global farm economy, which are reducing demand for agricultural machinery, particular",2211,"Thank you, Tony. With the announcement of our first quarter results, John Deere has started out 2015 on a good note, and we did so in spite of sluggish conditions in the global farm economy, which are reducing demand for agricultural machinery, particularly for larger models. As a result, both sales and profit for our Agriculture & Turf equipment operations were lower for the quarter and are forecast to be down for the year as well. At the same time, our Construction & Forestry and Financial Services businesses had higher profits, showing the value of a well-rounded business lineup. Deere's results for the quarter also demonstrated the progress we've made managing costs and creating a more flexible, responsive cost structure.
One other item worth emphasizing in today's earnings report is the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. It is putting significant pressure on reported sales made outside the United States, a fact reflected in both our first quarter results and our full year forecast.
Now let's take a closer look at the first quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 17% to $6.383 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $387 million. EPS was $1.12 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 19% to $5.6 billion. In the quarter-over-quarter comparison of net sales, Landscapes and Water accounted for 2 points of the change. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was negative by 2 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Sales were down 27% due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada and lower sales in Europe and Brazil. Operating profit was $268 million. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 35%.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts, which, in spite of lower grain prices, remain at historically high levels, thanks to help from record livestock receipts. As a result, we now see 2014 cash receipts at about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013 and the highest level ever recorded.
Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently, the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6%. Of note, crop receipts for 2015 are forecast to be down about 23% lower than the levels in 2012, which was the record.
On Slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong, while supplies appear to be fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could lower production, reduce the stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Economic growth continues in the regions, although at a slow pace. Grain prices have declined but appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average. While livestock margins remain at good levels, dairy margins are being squeezed, especially in the U.K. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In the CIS, increasing economic pressure and further tightening of credit availability continue to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, Western equipment manufacturers are being heavily impacted by geopolitical uncertainties.
In China, the government continues its investment in ag equipment subsidies, but the growth rate has slowed. This, among other things, has led to a decrease in industry sales.
Turning to India. The monsoon season rainfall was below normal, which could result in lower overall agriculture output.
Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness in Brazil. Ag production is expected to decrease about 12% in 2015 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices and the decline in the Brazilian real. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamentals remain positive for grains, and sugar margins are expected to improve in the coming year. On balance, though, farmer confidence in Brazil is lower as a result of economic uncertainty and political concerns in the country. This is leading to lower equipment purchases despite positive ag fundamentals.
Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for ag equipment in Brazil. FINAME PSI has been the primary financing source for ag producers from 2009 through 2014. For the first half of 2015, last year's favorable interest rates remain in place for the agriculture sector through the Moderfrota program. While agricultural producers are able to utilize the more attractive Moderfrota rates, construction equipment financing continues through PSI and will be subject to increased rates in 2015.
Our 2015 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes are putting pressure on demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are more positive, providing support to sales of small and mid-sized tractors. As a result, we continue to expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down 25% to 30% for 2015. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter, due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2015 mainly as a result of economic uncertainty in Brazil. This follows a 13% decline in 2014 compared with the extremely strong levels of 2013.
Shifting to the CIS. We now expect industry sales to be down significantly due to economic concerns and limited credit availability. In Asia, we continue to expect sales to be down slightly.
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.
Putting this all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 23%. Currency translation is now forecast to be a negative 4 points, though this outlook reflects about 1 point less volume than our prior guidance. The ag and turf division operating margin is now forecast to be about 7%. Technically, that is 1 point less than we said in our prior guidance, with the difference mainly due to foreign exchange. However, without the impact of rounding, the difference is closer to 0.5 point.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were up 13% in the quarter. Operating profit was up 55%, the result of higher shipment volumes. The division's incremental margin was about 30%.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues to move forward. GDP growth is improving, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. In contrast, we are seeing weakening conditions in the energy sector and energy-producing regions. Based on these factors, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales forecast remains up about 5% in 2015. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 2 points. Global forestry markets are expected to be about flat on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 11%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows Financial Services annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio was 2 basis points at the end of January. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 17 basis points, down about 7 basis points from our previous guidance. The year-over-year increase in the provision is a reflection of the unsustainability -- unsustainably low loss levels of the last 4 years. For reference, the 10-year average is 26 basis points and the 15-year average is 43 basis points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $157 million in the first quarter versus $142 million last year. 2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company is now forecast to be about $630 million.
Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.4 billion. That was equal to 24.9% of prior 12-month sales compared to 26.4% a year ago. The decrease, which came entirely from ag and turf, is reflective of the aggressive way we have cut production in line with our 2015 outlook. We expect to end 2015 with total receivables and inventories up about $100 million, with the increase coming from the C&F division.
Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 19, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price of about 2 points, favorable raw material costs and unfavorable mix of product and Tier 4 product costs.
Looking at R&D expense on Slide 20. R&D was up about 3% in the first quarter, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. Our 2015 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 2 points of negative currency translation.
SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 16% in the first quarter, as you'll see on Slide 21. Landscapes, Water and negative currency translation accounted for about 10 points of the change. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 9%, with Landscapes, Water and currency accounting for about 5 points of the change in the year-over-year comparison.
Turning to Slide 22. Pension and OPEB expense was up about $20 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $80 million in 2015.
On Slide 23, the equipment operations tax rate was approximately 28% in the quarter primarily due to discrete items. While it is not our practice to provide specifics on discrete items, we note that the R&D tax credit for 2014 was extended through the end of the calendar year. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 24 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.3 billion in 2015.
The company's second quarter financial outlook is on Slide 25. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 19% compared with 2014. This includes about 2 points of price realization, with unfavorable currency translation of about 4 points.
Turning to Slide 26 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 17%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative, about 3 points. Finally, our full year 2015 net income forecast is now about $1.8 billion, a decline of approximately $100 million compared with our previous guidance. The change is primarily attributable to foreign currency translation.
Now on Slide 27. There's no doubt Deere's ag business is facing a challenging year. The large ag industry in the United States and Canada, defined on this slide as tractors greater than 220 horsepower and combines, is forecast to be down about 50% from 2013 levels. Yet, as Sam Allen noted in today's earnings release, our forecast reflects a level of results much better than we've experienced in previous downturns. With a 50% decline in large ag, Deere net sales are forecast to be down 22%, with net income down 49%, again, from 2013 levels. This is much better than the 2 other recent downturns shown on the slide. Why the improvement? Because we reacted early to this pullback in the ag sector, controlling costs and assets and aligning production levels with demand.
But more importantly, today's John Deere is more than a large ag company. Our 2015 outlook illustrates the power of our portfolio with a wider range of revenue sources as well as a more durable SVA and OROA business model.
As a final note, it should be stressed that Deere's future continues to hold great promise for our customers and investors. That's because the trends underlying our businesses, such as global population growth and rising living standards, are very much intact and largely unaffected by swings in the farm economy. All in all, we remain confident that Deere is positioned to deliver value throughout the business cycle and to benefit from the world's increasing need for advanced equipment in the quarters and years ahead.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

And that's, again, why you didn't see much -- really, any change in our outlook on the U.S. and Canada side. The combines, we did end that program in early January, and it was down roughly 30% year-over-year, which, again, was maybe even slightly better than what we had anticipated. And we've had some others that are going a little bit different direction, but all in all, very much in line with our expectations. And you've seen that reflected in our outlook. As you think about tractors, again, if you look year-over-year, and I want to make sure I point out, obviously, we have much lower daily order -- or daily production in our Waterloo factory on those large tractors. So on that lower production schedule, our availability on large tractors are pretty much in line with where we were last year. 8R tractors would be a little lighter. Our availability this year is in June. Keep in mind, too, last year, there was some impact from Tier 4 transition as well. But if you think about the 8R tractor, this year availability is out into June. Last year would have been a little further out into August. But 9R tractors were in early June. Last year was actually early May, so we're a little further out on availability there. And on 7R tractors, again, we're very much in line. Last year was late June. This year is very early July. And again, that was as of the first week in February. So again, very much in line year-over-year -- or very much in line with our expectation. Thank you."

Yes, I would point out, as you think about the first quarter increased sales versus the outlook, remember, as you think about the comparison for 2014, we have much tougher comps as we moved through the year, especially in the third and fourth q",395,"All right. Yes, I would point out, as you think about the first quarter increased sales versus the outlook, remember, as you think about the comparison for 2014, we have much tougher comps as we moved through the year, especially in the third and fourth quarter. So we had a relatively light first and second quarter. And we also do have some FT4 transition that's going to create some moves from one quarter to the other. In some cases, that contributed to the very strong first quarter. So there are a lot of things along that line. As it relates to the incentives, and I mentioned this on an earlier question, I want to be clear. This isn't an increased incentive for the full year. It's really a timing issue as it relates to an accrual that was booked for some changes in some of the incentive structures that will largely reverse itself as we go through the year. In fact, you'll see a lot of that reversed in the second quarter. So it should not indicate a higher level of year-over-year incentives. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, if you look at the total budget, incentive as a percent of sales are flat year-over-year for that division. But specific to energy, certainly, the expectation is that you'll start to see some slowing in terms of orders. For dealers that are in regions that are heavily impacted by energy, yes, we've seen a little bit of slowdown in replenishment orders, as one would expect, again, in those specific regions, but some of that being offset by strength in other areas. The overall economy continues to improve, and so you're seeing some strength there as well. And we would tell you, longer term -- as you think about lower oil prices, certainly, in the short term, that's going to have a negative impact on the business from an energy sector perspective. But longer term, if they stay at these levels, it could have a more positive impact on the overall economy, which could help with some offsetting strength, longer term, in other parts of the business.

I don't know that it necessarily has a major impact on our bottom line longer term. I think the risk, obviously, shifts a little bit from a residual value perspective, but we have a lot of history that we put in play when we set those residual values on the equipment. And so I think that's the advantage we have with having a Financial Services organization like we do is that we can evaluate those things both from a short-term potential and risk as well as a longer-term potential positive as well as risk and act accordingly. And that's really what we're doing. I would not say that we're aggressively pursuing leasing necessarily, certainly not participating in some of the very aggressive leasing programs that are rumored to be in the market, and that wouldn't be our expectation going forward. But certainly, for those customers who choose to lease their product versus putting -- buying it and financing through a retail note, we'd be able to accommodate that through our Financial Services operation."

I don't know that our view has changed necessarily in the last few months. I think the first and maybe the last thing I'll say on it is it's very premature, really, to talk about market conditions beyond 2015. As we all know, that will largely be impacted by the upcoming growing season, and it's just very, very early. That being said, as we talked about previously, if you look at and assume more normal weather patterns, and we've talked about an analysis that our Chief Economist has completed, if you look at normal weather patterns, trend yields, with the expected lower acreage that most are anticipating for corn as we go into the upcoming growing season, that would result in production slightly less than usage, and you would see stocks brought down and pricing being more supportive. If that would transpire, we would certainly expect to see some improvement next year. Now again, that's based on assumptions of weather, and that's always risky. And while we've had 2 very good years in a row now for growing, especially last year had pretty much ideal growing conditions, that doesn't mean we won't see it again this year. And so that's the risk to the outlook. So again, we'll be watching closely as planting season approaches and what actually gets planted in terms of various crops as well as, of course, as we move through the summer, what happens with the growing conditions. And that will largely drive what we'd expect to see as we move into 2016. So again, I'll end where I started. It's really very premature to talk about things beyond 2015."

If for some reason -- and again, it would be a rare occurrence that you would see a longer downturn without any kind of increase as you move into 2016. It's not -- it wouldn't be unprecedented, but it'd be very, very rare. You'd have to go back much further than the '80s to find that kind of consistent kind of downturn. But if that were to happen, certainly, we're positioning ourselves as we move through the year such that if the downturn persists, we can be in a good, strong position to be able to continue to perform well during that downturn but also believe that we're in a good position to react quickly and if we need to bring production back up and so on. And one example I would point out in that regard is, as you know, with our UAW contracts, we have the ability to utilize inventory adjustment shutdowns or indefinite layoff. And certainly, as you've noted, I'm sure we have largely utilized indefinite layoffs in our UAW facilities, our large ag facilities, versus choosing to keep a higher level of workforce and leveraging a little more heavily the inventory adjustment shutdown. So that does put us, again, in a bit better footing as we move towards 2016 from a workforce perspective. So while we would argue, if you wanted to play percentages, that there's probably a greater likelihood that 2015 would be the lowest year. And again, recognizing there's always that risk that we could see a further downturn, we aren't playing that risk internally in how we're managing the businesses, with full assumption that we'll see that return in 2016. So we're playing it conservatively internally, even though we're optimistic as we look forward."

And that's really the biggest strength that the Certified Pre-Owned program provides. I think our dealers are embracing that. It's growing, and I think there's a fair amount of confidence from the dealer organization around this being a very useful tool for them. So again, I think all very positive signs as we move forward with that program. As far as other products being added, I think it'd be premature to talk about that.

It's not that sales are expected to fall off in the back half of the year. It's just the year-over-year comparison. So the growth year-over-year is what would be challenged as we go through the year. So I think that's probably the key there as you think about that. From an energy perspective, certainly, in recent years, that's been a stronger portion of our business, a stronger portion of the industry. We've seen a lot of strength in the energy business across the industry. And we would tell you, if you look at the machines that go directly into things like pipeline, oil, gas, fracking, those sorts of things, we would estimate roughly 10% to 15%, again, in recent years. Deere would not be out of line from where the industry was in that regard. But I would also point out that in those regions that are heavily influenced by energy, you have the residual impact as well on the overall economy and other types of construction that occurs in support of the strength of energy. So in terms of overall business could, for some, could be a bit heavier than that. So that would be our view on that. Thank you."

So again, we believe that there's certainly available credit. People are beginning to utilize the Moderfrota program. Really, if you think about differences between the 2, to be fair, rates are the same as you switch to Moderfrota, but there is a slightly higher down payment under PSI last year. It would have been 0% down payment, and it's 10% under Moderfrota. So there is a slightly higher down payment.

There are a couple of areas where we see some margins compressing a bit. Dairy, it would be one area. I would point out that as the herd expanded through 2015, you're likely to see some squeezing of margins. Today, they would be close to breakeven, roughly, but still slightly profitable. Poultry, again, coming off of very strong margins last year, we believe those strong margins will continue through the first half of the year. But production is up, and so that's a part of the industry that can recover fairly quickly, and so we would expect to see, perhaps, some margin squeezing there. And pork, of course, again, we would expect to see some growth in the herd and some reduction as we move through the year. Second half, in particular, could be a challenge from a margin perspective there. So we are seeing some squeezing there. Beef, of course, that takes a while to rebuild herds, and so profitability is expected to still be relatively strong, especially for cow-calf producers. And so overall, we're still looking at small ag, which tends to be a little more closely tied to livestock, to be relatively strong versus, certainly, large ag as we move through 2015, again, coming off of some pretty strong years for livestock producers.

But if you would anticipate further reductions, obviously, we would evaluate that. We will continue to look for ways we could pull costs out and keep those margins in positive territory. And we've talked a lot about the lever studies we have and plans that we have in place to make sure we do that as we move down the line. Now certainly, we're well down the line, especially if you think about large ag. But that doesn't mean that as you continue down the line, you don't find additional levers that you can pull. The best example I would point out to that is in our C&F division in 2009. We certainly went to levels that were far lower than what most would have anticipated they could have gone. And additional levers were pulled in that regard in order to try to compensate for that. So we would -- again, as we look into 2016, we're trying to position ourselves for whatever the market brings, and we'll make further changes as we need to."

And as you think about SA&G, I would tell you the same thing from a -- SA&G reduction comparison is what I talked about with C&F sales. It becomes more and more challenging as you go through the year. So certainly, as you put together a forecast, there are a lot of assumptions in there, and certainly, we try to put our best estimate that we can in that regard. So some of the big questions candidly, too, will be what continues to happen with material costs. We've seen some positive move there, which has certainly helped, at least in the short term. And those lower costs, especially in things like steel, if oil prices remain at low levels, that flows through not just our logistics but a lot of other oil-related type of inputs. And that certainly would be beneficial as well. So we'll just have to see where those things go. But at this point, we are forecasting similar decrementals for the year as what we've seen in the first quarter.

Our performance reflected the skillful execution of our operating plans and the contributions of a well-rounded business lineup.
The company's Construction & Forestry and Financial Services businesses had higher results for the quarter, while our Agriculture & Turf operations remains solidly profitable despite lower demand for large models of farm machinery.
We also saw benefits from our success holding the line on cost and assets, a fact that gives our performance of resilience we have not seen in prior downturns.
Another item weighing on our results was the strong U.S. dollar. It continued to put pressure on reported sales made outside of the United States and is expected to continue doing so for the rest of the year.
Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter in detail beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 18% to $8.171 billion. Net income attributable to the Deere & Company was $690 million. This includes a $38 million after-tax gain associated with the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business. EPS was $2.03 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 20% to $7.4 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 5 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Sales were down 25% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Also hurting sales in the quarter was a negative impact of foreign currency exchange. Operating profit was $639 million. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 31%, quite respectable considering the decrease in large ag sales.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines the U.S. farm cash receipts, which in spite of softer commodity prices remain near historically high levels, thanks to help from record livestock receipts. As a result, our 2014 forecast calls for cash receipts of about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013 and the highest level ever recorded.
Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently, the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6%. Of note, crop receipts for 2015 are forecast to be about 23% lower than 2012 record.
On Slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remains at somewhat sensitive levels even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oil feed demand remains strong while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tensions could lower production, reduce stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 28 -- is on Slide 8, I'm sorry. Economic growth continues in the region although at a slow pace. Grain prices appear to be a stabilizing at levels near the long-term average. While livestock margins remain at good levels, dairy margins are being squeezed. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets.
In China, the government continues its investment in ag equipment subsidies, but the growth rate has slowed. This, as well as the continued slowdown in economic growth and lower commodity prices, has led to a decrease in forecast industry sales.
Turning to India. The 2015 monsoon season rainfall is expected to be below normal. That, on top of last year's relatively drive monsoon season, will result in lower overall agriculture output.
In the CIS, continued deterioration of economic growth and further tightening of credit continue to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, Western equipment manufacturers are being heavily impacted by the weak Russian currency and geopolitical uncertainties.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 11% for the year in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more productive in the local currency as the price for which farmers sell crops is set in U.S. dollars but paid in Brazilian real. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamentals remain positive for grains. On balance, though, farmer confidence in Brazil is lower as a result of economic uncertainty and political concerns in the country, leading to lower equipment purchases.
Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for ag equipment in Brazil. Eligible finance rates for ag equipment through the end of June increased 3% in April to 7.5% and 9%, depending on the farmers' revenues, with no change on the required down payment. Uncertainty over the 2015, 2016 ag budget as well as concerns about possible further increases in interest rates are also weighing on farmer confidence.
Our 2015 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm income are putting pressure on demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are positive, providing support to sales of small and mid-sized tractors.
As we refine our forecast of market conditions, we now expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 25% for 2015. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter due to lower crop prices and farm income as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 15% to 20% in 2015. The decline in our outlook is a result of economic uncertainty in Brazil, the questions surrounding government-sponsored financing noted previously and potential currency movements.
Shifting to Asia. We now expect sales to be down modestly. In the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly due to economic concerns, limited credit availability and the weak ruble.
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.
Putting these all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide of ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 24%, including about 5 points of negative currency translation. The 1 point change in the forecast from last quarter is all attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange. The ag and turf division operating margin is now forecast to be about 8%.
Before turning to Construction & Forestry, let's take a look at our all-new 8000 series self-propelled forest harvester on Slide 14. After 20 years of incremental changes to our SPFH product line, it represents a complete update with a total of 5,500 new part numbers. The new machine addresses the needs of livestock and dairy customers as well as biogas producers for higher efficiency and productivity. It offers innovative features such as steel guidance, products and smart unloading systems as well as a new which combined the increased performance and uptime and decreased the cost of ownership while adding comfort for the operator.
Earlier this year, the 8000 series won the 2015 forest harvester machine of the year at the Paris international agribusiness show. The 8000 series forage harvester added to our lineup of self-propelled wind blowers and our recent entry into the large square business better positions Deere within the hay and market.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were up 2% in the quarter and operating profit was up 43%. The division's incremental margin was about 173%.
Moving to Slide 16. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues to move forward. GDP growth is improving, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. In contrast, we are seeing weakening conditions in the energy sector and energy-producing regions. Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 2% in 2015. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 3 points. The change in our forecast from last quarter is due to lower sales outside the U.S. and Canada as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange.
Global forestry market are expected to be about flat on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014. C&F full year operating margin is projected to be about 11%.
Before moving to Financial Services, the first Deere-designed and built production class is shown on Slide 17. The model 1050k [ph] is the largest crawler dozer John Deere has ever produced and is part of our growing production-class equipment portfolio. It was introduced earlier this year for mass earthmoving and quarry operations. Its dual path hydrostatic transmission, a unique feature to this size class, provides better fuel economy and maneuverability. Other improvements include a higher power-to-weight ratio, which provides more pushing power and more turning power with full load.
In addition, the 1050k crawler is equipped with John Deere worksite telematics to allow technicians to connect to the machines wirelessly, reducing the repair cycle time, the overall cost of repair and customer downtime.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 18 shows that the Financial Services annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio was 8 basis points at the end of April. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolio. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 14 basis points versus 9 basis points in 2014. The year-over-year increase is a reflection of the unsustainably low loss level of the last 4 years. For reference, the 10-year average is 26 basis points and the 15-year average is 43 points.
Moving to Slide 19. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $170 million in the second quarter versus $148 million last year. Net proceeds from the sale of the crop insurance business benefited the division's second quarter income by about $27 million after tax. Earlier I mentioned a $38 million enterprise gain on sale. The difference is largely due to the enterprise utilization of capital loss carryforward not originating at the Financial Services division level. 2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast at about $630 million, no change from our previous forecast.
Slide 20 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.6 billion. That was equal to 31.4% of prior 12-month sales compared with 32.1% a year ago. The decrease, which came entirely from ag and turf, is reflective of the aggressive way we have cut production in line with our 2015 outlook. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $600 million. The decrease in the ag division from prior guidance is due to reductions outside the United States and Canada and foreign currency exchange.
Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales shown on Slide 21 is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price realization of about 2 points; favorable raw material costs and unfavorable mix of product; and Tier 4 product cost.
Looking at our R&D expense on Slide 22. R&D was down about 4% in the second quarter, including about 3 points of negative currency translation. Our 2015 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 3 points of negative currency translation. The forecast reflects higher R&D spending in the second half of the year, which is the typical pattern.
Moving now to Slide 23. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down about 14% in the second quarter, including about 4 points of currency translation. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 11% with Landscapes, Water and currency accounting for about 6 points of the change. Similar to the situation with R&D spending, SA&G expense is forecast to be higher in the second half of the year.
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was up about $15 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $70 million in 2015.
On Slide 25, the equipment operations tax rate was approximately 30% in the quarter, primarily due to mix of income and discrete items. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.4 billion in 2015.
The company's third quarter financial outlook is on Slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 17% compared with 2014. This includes about 2 points of price realization, with unfavorable currency translation of about 6 points.
Turning to Slide 28 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 19%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative, about 4 points. Finally, despite strong currency headwinds, our full year 2015 net income forecast is now about $1.9 billion, an increase from our previous guidance.
In closing, John Deere expects to be solidly profitable in 2015. In fact, the year is forecast to rank among our stronger ones in sales and profits, even with the pullback we're experiencing in the farm sector. Such an achievement says a lot about the progress we've made establishing a wide range of revenue sources in a more durable business model. All in all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and in its ability to meet customer needs for advanced machinery and services in the future.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

So if you think about the equipment, obviously, overall, I assume you're referring mostly to large ag equipment. So as we look at dealer inventory, certainly we took -- last year, again as a reminder, we pulled a lot of inventory out, as Susan pointed out in the opening comments. We're down pretty significantly year-over-year as we ended the quarter this year with receivables and inventory were down almost $2 billion year-over-year for ag and turf. And certainly, there's a lot of conversation about used equipment levels as well. And we would tell you, if you look at large ag in total, certainly we feel -- I mean, we're always concerned about used equipment. If you ask us, are we more concerned today than we were 3 months ago or 6 months ago, the answer would be no. We continue to be very focused on that. We believe we're materially in better position than our competition. But we're really focusing on lowering those used inventory levels, but also protecting resale values as we do that. So we believe we're on the right path. We are -- feel pretty good about the direction we're heading with used equipment, but certainly we have a lot of work ahead of us in terms of continuing to pull that down."

If you want to talk about currency, we'll have to ask someone get back in queue our have someone pick up on that. As you know, we don't disclose specific guidance in terms of dollar impact from raw materials a couple of years ago. Now we switched and started providing guidance on overall cost of sales. But certainly, that has been a benefit in the first half of the year. I would tell you, if you look at the second half of the year, certainly for ag and turf but really on the overall business, it's slightly less benefit in the back half of the year. Now before anyone gets too excited about that, it's not that we're imply that steel costs and other commodity costs necessarily go up. If you think about the timing of our general purchases and our production on any year, we tend to build inventory in the first half of the year, sequentially, and then it comes down in the back half. So you tend to get the benefit earlier in the year in some of those material cost. So continued benefit from material cost year-over-year. But if you're looking first half, second half, there is actually a slight difference -- slightly lower benefit in the back half in our slide guidance. So okay. Thank you."

It relates to receivables and -- both receivables and inventory outside of the U.S. and Canada as well as some FX impact quarter-over-quarter. But it's mostly about those receivables outside of the U.S. and Canada. But it's implied already, and not to be forgotten that we pulled a lot of receivables and inventory out in 2014 as we ended the year. And certainly, in our initial -- in our original budget guidance, we had a pretty healthy level of receivables and inventory continuing to come out on ag and turf as we seek to underproduce the retail environment through the years. So we have underproduced year-to-date, and we will continue, especially us to go into the back of the year we'll be underproducing the retail environment and continuing to bring those deal inventories down both on new as well as providing some additional support that way for our dealers on used equipment. When you think about C&F, remember we talked about that early on. Much of that increase and some of that is because of higher sales of course. I don't want to imply there isn't increase in inventory what much of that has to do with some of the change in some of the terms, and we think that will drive some higher levels of receivables. And really, the reduction you saw in the quarter had more to do with a refinement of what we think that impact will be from those term changes versus really any kind of significant expectation in terms of a change in actual inventory. So that's really what's driving most of that as we look towards the end of the year."

And as frustrating as it may be for people to hear, it really is about what happens this summer with the current crop that's in the ground. If you're going to assume another year of better-than-average weather where yields are above trend yields, then certainly it's going to be a challenging argument to make that 2016 would certainly improve really anywhere around the globe. But if you look back at what would the implication be on trend yields or a little less than ideal weather or average weather and you see below trend years, then that story changes pretty dramatically because we would argue that you're not -- while you certainly have ample supply of commodity and you're seeing that reflected in commodity prices, there isn't a of commodities either. And so if you underproduce demand going into -- through the 2015 crop and going into 2016, we believe prices will be very responsive to that and as cash receipts would recover in that type of environment, you would see sales begin to recover as well. But that's -- it's close to -- and I just can't pinpoint a certain geography specifically. But I would say that's probably a pretty consistent global statement that we would make. So, okay.

If you think about 7000 series tractors today, we would be really 7,8 and 9 for this year, we're out in the early October in terms of availability. And these are the wheel tractors, not truck tractors. So across the board on wheel tractors would be early October. Last year on 7, that would have been late August. 8 would have also been early October, so consistent. And on 9s, it would have been mid June in terms of availability.

Certainly, you're right, we are seeing a move towards more leasing. We think some of that has to do with given some of the lower margin customers are facing and as well as -- so again, the -- when you purchase the equipment accommodate them to get a better advantage from a tax reduction perspective. So as margins are a bit lower, that isn't as attractive always. But then there's also questions around Section 179 and bonus depreciation. Will we really have that or not? And so we think that's factoring in to some of those decisions in terms of a move towards leasing. Really, if we look at it, the key here is making sure that residuals -- and I think as you implied, making sure that residuals are valued properly. And that tends to be what we focus on. As you know, we tend to be relatively conservative on the setting of residual values. We continue to do that today. We certainly evaluate those on a regular basis. We haven't had any kind of write-downs or accruals that we've had to make against the residual value of that leasing portfolio. But that's really where the risk is, is it does move some risk to the Financial Services organization in the sense of, if residuals would drop dramatically as they come off of lease, that could create some challenges there. A couple of things I would point out though related to that is, one, while it's increasing, it's still a relatively small part of our total portfolio. So just to keep that in perspective. And the other thing is, and it's one of the reasons why it's so important for us as we manage used inventories in general, to make sure we're protective of the -- of pricing on that used equipment. Not only does it help the value of that used equipment. So it helps certainly our dealers so it's supportive there, but it's also supportive of the Financial Services organization in the sense of making sure we're protecting those residual values as we go through this downturn and as we continue to focus on moving those used equipment levels lower. So it is a balancing act in terms of looking to reduce those and still being protective of those values. So anyway, thank you."

While in U.S. dollars certainly, it's down if you consider the impact of currency, remember Brazilian farmers sell in U.S. dollars and then convert back to currency. So their cash receipts in local currency and their margins, because most of their inputs were purchased in local currency and to the extent that they were purchased in U.S. dollars, it would have been before the currency shifted last fall. And so when you look at margins on the crop that was recently harvested, they're pretty attractive levels, which is in stark contrast to the outlook. Really, what we're seeing in our outlook is, in our view, a concern around the general economy. In Brazil, some of the -- you're seeing that in some of the increased rates of FINAME financing. So I would tell you, much of that is going to be dependent on what happens as we move forward with that Brazilian economy. There's still some questions. You'll note our slides end in June terms of what the FINAME financing rates are because they haven't been announced beyond that. So we'll be hearing hopefully in early June is the expectation now, not just what the FINAME financing rates will be for both PSI and Moderfrota, but also what down payment levels are going to require, will they keep Moderfrota at the 10%. And as importantly, what's the overall budget. Will they change that overall budget? And then we'll have a much better feel for what happens as we move forward with Brazil, at least in the short term. But again, I remind you this is about a short of the cycle. Longer term, we continue to believe that we have great opportunity in Brazil as agricultural output continues to grow, as acreage continues to grow and certainly, as our market share continues to grow.

But the overall market continues to be fairly attractive in terms of what we saw at the beginning of the year as well. Again, as a reminder, coming off of a very strong 2014. So if you see those growth rates slow as we go into the back half the year, remember we move into much tougher compares in that division. But when you look at margin like Brazil, and I just mentioned that in my last commentary on the ag sector. And I would say certainly, the overall business there is down significantly. While we have our new facilities and we continue to look for market share increases in Brazil as we go through 2015, those market share increases are just not going to offset the impact of the overall reduction in the industry. So again, those are some of the -- probably the major reduction quarter-over-quarter is lower expectation in Brazil. But a variety of overseas locations really have weakened in our view over the quarter. That's primarily what's driving that difference."

But certainly, that puts pressure because those inventories need to come down. And so you do see some pricing pressure. There's a variety of methods that they may choose to use to do that.

And we would view, in terms of row crop tractors, that breakdown to be more 180 to 200-horsepower and above. So when you look out the AEM data, it gets clouded because you have our 6000 series tractors in those numbers, you have some of our 5000 series tractors in those numbers. And certainly those are tied much more closely to the livestock industry. We talked about year-over-year seeing some strength in livestock. And so that does cloud that picture. And I would point out, those 6000 series tractors come from Germany. And so while we talk about building to retail order, that is on large ag. So that would be our 7, 8s and 9s, and that certainly is the case on those. So I think that part of what is causing maybe some of the confusion. The other thing to keep in mind too is what's reported in AEM is what inventory the dealer owns at the end of the quarter or at the end of the month. And so you do get some distortion. Not all of that is inventory or stock at the dealer. You can have retail sold inventory or tractors that are marked as retail sold counted in those numbers. So from the day it ships from our factory until it's delivered to the customer, it does get reported as dealer inventory. And so again, that can distort things. And I'd also caution any time that we talked about this for years to be very careful about looking at any single month. And especially this year, you look at year-over-year comparisons through the second quarter. Remember last year, our 7000 series tractors and 8000 series tractors were converting to Final Tier 4. And so you had different levels of inventory as you prepared for that transition and certainly as you came out of that transition. So it can distort the year-over-year comparison. So we would continue to tell you from a new inventory level perspective, we're quite comfortable in large ag. We continue to have the lowest level in the industry, and that's not expected to change as we go through the year. now Again that being said, as we talked about earlier, we are underproducing retail, which we think will help lower inventories even further as we go through the year."

So if you just sit back and think about that industry environment we are facing, what we have done with respect to new and used inventories. We are facing, as you know, the deepest downturn in North American large ag equipment that we've seen in 25 years. And as Tony mentioned, we've been working on our both used and new. Now on used combine volumes, our position today is less than where our used combine volumes were a year from now -- year before and 2 years before, okay? So we have confidence that will work down our row-crop used inventory as well. As for the new row-crop equipment sold to the corn and soybean producers in the U.S. and Canada, we take a 7000 and 8000 series tractors and half [ph] of it this year or shipments in the U.S. and Canada came down and there's a decline in retail and a lot further as well, we actually under shipped retail sales by over 20% in the first half, we have forecasted to under shipping sales of the second half as well. So the point I'm trying to make is we are managing our inventories aggressively while at the same time, and as Tony mentioned, keeping the long term in mind. So thanks for the question."

Although it did -- we did pull that down quite a bit. You continue to look at options with that P&G and R&D. We've talked about when C&F went through their super trough in 2009, when you get into levels that you didn't anticipate, you tend to also find levers that you didn't necessarily anticipate. And depending on the perspective, we kept R&D pretty flat year-over-year in our outlook. And so that would be something you would continue to look at. And that, as we've said all along that's something you balance in terms of long-term needs. That wouldn't be necessarily a desirable lever. But you would -- we would continue to look at those things that we could pull out as we go through the year. But it would -- I would also point out, it's the large incremental drop that creates challenges given where our capacity -- where our facilities are at today in terms of percent of capacity utilization. And so -- but again, we certainly -- as we look at the outlook for next year, unless you're going to argue for better-than-average weather, it's hard to argue that you're going to see a significant drop in commodity prices given the strength in demand that we continue to see on commodity. So that would be one area I would make sure to remind people. So okay.
With that, we will conclude the call. And I think it's important maybe to step back a little bit too and think about the year that we're forecasting. As you look at our guidance for 2015 and put that in perspective in a historical perspective, if you look at what we're forecasting for equipment operations net sales, if you look at what we're forecasting for cash flow from operations and equipment operations as well as our EPS overall, it puts us in a top 5-year in all 3 of those categories in terms of what the -- what this guidance provides. And when you put that in context of where our largest business -- where the end markets went this year in terms of the significant drop, we think that's really demonstrating again the power of the overall portfolio, the strength of that model and our ability to continue to drive very solid earnings even in lower end markets.
With that, we'll be around for the rest of the day to take any additional questions you may have. Thank you for participating."

Our performance reflected the skillful execution of our operating plans and the contributions of a well-rounded business lineup.
The company's Construction & Forestry and Financial Services businesses had higher results for the quarter, while our Agriculture & Turf operations remained solidly profitable despite lower demand for large models of farm machineries.
We also saw benefits from our success holding the line on cost and assets, effects that give our performance of resilience we have not seen in prior downturns.
Another item weighing on our results was the strong U.S. dollar. It continued to put pressure on reported sales made outside of the United States, and is expected to continue doing so for the rest of the year.
Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 18% to $8.171 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $690 million. This includes a $38 million after-tax gain associated with the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business. EPS was $2.03 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 20% to $7.4 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points; currency translation was negative by 5 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Sales were down 25% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Also hurting sales in the quarter was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. 
Operating profit was $639 million. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 31%, quite respectable considering the decrease in large ag sales.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts, which, in spite of softer commodity prices, remain near historically high levels, thanks to help from record livestock receipts. As a result, our 2014 forecast calls for cash receipts of about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013 and the highest level ever recorded.
Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and, consequently, the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6%. Of note, crop receipts for 2015 are forecast to be about 23% lower than 2012 record.
On Slide 7. Global grain stocks-to-use ratios remained at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oil feed demand remained strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension could lower production, reduce stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 28 -- is on Slide 8, I'm sorry. Economic growth continues in the region, although at a slow pace. Grain prices appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average. While livestock margins remain at good levels, dairy margins are being squeezed. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets.
In China, the government continues its investment in ag equipment subsidies, but the growth rate has slowed. This as well as the continued slowdown in economic growth and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in forecast industry sales.
Turning to India. The 2015 monsoon season rainfall is expected to be below normal. That, on top of last year's relatively dry monsoon season, will result in lower overall agriculture output.
In the CIS, continued deterioration of economic growth and further tightening of credit continued to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, Western equipment manufacturers are being heavily impacted by the weak Russian currency and geopolitical uncertainties.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 11% for the year, in U.S. dollar terms, due to lower global commodity prices. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency, as the price for which farmers sell crops is set in U.S. dollars but paid in Brazilian real. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamentals remain positive for grains. On balance, though, farmer confidence in Brazil is lower as a result of economic uncertainty and political concerns in the country, leading to lower equipment purchases.
Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for ag equipment in Brazil. Eligible finance rates for ag equipment through the end of June increased 3% in April to 7.5% and 9%, depending on a farmer's revenues, with no change on the required down payment. Uncertainty over the 2015, 2016 ag budgets as well as concerns about possible further increases in interest rates are also weighing on farmer confidence.
Our 2015 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes are putting pressure on demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are positive, providing support to sales of small and mid-size tractors.
As we refine our forecast of market conditions, we now expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 25% for 2015. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter, due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as pressure on the dairy sector. 
In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 15% to 20% in 2015. The decline in our outlook is a result of economic uncertainty in Brazil, the questions surrounding government-sponsored financing noted previously and potential currency movements.
Shifting to Asia. We now expect sales to be down modestly. In the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly due to economic concerns, limited credit availability and the weak ruble.
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.
Putting these all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide of ag and turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 24%, including about 5 points of negative currency translation. The 1-point change in the forecast from last quarter is all attributable to the impact of foreign-currency exchange. The ag and turf division operating margin is now forecast to be about 8%.
Before turning to Construction & Forestry, let's take a look at our all-new 8000 series self-propelled forage harvester on Slide 14. After 20 years of incremental changes to our SPFH product line, it represents a complete update with a total of 5,500 new part numbers. The new machine addresses the needs of livestock and dairy customers as well as biogas producers for higher efficiency and productivity. It offers innovative features such as field guidance, products and smart unloading systems as well as a new cab, which combine to increase performance and uptime and decrease the cost of ownership while adding comfort for the operator.
Earlier this year, the 8000 series won the 2015 forest harvester machine of the year at SIMA, the Paris international agribusiness show. The 8000 Series forage harvester added to our lineup of self-propelled wind blowers [ph] and our recent entry into the large square baler business better positions Deere within the hay and forage markets.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were up 2% in the quarter and operating profit was up 43%. The division's incremental margin was about 173%.
Moving to Slide 16. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues to move forward. GDP growth is improving, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. In contrast, we are seeing weakening conditions in the energy sector and energy-producing regions. Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 2% in 2015. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 3 points. The change in our forecast from last quarter is due to lower sales outside the U.S. and Canada as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange.
Global forestry markets are expected to be about flat on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014. C&F full year operating margin is projected to be about 11%.
Before moving to Financial Services, the first Deere-designed and -built production-class dozer is shown on Slide 17. The model 1050K is the largest crawler dozer John Deere has ever produced and is part of our growing production-class equipment portfolio. It was introduced earlier this year for mass earthmoving and quarry operations. Its dual-path hydrostatic transmission, a unique feature to this size class, provides better fuel economy and maneuverability. Other improvements include a higher power-to-weight ratio, which provides more pushing power and more turning power with full loads.
In addition, the 1050K crawler is equipped with John Deere worksite telematics to allow technicians to connect to the machines wirelessly, reducing the repair cycle times, the overall cost of repair and customer downtime.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 18 shows that the Financial Services annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio was 8 basis points at the end of April. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 14 basis points versus 9 basis points in 2014. The year-over-year increase is a reflection of the unsustainably low loss levels of the last 4 years. For reference, the 10-year average is 26 basis points and the 15-year average is 43 points.
Moving to Slide 19. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $170 million in the second quarter versus $148 million last year. Net proceeds from the sale of the crop insurance business benefited the division's second quarter income by about $27 million after tax. Earlier, I mentioned a $38 million enterprise gain on the sale. The difference is largely due to the enterprise utilization of capital loss carryforward not originating at the Financial Services division level. 2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast at about $630 million, no change from our previous forecast.
Slide 20 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.6 billion. That was equal to 31.4% of prior 12-month sales compared with 32.1% a year ago. The decrease, which came entirely from ag and turf, is reflective of the aggressive way we have cut production in line with our 2015 outlook. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $600 million. The decrease in the ag division from prior guidance is due to reductions outside the United States and Canada and foreign currency exchange.
Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 21, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price realization of about 2 points; favorable raw material costs and unfavorable mix of product; and Tier 4 product costs.
Looking at R&D expense on Slide 22. R&D was down about 4% in the second quarter, including about 3 points of negative currency translation. Our 2015 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 3 points of negative currency translation. The forecast reflects higher R&D spending in the second half of the year, which is the typical pattern.
Moving now to Slide 23. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down about 14% in the second quarter, including about 4 points of currency translation. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 11%, with Landscapes, Water and currency accounting for about 6 points of the change. Similar to the situation with R&D spending, SA&G expense is forecast to be higher in the second half of the year.
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was up about $15 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $70 million in 2015.
On Slide 25. The equipment operations tax rate was approximately 30% in the quarter, primarily due to mix of income and discrete items. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.4 billion in 2015.
The company's third quarter financial outlook is on Slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 17% compared with 2014. This includes about 2 points of price realization, with unfavorable currency translation of about 6 points.
Turning to Slide 28 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 19%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative, about 4 points. Finally, despite strong currency headwinds, our full year 2015 net income forecast is now about $1.9 billion, an increase from our previous guidance.
In closing, John Deere expects to be solidly profitable in 2015. In fact, the year is forecast to rank among our stronger ones in sales and profits, even with the pullback we're experiencing in the farm sector. Such an achievement says a lot about the progress we've made establishing a wide range of revenue sources and a more durable business model. All in all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and in its ability to meet customer needs for advanced machinery and services in the future.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

If you ask us, are we more concerned today than we were 3 months ago or 6 months ago? The answer would be no. We continue to be very focused on that. We believe we're materially in a better position than our competition. But we're really focusing on lowering those used inventory levels, but also protecting resale values as we do that. So we believe we're on the right path. We are -- feel pretty good about the direction we're heading with used equipment, but certainly we have a lot of work ahead of us in terms of continuing to pull that down."

Now before anyone gets too excited about that, we -- it's not that we're implying that steel costs and other commodity costs necessarily go up. If you think about the timing of our general purchases and our production on any year, we tend to build inventory in the first half of the year, sequentially, and then it comes down in the back half. So you tend to get the benefit earlier in the year in some of those material costs. So continued benefit from material cost year-over-year. But if you're looking first half, second half, there is actually a slight difference -- slightly lower benefit in the back half in our slide guidance. So okay. Thank you."

So as you look at receivables and inventory for -- and specifically, we'll start with ag and turf. If you look at the change in the forecast from last quarter to this quarter, I would tell you, it really -- it does not relate to the U.S. and Canada. It relates to receivables and -- it's both receivables and inventory outside of the U.S. and Canada as well as some FX impact quarter-over-quarter, but it's mostly about those receivables outside of the U.S. and Canada. But it's implied already, and not to be forgotten that we pulled a lot of receivables and inventory out in 2014 as we ended the year. And certainly, in our initial -- in our original budget guidance, we had a pretty healthy level of receivables and inventory continuing to come out on ag and turf as we seek to underproduce the retail environment through the years. So we have underproduced year-to-date, and we would continue -- especially as we go into the back of the year, we'll be underproducing the retail environment and continuing to bring those deals and inventories down, both on new as well as providing some additional support that way for our dealers on used equipment. When you think about C&F, remember, we talked about that early on. Much of that increase and some of that is because of higher sales, of course. I don't want to imply there isn't any increase in field inventory, but much of that have to do with the change in some of the terms, and we think that will drive some higher levels of receivables. And really, the reduction you saw in the quarter had more to do with a refinement of what we think that impact will be from those term changes versus, really, any kind of significant expectation in terms of a change in actual field inventories. So that's really what's driving most of that as we look towards the end of the year."

If you talk to our chief economist, he would say, we're really in kind of a year-to-year type of mode right now. And as frustrating as it may be for people to hear, it really is about what happens this summer with the current crop that's in the ground. If you're going to assume another year of better-than-average weather where yields are above trend yields, then certainly, it's going to be a challenging argument to make that the 2016 would certainly improve, really, anywhere in -- around the globe. But if you look back at what would the implications be of trend yields or a little less-than-ideal weather or average weather and you see below trend yields, then that story changes pretty dramatically, because we would argue that you're not -- while you certainly have ample supply of commodities and you're seeing that reflected in commodity prices, there isn't a glut of commodities either. And so if you underproduce demand going into -- through the 2015 crop and going into 2016, we believe prices would be very responsive to that, and as cash receipts would recover in that type of environment, you would see sales begin to recover as well. So that's -- it's close to -- and I just can't pinpoint a certain geography specifically, but I would say that, probably, a pretty consistent global statement that we would make. So, okay?"

And if you think about order book, I think, in general, we will continue to stay versus our forecast -- I mean, obviously, we're forecasting a much lower level of orders, but versus that forecast, we continue to be in very, very good shape compared to last year in terms of the order coverage. Certainly, combines, at this point in the year, with the early order program, we're well over 90% covered. And the bigger question tends to be things like large tractors. If you think about 7000 Series tractors today, we would be -- really, 7s, 8s and 9s for this year, we're out into early October in terms of availability. And these are the wheel tractors, not track tractors. So across the board, on wheel tractors would be early October. Last year, on 7s, that would have been late August. 8000 would have also been early October, so consistent. And on 9s, it would have been mid June in terms of availability. So our order book is actually on, again, much lower order level or much expectations. But as -- at an availability perspective, in very good shape. I didn't mention the track tractors. Those would also be, on 8s, would be out in early October, 9s would be in August, which will be a little bit behind where we were last year. Last year we would've been out into September."

Certainly, you're right. We are seeing a move towards more leasing. We think, some of that has to do with given some of the lower margin customers are facing and as well as -- so again, the -- when you purchase the equipment, you tend to get better advantage from a tax deduction perspective. So as margins are a bit lower, that isn't as attractive always. But then, there's also questions around Section 179 and bonus depreciation. Will we really have that or not? And so we think that's factoring in to some of those decisions in terms of a move towards leasing. Really, as we look at it, the key here is making sure that residuals -- and I think, as you implied, making sure that residuals are valued properly. And that tends to be what we focus on. As you know, we tend to be relatively conservative on the setting of residual values. We continue to do that today. We certainly -- we evaluate those on a regular basis. We haven't had any kind of write-downs or accruals that we've had to make against the residual values of that leasing portfolio. But that's really where the risk is, is it does move some risk to the Financial Services organization in the sense of, if residuals would drop dramatically as they come off of lease, that could create some challenges there. A couple of things I would point out, though, related to that is, one, while it's increasing, it's still a relatively small part of our total portfolio. So just to keep that in perspective. And the other thing is, and it's one of the reasons why it's so important for us as we manage used inventories in general, to make sure we're protective of the -- of pricing on that used equipment. Not only does it help the value of that used equipment. So it helps, certainly, our dealers, and so it's supportive there, but it's also supportive of the Financial Services organization in the sense of making sure we're protecting those residual values as we go through this downturn and as we continue to focus on moving those used equipment levels lower. So it is a balancing act in terms of looking to reduce those and still being protective of those values. So anyway, thank you."

While in U.S. dollars, certainly, it's down if you consider the impact of currency, because remember, Brazilian farmers sell in U.S. dollars, and then, convert back to currency. So their cash receipts in local currency and their margins, because most of their inputs were purchased in local currency and to the extent that they were purchased in U.S. dollars, it would have been before the currency shifted last fall. And so when you look at margins on the crop that was recently harvested, they're pretty attractive levels, which is in stark contrast to the outlook. Really, what we're seeing in our outlook is, in our view, a concern around the general economy. In Brazil, some of the -- you're seeing that in some of the increased rates of FINAME financing. So I would tell you, much of that is going to be dependent on what happens as we move forward with that Brazilian economy. There's still some questions. You'll note, our slides end in June in terms of what the FINAME financing rates are because they haven't been announced beyond that. So we'll be hearing, hopefully, in early June, is the expectation now, not just what the FINAME financing rates will be for both PSI and Moderfrota, but also, what down payment levels they're going to require. Will they keep Moderfrota at the 10%? And as importantly, what's the overall budget? Will they change that overall budget? And then, we'll have a much better feel for what happens as we move forward with Brazil, at least in the short term. But again, I'd remind you, this is about a short of the cycle. Longer term, we continue to believe that we have great opportunity in Brazil as agricultural output continues to grow, as acreage continues to grow and certainly, as our market share continues to grow. So okay."

It's more about sales outside of the U.S. and Canada as well as FX. Within the U.S. and Canada, certainly, we're seeing -- in those areas that are heavily influenced by energy, certainly seen lower orders and business slowing down somewhat. But the overall market continues to be fairly attractive in terms of what we saw at the beginning of the year as well. Again, as a reminder, coming off of a very strong 2014. So as you see those growth rates slow as we go into the back half the year, remember, we move into much tougher compares in that division. But when you look at markets like Brazil, and I just mentioned that in my last commentary on the ag sector. And I would say, certainly, the overall business there is down significantly. While we have our new facilities and we continue to look for market share increases in Brazil as we go through 2015, those market share increases just are not going to offset the impact of the overall reduction in the industry. And so again, those are some of the -- those are probably the major reduction quarter-over-quarter is what our expectation is in Brazil. But a variety of overseas locations really have weakened, in our view, over the quarter. So that's primarily what's driving that difference."

It's not a surprise given the level of inventories that our competition has. And as a reminder, we went into the year on large ag. If you look at inventory as a percent of sales, about half of where our competition was, we would continue to say on large ag equipment that our inventory levels are, as a percent of sales, about half of what the rest of the industry would be. But certainly, that puts pressure because those inventories need to come down. And so you do see some pricing pressure. There's a variety of methods that they may choose to use to do that. And certainly, we continue to see that -- we talked about it last year in Construction & Forestry, both on our dealer sales as well as with the independent rental business, a lot of pricing pressure. And I would certainly tell you, year-over-year, that pricing pressure has not reduced. Now we still continue to forecast, even in that environment, a 2-point price realization.

And we would view, in terms of row-crop tractors, that breakdown to be more 180- to 200-horsepower and above. So when you look at the AEM data, it gets clouded, because you have our 6000 Series tractors in those numbers. You have some of our 5000 Series tractors in those numbers. And certainly, those are tied much more closely to the livestock industry. We talked about, year-over-year, seeing some strength in livestock. And so that does cloud that picture. And I would point out, those 6000 Series tractors come from Germany. And so while we talk about building to retail order, that is on large ag. So that would be our 7, 8s and 9s, and that certainly is the case on those. So I think that part of what is causing maybe some of the confusion. The other thing to keep in mind, too, is what's reported in AEM is what inventory the dealer owns at the end of the quarter -- or at the end of the month. And so you do get some distortion. Not all of that is inventory or stock at the dealer. You can have retail-sold inventory or tractors that are marked as retail-sold counted in those numbers. So from the day it ships from our factory until it's delivered to the customer, it does get reported as dealer inventory. So again, that can distort things. And I'd also caution, any time that we've talked about this for years, to be very careful about looking at any single month. And especially, this year, you look at year-over-year comparisons through the second quarter. Remember last year, our 7000 Series tractors and 8000 Series tractors were converting to Final Tier 4. And so you had different levels of inventory as you prepared for that transition and certainly as you came out of that transition. So it can distort the year-over-year comparison. So we would continue to tell you, from a new inventory level perspective, we're quite comfortable. In large ag, we continue to have the lowest levels in the industry, and that's not expected to change as we go through the year. Now again, that being said, as we talked about earlier, we are underproducing retail, which, we think, will help lower inventories even further as we go through the year."

Now on used combine volumes, our position today is less than where our used combine volumes were a year from now -- year before and 2 years before, okay? So we have confidence that we'll work down our row-crop used inventory as well. And as for the new row-crop equipment sold to the corn and soybean producers in the U.S. and Canada, we take our 7000 and 8000 Series tractors in the first half of this year. Our shipments in the U.S. and Canada came down with the decline in retail and a lot further as well. We actually under-shipped retail sales by over 20% in the first half, we have forecasted to under-shipping sales of the second half as well.

You continue to look at options with SA&G and R&D. We've talked about when C&F went through their super trough in 2009. When you get into levels that you didn't anticipate, you tend to also find levers that you didn't necessarily anticipate. And depending on the perspective, we kept R&D pretty flat year-over-year in our outlook. And so that would be something you would continue to look at. And that, as we've said all along, that's something you balance in terms of long-term needs. That wouldn't be necessarily a desirable lever. But you would -- we will continue to look at those things that we could pull out as we go through the year. But it would -- I would also point out, it's the -- a large incremental drop that creates challenges, given where our capacity -- where our facilities are at today in terms of percent of capacity utilization. And so -- but again, we certainly -- as we look at the outlook for next year, unless you're going to argue for better-than-average weather, it's hard to argue that you're going to see a significant drop in commodity prices given the strength in demand that we continue to see on commodity. So that would be one area I would make sure to remind people, so.
Okay. With that, we will conclude the call. And I think it's important maybe to step back a little bit, too, and think about the year that we're forecasting. As you look at our guidance for 2015 and put that in perspective in a historical perspective, if you look at what we're forecasting for equipment operations net sales, if you look at what we're forecasting for cash flow from operations and equipment operations as well as our EPS overall, it puts us in a top-5 year in all 3 of those categories in terms of what the -- what this guidance provides. And when you put that in context of where our largest business -- where the end markets went this year in terms of the significant drop, we think that's really demonstrating, again, the power of the overall portfolio, the strength of that SVA model and our ability to continue to drive very solid earnings even in lower-end markets.
With that, we'll be around for the rest of the day to take any additional questions you may have. Thank you for participating."

Our performance reflected the skillful execution of our operating plans and the contributions of a well-rounded business lineup.
The company's Construction & Forestry and Financial Services businesses had higher results for the quarter, while our Agriculture & Turf operations remained solidly profitable despite lower demand for large models of farm machinery.
We also saw benefits from our success holding the line on costs and assets, a fact that give our performance of resilience we have not seen in prior downturns.
Another item weighing on our results was the strong U.S. dollar. It continued to put pressure on reported sales made outside of the United States and is expected to continue doing so for the rest of the year.
Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 18% to $8.171 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $690 million. This includes a $38 million after-tax gain associated with the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business. EPS was $2.03 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 20% to $7.4 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 5 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Sales were down 25% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Also hurting sales in the quarter was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. 
Operating profit was $639 million. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 31%, quite respectable considering the decrease in large ag sales.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts, which, in spite of softer commodity prices, remain near historically high levels, thanks to help from record livestock receipts. As a result, our 2014 forecast calls for cash receipts of about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013 and the highest level ever recorded.
Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and, consequently, the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6%. Of note, crop receipts for 2015 are forecast to be about 23% lower than 2012's record.
On Slide 7. Global grain stocks-to-use ratios remained at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oil feed demand remain strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension could lower production, reduce stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 28 -- is on Slide 8, I'm sorry. Economic growth continues in the region, although at a slow pace. Grain prices appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average. While livestock margins remain at good levels, dairy margins are being squeezed. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets.
In China, the government continues its investment in ag equipment subsidies, but the growth rate has slowed. This as well as the continued slowdown in economic growth and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in forecast industry sales.
Turning to India. The 2015 monsoon season rainfall is expected to be below normal. That, on top of last year's relatively dry monsoon season, will result in lower overall agriculture output.
In the CIS, continued deterioration of economic growth and further tightening of credit continued to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, Western equipment manufacturers are being heavily impacted by the weak Russian currency and geopolitical uncertainties.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 11% for the year, in U.S. dollar terms, due to lower global commodity prices. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency, as the price for which farmers sell crops is set in U.S. dollars but paid in Brazilian real. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamentals remain positive for grains. On balance, though, farmer confidence in Brazil is lower as a result of economic uncertainty and political concerns in the country, leading to lower equipment purchases.
Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for ag equipment in Brazil. Eligible finance rates for ag equipment through the end of June increased 3% in April to 7.5% and 9%, depending on a farmer's revenues, with no change on the required down payment. Uncertainty over the 2015, 2016 ag budgets as well as concerns about possible further increases in interest rates are also weighing on farmer confidence.
Our 2015 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes are putting pressure on demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are positive, providing support to sales of small and mid-size tractors.
As we refine our forecast of market conditions, we now expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 25% for 2015. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter, due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as pressure on the dairy sector. 
In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 15% to 20% in 2015. The decline in our outlook is a result of economic uncertainty in Brazil, the questions surrounding government-sponsored financing noted previously and potential currency movements.
Shifting to Asia. We now expect sales to be down modestly. In the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly due to economic concerns, limited credit availability and the weak ruble.
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.
Putting these all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide of Ag and Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 24%, including about 5 points of negative currency translation. The 1-point change in the forecast from last quarter is all attributable to the impact of foreign-currency exchange. The Ag and Turf division operating margin is now forecast to be about 8%.
Before turning to Construction & Forestry, let's take a look at our all-new 8000 series self-propelled forage harvester on Slide 14. After 20 years of incremental changes to our SPFH product line, it represents a complete update with a total of 5,500 new part numbers. The new machine addresses the needs of livestock and dairy customers as well as biogas producers for higher efficiency and productivity. It offers innovative features such as field guidance, products and smart unloading systems as well as a new cab, which combine to increase performance and uptime and decrease the cost of ownership while adding comfort for the operator.
Earlier this year, the 8000 series won the 2015 forage harvester machine of the year at SIMA, the Paris international agribusiness show. The 8000 Series forage harvester added to our lineup of self-propelled windrowers and our recent entry into the large square baler business better positions Deere within the hay and forage markets.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were up 2% in the quarter and operating profit was up 43%. The division's incremental margin was about 173%.
Moving to Slide 16. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues to move forward. GDP growth is improving, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. In contrast, we are seeing weakening conditions in the energy sector and energy-producing regions. Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 2% in 2015. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 3 points. The change in our forecast from last quarter is due to lower sales outside the U.S. and Canada as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange.
Global forestry markets are expected to be about flat on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014. C&F full year operating margin is projected to be about 11%.
Before moving to Financial Services, the first Deere-designed and -built production-class dozer is shown on Slide 17. The model 1050K is the largest crawler dozer John Deere has ever produced and is part of our growing production-class equipment portfolio. It was introduced earlier this year for mass earthmoving and quarry operations. Its dual-path hydrostatic transmission, a unique feature to this size class, provides better fuel economy and maneuverability. Other improvements include a higher power-to-weight ratio, which provides more pushing power and more turning power with full loads.
In addition, the 1050K crawler is equipped with John Deere worksite telematics to allow technicians to connect to the machines wirelessly, reducing the repair cycle times, the overall cost of repair and customer downtime.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 18 shows that the Financial Services annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio was 8 basis points at the end of April. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 14 basis points versus 9 basis points in 2014. The year-over-year increase is a reflection of the unsustainably low loss levels of the last 4 years. For reference, the 10-year average is 26 basis points and the 15-year average is 43 points.
Moving to Slide 19. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $170 million in the second quarter versus $148 million last year. Net proceeds from the sale of the crop insurance business benefited the division's second quarter income by about $27 million after tax. Earlier, I mentioned a $38 million enterprise gain on the sale. The difference is largely due to the enterprise utilization of capital loss carryforwards not originating at the Financial Services division level. 2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast at about $630 million, no change from our previous forecast.
Slide 20 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.6 billion. That was equal to 31.4% of prior 12-month sales compared with 32.1% a year ago. The decrease, which came entirely from Ag and Turf, is reflective of the aggressive way we have cut production in line with our 2015 outlook. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $600 million. The decrease in the Ag division from prior guidance is due to reductions outside the United States and Canada and foreign currency exchange.
Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 21, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price realization of about 2 points, favorable raw material costs and unfavorable mix of product, and Tier 4 product costs.
Looking at R&D expense on Slide 22. R&D was down about 4% in the second quarter, including about 3 points of negative currency translation. Our 2015 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 3 points of negative currency translation. The forecast reflects higher R&D spending in the second half of the year, which is the typical pattern.
Moving now to Slide 23. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down about 14% in the second quarter, including about 4 points of currency translation. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 11%, with Landscapes, Water and currency accounting for about 6 points of the change. Similar to the situation with R&D spending, SA&G expense is forecast to be higher in the second half of the year.
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was up about $15 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $70 million in 2015.
On Slide 25. The equipment operations tax rate was approximately 30% in the quarter, primarily due to mix of income and discrete items. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.4 billion in 2015.
The company's third quarter financial outlook is on Slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 17% compared with 2014. This includes about 2 points of price realization, with unfavorable currency translation of about 6 points.
Turning to Slide 28 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 19%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative, about 4 points. Finally, despite strong currency headwinds, our full year 2015 net income forecast is now about $1.9 billion, an increase from our previous guidance.
In closing, John Deere expects to be solidly profitable in 2015. In fact, the year is forecast to rank among our stronger ones in sales and profits, even with the pullback we're experiencing in the farm sector. Such an achievement says a lot about the progress we've made establishing a wider range of revenue sources and a more durable business model. All in all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and in its ability to meet customer needs for advanced machinery and services in the future.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

We believe we're materially in a better position than our competition. But we're really focusing on lowering those used inventory levels, but also protecting resale values as we do that. So we believe we're on the right path. We are -- feel pretty good about the direction we're heading with used equipment, but certainly we have a lot of work ahead of us in terms of continuing to pull that down."

Now before anyone gets too excited about that, we -- it's not that we're implying that steel costs and other commodity costs necessarily go up. If you think about the timing of our general purchases and our production on any year, we tend to build inventory in the first half of the year, sequentially, and then it comes down in the back half. So you tend to get the benefit earlier in the year in some of those material costs. So continued benefit from material cost year-over-year.

But it's implied already, and not to be forgotten that we pulled a lot of receivables and inventory out in 2014 as we ended the year. And certainly, in our initial -- in our original budget guidance, we had a pretty healthy level of receivables and inventory continuing to come out on Ag and Turf as we seek to underproduce the retail environment through the years. So we have underproduced year-to-date, and we would continue, especially as we go into the back of the year. We'll be underproducing the retail environment and continuing to bring those field inventories down, both on new as well as providing some additional support that way for our dealers on used equipment. When you think about C&F, remember, we talked about that early on. Much of that increase -- and some of that is because of higher sales, of course. I don't want to imply there isn't any increase in field inventory, but much of that has to do with the change in some of the terms, and we think that will drive some higher levels of receivables. And really, the reduction you saw in the quarter had more to do with a refinement of what we think that impact will be from those term changes versus, really, any kind of significant expectation in terms of a change in actual field inventories. So that's really what's driving most of that as we look towards the end of the year."

And actually, I think, if you look at the U.S. and Canada markets, for example, and I think it really implies the overall commodity markets in general. If you talk to our chief economist, he would say, we're really in kind of a year-to-year type of mode right now. And as frustrating as it may be for people to hear, it really is about what happens this summer with the current crop that's in the ground. If you're going to assume another year of better-than-average weather where yields are above trend yields, then certainly, it's going to be a challenging argument to make that 2016 would certainly improve, really, anywhere in -- around the globe. But if you look back at what would the implications be of trend yields or a little less-than-ideal weather or average weather and you see below-trend yields, then that story changes pretty dramatically, because we would argue that you're not -- while you certainly have ample supply of commodities and you're seeing that reflected in commodity prices, there isn't a glut of commodities either. And so if you underproduce demand going into -- through the 2015 crop and going into 2016, we believe prices would be very responsive to that, and as cash receipts would recover in that type of environment, you would see sales begin to recover as well. So that's -- it's close to -- and I just can't pinpoint a certain geography specifically, but I would say that's probably a pretty consistent global statement that we would make. So, okay?"

Certainly, combines, at this point in the year, with the early order program, we're well over 90% covered. And the bigger question tends to be things like large tractors. If you think about 7000 Series tractors today, we would be -- really, 7s, 8s and 9s for this year, we're out into early October in terms of availability. And these are the wheel tractors, not track tractors. So across the board, on wheel tractors would be early October.

Certainly, you're right. We are seeing a move towards more leasing. We think some of that has to do with -- given some of the lower margins customers are facing and as well as -- so again, the -- when you purchase the equipment, you tend to get better advantage from a tax-deduction perspective. So as margins are a bit lower, that isn't as attractive always. But then, there's also questions around Section 179 and bonus depreciation. Will we really have that or not? And so we think that's factoring in to some of those decisions in terms of a move towards leasing. Really, as we look at it, the key here is making sure that residuals -- and I think, as you implied, making sure that residuals are valued properly. And that tends to be what we focus on. As you know, we tend to be relatively conservative on the setting of residual values. We continue to do that today. We certainly reevaluate those on a regular basis. We haven't had any kind of write-downs or accruals that we've had to make against the residual values of that leasing portfolio. But that's really where the risk is, is it does move some risk to the Financial Services organization in the sense of, if residuals would drop dramatically as they come off of lease, that could create some challenges there. A couple of things I would point out, though, related to that is, one, while it's increasing, it's still a relatively small part of our total portfolio. So just to keep that in perspective. And the other thing is, and it's one of the reasons why it's so important for us as we manage used inventories in general, to make sure we're protective of the -- of pricing on that used equipment. Not only does it help the value of that used equipment. So it helps, certainly, our dealers, and so it's supportive there, but it's also supportive of the Financial Services organization in the sense of making sure we're protecting those residual values as we go through this downturn and as we continue to focus on moving those used equipment levels lower. So it is a balancing act in terms of looking to reduce those and still being protective of those values. So anyway, thank you."

While in U.S. dollars, certainly, it's down if you consider the impact of currency, because remember, Brazilian farmers sell in U.S. dollars, and then convert back to local currency. So their cash receipts in local currency and their margins, because most of their inputs were purchased in local currency and to the extent that they were purchased in U.S. dollars, it would have been before the currency shifted last fall. And so when you look at margins on the crop that was recently harvested, they're pretty attractive levels, which is in stark contrast to the outlook. Really, what we're seeing in our outlook is, in our view, a concern around the general economy. In Brazil, some of the -- you're seeing that in some of the increased rates of FINAME financing. So I would tell you, much of that is going to be dependent on what happens as we move forward with that Brazilian economy. There's still some questions. You'll note, our slides end in June in terms of what the FINAME financing rates are because they haven't been announced beyond that. So we'll be hearing, hopefully, in early June, is the expectation now, not just what the FINAME financing rates will be for both PSI and Moderfrota, but also what down payment levels they're going to require. Will they keep Moderfrota at the 10%? And as importantly, what's the overall budget? Will they change that overall budget? And then, we'll have a much better feel for what happens as we move forward with Brazil, at least in the short term. But again, I'd remind you, this is about a short -- the cycle. Longer term, we continue to believe that we have great opportunity in Brazil as agricultural output continues to grow, as acreage continues to grow and certainly, as our market share continues to grow.

While we have our new facilities and we continue to look for market share increases in Brazil as we go through 2015, those market share increases just are not going to offset the impact of the overall reduction in the industry. And so again, those are some of the -- it's probably the major reduction quarter-over-quarter is what our expectation is in Brazil. But a variety of overseas locations really have weakened, in our view, over the quarter. So that's primarily what's driving that difference."

It's not a surprise given the level of inventories that our competition has. And as a reminder, we went into the year on large ag, if you look at inventory as a percent of sales, about half of where our competition was. We would continue to say on large ag equipment that our inventory levels are, as a percent of sales, about half of what the rest of the industry would be. But certainly, that puts pressure because those inventories need to come down. And so you do see some pricing pressure. There's a variety of methods that they may choose to use to do that. And certainly, we continue to see that. We talked about it last year in Construction & Forestry, both on our dealer sales as well as with the independent rental business, a lot of pricing pressure. And I would certainly tell you, year-over-year, that pricing pressure has not reduced. Now we still continue to forecast, even in that environment, a 2-point price realization. That's for the enterprise, but I would tell you, both divisions are contributing to that, both Ag and Construction. And so while it's a tough environment, we continue to focus on bringing value to customers that enable us to get some of that price realization. Thank you."

And we would view, in terms of row-crop tractors, that breakdown to be more 180- to 200-horsepower and above. So when you look at the AEM data, it gets clouded, because you have our 6000 Series tractors in those numbers. You have some of our 5000 Series tractors in those numbers. And certainly, those are tied much more closely to the livestock industry. We talked about, year-over-year, seeing some strength in livestock. And so that does cloud that picture. And I would point out, those 6000 Series tractors come from Germany. And so while we talk about building to retail order, that is on large ag. So that would be our 7, 8s and 9s, and that certainly is the case on those. So I think that part of what is causing maybe some of the confusion. The other thing to keep in mind, too, is what's reported in AEM is what inventory the dealer owns at the end of the quarter -- or at the end of the month. And so you do get some distortion. Not all of that is inventory or stock at the dealer. You can have retail-sold inventory or tractors that are marked as retail-sold counted in those numbers. So from the day it ships from our factory until it's delivered to the customer, it does get reported as dealer inventory. So again, that can distort things. And I'd also caution, any time, and we've talked about this for years, to be very careful about looking at any single month. And especially, this year, you look at year-over-year comparisons through the second quarter. Remember last year, our 7000 Series tractors and 8000 Series tractors were converting to Final Tier 4. And so you had different levels of inventory as you prepared for that transition and certainly, as you came out of that transition. So it can distort the year-over-year comparison. So we would continue to tell you, from a new inventory level perspective, we're quite comfortable. In large ag, we continue to have the lowest levels in the industry, and that's not expected to change as we go through the year. Now again, that being said, as we talked about earlier, we are underproducing retail, which, we think, will help lower inventories even further as we go through the year."

So if you just sit back and think of that industry environment we are facing and what we have done with respect to new and used inventories. We are facing, as you know, the deepest downturn in North American large ag equipment industry in 25 years. And as Tony has mentioned, we've been working on our both used and new. Now on used combine volumes, our position today is less than where our used combine volumes were a year from now -- year before and 2 years before, okay? So we have confidence that we'll work down our row-crop used inventory as well. And as for the new row-crop equipment sold to the corn and soybean producers in the U.S. and Canada, we take our 7000 and 8000 Series tractors in the first half of this year. Our shipments in the U.S. and Canada came down with the decline in retail and a lot further as well. We actually under-shipped retail sales by over 20% in the first half, we have forecasted to under-shipping sales of the second half as well. So the point I'm trying to make is we are managing our inventories aggressively while at the same time, and as Tony mentioned, keeping the long term in mind. So thanks for the question."

You continue to look at options with SA&G and R&D. We've talked about when C&F went through their super trough in 2009. When you get into levels that you didn't anticipate, you tend to also find levers that you didn't necessarily anticipate. And depending on the perspective, we kept R&D pretty flat year-over-year in our outlook. And so that would be something you would continue to look at. And that, as we've said all along, that's something you balance in terms of long-term needs. That wouldn't be necessarily a desirable lever. But you would -- we would continue to look at those things that we could pull out as we go through the year. But it would -- I would also point out, if you see a large incremental drop, that creates challenges, given where our capacity -- where our facilities are at today in terms of percent of capacity utilization. And so -- but again, we certainly -- as we look at the outlook for next year, unless you're going to argue for better-than-average weather, it's hard to argue that you're going to see a significant drop in commodity prices given the strength in demand that we continue to see on commodities. So that would be one area I would make sure to remind people, so.
Okay. With that, we will conclude the call. And I think it's important maybe to step back a little bit, too, and think about the year that we're forecasting. As you look at our guidance for 2015 and put that in perspective in a historical perspective, if you look at what we're forecasting for equipment operations net sales, if you look at what we're forecasting for cash flow from operations and equipment operations as well as our EPS overall, it puts us in a top-5 year in all 3 of those categories in terms of what the -- what this guidance provides. And when you put that in context of where our largest business -- where the end markets went this year in terms of the significant drop, we think that's really demonstrating, again, the power of the overall portfolio, the strength of that SVA model and our ability to continue to drive very solid earnings even in lower-end markets.
With that, we'll be around for the rest of the day to take any additional questions you may have. Thank you for participating."

Our performance reflected the skillful execution of our operating plans and the contributions of a well-rounded business lineup.
The company's Construction & Forestry and Financial Services businesses had higher results for the quarter, while our Agriculture & Turf operations remained solidly profitable despite lower demand for large models of farm machinery.
We also saw benefits from our success holding the line on costs and assets, a fact that give our performance of resilience we have not seen in prior downturns.
Another item weighing on our results was the strong U.S. dollar. It continued to put pressure on reported sales made outside of the United States and is expected to continue doing so for the rest of the year.
Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 18% to $8.171 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $690 million. This includes a $38 million after-tax gain associated with the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business. EPS was $2.03 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 20% to $7.4 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 5 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses. Let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Sales were down 25% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Also hurting sales in the quarter was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. 
Operating profit was $639 million. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 31%, quite respectable considering the decrease in large ag sales.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts, which, in spite of softer commodity prices, remain near historically high levels, thanks to help from record livestock receipts. As a result, our 2014 forecast calls for cash receipts of about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013 and the highest level ever recorded.
Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and, consequently, the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 6%. Of note, crop receipts for 2015 are forecast to be about 23% lower than 2012's record.
On Slide 7. Global grain stocks-to-use ratios remained at somewhat sensitive levels, even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oil feed demand remain strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension could lower production, reduce stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 28 -- is on Slide 8, I'm sorry. Economic growth continues in the region, although at a slow pace. Grain prices appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average. While livestock margins remain at good levels, dairy margins are being squeezed. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets.
In China, the government continues its investment in ag equipment subsidies, but the growth rate has slowed. This as well as the continued slowdown in economic growth and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in forecast industry sales.
Turning to India. The 2015 monsoon season rainfall is expected to be below normal. That, on top of last year's relatively dry monsoon season, will result in lower overall agriculture output.
In the CIS, continued deterioration of economic growth and further tightening of credit continued to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, Western equipment manufacturers are being heavily impacted by the weak Russian currency and geopolitical uncertainties.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 11% for the year, in U.S. dollar terms, due to lower global commodity prices. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency, as the price for which farmers sell crops is set in U.S. dollars but paid in Brazilian real. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamentals remain positive for grains. On balance, though, farmer confidence in Brazil is lower as a result of economic uncertainty and political concerns in the country, leading to lower equipment purchases.
Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for ag equipment in Brazil. Eligible finance rates for ag equipment through the end of June increased 3% in April to 7.5% and 9%, depending on a farmer's revenues, with no change on the required down payment. Uncertainty over the 2015, 2016 ag budgets as well as concerns about possible further increases in interest rates are also weighing on farmer confidence.
Our 2015 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes are putting pressure on demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are positive, providing support to sales of small and mid-size tractors.
As we refine our forecast of market conditions, we now expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 25% for 2015. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter, due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as pressure on the dairy sector. 
In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 15% to 20% in 2015. The decline in our outlook is a result of economic uncertainty in Brazil, the questions surrounding government-sponsored financing noted previously and potential currency movements.
Shifting to Asia. We now expect sales to be down modestly. In the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly due to economic concerns, limited credit availability and the weak ruble.
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.
Putting these all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide of Ag and Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 24%, including about 5 points of negative currency translation. The 1-point change in the forecast from last quarter is all attributable to the impact of foreign-currency exchange. The Ag and Turf division operating margin is now forecast to be about 8%.
Before turning to Construction & Forestry, let's take a look at our all-new 8000 series self-propelled forage harvester on Slide 14. After 20 years of incremental changes to our SPFH product line, it represents a complete update with a total of 5,500 new part numbers. The new machine addresses the needs of livestock and dairy customers as well as biogas producers for higher efficiency and productivity. It offers innovative features such as field guidance, products and smart unloading systems as well as a new cab, which combine to increase performance and uptime and decrease the cost of ownership while adding comfort for the operator.
Earlier this year, the 8000 series won the 2015 forage harvester machine of the year at SIMA, the Paris international agribusiness show. The 8000 Series forage harvester added to our lineup of self-propelled windrowers and our recent entry into the large square baler business better positions Deere within the hay and forage markets.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 15. Net sales were up 2% in the quarter and operating profit was up 43%. The division's incremental margin was about 173%.
Moving to Slide 16. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide, the economy continues to move forward. GDP growth is improving, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. In contrast, we are seeing weakening conditions in the energy sector and energy-producing regions. Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be up about 2% in 2015. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 3 points. The change in our forecast from last quarter is due to lower sales outside the U.S. and Canada as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange.
Global forestry markets are expected to be about flat on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014. C&F full year operating margin is projected to be about 11%.
Before moving to Financial Services, the first Deere-designed and -built production-class dozer is shown on Slide 17. The model 1050K is the largest crawler dozer John Deere has ever produced and is part of our growing production-class equipment portfolio. It was introduced earlier this year for mass earthmoving and quarry operations. Its dual-path hydrostatic transmission, a unique feature to this size class, provides better fuel economy and maneuverability. Other improvements include a higher power-to-weight ratio, which provides more pushing power and more turning power with full loads.
In addition, the 1050K crawler is equipped with John Deere worksite telematics to allow technicians to connect to the machines wirelessly, reducing the repair cycle times, the overall cost of repair and customer downtime.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 18 shows that the Financial Services annualized provision for credit losses as a percent of the average owned portfolio was 8 basis points at the end of April. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 14 basis points versus 9 basis points in 2014. The year-over-year increase is a reflection of the unsustainably low loss levels of the last 4 years. For reference, the 10-year average is 26 basis points and the 15-year average is 43 points.
Moving to Slide 19. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $170 million in the second quarter versus $148 million last year. Net proceeds from the sale of the crop insurance business benefited the division's second quarter income by about $27 million after tax. Earlier, I mentioned a $38 million enterprise gain on the sale. The difference is largely due to the enterprise utilization of capital loss carryforwards not originating at the Financial Services division level. 2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company is forecast at about $630 million, no change from our previous forecast.
Slide 20 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.6 billion. That was equal to 31.4% of prior 12-month sales compared with 32.1% a year ago. The decrease, which came entirely from Ag and Turf, is reflective of the aggressive way we have cut production in line with our 2015 outlook. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $600 million. The decrease in the Ag division from prior guidance is due to reductions outside the United States and Canada and foreign currency exchange.
Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 21, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price realization of about 2 points, favorable raw material costs and unfavorable mix of product, and Tier 4 product costs.
Looking at R&D expense on Slide 22. R&D was down about 4% in the second quarter, including about 3 points of negative currency translation. Our 2015 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 1% for the full year, including about 3 points of negative currency translation. The forecast reflects higher R&D spending in the second half of the year, which is the typical pattern.
Moving now to Slide 23. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down about 14% in the second quarter, including about 4 points of currency translation. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 11%, with Landscapes, Water and currency accounting for about 6 points of the change. Similar to the situation with R&D spending, SA&G expense is forecast to be higher in the second half of the year.
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was up about $15 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $70 million in 2015.
On Slide 25. The equipment operations tax rate was approximately 30% in the quarter, primarily due to mix of income and discrete items. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.4 billion in 2015.
The company's third quarter financial outlook is on Slide 27. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 17% compared with 2014. This includes about 2 points of price realization, with unfavorable currency translation of about 6 points.
Turning to Slide 28 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 19%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 2 points. Currency translation is negative, about 4 points. Finally, despite strong currency headwinds, our full year 2015 net income forecast is now about $1.9 billion, an increase from our previous guidance.
In closing, John Deere expects to be solidly profitable in 2015. In fact, the year is forecast to rank among our stronger ones in sales and profits, even with the pullback we're experiencing in the farm sector. Such an achievement says a lot about the progress we've made establishing a wider range of revenue sources and a more durable business model. All in all, we remain confident in the company's present direction and in its ability to meet customer needs for advanced machinery and services in the future.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

And certainly, there's a lot of conversation about used equipment levels as well. And we would tell you, if you look at large ag in total, certainly, we feel -- I mean, we're always concerned about used equipment. If you ask us, are we more concerned today than we were 3 months ago or 6 months ago? The answer would be no. We continue to be very focused on that. We believe we're materially in a better position than our competition. But we're really focusing on lowering those used inventory levels, but also protecting resale values as we do that. So we believe we're on the right path. We are -- feel pretty good about the direction we're heading with used equipment, but certainly we have a lot of work ahead of us in terms of continuing to pull that down."

And as you know, we don't disclose specific guidance in terms of dollar impact from raw materials. A couple of years ago now, we'd switched and started providing guidance on overall cost of sales. But certainly, that has been a benefit in the first half of the year. I would tell you, if you look at the second half of the year, certainly, for Ag and Turf but really on the overall business, it's slightly less benefit in the back half of the year. Now before anyone gets too excited about that, we -- it's not that we're implying that steel costs and other commodity costs necessarily go up. If you think about the timing of our general purchases and our production on any year, we tend to build inventory in the first half of the year, sequentially, and then it comes down in the back half. So you tend to get the benefit earlier in the year in some of those material costs. So continued benefit from material cost year-over-year. But if you're looking first half, second half, there is actually a slight difference -- slightly lower benefit in the back half in our applied guidance. So okay. Thank you."

So as you look at receivables and inventory for -- and specifically, we'll start with Ag and Turf. If you look at the change in the forecast from last quarter to this quarter, I would tell you, it really -- it does not relate to the U.S. and Canada. It relates to receivables and -- it's both receivables and inventory outside of the U.S. and Canada as well as some FX impact quarter-over-quarter, but it's mostly about those receivables outside of the U.S. and Canada. But it's implied already, and not to be forgotten that we pulled a lot of receivables and inventory out in 2014 as we ended the year. And certainly, in our initial -- in our original budget guidance, we had a pretty healthy level of receivables and inventory continuing to come out on Ag and Turf as we seek to underproduce the retail environment through the years. So we have underproduced year-to-date, and we would continue, especially as we go into the back of the year. We'll be underproducing the retail environment and continuing to bring those field inventories down, both on new as well as providing some additional support that way for our dealers on used equipment. When you think about C&F, remember, we talked about that early on. Much of that increase -- and some of that is because of higher sales, of course. I don't want to imply there isn't any increase in field inventory, but much of that has to do with the change in some of the terms, and we think that will drive some higher levels of receivables. And really, the reduction you saw in the quarter had more to do with a refinement of what we think that impact will be from those term changes versus, really, any kind of significant expectation in terms of a change in actual field inventories. So that's really what's driving most of that as we look towards the end of the year."

And actually, I think, if you look at the U.S. and Canada markets, for example, and I think it really implies the overall commodity markets in general. If you talk to our chief economist, he would say, we're really in kind of a year-to-year type of mode right now. And as frustrating as it may be for people to hear, it really is about what happens this summer with the current crop that's in the ground. If you're going to assume another year of better-than-average weather where yields are above trend yields, then certainly, it's going to be a challenging argument to make that 2016 would certainly improve, really, anywhere in -- around the globe. But if you look back at what would the implications be of trend yields or a little less-than-ideal weather or average weather and you see below-trend yields, then that story changes pretty dramatically, because we would argue that you're not -- while you certainly have ample supply of commodities and you're seeing that reflected in commodity prices, there isn't a glut of commodities either. And so if you underproduce demand going into -- through the 2015 crop and going into 2016, we believe prices would be very responsive to that, and as cash receipts would recover in that type of environment, you would see sales begin to recover as well. So that's -- it's close to -- and I just can't pinpoint a certain geography specifically, but I would say that's probably a pretty consistent global statement that we would make. So, okay?"

Certainly, combines, at this point in the year, with the early order program, we're well over 90% covered. And the bigger question tends to be things like large tractors. If you think about 7000 Series tractors today, we would be -- really, 7s, 8s and 9s for this year, we're out into early October in terms of availability. And these are the wheel tractors, not track tractors. So across the board, on wheel tractors would be early October. Last year, on 7s, that would have been late August. 8s would have also been early October, so consistent. And on 9s, it would have been mid-June in terms of availability.

Certainly, you're right. We are seeing a move towards more leasing. We think some of that has to do with -- given some of the lower margins customers are facing and as well as -- so again, the -- when you purchase the equipment, you tend to get better advantage from a tax-deduction perspective. So as margins are a bit lower, that isn't as attractive always. But then, there's also questions around Section 179 and bonus depreciation. Will we really have that or not? And so we think that's factoring in to some of those decisions in terms of a move towards leasing. Really, as we look at it, the key here is making sure that residuals -- and I think, as you implied, making sure that residuals are valued properly. And that tends to be what we focus on. As you know, we tend to be relatively conservative on the setting of residual values. We continue to do that today. We certainly reevaluate those on a regular basis. We haven't had any kind of write-downs or accruals that we've had to make against the residual values of that leasing portfolio. But that's really where the risk is, is it does move some risk to the Financial Services organization in the sense of, if residuals would drop dramatically as they come off of lease, that could create some challenges there. A couple of things I would point out, though, related to that is, one, while it's increasing, it's still a relatively small part of our total portfolio. So just to keep that in perspective. And the other thing is, and it's one of the reasons why it's so important for us as we manage used inventories in general, to make sure we're protective of the -- of pricing on that used equipment. Not only does it help the value of that used equipment. So it helps, certainly, our dealers, and so it's supportive there, but it's also supportive of the Financial Services organization in the sense of making sure we're protecting those residual values as we go through this downturn and as we continue to focus on moving those used equipment levels lower. So it is a balancing act in terms of looking to reduce those and still being protective of those values. So anyway, thank you."

While in U.S. dollars, certainly, it's down if you consider the impact of currency, because remember, Brazilian farmers sell in U.S. dollars, and then convert back to local currency. So their cash receipts in local currency and their margins, because most of their inputs were purchased in local currency and to the extent that they were purchased in U.S. dollars, it would have been before the currency shifted last fall. And so when you look at margins on the crop that was recently harvested, they're pretty attractive levels, which is in stark contrast to the outlook. Really, what we're seeing in our outlook is, in our view, a concern around the general economy. In Brazil, some of the -- you're seeing that in some of the increased rates of FINAME financing. So I would tell you, much of that is going to be dependent on what happens as we move forward with that Brazilian economy. There's still some questions. You'll note, our slides end in June in terms of what the FINAME financing rates are because they haven't been announced beyond that. So we'll be hearing, hopefully, in early June, is the expectation now, not just what the FINAME financing rates will be for both PSI and Moderfrota, but also what down payment levels they're going to require. Will they keep Moderfrota at the 10%? And as importantly, what's the overall budget? Will they change that overall budget? And then, we'll have a much better feel for what happens as we move forward with Brazil, at least in the short term. But again, I'd remind you, this is about a short -- the cycle. Longer term, we continue to believe that we have great opportunity in Brazil as agricultural output continues to grow, as acreage continues to grow and certainly, as our market share continues to grow.

But the overall market continues to be fairly attractive in terms of what we saw at the beginning of the year as well. Again, as a reminder, coming off of a very strong 2014. So as you see those growth rates slow as we go into the back half the year, remember, we move into much tougher compares in that division. But when you look at markets like Brazil, and I just mentioned that in my last commentary on the ag sector. And I would say, certainly, the overall business there is down significantly. While we have our new facilities and we continue to look for market share increases in Brazil as we go through 2015, those market share increases just are not going to offset the impact of the overall reduction in the industry. And so again, those are some of the -- it's probably the major reduction quarter-over-quarter is what our expectation is in Brazil. But a variety of overseas locations really have weakened, in our view, over the quarter. So that's primarily what's driving that difference."

We would continue to say on large ag equipment that our inventory levels are, as a percent of sales, about half of what the rest of the industry would be. But certainly, that puts pressure because those inventories need to come down. And so you do see some pricing pressure. There's a variety of methods that they may choose to use to do that. And certainly, we continue to see that. We talked about it last year in Construction & Forestry, both on our dealer sales as well as with the independent rental business, a lot of pricing pressure.

And we would view, in terms of row-crop tractors, that breakdown to be more 180- to 200-horsepower and above. So when you look at the AEM data, it gets clouded, because you have our 6000 Series tractors in those numbers. You have some of our 5000 Series tractors in those numbers. And certainly, those are tied much more closely to the livestock industry. We talked about, year-over-year, seeing some strength in livestock. And so that does cloud that picture. And I would point out, those 6000 Series tractors come from Germany. And so while we talk about building to retail order, that is on large ag. So that would be our 7, 8s and 9s, and that certainly is the case on those. So I think that part of what is causing maybe some of the confusion. The other thing to keep in mind, too, is what's reported in AEM is what inventory the dealer owns at the end of the quarter -- or at the end of the month. And so you do get some distortion. Not all of that is inventory or stock at the dealer. You can have retail-sold inventory or tractors that are marked as retail-sold counted in those numbers. So from the day it ships from our factory until it's delivered to the customer, it does get reported as dealer inventory. So again, that can distort things. And I'd also caution, any time, and we've talked about this for years, to be very careful about looking at any single month. And especially, this year, you look at year-over-year comparisons through the second quarter. Remember last year, our 7000 Series tractors and 8000 Series tractors were converting to Final Tier 4. And so you had different levels of inventory as you prepared for that transition and certainly, as you came out of that transition. So it can distort the year-over-year comparison. So we would continue to tell you, from a new inventory level perspective, we're quite comfortable. In large ag, we continue to have the lowest levels in the industry, and that's not expected to change as we go through the year. Now again, that being said, as we talked about earlier, we are underproducing retail, which, we think, will help lower inventories even further as we go through the year."

So we have confidence that we'll work down our row-crop used inventory as well. And as for the new row-crop equipment sold to the corn and soybean producers in the U.S. and Canada, we take our 7000 and 8000 Series tractors in the first half of this year. Our shipments in the U.S. and Canada came down with the decline in retail and a lot further as well. We actually under-shipped retail sales by over 20% in the first half, we have forecasted to under-shipping sales of the second half as well.

We would tell you that, certainly, from a retail sales perspective, things are moving forward as we would expect. We continue to take market share. I mean it's showing, I think, even in the shipment numbers that, certainly, from a retail sales perspective, our market shares continue to grow in Brazil, especially on tractors. And so we feel pretty comfortable with where we're at on inventories and -- as well as the retail sales from a market share perspective in Brazil. Okay? Thank you."

You continue to look at options with SA&G and R&D. We've talked about when C&F went through their super trough in 2009. When you get into levels that you didn't anticipate, you tend to also find levers that you didn't necessarily anticipate. And depending on the perspective, we kept R&D pretty flat year-over-year in our outlook. And so that would be something you would continue to look at. And that, as we've said all along, that's something you balance in terms of long-term needs. That wouldn't be necessarily a desirable lever. But you would -- we would continue to look at those things that we could pull out as we go through the year. But it would -- I would also point out, if you see a large incremental drop, that creates challenges, given where our capacity -- where our facilities are at today in terms of percent of capacity utilization. And so -- but again, we certainly -- as we look at the outlook for next year, unless you're going to argue for better-than-average weather, it's hard to argue that you're going to see a significant drop in commodity prices given the strength in demand that we continue to see on commodities. So that would be one area I would make sure to remind people, so.
Okay. With that, we will conclude the call. And I think it's important maybe to step back a little bit, too, and think about the year that we're forecasting. As you look at our guidance for 2015 and put that in perspective in a historical perspective, if you look at what we're forecasting for equipment operations net sales, if you look at what we're forecasting for cash flow from operations and equipment operations as well as our EPS overall, it puts us in a top-5 year in all 3 of those categories in terms of what the -- what this guidance provides. And when you put that in context of where our largest business -- where the end markets went this year in terms of the significant drop, we think that's really demonstrating, again, the power of the overall portfolio, the strength of that SVA model and our ability to continue to drive very solid earnings even in lower-end markets.
With that, we'll be around for the rest of the day to take any additional questions you may have. Thank you for participating."

Deere's results reflected the sound execution of our operating plans and the success of efforts to manage costs. Although results were lower than in the same quarter a year ago, all of our businesses remained solidly profitable. As a result, the company continues to be well positioned to meet the needs of customers while funding its growth plans and returning cash to stockholders.
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 20% to $7.594 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $512 million. EPS was $1.53 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 22% to $6.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 6 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volume of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Also hurting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange.
Operating profit was $472 million. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volume, a less favorable product mix and foreign exchange, partially offset by price realization and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 28%, quite respectable considering the decrease in large ag sales.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Our 2014 forecast calls for cash receipts of about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013 and the highest level ever recorded. Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 7%.  Looking ahead to next year, based on our expectation of above trend line yields for 2015 and declining livestock prices, our very early forecast calls for total cash receipts to be down slightly in 2016.
On Slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension could disrupt trade, lower production, reduce the stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Gradual economic growth continues in the region. While grain prices appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average, the dairy sector remains under pressure. As a result, farmer demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year. I should mention, we are encouraged by some early indications that this market may be in the early stages of recovery.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, the government's continued investment in equipment subsidies and mechanization are supportive of agriculture. However, the economic slowdown and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in forecast industry sales.
Turning to India. Positive consumer and investor sentiment are encouraging economic growth. While the government continues to support agriculture, 2 consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons are hurting the farm sector.
In the CIS, continued deterioration of economic growth and further tightening of credit continue to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, Western equipment manufacturers are being heavily affected by the weak Russian currency and geopolitical uncertainties.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 11% for the year in U.S. dollar terms, due to lower global commodity prices. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency, up about 10%. Brazilian farmers sell their crops in dollars. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamentals remain positive for grains. Our early forecast calls for the value of production to be down slightly in 2016.
Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for ag equipment in Brazil. The 2015, 2016 ag budget affirmed eligible finance rates for ag equipment are 7.5% and 9% through the end of June 2016, depending on the farmers' revenues, with no change on the required downpayment. Fill rates have increased, they are not considerably higher than they were in 2011, which was a banner year for industry sales in Brazil, and they remain below current market rate of about 14%. Nonetheless, farmer confidence is lower as a result of these rising interest rates, economic uncertainty and political concerns, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. Still, long-term fundamentals for the ag business in Brazil are solid.
Our 2015 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm income are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are more positive, providing support to sales of small and midsize tractors. 
We continue to expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 25% for 2015. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter due to lower crop prices and farm income as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 20% to 25% in 2015, a reflection of the factors already discussed.
Shifting to Asia. We now expect sales to be down moderately, with most of the decline in India and China. In the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly due to limited credit availability, the weak ruble and overall economic concerns. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.
Putting this all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide Ag and Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 25%, including about 5 points of negative currency translation. Our forecast for the Ag and Turf division's operating margin continues to be approximately 8%.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were down 13% in the quarter, and operating profit was down 34% due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency. The division's decremental margin was 29%.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging economic indicators and positive dealer and customer sentiment, we are seeing weakening in our order book. 
Some contributing factors to the slowdown in demand are the conditions in the energy sector and energy-producing regions, wet weather that slowed construction activity this spring and summer, the decline in rental utilization rates and sluggish economic growth outside the United States. As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 5% in 2015. 
Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 3 points. Global forestry markets are now expected to be flat to up 5% on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014 as gains in the U.S. and Europe are offset by declines in other regions of the world. C&F full year operating margin is now projected to be about 10%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows that annualized provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio was 12 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 13 basis points versus 9 basis points in 2014. The increase is a reflection of unsustainably low loss levels of the last 4 years. It remains well below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and the 15-year average of 43 points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $153 million in the third quarter versus $162 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, partially offset by lower selling administrative and general expenses. The division's forecast net income attributable to Deere & Company remains at about $630 million for the year.
Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.5 billion. That's equal to 30.6% of prior 12-month sales compared with 29.8% a year ago. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $350 million. With this decrease, forecasts that come entirely from Ag and Turf, the division will have reduced receivables and inventory by almost $2 billion over the last 2 years. At constant exchange rates, the 2-year decline is about $1.4 billion.
Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 19, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price realization of about 1 point, favorable raw material costs and unfavorable mix of product and Tier 4 product costs.
With respect to R&D expense on Slide 20, R&D was down 4% in the third quarter, including 4 points of negative currency translation, so essentially flat on a constant exchange basis. Our 2015 forecast now calls for R&D to be down about 2% for the full year, including about 3 points of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 21. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 7% in the third quarter, including 5 points of currency translation. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 11%, with landscapes, water, incentive compensation and currency accounting for about 9 points of the change.
Turning to Slide 22. Pension and OPEB expense was up $25 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $70 million in 2015.
On Slide 23, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 24 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.2 billion in 2015.
The company's fourth quarter financial outlook is on Slide 25. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 24% compared with 2014. This includes about 1 point of price realization, with unfavorable currency translation of about 5 points.
Turning to Slide 26 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 21%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point, with negative currency translation of about 4 points. Finally, our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.8 billion for the full year.
As a closing thought, John Deere is well on its way to another good year and doing so in the face of some pretty significant headwinds. Our performance highlights our success, establishing a wider range of revenue sources and a more durable business model. As a result, the company is showing great resilience and discipline and performing much better than in previous farm downturns.
Longer term, we believe our steady investment in new products and geographies will make Deere the provider of choice for a growing global customer base.

We continue to evaluate that, of course, as we go through the year and see various changes in the market. Used equipment continues to be a challenge. We are making good progress on used equipment. As you look at some of the factors from a large ag perspective, we are down about 10% year-over-year in July in terms of where we're at with used inventory. Pricing is holding in okay. If you look at it kind of from a 2-year average, we would be slightly below that. We believe we continue to maintain a healthy premium versus our competition.

Now having said that, so I just want to make sure I have that clearly out front, but directionally, what we're seeing is order activity on the early order programs are off year-over-year. And just to be clear, what we're talking about is planter sprayers and tillage. A lot of people have questions around combine early order programs. I'm guessing that remember those just started up in early August. And candidly, it's just too early to make any type of conclusions related to where that program is. One of the challenges we do have also as you think about the spring season early order program in where we would think that perhaps in this current environment where they may not be as close of a correlation to overall are good of an indicator of overall demand going into next year, is the fact that they do have a much higher level of stock component versus retail orders in those spring seasonal order programs. And again, given the dynamics in the market, they're candidly not as much pressure to put orders in at this particular point. And we really believe the combine early order program, as that continues to develop, will be a better indicator of actual demand. And again, I want to be clear, I'm not trying to the issue.

And as you'll recall, there were some changes in 2015 related to wholesale terms, which we believe was going to drive some higher level of receivables, and that has been the case. So that's part of what's driving that. Now as you look at the underlying forecast for receivables and inventory, it looks like there was just a slight reduction. Actually, what's underlying there is more of a reduction in receivables so field inventory, with some offsetting increase in inventory, so Deere company-owned inventories. And again, some of that has to do with Final Tier 4 transitions and plans along that way as well as recognizing this has been a pretty rapid change in the business environment. There is about a 7-point change in our sales outlook. I'm sorry -- apparently, I said a decrease in receivables. There's an increase in receivables -- no-no, a decrease in the forecasted receivable -- in the level of forecast. So again, we're still -- just to be clear, we're still forecasting an increase in receivables, but it's less of an increase versus our prior guidance.

El Niño actually strengthened through the summer, and that certainly bodes well normally for the U.S. market or growing areas.

So you'd be around 32% for equipment up is roughly what's implied there. But keep in mind, you also have a fourth quarter where we're forecasting the largest reduction in terms of year-over-year sales on a percentage basis at 24% reduction. And so the next close this quarter would have been first quarter where our decrementals were 35%. So again, I would argue sequentially would be a little higher decremental but still very good performance and especially relative to what we saw in the first quarter would be very strong. There was a hint at the UAW contract, we will begin negotiations later this month to officially kick those off. Beyond that, as agreed on with the UAW, we really just have no comment related to that and we'll have to leave that there."

We are hearing -- again as Susan pointed out in her comments when you think about C&F, there is a little bit of that dichotomy because we talk to our contractors, our dealers, the sentiment is generally, fairly positive, especially outside of those energy impacted areas. The underlying fundamentals that we would normally point to are actually fairly positive year-over-year. We're just seeing a softness in orders. Certainly, energy is weaker year-over-year. You're hearing some either commentary about some of the independent rental companies, for example, shifting inventory out of those areas that are more energy dependent into the rest of the country. And that in fairly large sizes, some large options and in places like Western Canada in more recent months. So those sorts of things can have some impact. So again, we'll see as we move forward where this market ends up going. But both in current year as well as if you look out into 2016, most of the indications from a general economic perspective would be relatively positive. But again, as I started to say, our dealers respond quickly with our order fulfillment process and the ability for them to replenish equipment very rapidly. They tend to when there's uncertainty. They tend to pull back quickly and adjust their inventories very rapidly, which is exactly what we would hope to see.

But clearly, as we talk about longer term from intelligence and machinery, that's a key focus that we continue to have, especially around machine and job optimization function. From an R&D perspective, I think we've talked about it as well. Certainly increasing the amount that we're spending in that area today. What we spend on intelligence would be comparable to the type of R&D we would have on things like large tractors or combines. So it is certainly right up in parity with that. And again, just reflects the importance that we see of intelligence as we move forward. And we think we have a great opportunity to continue to provide efficiency to our customers through intelligence and believe that'll be a way that we continue to differentiate as we move forward."

I want to be clear, we are not trying to signal down 10% for next year on all product lines. It's just an example, and we similarly use that really to reflect the fact that as we underproduced this year, you don't need an increase in end markets, retail sales and necessarily see an increase in Deere sales. But clearly, as you look at the early order programs, I want to be clear there as well. We're down year-over-year. We're not talking about seeing the type of magnitude of decrease that we saw last year, but certainly down directionally is what we're seeing in those early order programs at this point. So in that regard, we certainly have underproduced this year from a new inventory perspective. Certainly, we feel like -- our inventories will be in good shape. But as I mentioned earlier in the call, we will have some additional challenges to work through next year on used equipment, especially as it relates to large tractors.

Deere's results reflected the sound execution of our operating plans and the success of efforts to manage costs. Although results were lower than in the same quarter a year ago, all of our businesses remained solidly profitable. As a result, the company continues to be well positioned to meet the needs of customers while funding its growth plans and returning cash to stockholders.
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 20% to $7.594 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $512 million. EPS was $1.53 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 22% to $6.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 6 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volume of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Also hurting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange.
Operating profit was $472 million. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volume, a less favorable product mix and foreign exchange, partially offset by price realization and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 28%, quite respectable considering the decrease in large ag sales.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Our 2014 forecast calls for cash receipts of about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013 and the highest level ever recorded. Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 7%. Looking ahead to next year, based on our expectation of above trend yield -- above trend line yields for 2015 and declining livestock prices, our very early forecast calls for total cash receipts to be down slightly in 2016.
On Slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive level even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension could disrupt trade, lower production, reduce the stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Gradual economic growth continues in the region. While grain prices appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average, the dairy sector remains under pressure. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year. I should mention, we are encouraged by some early indications that this market may be in the early stages of recovery.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, the government's continued investment in equipment subsidies and mechanization are supportive of agriculture. However, the economic slowdown and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in forecast industry sales.
Turning to India. Positive consumer and investor sentiment are encouraging economic growth. While the government continues to support agriculture, 2 consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons are hurting the farm sector.
In the CIS, continued deterioration of economic growth and further tightening of credit continue to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, Western equipment manufacturers are being heavily affected by the weak Russian currency and geopolitical uncertainties.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 11% for the year in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency, up about 10%. That's because Brazilian farmers sell their crops in dollars. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamentals remained positive for grains. Our early forecast calls for the value of production to be down slightly in 2016.
Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for ag equipment in Brazil. The 2015, 2016 ag budget affirmed eligible finance rates for ag equipment are 7.5% and 9% through the end of June 2016, depending on the farmers' revenues, with no change on the required down payment. Though rates have increased, they are not considerably higher than they were in 2011, which was a banner year for industry sales in Brazil, and they remain below current market rate of about 14%. Nonetheless, farmer confidence is lower as a result of these rising interest rates, economic uncertainty and political concerns, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. Still, long-term fundamentals for the ag business in Brazil are solid.
Our 2015 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm income are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are more positive, providing support to sales of small and midsized tractors. 
We continue to expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 25% for 2015. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter due to lower crop prices and farm income as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 20% to 25% in 2015, a reflection of the factors already discussed.
Shifting to Asia. We now expect sales to be down moderately, with most of the decline in India and China. In the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly due to limited credit availability, the weak ruble and overall economic concerns. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.
Putting this all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide Ag and Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 25%, including about 5 points of negative currency translation. Our forecast for the Ag and Turf division's operating margin continues to be approximately 8%.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were down 13% in the quarter, and operating profit was down 34% due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency. The division's decremental margin was 29%.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide: GDP growth is positive, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging economic indicators and positive dealer and customer sentiment, we are seeing weakening in our order books. 
Some contributing factors to the slowdown in demand are the conditions in the energy sector and energy-producing regions, wet weather that slowed construction activity this spring and summer, the decline in rental utilization rates and sluggish economic growth outside the United States. As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 5% in 2015. 
Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 3 points. Global forestry markets are now expected to be flat to up 5% on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014 as gains in the U.S. and Europe are offset by declines in other regions of the world. C&F full year operating margin is now projected to be about 10%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows that annualized provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio was 12 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 13 basis points versus 9 basis points in 2014. The increase is a reflection of unsustainably low loss levels of the last 4 years. It remains well below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and the 15-year average of 43 points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $153 million in the third quarter versus $162 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The division's forecast net income attributable to Deere & Company remains at about $630 million for the year.
Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.5 billion. That's equal to 30.6% of prior 12-month sales compared with 29.8% a year ago. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $350 million. With this decrease, forecasts that come entirely from Ag and Turf, the division will have reduced receivables and inventory by almost $2 billion over the last 2 years. At constant exchange rates, the 2-year decline is about $1.4 billion.
Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 19, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price realization of about 1 point, favorable raw material costs and unfavorable mix of product and Tier 4 product costs.
With respect to R&D expense on Slide 20, R&D was down 4% in the third quarter, including 4 points of negative currency translation. So essentially flat on a constant exchange basis. Our 2015 forecast now calls for R&D to be down about 2% for the full year, including about 3 points of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 21. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 7% in the third quarter, including 5 points of currency translation. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 11%, with landscapes, water, incentive compensation and currency accounting for about 9 points of the change.
Turning to Slide 22. Pension and OPEB expense was up $25 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $70 million in 2015.
On Slide 23, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 24 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.2 billion in 2015.
The company's fourth quarter financial outlook is on Slide 25. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 24% compared with 2014. This includes about 1 point of price realization with unfavorable currency translation of about 5 points.
Turning to Slide 26 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 21%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point, with negative currency translation of about 4 points. Finally, our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.8 billion for the full year.
As a closing thought, John Deere is well on its way to another good year and doing so in the face of some pretty significant headwinds. Our performance highlights our success, establishing a wider range of revenue sources and a more durable business model. As a result, the company is showing great resilience and discipline and performing much better than in previous farm downturns.
Longer term, we believe our steady investment in new products and geographies will make Deere the provider of choice for a growing global customer base. What's more, we believe the impact of these actions will become increasingly clear as the end markets for our products start moving ahead. These are just some of the reasons we have confidence in the company's present course and in our ability to deliver significant value to customers and investors well into the future.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

As you think about new inventory, and I would say the similar situation of what we've talked about in the past in the sense that we continue to have new inventory well below the competitors. We tend to have a 50% or less as you look at inventory as a percent of sales and that continues to be the case. We continue to evaluate that, of course, as we go through the year and see various changes in the market. Used equipment continues to be a challenge. We are making good progress on used equipment. As you look at some of the factors from a large ag perspective, we are down about 10% year-over-year in July in terms of where we're at with used inventory. Pricing is holding in okay. If you look at it kind of from a 2-year average, we would be slightly below that. But I believe we continue to maintain a healthy premium versus our competition. And again, we are making progress, but it's likely we would expect these efforts will continue into 2016. We continue to coordinate with our dealers to assist with the movement of the used equipment, but it is still, especially on large tractors, continues to be a challenge that we're working on within the market."

As you know, we have various phases of the early order programs. And the closing of the first phase is a bit different year-over-year. Now having said that, so I just want to make sure I have that clearly out front, but directionally, what we're seeing is order activity on those early order programs are off year-over-year. And just to be clear, what we're talking about is planter, sprayers and tillage. A lot of people will have questions around combine early order programs. I'm guessing that remember those just started up in early August. And candidly, it's just too early to make any type of conclusions related to where that program is. One of the challenges we do have also as you think about the spring seasonal early order program in where we would think that perhaps in this current environment, where they may not be as close of a correlation to overall is good of an indicator of overall demand going into next year, is the fact that they do have a much higher level of stock component versus retail orders in those spring seasonal order programs. And again, given the dynamics in the market, there are candidly not as much pressure to put orders in at this particular point. And we really believe the combine early order program, as that continues to develop, will be a better indicator of actual demand. And again, I want to be clear, I'm not trying to skirt the issue. Certainly, we are seeing in those early order programs orders being off year-over-year, which historically would indicate some additional weakening as they move into 2016."

And as you'll recall, there were some changes in 2015 related to wholesale terms, which we believe was going to drive some higher level of receivables, and that has been the case. So that's part of what's driving that. Now as you look at the underlying forecast for receivables and inventory, it looks like there was just a slight reduction. Actually, what's underlying there is more of a reduction in receivables, so field inventory, with some offsetting increase in inventory, so Deere -- company-owned inventories. And again, some of that has to do with Final Tier 4 transitions and plans along that way as well as recognizing this has been a pretty rapid change in the business environment. There is about a 7-point change in our sales outlook. I'm sorry, I said -- apparently, I said a decrease in receivables. There's an increase in receivables -- no-no, a decrease in the forecasted receivable -- in the level of forecast. So again, we're still -- just to be clear, we're still forecasting an increase in receivables, but it's less of an increase versus our prior guidance. And inventory is a little higher than in our prior guidance. And again, a combination of Final Tier 4 and as well as just the rapid change in that business environment from an inventory perspective."

But certainly, as you look at other parts of the world, we'll see what happens with the growing conditions in Brazil as we move forward. They're heading towards planting season now, and we'll see what factors might be driven there. Keep in mind as we go into 2016, we did have some favorable weather conditions. El Niño actually strengthened through the summer, and that certainly bodes well normally for the U.S. market or growing areas. But keep in mind, that can have some more negative and dry impact on other parts of the world. So as you think about weather, there are a number of regions of the world that we would be point kind of on a watch list, if you will, of what impact El Niño may have. When you think about Southeast Asia, India, Australia, even Brazil and Argentina quite often, that can drive some very wet spring, summer type of weather, which a little bit of extra moisture is good in some cases, but if it's excessive, obviously, that can have some negative ramifications as well. So we'll see how things develop as we move forward for the rest of the world. But certainly, we did have a very good summer here in the U.S. from a weather perspective, at least in aggregate.

I mean, maybe it's a positive story, maybe there's cushion on the net income number and you think the segments of these numbers, and that's great. So I'm not taking a bullish or bearish comment here. I'm just trying to make sure I understand because that math doesn't make sense. It can wildly swing the C&F margin for the fourth quarter, and thus, influence people's thoughts on how they model C&F into '16.

We are hearing -- and again, as Susan pointed out in her comments, when you think about C&F, there is a little bit of dichotomy because when you talk to our contractors, our dealers, the sentiment is generally, fairly positive, especially outside of those energy impacted areas. The underlying fundamentals that we would normally point to are actually fairly positive year-over-year. We're just seeing a softness in orders. Certainly, energy is weaker year-over-year. You're hearing some either commentary about some of the independent rental companies, for example, shifting inventory out of those areas that are more energy dependent into the rest of the country, and that's in fairly large sizes. Some large auctions and in places like Western Canada in more recent months. So those sorts of things can have some impact. So again, we'll see as we move forward where this market ends up going. But both in current year as well as if you look out into 2016, most of the indications from a general economic perspective would be relatively positive. But again, as I started to say, our dealers respond quickly with our order fulfillment process and the ability for them to replenish equipment very rapidly. They tend to when there's uncertainty. They tend to pull back quickly and adjust their inventories very rapidly, which is exactly what we would hope to see. And that's really what we've seen in the quarter as well is those dealers making those adjustments quickly."

Of course, there is always risk that, that can change. And again, the funding that was announced is, we believe, at a very appropriate level for the business. So that's one positive aspect. But I think FX creates certainly uncertainty in the environment. Farmers, there have benefited from the weakening of the real in this year. As they sell their crops in U.S. dollars and they convert that back, it's actually kept their cash receipts and margins pretty favorable. But there's always the risk of when does that change and move back the other direction. So there's uncertainty there. And more importantly, just around the general economy and that doesn't seem to be seeing much stabilization at this point. I'd argue that's probably the biggest risk as we move next year."

I want to be clear, we are not trying to signal down 10% for next year on all product lines. That's just an example, and we similarly use that really to reflect the fact that as we underproduce this year, you don't need an increase in end markets, retail sales and necessarily see an increase in Deere sales. But clearly, as you look at the early order programs, I want to be clear there as well. We're down year-over-year. We're not talking about seeing the type of magnitude of decrease that we saw last year, but certainly down directionally is what we're seeing in those early order programs at this point. So in that regard, we certainly have underproduced this year from a new inventory perspective. Certainly, we feel like -- our inventories will be in good shape, but as I mentioned earlier in the call, we will have some additional challenges to work through next year on used equipment, especially as it relates to large tractors.

Deere's results reflected the sound execution of our operating plans and the success of efforts to manage costs. Although results were lower than in the same quarter a year ago, all of our businesses remained solidly profitable. As a result, the company continues to be well positioned to meet the needs of customers while funding its growth plans and returning cash to stockholders.
Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 20% to $7.594 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $512 million. EPS was $1.53 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 22% to $6.8 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 2 points. Currency translation was negative by 6 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 24% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volume of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Also hurting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange.
Operating profit was $472 million. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volume, a less favorable product mix and foreign exchange, partially offset by price realization and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 28%, quite respectable considering the decrease in large ag sales.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Our 2014 forecast calls for cash receipts of about $418 billion, up about 1% from 2013 and the highest level ever recorded. Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 7%. Looking ahead to next year, based on our expectation of above trend yield -- above trend line yields for 2015 and declining livestock prices, our very early forecast calls for total cash receipts to be down slightly in 2016.
On Slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive level even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension could disrupt trade, lower production, reduce the stocks-to-use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher.
Our economic outlook for the EU 28 is on Slide 8. Gradual economic growth continues in the region. While grain prices appear to be stabilizing at levels near the long-term average, the dairy sector remains under pressure. As a result, farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be lower for the year. I should mention, we are encouraged by some early indications that this market may be in the early stages of recovery.
On Slide 9, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, the government's continued investment in equipment subsidies and mechanization are supportive of agriculture. However, the economic slowdown and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in forecast industry sales.
Turning to India. Positive consumer and investor sentiment are encouraging economic growth. While the government continues to support agriculture, 2 consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons are hurting the farm sector.
In the CIS, continued deterioration of economic growth and further tightening of credit continue to weigh on equipment sales. Notably, Western equipment manufacturers are being heavily affected by the weak Russian currency and geopolitical uncertainties.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 10 illustrates the value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 11% for the year in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. However, with the weak real, the value of production is much more attractive in the local currency, up about 10%. That's because Brazilian farmers sell their crops in dollars. Even with the recent drop in prices, ag fundamentals remained positive for grains. Our early forecast calls for the value of production to be down slightly in 2016.
Slide 11 illustrates eligible finance rates for ag equipment in Brazil. The 2015, 2016 ag budget affirmed eligible finance rates for ag equipment are 7.5% and 9% through the end of June 2016, depending on the farmers' revenues, with no change on the required down payment. Though rates have increased, they are not considerably higher than they were in 2011, which was a banner year for industry sales in Brazil, and they remain below current market rate of about 14%. Nonetheless, farmer confidence is lower as a result of these rising interest rates, economic uncertainty and political concerns, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. Still, long-term fundamentals for the ag business in Brazil are solid.
Our 2015 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Lower commodity prices and falling farm income are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, especially larger models. At the same time, conditions in the livestock sector are more positive, providing support to sales of small and midsized tractors. 
We continue to expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be down about 25% for 2015. The EU 28 industry outlook is down about 10%, unchanged from last quarter due to lower crop prices and farm income as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are now projected to be down 20% to 25% in 2015, a reflection of the factors already discussed.
Shifting to Asia. We now expect sales to be down moderately, with most of the decline in India and China. In the CIS, we continue to expect industry sales to be down significantly due to limited credit availability, the weak ruble and overall economic concerns. 
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2015, no change from our prior forecast.
Putting this all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2015 Deere sales of worldwide Ag and Turf equipment are now forecast to be down about 25%, including about 5 points of negative currency translation. Our forecast for the Ag and Turf division's operating margin continues to be approximately 8%.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were down 13% in the quarter, and operating profit was down 34% due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency. The division's decremental margin was 29%.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide: GDP growth is positive, unemployment is falling, construction hiring is on the increase and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. In spite of these encouraging economic indicators and positive dealer and customer sentiment, we are seeing weakening in our order books. 
Some contributing factors to the slowdown in demand are the conditions in the energy sector and energy-producing regions, wet weather that slowed construction activity this spring and summer, the decline in rental utilization rates and sluggish economic growth outside the United States. As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are now forecast to be down about 5% in 2015. 
Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 3 points. Global forestry markets are now expected to be flat to up 5% on the heels of a 10% increase in 2014 as gains in the U.S. and Europe are offset by declines in other regions of the world. C&F full year operating margin is now projected to be about 10%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows that annualized provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio was 12 basis points at the end of July. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2015 now contemplates a loss provision of about 13 basis points versus 9 basis points in 2014. The increase is a reflection of unsustainably low loss levels of the last 4 years. It remains well below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and the 15-year average of 43 points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $153 million in the third quarter versus $162 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to less favorable financing spreads, partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses. The division's forecast net income attributable to Deere & Company remains at about $630 million for the year.
Slide 18 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the quarter down $1.5 billion. That's equal to 30.6% of prior 12-month sales compared with 29.8% a year ago. We expect to end the year with total receivables and inventories down about $350 million. With this decrease, forecasts that come entirely from Ag and Turf, the division will have reduced receivables and inventory by almost $2 billion over the last 2 years. At constant exchange rates, the 2-year decline is about $1.4 billion.
Our 2015 guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales, shown on Slide 19, is about 78%, unchanged from last quarter. When modeling 2015, keep these factors in mind: price realization of about 1 point, favorable raw material costs an unfavorable mix of product and Tier 4 product costs.
With respect to R&D expense on Slide 20, R&D was down 4% in the third quarter, including 4 points of negative currency translation. So essentially flat on a constant exchange basis. Our 2015 forecast now calls for R&D to be down about 2% for the full year, including about 3 points of negative currency translation.
Moving now to Slide 21. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 7% in the third quarter, including 5 points of currency translation. Our 2015 forecast contemplates SA&G expense being down about 11%, with landscapes, water, incentive compensation and currency accounting for about 9 points of the change.
Turning to Slide 22. Pension and OPEB expense was up $25 million in the quarter and is forecast to be up about $70 million in 2015.
On Slide 23, the equipment operations tax rate was 31% in the quarter. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 24 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations is now forecast to be about $3.2 billion in 2015.
The company's fourth quarter financial outlook is on Slide 25. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 24% compared with 2014. This includes about 1 point of price realization with unfavorable currency translation of about 5 points.
Turning to Slide 26 and the full year outlook. The forecast now calls for net sales to be down about 21%. Price realization is expected to be positive by about 1 point, with negative currency translation of about 4 points. Finally, our forecast now calls for net income attributable to Deere & Company to be about $1.8 billion for the full year.
As a closing thought, John Deere is well on its way to another good year and doing so in the face of some pretty significant headwinds. Our performance highlights our success, establishing a wider range of revenue sources and a more durable business model. As a result, the company is showing great resilience and discipline and performing much better than in previous farm downturns.
Longer term, we believe our steady investment in new products and geographies will make Deere the provider of choice for a growing global customer base. What's more, we believe the impact of these actions will become increasingly clear as the end markets for our products start moving ahead. These are just some of the reasons we have confidence in the company's present course and in our ability to deliver significant value to customers and investors well into the future.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tony."

As you think about new inventory, and I would say the similar situation of what we've talked about in the past in the sense that we continue to have new inventory well below the competitors. We tend to have a 50% or less as you look at inventory as a percent of sales and that continues to be the case. We continue to evaluate that, of course, as we go through the year and see various changes in the market. Used equipment continues to be a challenge. We are making good progress on used equipment. As you look at some of the factors from a large ag perspective, we are down about 10% year-over-year in July in terms of where we're at with used inventory. Pricing is holding in okay. If you look at it kind of from a 2-year average, we would be slightly below that. But I believe we continue to maintain a healthy premium versus our competition. And again, we are making progress, but it's likely we would expect these efforts will continue into 2016. We continue to coordinate with our dealers to assist with the movement of the used equipment, but it is still -- especially on large tractors, continues to be a challenge that we're working on within the market."

As you know, we have various phases of the early order programs. And the closing of the first phase is a bit different year-over-year. Now having said that, so I just want to make sure I have that clearly out front, but directionally, what we're seeing is order activity on those early order programs are off year-over-year. And just to be clear, what we're talking about is planter, sprayers and tillage. A lot of people will have questions around combine early order programs, I'm guessing but remember those just started up in early August. And candidly, it's just too early to make any type of conclusions related to where that program is. One of the challenges we do have also as you think about the spring seasonal early order program in where we would think that perhaps in this current environment, where they may not be as close of a correlation to overall -- as good of an indicator of overall demand going into next year, is the fact that they do have a much higher level of stock component versus retail orders in those spring seasonal order programs. And again, given the dynamics in the market, there are candidly not as much pressure to put orders in at this particular point. And we really believe the combine early order program, as that continues to develop, will be a better indicator of actual demand. And again, I want to be clear, I'm not trying to skirt the issue. Certainly, we are seeing in those early order programs, orders being off year-over-year, which historically would indicate some additional weakening as they move into 2016."

And as you'll recall, there were some changes in 2015 related to wholesale terms, which we believed was going to drive some higher level of receivables, and that has been the case. So that's part of what's driving that. Now as you look at the underlying forecast for receivables and inventory, it looks like there was just a slight reduction. Actually, what's underlying there is more of a reduction in receivables, so field inventory, with some offsetting increase in inventory, so Deere -- company-owned inventories. And again, some of that has to do with Final Tier 4 transitions and plans along that way as well as recognizing this has been a pretty rapid change in the business environment. There is about a 7-point change in our sales outlook. I'm sorry, I said -- apparently, I said a decrease in receivables. There's an increase in receivables -- no-no, a decrease in the forecasted receivable -- in the level of forecast. So again, we're still -- just to be clear, we're still forecasting an increase in receivables, but it's less of an increase versus our prior guidance. And inventory is a little higher than in our prior guidance. And again, a combination of Final Tier 4 and as well as just the rapid change in that business environment from an inventory perspective."

So we've been fluctuating candidly right around 1.5 points. And we just happened -- last quarter, it rounded up and this quarter, rounds down. Now -- so there hasn't been a substantial change in the pricing environment since last quarter. And I would say it's a little bit of both. Certainly, I wouldn't point all to Ag and Turf.

What I would tell you is at this point, given that outlook in cash receipts, given what we're seeing in the very early stages of our early order program, that it is likely that you would see some reduction -- further reduction in large ag sales -- retail sales next year."

They're heading towards planting season now, and we'll see what factors might be driven there. Keep in mind as we go into 2016, we did have some favorable weather conditions. El Niño actually strengthened through the summer, and that certainly bodes well normally for the U.S. market or growing areas. But keep in mind, that can have some more negative and dry impact on other parts of the world. So as you think about weather, there are a number of regions of the world that we would be point kind of on a watch list, if you will, of what impact El Niño may have. When you think about Southeast Asia, India, Australia, even Brazil and Argentina quite often, that can drive some very wet spring, summer type of weather, which a little bit of extra moisture is good in some cases, but if it's excessive, obviously, that can have some negative ramifications as well. So we'll see how things develop as we move forward for the rest of the world. But certainly, we did have a very good summer here in the U.S. from a weather perspective, at least in aggregate.

You're hearing some either commentary about some of the independent rental companies, for example, shifting inventory out of those areas that are more energy dependent into the rest of the country, and that's in fairly large sizes. Some large auctions and in places like Western Canada in more recent months. Those sorts of things can have some impact. So again, we'll see as we move forward where this market ends up going.

The funding seems to be appropriate. So they didn't increase it from where rates went to in April of this year. And so there is some stability there. Of course, there is always risk that, that can change. And again, the funding that was announced is, we believe, at a very appropriate level for the business. So that's one positive aspect. But I think FX creates certainly uncertainty in the environment. Farmers, there have benefited from the weakening of the real in this year. As they sell their crops in U.S. dollars and they convert that back, it's actually kept their cash receipts and margins pretty favorable. But there's always the risk of when does that change and move back the other direction. So there's uncertainty there. And more importantly, just around the general economy and that doesn't seem to be seeing much stabilization at this point. I'd argue that's probably the biggest risk as we move next year."

I want to be clear, we are not trying to signal down 10% for next year on all product lines. That's just an example, and we similarly use that really to reflect the fact that as we underproduce this year, you don't need an increase in end markets, retail sales and necessarily see an increase in Deere sales. But clearly, as you look at the early order programs, I want to be clear there as well. We're down year-over-year. We're not talking about seeing the type of magnitude of decrease that we saw last year, but certainly down directionally is what we're seeing in those early order programs at this point. So in that regard, we certainly have underproduced this year. From a new inventory perspective, certainly, we feel like -- our inventories will be in good shape, but as I mentioned earlier in the call, we will have some additional challenges to work through next year on used equipment, especially as it relates to large tractors.

266112,286331133,908169,"Deere & Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 25, 2015",2015-11-25,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","With today's announcement of our fourth quarter results, John Deere has completed another year of solid performance. We did so in spite of further weakness in the global agricultural sector and a slowdown in construction equipment markets. In response to",2366,"With today's announcement of our fourth quarter results, John Deere has completed another year of solid performance. We did so in spite of further weakness in the global agricultural sector and a slowdown in construction equipment markets. In response to this challenging environment, the company moved aggressively, restraining costs, reducing assets and seeing further benefits of having a broad-based business lineup.
As a result, Deere was able to deliver solid results, including our sixth best-ever year in terms of net sales and income. We also maintained our strong financial condition, generated healthy levels of cash flow and returned some $3.4 billion, a record amount to investors in the form of dividends and net share repurchases. All in all, it was a sound year, one in which Deere further demonstrated its commitment to disciplined operations and the resilience of its business model. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 25% to $6.715 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $351 million. EPS was $1.08 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 26% to $5.9 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was negative by 5 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 25% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Brazil accounted for most of the lower sales outside the U.S. and Canada. Also hurting sales was a negative impact of foreign currency exchange. 
Operating profit was $271 million. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, a less favorable product mix and foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization, lower selling administrative and general expenses and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 27% and 30% for the full year, quite respectable considering that worldwide large ag sales were down approximately 35% for the year.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 8% from 2014's peak levels. Moving to 2016, we expect total cash receipts to be about $394 billion, roughly flat with this year.
On Slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive levels even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world, as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension, could result in prices quickly moving higher.
Slide 8 highlights the awards John Deere earned at Agritechnica, the world's largest agricultural equipment fair earlier this month. Acknowledging Deere's ongoing research and development efforts, the innovation committee of the German Agricultural Society recognized innovations from John Deere and partner companies with 3 gold and 10 silver medals. It was the most gold and most silver medals ever awarded to one company. In addition, during the show, the Waterloo-built 8R [ph] series tractors were named Machine of the Year 2016 by a German publishing house. 
Our economic outlook to the EU 28 is on Slide 9. Economic growth is gradually improving in the region. Farm income is below long-term averages and remains under pressure. Also weakness continues in the dairy sector. As a result, industry farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be flat to down 5% in 2016.
On Slide 10, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, the government's continued investment in equipment subsidies and mechanization is supportive of agriculture. However, the economic slowdown there and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in the industry sales forecast.
Turning to India. Positive consumer and investor sentiment are encouraging economic growth. While the government continues to support agriculture, 2 consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons have taken a toll on the farm sector.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 11 illustrates the craft value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. However, the situation is more positive in local currency due to the sharp devaluation of the real. That's because Brazilian farmers sell their crops in dollars, helping to keep profitability at good levels.
fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is lower due to uncertainty over government-sponsored financing programs as well as economic and political concerns, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. Looking beyond these immediate concerns, however, long-term fundamentals for the ag business in Brazil remain solid. 
Our 2016 Ag & Turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down 15% to 20%, with large ag sales down 25% to 30%. Low commodity prices and stagnant farm income are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, with the decline being most pronounced in the sale of higher horsepower models. 
As mentioned previously, the EU 28 industry outlook is forecast to be flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm income as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2016, a reflection of the factors already discussed.
Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to down slightly due in part to weakness in China.
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, benefiting from general economic growth.
Putting this all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide Ag and Turf equipment are forecast to be down about 8%, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. The Ag and Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016 due to lower shipment volume, a less favorable product mix and the negative impact of foreign currency.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were down 32% in the quarter, and operating profit was down 72% due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency. The division's decremental margin was 27% in the quarter and 19% for the full year.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive. Construction spending is increasing, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units this year. And yet, in spite of these encouraging signs, we are seeing weakness in our order book year-over-year.
Contributing factors are weak conditions in the energy sector and energy producing regions, especially in Canada. We're also seeing a decline in rental utilization rates, sluggish economic growth outside the United States, and importantly the mix of housing starts in the U.S. skewing to multifamily homes, therefore reducing demand for earthmoving equipment.
As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are forecast to be down about 5% in 2016. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 1 point. Global forestry markets are expected to be down 5% to 10% from the strong levels we've experienced the last several years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the United States and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 8%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio at the end of the year was 13 basis points. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 19 basis points. Even so, losses would remain below the 10-year average of 26 basis points and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $153 million in the fourth quarter versus $172 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation and higher losses on residual values primarily for construction equipment operating leases. These factors were partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses. 
2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $633 million, an all-time record high for John Deere Financial. The 2016 forecast is about $550 million. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses. Also, remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of our crop insurance business of about $30 million [ph] 
Before we leave Financial Services, especially with all the questions we've been getting over leasing, let's take a closer look at the portfolio composition as shown on Slide 18. At 31 October 2015, operating leases made up 13% of the portfolio, up 2 points compared to a year earlier. The vast majority of the impairment charge taken in the quarter was on a handful of construction equipment models. 
JDF has not been encouraging customers to utilize leases in general or short-term leases specifically through pricing or residual values. Leasing, however, is becoming more attractive to many of our customers. That's because of an uncertain business environment, coupled with the lack of confidence and clarity in tax incentives. Meeting our customers' financing preferences continues to be our top priority. We monitor the leasing portfolio daily, take necessary actions to mitigate risk and expect to continue to see strength in our used equipment values.
Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year down $619 million. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventories down about $650 million. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percentage of net sales shown on Slide 20 is about 79%. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: Tier 4 product costs, overhead spend and an unfavorable mix of product. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 2 points, lower pension and OPEB expense and to a lesser extent, favorable raw material costs.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 21, R&D was down 2% in the fourth quarter and full year, including about 3 points of negative currency translation in each period. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%.
Moving now to Slide 22. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 17% in the fourth quarter, with currency translation and incentive compensation accounting for about 12 points of the change. 
Our 2016 forecast shown on Slide 23 contemplates SA&G expense being down about 1%, with currency translation accounting for about 2 points of the change, so essentially flat in comparison to 2015.
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was up $20 million for the quarter and up $80 million for the full year. Pension and OPEB expense is forecast to be down about $200 million in 2016 due to the fact that we are adopting a change in the measurement of service of interest costs, known as the spot yield curve approach.
On Slide 25, the equipment operations tax rate was 14% in the quarter and 28% for the full year. The lower rate resulted mainly from a reduction of a valuation allowance recorded during the quarter due to a change in the expected realizable value of a deferred tax asset. For 2016, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was approximately $3.1 billion in 2015 and is forecast to be about $2.6 billion in 2016.
Slide 27 outlines our use of cash priorities, which are unchanged and familiar to many of you. Our #1 priority is to manage the balance sheet, including liquidity to support a rating that provides access to low-cost and readily available short- and long-term funding. Thus, Deere is firmly committed to its A rating. Our second use of cash priority is funding value-creating investments in our operations, mostly relating to CapEx and R&D spending but also acquisitions.
Our third priority is to provide for the common stock dividend, which has been raised 114% since 2010. Over time, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends while targeting, at mid-cycle earnings, a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. In this regard, we are mindful of the importance of maintaining the dividend and not raising it beyond the point that can be sustained by our cash flow throughout the cycle.
Share repurchase is our preferred method of deploying excess cash once the previous requirements are met, so long as such repurchase is value-enhancing. Since 2004, Deere has repurchased about 242 million shares, resulting in a net share reduction of 36%. Cumulatively from 2004 to 2015, we have returned about 65% of cash from the equipment operations to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
The 2016 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on Slide 28. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 11% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and about 4 points of unfavorable currency translation. 
The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 7%. Price realizations and currency translation will offset one another, with each expected to be about 2 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is about $1.4 billion. 
I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Raj Kalathur."

In closing, I'd like to summarize a few things and also reiterate a few things that Susan mentioned about Deere's recent performance and the current ag downturn. We have faced 2 years",373,"Thanks, Susan. Thanks, everyone, for participating in the call today. In closing, I'd like to summarize a few things and also reiterate a few things that Susan mentioned about Deere's recent performance and the current ag downturn. 
We have faced 2 years of lower equipment sales in 2014 and 2015, and we are forecasting a third year of decline in 2016. Industry sales of large ag equipment in North America have declined by more than 60% over this time. Again, it's large ag in North America industry relative to the 2016 forecast, okay? This is 2013 to 2016's end. 
In addition, all key ag markets around the world and construction equipment markets in the Americas were down in 2015. Even with such a steep industry pullback, our businesses have remained solidly profitable, delivering respectable decremental margins of 30% in 2015. 
Now we also expect a solidly profitable 2016. Now we also expect to continue generating strong cash flow. Last year, Deere delivered third highest-ever level of cash flow from operations, and we are forecasting a very healthy level of cash flow of over $2.5 billion in 2016. Our actions in proactively controlling expenses, costs and managing assets have enabled us to deliver substantially better results than in any of the past downturns. 
At the same time, I should stress that the trends that hold so much promise for John Deere's future, the ones we have told you about in the past based on population growth, rising living standards and increasing urbanization, they haven't gone away. They are still quite compelling in our view and have ample staying power. In fact, demand for grain has continued to grow and the supply-demand balance is even closer now than last year. That's in spite of record production, in some cases, corn, as an example. 
Recall that earlier this year, in the summer, corn prices shot up to $4.50 [ph] over worries about the weather in the U.S. corn belt. So all in all, we believe John Deere can continue to earn solid returns even in a weak farm economy, deliver financial performance much improved over downturns in the past and longer term, see substantial benefits from the world's growing need for advanced equipment and technology solutions."

So it did mute on our reported numbers the impact of the reductions that were being taken in our large ag product, on top of the large reductions we took in 2014. So as you look at 2016, what you're seeing again is some reduction in small ag, but you're also seeing some additional reduction in large ag relative to the lower markets that we're anticipating in 2016. But I think maybe where you were going with this is with production versus retail. Last year, we talked a lot about underproducing retail. This year, there will be some of that but not nearly to the same level. So we are getting some advantage in 2016 from all of the work that took place in both 2014 and 2015 and able to produce much closer to retail than what we have in the past couple of years."

At that time, many were anticipating that the weakness in dairy would begin to moderate as we moved into 2016, and that isn't happening at this point. So it appears that we'll continue to have some weakness in the dairy market, as an example, as we go well into 2016. And that's a significant part of the business in Europe, so I think that is probably the biggest difference. As Susan pointed out in the opening comments, we are still seeing some positive trends in the overall economic environment. We would stress there certainly, as we point to in our slides, there's still some risk there and so we'll see if that continues to progress. But we did see a little bit of weaker market than what we had hoped to see as we move into 2016."

If I were to the puts and takes, it's about a 5% operating margin outlook for 2016, and you've embedded about $200 million benefit of lower pension expense or about an 80 basis point margin cushion. If I take that pension benefit out, it looks like your implied decremental margin is somewhere around 40%. Just wondering why do you expect that to deteriorate from the reported 30% in 2015, especially given the lower gap between production retail for large ag in the U.S. and higher aftermarket."

If you take out the pension and OPEB benefit, you'd get closer to 40%, just under -- just below that. And I think we talked about this really on the last call is you look at large ag, it is still down year-over-year. Now we're getting some benefit so it's not down as much as maybe the retail environment is, but the production is down year-over-year and is the major contributor from an agricultural perspective, is a major contributor to the lower sales would still be large ag. And so when you put that in perspective of where we've been from a capacity perspective last year, we talked about being at about 50% of capacity in most of our large ag facilities. And now we're further down from that, closer to 60% -- down 60%. So we're pushing 40% of capacity in some of these facilities. And so the headwinds just get very, very challenging in that type of an environment. And I'd point out, while the near 40% decremental margins may not be as appealing as the 30% of 2015 relative to what we were able to do historically, that 40% is very, very impressive, especially in light of where we're at within the end markets. So you're right in the sense that it has grown year-over-year but certainly, it's still, from a historic basis, pretty attractive."

The good news there too is our resale values are holding in quite well. We talked last quarter about, if you look over a 2-year kind of horizon, down a small single digit, I'd tell you, those used pricing continues -- used pricing continues to remain very steady at those levels.

We have not, at this point, disclosed acres and so on for next year's crop. I don't think we certainly don't anticipate a significant decrease in the acres plan. I think I'll follow up a little bit on the last question you had though because I think the situation in Argentina with the election over last weekend could have an impact on that. I think that the challenge there is very premature and a lot depends on how quickly some of these promised changes may occur in terms of both planting and situation in Argentina and then what impact that could have on the Northern Hemisphere in the U.S. and Canada. So there is still time for Argentinian farmers to shift and plant more corn acres. Planting so far has been running behind, and the expectation has been lower acres in this current year. But that could change and certainly could then impact the pricing outlook for farmers here in the U.S. and Canada. But again, it'd be fairly marginal and short term. And I think similarly with soybeans, we'll just have to wait and see how quickly things happen in terms of any changes and what impact that has on some of those pricing. Now I think to be fair, much of that, I think, was speculated and priced into current commodity prices in terms of the anticipation of this, when and what that might have for exports coming out of Argentina."

Now that uncertainty swings both ways, right? And so there's possibility things could end up better than this current outlook too but as you think about it, similar to a -- and we see this about any region outside of U.S. and Canada. Our visibility from an order book perspective is strongest in the U.S. and Canada especially on large ag and lesser in other markets. So you certainly have uncertainty around FINAME. While the expectation is that will come back and around the 1st of December, that's what is scheduled to do and anticipated to stay in place. There's always uncertainty certainly around that. And then over the general economy, there's a lot of uncertainty that continues to exist there. Again, the good news with Brazil is because of the FX rate and the fact that those farmers do sell in U.S. dollars, and then when you convert into local currency, profitability for farmers and cash receipts in local currency have remained very strong. And so we have -- under this weakness that we've experienced in '15 and in '16 with the forecast for '16 in the equipment sales is a farmer base that financially again is pretty strong. So if anything shifts and some of that uncertainty is removed from the market, there's certainly some potential for those farmers to step back and as well. So again, I think your point is well taken in the sense that there is a lot of uncertainty in South America, Brazil in particular. We'll see how that develops as we go through the year."

And while you have fewer notes coming in because of the trade cycle slowing down, you also have fewer notes paying off early. And so the notes are extending so it does help sustain that portfolio balance further into the cycle. So that's one of the -- again, one of the benefits we talked about with Financial Services.

We did so in spite of further weakness in the global agricultural sector and a slowdown in construction equipment markets. In response to",2368,"With today's announcement of our fourth quarter results, John Deere has completed another year of solid performance. We did so in spite of further weakness in the global agricultural sector and a slowdown in construction equipment markets. In response to this challenging environment, the company moved aggressively, restraining costs, reducing assets and seeing further benefits of having a broad-based business lineup.
As a result, Deere was able to deliver solid results, including our sixth best-ever year in terms of net sales and income. We also maintained our strong financial condition, generated healthy levels of cash flow and returned some $3.4 billion, a record amount to investors in the form of dividends and net share repurchases. All in all, it was a sound year, one in which Deere further demonstrated its commitment to disciplined operations and the resilience of its business model. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 25% to $6.715 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $351 million. EPS was $1.08 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 26% to $5.9 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was negative by 5 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 25% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Brazil accounted for most of the lower sales outside the U.S. and Canada. Also hurting sales was a negative impact of foreign currency exchange. 
Operating profit was $271 million. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, a less favorable product mix and foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 27% and 30% for the full year, quite respectable, considering that worldwide large ag sales were down, approximately 35% for the year.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 8% from 2014 peak level. Moving to 2016, we expect total cash receipts to be about $394 billion, roughly flat with this year.
On Slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive level even after the abundant harvest of the past 2 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension, could result in prices quickly moving higher.
Slide 8 highlights the awards, John Deere earned at Agritechnica, the world's largest agricultural equipment fair, earlier this month. Acknowledging Deere's ongoing research and development efforts, the innovation committee of the German Agricultural Society recognized innovations from John Deere and partner companies with 3 gold and 10 silver medals. It was the most gold and most silver medals ever awarded to one company. In addition, during the show, the Waterloo-built 8R series tractors were named Machine of the Year 2016 by a German publishing house. 
Our economic outlook to the EU 28 is on Slide 9. Economic growth is gradually improving in the region. Farm income is below long-term averages and remains under pressure. Also weakness continues in the dairy sector. As a result, industry farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be flat to down 5% in 2016.
On Slide 10, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, the government's continued investment in equipment subsidies and mechanization is supportive of agriculture. However, the economic slowdown there and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in the industry sales forecast.
Turning to India. Positive consumer and investor sentiment are encouraging economic growth. While the government continues to support agriculture, 2 consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons have taken a toll on the farm sector.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 11 illustrates the craft value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. However, the situation is more positive in local currency due to the sharp devaluation of the real. That's because Brazilian farmers sell their crops in dollars, helping to keep profitability at good levels.
Although Ag fundamentals remained positive, farmer confidence is lower due to uncertainty over government-sponsored financing programs as well as economic and political concerns, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. Looking beyond these immediate concerns, however, long-term fundamentals for the ag business in Brazil remain solid. 
Our 2016 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down 15% to 20%, with large ag sales down 25% to 30%. Low commodity prices and stagnant farm income are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, with the decline being most pronounced in the sale of high horsepower models. 
As mentioned previously, the EU 28 industry outlook is forecast to be flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm income as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2016, a reflection of the factors already discussed.
Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to down slightly, due in part to weakness in China.
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, benefiting from general economic growth.
Putting this all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are forecast to be down about 8%, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. The Ag and Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016 due to lower shipment volume, a less favorable product mix and the negative impact of foreign currency.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were down 32% in the quarter, and operating profit was down 72% due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency. The division's decremental margin was 27% in the quarter, and 19% for the full year.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive. Construction spending is increasing, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units, this year. And yet, in spite of these encouraging signs, we are seeing weakness in our order book year-over-year.
Contributing factors are weak conditions in the energy sector and energy producing regions, especially in Canada. We're also seeing a decline in rental utilization rates, sluggish economic growth outside the United States, and importantly, the mix of housing starts in the U.S. skewing to multifamily homes, therefore reducing demand for earthmoving equipment.
As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are forecast to be down about 5% in 2016. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 1 point. Global forestry markets are expected to be down 5% to 10% from the strong levels, we've experienced the last several years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the United States and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 8%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio at the end of the year was 13 basis points. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 19 basis points. Even so, losses would remain below the 10-year average of 26 basis points, and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $153 million in the fourth quarter versus $172 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation and higher losses on residual values, primarily for construction equipment operating leases. These factors were partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses. 
2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $633 million, an all-time record high for John Deere Financial. The 2016 forecast is about $550 million. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses. Also, remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of our crop insurance business of about $30 million. 
Before we leave Financial Services, especially with all the questions we've been getting over leasing, let's take a closer look at the portfolio composition as shown on Slide 18. At 31 October 2015, operating leases made up 13% of the portfolio, up 2 points compared to a year earlier. The vast majority of the impairment charge taken in the quarter was on a handful of construction equipment models. 
JDF has not been encouraging customers to utilize leases in general, or short-term leases specifically, through pricing or residual values. Leasing, however, is becoming more attractive to many of our customers. That's because of an uncertain business environment, coupled with the lack of confidence and clarity in tax incentive. Meeting our customers' financing preferences continues to be our top priority. We monitor the leasing portfolio daily, take necessary actions to mitigate risk, and expect to continue to see strength in our used equipment values.
Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year down $619 million. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventories down about $650 million. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percentage of net sales shown on Slide 20, is about 79%. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: Tier 4 product costs, overhead spend and an unfavorable mix of product. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 2 points, lower pension and OPEB expense and to a lesser extent, favorable raw material costs.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 21, R&D was down 2% in the fourth quarter and full year, including about 3 points of negative currency translation in each period. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%.
Moving now to Slide 22. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 17% in the fourth quarter, with currency translation and incentive compensation accounting for about 12 points of the change. 
Our 2016 forecast shown on Slide 23 contemplates SA&G expense being down about 1%, with currency translation accounting for about 2 points of the change, so essentially flat in comparison to 2015.
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was up $20 million for the quarter, and up $80 million for the full year. Pension and OPEB expense is forecast to be down about $200 million in 2016 due to the fact that we are adopting a change in the measurement of service of interest costs, known as the spot yield curve approach.
On Slide 25, the equipment operations tax rate was 14% in the quarter, and 28% for the full year. The lower rate resulted mainly from a reduction of a valuation allowance recorded during the quarter, due to a change in the expected realizable value of a deferred tax asset. For 2016, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was approximately $3.1 billion in 2015 and is forecast to be about $2.6 billion in 2016.
Slide 27 outlines our use of cash priorities, which are unchanged and familiar to many of you. Our #1 priority is to manage the balance sheet, including liquidity to support a rating that provides access to low cost and readily available short- and long-term funding. Thus, Deere is firmly committed to it's A rating. Our second use of cash priority is funding value-creating investments in our operations, mostly relating to CapEx and R&D spending but also acquisitions.
Our third priority is to provide for the common stock dividend, which has been raised 114% since 2010. Over time, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends, while targeting, at mid-cycle earnings, a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. In this regard, we are mindful of the importance of maintaining the dividend and not raising it beyond a point that can be sustained by our cash flow throughout the cycle.
Share repurchase is our preferred method of deploying excess cash, once the previous requirements are met, so long and such repurchase is value enhancing. Since 2004, Deere has repurchased about 242 million shares, resulting in a net share reduction of 36%. Cumulatively, from 2004 to 2015, we have returned about 65% of cash from the equipment operations to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
The 2016 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on Slide 28. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 11% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and about 4 points of unfavorable currency translation. 
The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 7%. Price realizations and currency translation will offset one another, with each expected to be about 2 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is about $1.4 billion. 
I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Raj Kalathur."

In closing, I'd like to summarize a few things and also reiterate a few things that Susan mentioned about Deere's recent performance and the current ag downturn. We have faced 2 years",373,"Thanks, Susan. Thanks, everyone, for participating in the call today. In closing, I'd like to summarize a few things and also reiterate a few things that Susan mentioned about Deere's recent performance and the current ag downturn. 
We have faced 2 years of lower equipment sales in 2014 and 2015, and we are forecasting a third year of decline in 2016. Industry sales of large ag equipment in North America have declined by more than 60% over this time. Again, it's large ag in North America industry, relative to the 2016 forecast, okay? This is 2013 to 2016's end. 
In addition, all key ag markets around the world and construction equipment markets in the Americas were down in 2015. Even with such a steep industry pullback, our businesses have remained solidly profitable, delivering respectable decremental margins of 30% in 2015. 
Now, we also expect a solidly profitable 2016. Now, we also expect to continue generating strong cash flow. Last year, Deere delivered third highest-ever level of cash flow from operations, and we are forecasting a very healthy level of cash flow of over $2.5 billion in 2016. Our actions in proactively controlling expenses, costs and managing assets have enabled us to deliver substantially better results than in any of the past downturns. 
At the same time, I should stress that the trends that hold so much promise for John Deere's future, the ones we have told you about in the past based on population growth, rising living standards and increasing urbanization, they haven't gone away. They are still quite compelling in our view and have ample staying power. In fact, demand for grain has continued to grow and the supply-demand balance is even closer now than last year. That's in spite of record production, in some cases, corn, as an example. 
Recall that earlier this year, in the summer, corn prices shot up to $4.50 over worries about the weather in the U.S. Corn Belt. So all in all, then we believe John Deere can continue to earn solid returns even in a weak farm economy, deliver financial performance much improved over downturns in the past and longer term, see substantial benefits from the world's growing need for advanced equipment and technology solutions."

So it did mute on our reported numbers the impact of the reductions that were being taken in our large ag product, on top of the large reductions we took in 2014. So as you look at 2016, what you're seeing again, is some reduction in small ag, but you're also seeing some additional reduction in large ag relative to the lower markets that we're anticipating in 2016. But -- and I think maybe where you were going with this is with production versus retail, last year, we talked a lot about underproducing retail. This year, there will be some of that, but not nearly to the same level. So we are getting some advantage in 2016 from all of the work that took place in both 2014 and 2015 and able to produce much closer to retail than what we have in the past couple of years."

At that time, many were anticipating that the weakness in dairy would begin to moderate as we moved into 2016, and that isn't happening at this point. So it appears that we'll continue to have some weakness in the dairy market, as an example, as we go well into 2016. And that's a significant part of the business in Europe, so I think that is probably the biggest difference. And Susan pointed out in the opening comments, we are still seeing some positive trends in the overall economic environment. We would stress there are certainly, as we point to in our slides, there's still some risk there and so we'll see if that continues to progress. But we did see a little bit of weaker market than what we had hoped to see as we move into 2016."

If I take that pension benefit out, it looks like your implied decremental margin is somewhere around 40%, I'm just wondering why do you expect that deteriorate from the reported 30% in 2015, especially given the lower gap between production retail for large ag in the U.S. and higher aftermarket."

And I think we talked about this really, on the last call is if you look at large ag, it is still down year-over-year. Now we're getting some benefit so it's not down as much as maybe the retail environment is, but the production is down year-over-year and is the major contributor from an agricultural perspective, it's the major contributor to the lower sales would still be large ag. And so when you put that in perspective of where we've been from a capacity perspective last year, we talked about being at about 50% of capacity in most of our large ag facilities. And now we're further down from that, closer to 60% -- down 60%. So we're pushing 40% of capacity in some of these facilities. And so the headwinds just get very, very challenging in that type of an environment. And I'd point out, while the near 40% decremental margins may not be as appealing as the 30% of 2015 relative to what we were able to do historically, that 40% is very, very impressive, especially in light of where we're at within the end markets. So you're right in the sense that it has grown year-over-year but certainly, it's still, from a historic basis, pretty attractive."

In fact, if you look at the high point in 2014, we're down about 18% from that point, so again, making progress. The good news there too is our resale values are holding in quite well. We talked last quarter about, if you look over a 2-year kind of horizon, down a small single digit, I'd tell you, those used pricing continues -- used pricing continues to remain very steady at those levels. And versus competition, we're maintaining a very healthy premium. And certainly, from both a inventory and pricing perspective, when you put it in context of where our competition is, we're in a much more favorable position.

And I think you're aware with Europe, we don't have as -- our order book isn't as full, or isn't as extended as it tends to be in the U.S., and so it's a little harder to gauge the market, the coming year.

We have not, at this point, disclosed acres and so on for next year's crop. I don't think we certainly, don't anticipate a significant decrease in the acres plan. And I think I'll follow-up a little bit on the last question you had though because I think the situation in Argentina, with the elections over last weekend, could have some impact on that. I think that the challenge there it is very premature, and a lot depends on how quickly, some of these promised changes may occur in terms of both planting and situation in Argentina, and then what impact that could have on the Northern Hemisphere in the U.S. and Canada. So there is still time for Argentinian farmers to shift and plant more corn acres. Planting so far has been running behind, and the expectation has been lower acres in this current year. But that could change and certainly, could then impact the pricing outlook for farmers here in the U.S. and Canada. But again, it be fairly marginal and short term. And I think that similarly, with soybeans, it will -- we'll just have to wait and see how quickly things happen in terms of any changes, and what impact that has on some of those pricing. Now I think to be fair, much of that, I think was speculated and priced into current commodity prices in terms of the anticipation of this, when and what that might have for exports coming out of Argentina."

Now that uncertainty swings both ways, right? And so there's possibility, things could end up better than this current outlook too but as you think about it, similar to -- and we say this about any region outside of U.S. and Canada. Our visibility from an order book perspective is strongest in the U.S. and Canada, especially on large ag and lesser in other markets. So you certainly have uncertainty around FINAME. While the expectation is that Moderfrota will come back and around the 1st of December, that's what it's scheduled to do and anticipated to stay in place. There's always uncertainty, certainly around that. And then over the general economy, there's a lot of uncertainty that continues to exist there. Again, the good news with Brazil is because of the FX rate and the fact that those farmers do sell in U.S. dollars, and then when you convert into local currency, profitability for farmers and cash receipts in local currency have remained very strong. And so we have -- under this weakness that we've experienced in '15 and in '16 which has been forecast for '16 in the equipment sale is a farmer base that financially again, is pretty strong. So if anything shifts and some of that uncertainty is removed from the market, there's certainly some potential for those farmers to step back and as well. So again, I think your point is well taken in the sense that there is a lot of uncertainty in South America, Brazil, in particular. We'll see how that develops as we go through the year."

We did so in spite of further weakness in the global agricultural sector and a slowdown in construction equipment markets. In response to",2368,"With today's announcement of our fourth quarter results, John Deere has completed another year of solid performance. We did so in spite of further weakness in the global agricultural sector and a slowdown in construction equipment markets. In response to this challenging environment, the company moved aggressively, restraining costs, reducing assets and seeing further benefits of having a broad-based business lineup.
As a result, Deere was able to deliver solid results, including our sixth best-ever year in terms of net sales and income. We also maintained our strong financial condition, generated healthy levels of cash flow and returned some $3.4 billion, a record amount, to investors in the form of dividends and net share repurchases. All in all, it was a sound year, one in which Deere further demonstrated its commitment to disciplined operations and the resilience of its business model. 
Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter in detail, beginning on Slide 3. Net sales and revenues were down 25% to $6.715 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $351 million. EPS was $1.08 in the quarter.
On Slide 4, total worldwide equipment operations net sales were down 26% to $5.9 billion. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 1 point. Currency translation was negative by 5 points.
Turning to a review of our individual businesses, let's start with Agriculture & Turf on Slide 5. Net sales were down 25% in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Lower sales were recorded in all regions of the world, but the decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes of large ag equipment in the United States and Canada. Brazil accounted for most of the lower sales outside the U.S. and Canada. Also hurting sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange. 
Operating profit was $271 million. The decrease in operating profit was primarily driven by lower shipment volumes, a less favorable product mix and foreign currency exchange, partially offset by price realization, lower selling, administrative and general expenses and lower production costs. The division's decremental margin in the quarter was 27% and 30% for the full year, quite respectable, considering that worldwide large ag sales were down, approximately 35% for the year.
Before we review the industry sales outlook, let's look at fundamentals affecting the ag business. Slide 6 outlines U.S. farm cash receipts. Given the record crop harvest of 2014 and consequently the lower commodity prices we're seeing today, our 2015 forecast calls for cash receipts to be down about 8% from 2014 peak level. Moving to 2016, we expect total cash receipts to be about $394 billion, roughly flat with this year.
On Slide 7, global grain stocks-to-use ratios remain at somewhat sensitive level even after the abundant harvests of the past 2 years. Global grain and oilseed demand remains strong, while supplies are now fully adequate. Even so, unfavorable growing conditions in any key region of the world as well as unknown impacts from any geopolitical tension, could result in prices quickly moving higher.
Slide 8 highlights the awards John Deere earned at Agritechnica, the world's largest agricultural equipment fair, earlier this month. Acknowledging Deere's ongoing research and development efforts, the innovation committee of the German Agricultural Society recognized innovations from John Deere and partner companies with 3 gold and 10 silver medals. It was the most gold and most silver medals ever awarded to one company. In addition, during the show, the Waterloo-built 8R series tractors were named Machine of the Year 2016 by a German publishing house. 
Our economic outlook to the EU 28 is on Slide 9. Economic growth is gradually improving in the region. Farm income is below long-term averages and remains under pressure. Also weakness continues in the dairy sector. As a result, industry farm machinery demand in the EU region is expected to be flat to down 5% in 2016.
On Slide 10, you'll see the economic fundamentals outlined for other targeted growth markets. In China, the government's continued investment in equipment subsidies and mechanization is supportive of agriculture. However, the economic slowdown there and lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in the industry sales forecast.
Turning to India. Positive consumer and investor sentiment are encouraging economic growth. While the government continues to support agriculture, 2 consecutive below-normal monsoon seasons have taken a toll on the farm sector.
Shifting to Brazil. Slide 11 illustrates the crop value of agricultural production, a good proxy for the health of agribusiness. Ag production is expected to decrease about 2% in 2016 in U.S. dollar terms due to lower global commodity prices. However, the situation is more positive in local currency due to the sharp devaluation of the real. That's because Brazilian farmers sell their crops in dollars, helping to keep profitability at good levels.
Although Ag fundamentals remain positive, farmer confidence is lower due to uncertainty over government-sponsored financing programs as well as economic and political concerns, all of which are leading to lower equipment sales. Looking beyond these immediate concerns, however, long-term fundamentals for the ag business in Brazil remain solid. 
Our 2016 ag and turf industry outlooks are summarized on Slide 12. Industry sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down 15% to 20%, with large ag sales down 25% to 30%. Low commodity prices and stagnant farm incomes are continuing to pressure demand for farm equipment, with the decline being most pronounced in the sale of high horsepower models. 
As mentioned previously, the EU 28 industry outlook is forecast to be flat to down 5% in 2016 due to low crop prices and farm incomes as well as pressure on the dairy sector. In South America, industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be down 10% to 15% in 2016, a reflection of the factors already discussed.
Shifting to Asia. Sales are expected to be flat to down slightly, due in part to weakness in China.
Turning to another product category. Industry retail sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are projected to be flat to up 5% in 2016, benefiting from general economic growth.
Putting this all together on Slide 13. Fiscal year 2016 Deere sales of worldwide ag and turf equipment are forecast to be down about 8%, including about 2 points of negative currency translation. The Ag and Turf division operating margin is forecast to be about 7% in 2016 due to lower shipment volume, a less favorable product mix and the negative impact of foreign currency.
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 14. Net sales were down 32% in the quarter, and operating profit was down 72% due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency. The division's decremental margin was 27% in the quarter, and 19% for the full year.
Moving to Slide 15. Looking at the economic indicators on the bottom part of the slide. GDP growth is positive. Construction spending is increasing, and housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units, this year. And yet, in spite of these encouraging signs, we are seeing weakness in our order book year-over-year.
Contributing factors are weak conditions in the energy sector and energy producing regions, especially in Canada. We're also seeing a decline in rental utilization rates, sluggish economic growth outside the United States, and importantly, the mix of housing starts in the U.S. skewing to multifamily homes, therefore reducing demand for earthmoving equipment.
As a result, Deere's Construction & Forestry sales are forecast to be down about 5% in 2016. Currency translation is forecast to be negative by about 1 point. Global forestry markets are expected to be down 5% to 10% from the strong levels, we've experienced the last several years, primarily as a result of lower sales in the United States and Canada. C&F's full year operating margin is projected to be about 8%.
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations. Slide 16 shows the annualized provision for credit losses as a percentage of the average owned portfolio at the end of the year was 13 basis points. This reflects the continued excellent quality of our portfolios. The financial forecast for 2016 contemplates a loss provision of about 19 basis points. Even so, losses would remain below the 10-year average of 26 basis points, and well below the 15-year average of 39 basis points.
Moving to Slide 17. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company was $153 million in the fourth quarter versus $172 million last year. Lower results for the quarter were primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation and higher losses on residual values, primarily for construction equipment operating leases. These factors were partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses. 
2015 net income attributable to Deere & Company was $633 million, an all-time record high for John Deere Financial. The 2016 forecast is about $550 million. The outlook reflects less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses. Also, remember that 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of our crop insurance business of about $30 million. 
Before we leave Financial Services, especially with all the questions we've been getting over leasing, let's take a closer look at the portfolio composition as shown on Slide 18. At 31 October 2015, operating leases made up 13% of the portfolio, up 2 points compared to a year earlier. The vast majority of the impairment charge taken in the quarter was on a handful of construction equipment models. 
JDF has not been encouraging customers to utilize leases in general, or short-term leases specifically, through pricing or residual values. Leasing, however, is becoming more attractive to many of our customers. That's because of an uncertain business environment, coupled with the lack of confidence and clarity in tax incentive. Meeting our customers' financing preferences continues to be our top priority. We monitor the leasing portfolio daily, take necessary actions to mitigate risk, and expect to continue to see strength in our used equipment values.
Slide 19 outlines receivables and inventories. For the company as a whole, receivables and inventories ended the year down $619 million. We expect to end 2016 with total receivables and inventory down about $650 million. 
Our 2016 guidance for cost of sales as a percentage of net sales shown on Slide 20, is about 79%. When modeling 2016, keep these unfavorable impacts in mind: Tier 4 product costs, overhead spend and an unfavorable mix of product. On the favorable side, we expect price realization of about 2 points, lower pension and OPEB expense and to a lesser extent, favorable raw material costs.
Now let's look at a few housekeeping items. With respect to R&D expense on Slide 21, R&D was down 2% in the fourth quarter and full year, including about 3 points of negative currency translation in each period. Our 2016 forecast calls for R&D to be down about 3%.
Moving now to Slide 22. SA&G expense for the equipment operations was down 17% in the fourth quarter, with currency translation and incentive compensation accounting for about 12 points of the change. 
Our 2016 forecast shown on Slide 23 contemplates SA&G expense being down about 1%, with currency translation accounting for about 2 points of the change, so essentially flat in comparison to 2015.
Turning to Slide 24. Pension and OPEB expense was up $20 million for the quarter, and up $80 million for the full year. Pension and OPEB expense is forecast to be down about $200 million in 2016 due to the fact that we are adopting a change in the measurement of service and interest costs, known as the spot yield curve approach.
On Slide 25, the equipment operations tax rate was 14% in the quarter, and 28% for the full year. The lower rate resulted mainly from a reduction of a valuation allowance recorded during the quarter due to a change in the expected realizable value of a deferred tax asset. For 2016, the projected effective tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 36%.
Slide 26 shows our equipment operations history of strong cash flow. Cash flow from the equipment operations was approximately $3.1 billion in 2015 and is forecast to be about $2.6 billion in 2016.
Slide 27 outlines our use of cash priorities, which are unchanged and familiar to many of you. Our #1 priority is to manage the balance sheet, including liquidity to support a rating that provides access to low cost and readily available short- and long-term funding. Thus, Deere is firmly committed to it's A rating. Our second use of cash priority is funding value-creating investments in our operations, mostly relating to CapEx and R&D spending but also acquisitions.
Our third priority is to provide for the common stock dividend, which has been raised 114% since 2010. Over time, we want to consistently deliver a series of moderately increased dividends, while targeting, at mid-cycle earnings, a 25% to 35% payout ratio on average. In this regard, we are mindful of the importance of maintaining the dividend and not raising it beyond a point that can be sustained by our cash flow throughout the cycle.
Share repurchase is our preferred method of deploying excess cash, once the previous requirements are met, so long as such repurchase is value enhancing. Since 2004, Deere has repurchased about 242 million shares, resulting in a net share reduction of 36%. Cumulatively, from 2004 to 2015, we have returned about 65% of cash from the equipment operations to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
The 2016 outlook for the first quarter and full year is on Slide 28. Net sales for the quarter are forecast to be down about 11% compared with 2015. This includes about 2 points of price realization and about 4 points of unfavorable currency translation. 
The full year forecast calls for net sales to be down about 7%. Price realizations and currency translation will offset one another, with each expected to be about 2 points. Finally, our full year 2016 net income forecast is about $1.4 billion. 
I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Raj Kalathur."

We have faced 2 years",375,"Thanks, Susan. Thanks, everyone, for participating in the call today. In closing, I'd like to summarize a few things and also reiterate a few things that Susan mentioned about Deere's recent performance and the current ag downturn. 
We have faced 2 years of lower equipment sales in 2014 and 2015, and we are forecasting a third year of decline in 2016. Industry sales of large ag equipment in North America have declined by more than 60% over this time. Again, it's large ag in North America industry, relative to the 2016 forecast, okay? This is 2013 to 2016's end. 
In addition, all key ag markets around the world and construction equipment markets in the Americas were down in 2015. Even with such a steep industry pullback, our businesses have remained solidly profitable, delivering respectable decremental margins of 30% in 2015. 
Now, we also expect a solidly profitable 2016. Now, we also expect to continue generating strong cash flow. Last year, Deere delivered the third highest-ever level of cash flow from operations, and we are forecasting a very healthy level of cash flow of over $2.5 billion in 2016. Our actions in proactively controlling expenses, costs and managing assets have enabled us to deliver substantially better results than in any of the past downturns. 
At the same time, I should stress that the trends that hold so much promise for John Deere's future, the ones we have told you about in the past based on population growth, rising living standards and increasing urbanization, they haven't gone away. They are still quite compelling in our view and have ample staying power. In fact, the demand for grain has continued to grow and the supply-demand balance is even closer now than last year. That's in spite of record production, in some cases, corn, as an example. 
Recall that earlier this year, in the summer, corn prices shot up to $4.50 over worries about the weather in the U.S. Corn Belt. So all in all, then we believe John Deere can continue to earn solid returns even in a weak farm economy, deliver financial performance much improved over downturns in the past and longer term, see substantial benefits from the world's growing need for advanced equipment and technology solutions."

So it did mute on our reported numbers the impact of the reductions that were being taken in our large ag product, on top of the large reductions we took in 2014. So as you look at 2016, what you're seeing again, is some reduction in small ag, but you're also seeing some additional reduction in large ag relative to the lower markets that we're anticipating in 2016. But -- and I think maybe where you were going with this is with production versus retail, last year, we talked a lot about underproducing retail. This year, there will be some of that, but not nearly to the same level. So we are getting some advantage in 2016 from all of the work that took place in both 2014 and 2015 and able to produce much closer to retail than what we have in the past couple of years."

So it appears that we'll continue to have some weakness in the dairy market, as an example, as we go well into 2016.

Now we're getting some benefit so it's not down as much as maybe the retail environment is, but the production is down year-over-year and is the major contributor, from an agricultural perspective, is the major contributor to the lower sales, would still be large ag. And so when you put that in perspective of where we've been from a capacity perspective last year, we talked about being at about 50% of capacity in most of our large ag facilities. And now we're further down from that, closer to 60% -- down 60%. So we're pushing 40% of capacity in some of these facilities. And so the headwinds just get very, very challenging in that type of an environment. And I'd point out, while the near 40% decremental margins may not be as appealing as the 30% of 2015 relative to what we were able to do historically, that 40% is very, very impressive, especially in light of where we're at within the end markets.

And I think you're aware with Europe, we don't have as -- our order book isn't as full, or isn't as extended as it tends to be in the U.S., and so it's a little harder to gauge the market, the coming year.

We have not, at this point, disclosed acres and so on for next year's crop. I don't think we certainly, don't anticipate a significant decrease in the acres planted. And I think I'll follow-up a little bit on the last question you had though because I think the situation in Argentina, with the elections over last weekend, could have some impact on that. I think that the challenge there is it's very premature, and a lot depends on how quickly some of these promised changes may occur in terms of both planting and situation in Argentina, and then what impact that could have on the Northern Hemisphere in the U.S. and Canada. So there is still time for Argentinian farmers to shift and plant more corn acres. Planting so far has been running behind, and the expectation has been lower acres in this current year. But that could change and certainly, could then impact the pricing outlook for farmers here in the U.S. and Canada. But again, it'd be fairly marginal and short term. And I think that similarly, with soybeans, it will -- we'll just have to wait and see how quickly things happen in terms of any changes, and what impact that has on some of those pricing. Now I think to be fair, much of that, I think was speculated and priced into current commodity prices in terms of the anticipation of this, when and what that might have for exports coming out of Argentina."

Now that uncertainty swings both ways, right? And so there's a possibility, things could end up better than this current outlook too but as you think about it, similar to -- and we say this about any region outside of U.S. and Canada. Our visibility from an order book perspective is strongest in the U.S. and Canada, especially on large ag and lesser in other markets. So you certainly have uncertainty around FINAME. While the expectation is that Moderfrota will come back around the 1st of December, that's what it's scheduled to do and anticipated to stay in place. There's always uncertainty, certainly around that. And then over the general economy, there's a lot of uncertainty that continues to exist there. Again, the good news with Brazil is because of the FX rate and the fact that those farmers do sell in U.S. dollars, and then when you convert into local currency, profitability for farmers and cash receipts in local currency have remained very strong. And so we have -- under this weakness that we've experienced in '15 and in '16, and forecasted for '16 in the equipment sales is a farmer base that financially again, is pretty strong. So if anything shifts and some of that uncertainty is removed from the market, there's certainly some potential for those farmers to step back in as well. So again, I think your point is well taken in the sense that there is a lot of uncertainty in South America, Brazil, in particular. We'll see how that develops as we go through the year."

It's down very slightly year-over-year. And again, that's more of a reflection of, as we talked about last year, 2015, it was actually higher year-over-year. And while you have fewer notes coming in because of the trade cycle slowing down, you also have fewer notes paying off early. And so the notes are extending, and so it does help sustain that portfolio balance further into the cycle. And so that's one of the -- again, one of the benefits we talk about with Financial Services. As you think about pension and OPEB, I think what I would say is candidly, it's a more accurate calculation. As you look at the method that we have chosen to change to, and so that's the reason why we decided to make that change."
