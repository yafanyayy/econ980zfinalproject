With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's Fourth Quarter 2014 Results. Please also reference our 2014 fourth quarter earnings release issued today, January 26, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast. 
As a reminder, certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. 
As mentioned in the press release, we lowered our 2015th guidance to reflect the 10% weakening in the Canadian dollar since our Analyst Meeting in November. To put this in perspective, Canada is our second largest business behind the United States, representing 11% of total company sales in 2014. Roughly 20% of our Canadian sales are tied directly to the Oil and Gas industry. Beyond our direct exposure, the Canadian economy and the Canadian dollar tend to correlate closely with Natural Resource prices, more specifically oil. Because of this, we have taken a fresh look at our expected performance in Canada based on current exchange rates and a weaker economy. As a result, we now expect 2015 sales growth of 3% to 7% and earnings per share of $12.60 to $13.60. Our 2015th guidance issued on November 12, 2014, call for sales growth of 5% to 9% and earnings per share of $12.90 to $13.80. At the end of the podcast, we will provide more color around the revised guidance. 
Before we analyze the results, let's review some highlights from full year 2014. We saw continued strong performance in the United States, with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 18.2%. As promised, we took actions to address several smaller underperforming businesses. Our single channel online model continued its strong growth, and we spent an incremental $78 million on growth and infrastructure and $387 million in gross capital spending to create long-term competitive advantage. 
With that as a backdrop, let's now take a look at our performance. Today, we reported results for the year 2014. For the full year, company sales increased 6% to $10 billion. Net earnings increased 1% to $802 million, and earnings per share increased 3% to $11.45. As described in the earnings release, the fourth quarter contained restructuring and impairment charges that lowered reported earnings by $0.66 per share. To better understand our performance, the majority of the analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effective charges in 2014 and 2013. Details regarding the charges can be found in the earnings release posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Excluding charges from 2014 and 2013, company operating earnings increased 6% for the year, while net earnings increased 4%. Adjusted earnings per share were $12.26 for the year, representing a 6% increase versus $11.52 in 2013. Adjusted EPS grew faster than net earnings due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchases. 
Now let's turn to the 2014 fourth quarter. Overall, results were within the expectations issued at our Analyst Meeting on November 12. Company sales in the fourth quarter increased 6%. Excluding the charges from 2014 and 2013, operating earnings increased 9%, while net earnings increased 6%. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.80 for the quarter, representing an increase of 8% versus the 2013 fourth quarter. 
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Adjusted gross profit margins were 42.5%, flat with the 2013 fourth quarter due to improvement in the United States, offset by gross profit declines in Canada and Fabory in Europe. On an adjusted basis, company operating earnings for the quarter increased 9%. The earnings growth was driven by the 6% sales increase and operating expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Adjusted operating expenses grew 4%, including $10 million in incremental growth-related spending. Throughout the year, we continued to invest in growth and infrastructure designed to accelerate our share gains and increase our size and scale. Incremental growth spending for the full year 2014 was $78 million versus 2013. A schedule summarizing incremental growth spending for 2011 through 2015 can be found in Exhibit 3 of this podcast. Adjusted company operating margins increased 40 basis points to 12.7% for the quarter from 12.3% a year ago. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter, the month of December and January sales so far; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance and other key items. 
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 6%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. The 6% sales growth for the quarter consisted of 7 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola-related safety products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 1 percentage point negative variance from lapping an extra month of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 from E&R Industrial Inc. 
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a group entitled Other Businesses and also include results for the single channel online model businesses in Japan, the United States and Europe. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 77% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 6%. The 6% sales growth for the quarter was driven by 6 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola-related safety products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point negative variance from the extra month of E&R sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 1 percentage points negative variance from the divestiture of several Specialty Brands on December 31, 2013. 
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Commercial and Natural Resources were up in the low-double digits. Light Manufacturing was up in the high single digits. Government and Heavy Manufacturing were up in the mid-single digits. Retail and Reseller were up in the low-single digits. And Contractor was down in the low-single digits. 
For perspective, Natural Resources represents approximately 4% of sales in the U.S. segment, with sales growth driven by Oil and Gas, and refining and mining customers. The strong performance in Commercial was driven by sales of Ebola-related safety products to healthcare customers. 
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian segment. Sales in Canada represented 11% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 3% in U.S. dollars, 11% in local currency. The 11% sales increase consisted of 7 percentage points from WFS Enterprises Inc. acquired on September 2, 2014, and a 4 percentage points increase from volume. The volume increase in Canada was led by growth to customers in the Government and Utilities end markets. 
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, and currently represents about 12% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 13% in the 2014 fourth quarter versus the prior year. This performance consisted of 21 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by an 8 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States, partially offset by lower sales from Fabory in Europe. 
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at December. There were 22 selling days in December of 2014 versus 21 in the same month of 2013. Total company sales increased 3% on a daily basis in December of 2014 versus December of 2013. The daily sales growth in December included 7 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola-related safety products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 2 percentage point negative variance from the extra month of E&R sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. In the United States, December daily sales increased 4%, driven by 8 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola-related safety products, partially offset by a 3 percentage point negative variance from the extra month of E&R sales in fourth quarter 2013, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point negative variance from divestitures. December customer end market performance in the United States excluding acquisitions was as follows: Commercial was up in the low double digits. Light Manufacturing was up in the high single digits. Heavy Manufacturing, Government and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits. And Retail, Contractor and Reseller were down in the low single digits. Similar to the quarter, the strong performance in Commercial was driven by sales of Ebola-related safety products to healthcare customers. Daily sales in Canada for December increased 2% in U.S. dollars and were up 10% in local currency. The 10% daily sales increase consisted of 7 percentage points from the WFS acquisition and a 4 percentage point increase from volume, partially offset by 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. The organic growth in Canada was driven by the Heavy and Light Manufacturing and Government end markets. Daily sales for the Other Businesses increased 7% in December, consisting of 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by an 11 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The volume growth was driven by Zoro in the United States, which grew more than 100% in the month, with sales from the businesses in Mexico and Japan grew double digits in local currency. 
Let's move on to January. Daily sales growth in the month of January is currently trending in the mid-single digits. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Since we've already reviewed operating performance, we'll discuss performance by reporting segment. As a reminder, results in this discussion exclude the charges detailed in the earnings press release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Operating earnings in the United States increased 11% versus the 2013 fourth quarter, driven by the 6% sales growth and positive expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 10 basis points, as a result of price increases exceeding cost increases, partially offset by faster growth with lower-margin customers. Operating expenses increased 4%, primarily due to productivity initiatives and lower-than-forecasted incremental investment spending of $1 million. The U.S. operating margin increased a healthy 70 basis points to 17% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings declined 27% versus the 2013 fourth quarter, down 21% in local currency. This decrease was driven by lower gross profit margins. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 280 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to product cost inflation exceeding price inflation, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, higher freight cost and lower supplier rebates as well as negative mix from the WFS acquisition. 
On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses were breakeven in the 2014 fourth quarter versus generating $3 million in earnings in the 2013 period. The decline in adjusted earnings was more than driven by incremental expenses associated with the start-up of the single channel online model business in Europe, partially offset by strong operating performance from Zoro in the United States. In addition, operating earnings growth from MonotaRO in Japan was strong in local currency, but was essentially flat in U.S. dollars. 
Other income and expense was a net expense of $5 million in the 2014 fourth quarter versus net expense of $2 million in the 2013 fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher foreign exchange transaction losses. The reported tax rate in 2014 was 42.3% for the quarter and 39.1% for the full year. Excluding the effect of items separately disclosed in other fourth quarter tax items, the tax rate was 38.2% for the quarter and the year in 2014 compared to 37.3% in the 2013 quarter and year. The increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in the United States versus geographies with lower tax rates and losses with no tax benefit. The company is currently projecting a tax rate of 37.7% to 38.8% for 2015. 
Lastly, let's take a look at our cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $297 million or 152% of adjusted net income versus $246 million in 2013. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Gross capital expenditures for the quarter were $147 million versus $124 million in 2013. We paid dividends of $76 million in the quarter, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2014. In addition, we bought back 842,000 shares of stock for $208 million and ended the quarter with 8.5 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $284 million to shareholders in the quarter. As we noted earlier, we adjusted our 2015 guidance to reflect the foreign exchange headwinds and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment in Canada and now expect sales growth of 3% to 7% and earnings per share of $12.60 to $13.60. 
Let's take a closer look at some of our assumptions for the full year and the first quarter. Keep in mind, this reflects normalized results in 2014 as a basis for comparison. We'll start with sales. For the full year, the change from our original guidance reflects lower organic growth in Canada and more headwinds from foreign exchange. The effect of foreign exchange reduces total company sales by 3% compared to 1% in our November guidance. We originally expected 5% organic sales growth in Canada and now expect 2% growth in local currency due to the weakening economy. 
Let's move on to gross profit margins. We expect flattish gross profit margins for the full year 2015 versus the full year 2014. For the first quarter, we forecast gross profit margins to be down 20 to 60 basis points versus the 2014 first quarter. As a reminder, the company's annual customer trade shows held in the first quarter typically result in gross profit margins and operating expenses that are about 100 basis points above the run rate for the full year, distorting sequential quarterly trends. 
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we still expect 0 to 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, driven by expansion in the United States and the Other Businesses, partially offset by margin contraction in Canada due to higher investment levels and challenging macroeconomic conditions. Finally, the effect of foreign currency translation, currency transaction and the macroeconomic weakness is a reduction of $0.25 per share at the midpoint of our guidance.

As a reminder, the company's annual customer trade shows held in the first quarter typically result in gross profit margins and operating expenses that are about 100 basis points above the run rate for the full year, distorting sequential quarterly trends. 
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we still expect 0 to 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, driven by expansion in the United States and the Other Businesses, partially offset by margin contraction in Canada due to higher investment levels and challenging macroeconomic conditions. Finally, the effect of foreign currency translation, currency transaction and macroeconomic weakness is a reduction of $0.25 per share at the midpoint of our guidance.

The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's fourth quarter 2014 results. Please also reference our 2014 fourth quarter earnings release issued today, January 26, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast. 
As a reminder, certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. 
As mentioned in the press release, we lowered our 2015 guidance to reflect the 10% weakening in the Canadian dollar since our Analyst Meeting in November. To put this in perspective, Canada is our second-largest business behind the United States, representing 11% of total company sales in 2014. Roughly 20% of our Canadian sales are tied directly to the Oil and Gas industry. 
Beyond our direct exposure, the Canadian economy and the Canadian dollar tend to correlate closely with natural resource prices, more specifically, oil. Because of this, we have taken a fresh look at our expected performance in Canada based on current exchange rates and a weaker economy. As a result, we now expect 2015 sales growth of 3% to 7% and earnings per share of $12.60 to $13.60. Our 2015 guidance issued on November 12, 2014, call for sales growth of 5% to 9% and earnings per share of $12.90 to $13.80. At the end of the podcast, we will provide more color around the revised guidance. 
Before we analyze the results, let's review some highlights from full year 2014. We saw continued strong performance in the United States, with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 18.2%. As promised, we took actions to address several smaller underperforming businesses. Our single-channel online model continued its strong growth. And, we spent an incremental $78 million on growth and infrastructure and $387 million in gross capital spending to create long-term competitive advantage. 
With that as a backdrop, let's now take a look at our performance. Today, we reported results for the year 2014. For the full year, company sales increased 6% to $10 billion. Net earnings increased 1% to $802 million, and earnings per share increased 3% to $11.45. As described in the earnings release, the fourth quarter contained restructuring and impairment charges that lowered reported earnings by $0.66 per share. 
To better understand our performance, the majority of the analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effective charges in 2014 and 2013. Details regarding the charges can be found in the earnings release posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Excluding charges from 2014 and 2013, company operating earnings increased 6% for the year, while net earnings increased 4%. Adjusted earnings per share were $12.26 for the year, representing a 6% increase versus $11.52 in 2013. Adjusted EPS grew faster than net earnings due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchases. 
Now let's turn to the 2014 fourth quarter. Overall, results were within the expectations issued at our Analyst Meeting on November 12. Company sales in the fourth quarter increased 6%. Excluding the charges from 2014 and 2013, operating earnings increased 9%, while net earnings increased 6%. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.80 for the quarter, representing an increase of 8% versus the 2013 fourth quarter. 
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Adjusted gross profit margins were 42.5%, flat with the 2013 fourth quarter due to improvement in the United States, offset by gross profit declines in Canada and Fabory in Europe. On an adjusted basis, company operating earnings for the quarter increased 9%. The earnings growth was driven by the 6% sales increase and operating expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Adjusted operating expenses grew 4%, including $10 million in incremental growth-related spending. 
Throughout the year, we continued to invest in growth and infrastructure designed to accelerate our share gains and increase our size and scale. Incremental growth spending for the full year 2014 was $78 million versus 2013. A schedule summarizing incremental growth spending for 2011 through 2015 can be found in Exhibit 3 of this podcast. Adjusted company operating margins increased 40 basis points to 12.7% for the quarter from 12.3% a year ago. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter, the month of December and January sales so far. Second, operating performance by segment. Third, cash generation and capital deployment. And finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance and other key items. 
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 6%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. The 6% sales growth for the quarter consisted of 7 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola-related safety products, partially offset by a 2-percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 1-percentage-point negative variance from lapping an extra month of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 from E&R Industrial, Inc. 
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a group entitled Other Businesses and also include results for the single-channel online model businesses in Japan, the United States and Europe. 
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 77% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 6%. The 6% sales growth for the quarter was driven by 6 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola-related safety products, partially offset by a 1-percentage-point negative variance from the extra month of E&R sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 1-percentage-point negative variance from the divestiture of several Specialty Brands on December 31, 2013. 
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Commercial and Natural Resources were up in the low double digits; Light Manufacturing was up in the high single digits; Government and Heavy Manufacturing were up in the mid-single digits; Retail and Reseller were up in the low single digits; and Contractor was down in the low single digits. 
For perspective, Natural Resources represents approximately 4% of sales in the U.S. segment, with sales growth driven by Oil and Gas and refining and Mining customers. The strong performance in Commercial was driven by sales of Ebola-related safety products to health care customers. 
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian segment. Sales in Canada represented 11% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 3% in U.S. dollars, 11% in local currency. The 11% sales increase consisted of 7 percentage points from WFS Enterprises Inc. acquired on September 2, 2014, and a 4-percentage-point increase from volume. The volume increase in Canada was led by growth to customers in the Government and Utilities end markets. 
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 12% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 13% in the 2014 fourth quarter versus the prior year. This performance consisted of 21 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by an 8-percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States, partially offset by lower sales from Fabory in Europe. 
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at December. There were 22 selling days in December of 2014 versus 21 in the same month of 2013. Total company sales increased 3% on a daily basis in December of 2014 versus December of 2013. The daily sales growth in December included 7 percentage points from volume and 1-percentage-point from sales of Ebola-related safety products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 2 percentage point negative variance from the extra month of E&R sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. 
In the United States, December daily sales increased 4%, driven by 8 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola-related safety products, partially offset by a 3-percentage-point negative variance from the extra month of E&R sales in fourth quarter 2013, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point negative variance from divestitures. 
December customer end market performance in the United States, excluding acquisitions, was as follows. Commercial was up in the low double digits; Light Manufacturing was up in the high single digits; Heavy Manufacturing, Government and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits; and Retail, Contractor and Reseller were down in the low single digits. 
Similar to the quarter, the strong performance in Commercial was driven by sales of Ebola-related safety products to health care customers. 
Daily sales in Canada for December increased 2% in U.S. dollars and were up 10% in local currency. The 10% daily sales increase consisted of 7 percentage points from the WFS acquisition and a 4 percentage point increase from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products. The organic growth in Canada was driven by the Heavy and Light Manufacturing and Government end markets. 
Daily sales for the Other Businesses increased 7% in December, consisting of 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by an 11 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The volume growth was driven by Zoro in the United States, which grew more than 100% in the month, while sales from the businesses in Mexico and Japan grew double digits in local currency. 
Let's move on to January. Daily sales growth in the month of January is currently trending in the mid-single digits. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Since we've already reviewed company operating performance, we'll discuss performance by reporting segment. As a reminder, results in this discussion exclude the charges detailed in the earnings press release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Operating earnings in the United States increased 11% versus the 2013 fourth quarter driven by the 6% sales growth and positive expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 10 basis points as a result of price increases exceeding cost increases, partially offset by faster growth with lower-margin customers. Operating expenses increased 4% primarily due to productivity initiatives and lower-than-forecasted incremental investment spending of $1 million. The U.S. operating margin increased a healthy 70 basis points to 17% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings declined 27% versus the 2013 fourth quarter, down 21% in local currency. This decrease was driven by lower gross profit margins. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 280 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to product cost inflation exceeding price inflation, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, higher freight costs and lower supplier rebates as well as negative mix from the WFS acquisition. 
On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses were breakeven in the 2014 fourth quarter versus generating $3 million in earnings in the 2013 period. The decline in adjusted earnings was more than driven by incremental expenses associated with the startup of the single-channel online model business in Europe, partially offset by strong operating performance from Zoro in the United States. In addition, operating earnings growth from MonotaRO in Japan was strong in local currency but was essentially flat in U.S. dollars. 
Other income and expense was a net expense of $5 million in the 2014 fourth quarter versus net expense of $2 million in the 2013 fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher foreign exchange transaction losses. 
The reported tax rate in 2014 was 42.3% for the quarter and 39.1% for the full year. Excluding the effect of items separately disclosed and other fourth quarter tax items, the tax rate was 38.2% for the quarter and the year in 2014 compared to 37.3% in the 2013 quarter and year. The increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in the United States versus geographies with lower tax rates and losses with no tax benefit. The company is currently projecting a tax rate of 37.7% to 38.8% for 2015. 
Lastly, let's take a look at our cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $297 million or 152% of adjusted net income versus $246 million in 2013. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Gross capital expenditures for the quarter were $147 million versus $124 million in 2013. 
We paid dividends of $76 million in the quarter, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2014. In addition, we bought back 842,000 shares of stock for $208 million and ended the quarter with 8.5 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $284 million to shareholders in the quarter. 
As we noted earlier, we adjusted our 2015 guidance to reflect foreign exchange headwinds and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment in Canada and now expect sales growth of 3% to 7% and earnings per share of $12.60 to $13.60. Let's take a closer look at some of our assumptions for the full year and the first quarter. Keep in mind, this reflects normalized results in 2014 as a basis for comparison. 
We'll start with sales. For the full year, the change from our original guidance reflects lower organic growth in Canada and more headwinds from foreign exchange. The effect of foreign exchange reduces total company sales by 3% compared to 1% in our November guidance. We originally expected 5% organic sales growth in Canada and now expect 2% growth in local currency due to the weakening economy. 
Let's move on to gross profit margins. We expect flattish gross profit margins for the full year 2015 versus the full year 2014. For the first quarter, we forecast gross profit margins to be down 20 to 60 basis points versus the 2014 first quarter. As a reminder, the company's annual customer trade shows held in the first quarter typically result in gross profit margins and operating expenses that are about 100 basis points above the run rate for the full year, distorting sequential quarterly trends.

In total, we returned $284 million to shareholders in the quarter. 
As we noted earlier, we adjusted our 2015 guidance to reflect foreign exchange headwinds and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment in Canada and now expect sales growth of 3% to 7% and earnings per share of $12.60 to $13.60. Let's take a closer look at some of our assumptions for the full year and the first quarter. Keep in mind, this reflects normalized results in 2014 as a basis for comparison. 
We'll start with sales. For the full year, the change from our original guidance reflects lower organic growth in Canada and more headwinds from foreign exchange. The effect of foreign exchange reduces total company sales by 3% compared to 1% in our November guidance. We originally expected 5% organic sales growth in Canada and now expect 2% growth in local currency due to the weakening economy. 
Let's move on to gross profit margins. We expect flattish gross profit margins for the full year 2015 versus the full year 2014. For the first quarter, we forecast gross profit margins to be down 20 to 60 basis points versus the 2014 first quarter. As a reminder, the company's annual customer trade shows held in the first quarter typically result in gross profit margins and operating expenses that are about 100 basis points above the run rate for the full year, distorting sequential quarterly trends. 
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we still expect 0 to 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, driven by expansion in the United States and the Other Businesses, partially offset by margin contraction in Canada due to higher investment levels and challenging macroeconomic conditions. Finally, the effect of foreign currency translation, currency transaction and macroeconomic weakness is a reduction of $0.25 per share at the midpoint of our guidance.

With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2015 second quarter results. Please also reference our 2015 second quarter earnings release issued on July 17, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this podcast. 
Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. 
Today, we reported results for the 2015 second quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year. We delivered a solid quarter from an EPS standpoint, and while our gross profit margin was less than we expected, we were able to generate positive cost leverage as an offset. 
I'd like to share with you what we are seeing in the market. We remain in a soft demand environment. Deflationary commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar and the economy in Canada continue to be headwinds. Despite all of this, we continue to gain share with customers who value a broad product offering, inventory management services, technical services and fast reliable delivery. In addition, we're growing rapidly with small customers through Zoro and MonotaRO, and remain focused on productivity to fund our growth and infrastructure investments and reduce the effect of lower gross profit margins. 
Last month, we announced that DG Macpherson will assume the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer effective August 1. We expect this move will ensure tighter coordination between operating functions, business units and business models. Also last month, we issued $1 billion in new 30-year debt. We are using the proceeds as part of our $3 billion share buyback program announced on April 16. 
Before we begin the review of results, I'd like to remind you that there were adjustments to reported results in the second quarters of both 2015 and '14. In 2015, we took $0.02 per share in charges related to restructuring at Fabory and the shutdown of the Brazil business. In 2014, we recorded a $0.15 per share charge related to the transition of Fabory's employee retirement plan in Europe.  During the 2015 second quarter, Grainger invested in a limited liability company established to produce clean energy. In addition to supporting the operations of this entity, we receive a pro rata share of energy tax credits. Tax credits earned, net of operating losses, from this investment lowered the company's effective tax rate in the 2015 second quarter and contributed approximately $0.09 per share to earnings. For the full year, energy credits are expected to result in a 1.4 percentage point reduction in the company's effective tax rate.
With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2015 second quarter. Company sales for the quarter increased 1% versus the 2014 second quarter. Excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions, organic sales increased 3%. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Reported operating earnings increased 5% or 1% adjusted. Reported net earnings increased 7%, and adjusted net earnings were up 3%. Reported earnings per share were $3.25 for the quarter, an increase of 11% versus the 2014 second quarter. Excluding the adjustments from both years, earnings per share were $3.27, up 6% versus the prior year. 
We also revised guidance for sales and earnings per share, which Bill will cover in detail at the end of the podcast. Our 2015 guidance issued on April 16, 2015, included 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $12.25 to $12.95. We now expect 2015 sales growth of 0 to 2% and earnings per share of $12 to $12.50, which includes the benefit of the energy tax credits. 
Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 50 basis points to 42.6% versus 43.1% in 2014, due primarily to faster growth with lower gross margin customers, lower supplier rebates tied to volume and price deflation versus cost inflation driven by foreign exchange. Operating expenses for the company declined 3% driven by lower payroll and benefits. The company generated $28 million of productivity savings to fund $25 million of incremental growth and infrastructure spending. Total company operating earnings were $357 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. The reported operating margin was 14.1%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the prior year. The adjusted operating margin was 14.2%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior year. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: First, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with the discussion of our 2015 guidance. 
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales. 
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 1%. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: Up 1% in April; flat in May; and up 1% in June. Results for the quarter included 1 percentage point from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 3% driven by 4 percentage points from volume partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price. 
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter increased 2%. Results for the quarter included 2 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price. 
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Government, Commercial and Light Manufacturing were up in the mid-single digits. Retail was up in the low single digits; Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the low single digits; Reseller was down in the high single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the low teens. Low oil prices continued to affect our Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the quarter. 
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 9% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales increased 2% in local currency and declined 9% in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The 2% sales increase consisted of 8 percentage points from the WFS acquisition and 4 points from price. This was partially offset by a 10 percentage point decline in volume. Based on our estimates, we believe the vast majority of the volume decline is attributable to direct and indirect exposure to oil and gas. On an organic basis, declines during the quarter in the Commercial, Oil and Gas, Retail, construction, Heavy Manufacturing, Forestry and Transportation customer end markets more than offset growth to customers in the Government, Mining, Utilities and Light Manufacturing end markets. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 18% compared to all other provinces, which were up 3% in aggregate. 
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the other businesses, which represented 13% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 7%, consisting of 21 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 14 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to the growth from the single channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO and also the business in Mexico. 
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2015 versus 21 days in the same month of 2014. Daily sales increased 1% in June versus the prior year. The daily sales increase included 1 percentage point from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic daily sales increased 3% driven by 4 percentage points from volume partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price. 
In the United States, June daily sales increased 3% driven by 3 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Light Manufacturing, Government, Retail and Commercial were up in the mid-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the low single digits; Reseller was down in the high single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the low teens. Low oil prices continued to affect our Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the month. 
Daily sales in Canada for June were up 1% in local currency and declined 11% in U.S. dollars. The local currency increase was driven by 8 percentage points from the WFS acquisition and 4 percentage points from price, partially offset by an 11 percentage point decrease in volume. As a reminder, we will anniversary the WFS acquisition on September 2, 2015. 
In Canada, on an organic basis, declines during the month in the Commercial, Oil and Gas, Retail, Construction, Heavy Manufacturing, Forestry, Light Manufacturing and Transportation customer end markets more than offset growth to customers in the Government, Mining and Utilities end markets. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 17% compared to all other provinces, which were flat to the prior year in aggregate. 
Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 6% in June, consisting of 20 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by 14 percentage points decrease from foreign exchange. The daily sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S., Japan and Mexico. Sales growth in the month of July is currently trending slightly below the growth rate reported for June. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."
276060,306109415,834191,"W.W. Grainger, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2015",2015-07-17,"Earnings Calls","W.W. Grainger, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let's talk about performance by reportable segment.

Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let's talk about performance by reportable segment. In the United States, gross profit margins for the quarter declined 70 basis points primarily driven by faster growth with larger customers, higher sales to Zoro, reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these inter-segment sales, and price deflation exceeding cost deflation. Excluding Zoro, gross profit margins were down 40 basis points versus the prior year. Operating expenses were down slightly in the quarter driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits, which offset incremental growth and infrastructure spending of $23 million. Operating earnings for the U.S. segment increased 1% in the quarter driven by the 2% sales growth and positive operating expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross profit margins. 
We also wanted to provide a mid-year update on our growth initiatives in the United States. Year-to-date, we have hired 80 sales representatives, with a plan to hire several hundred total by year end. Most of the new sellers will call on our large customers where we see additional opportunity to gain share. In addition, eCommerce represented 40% of sales in the first half of the year, up from 35% in the first half of 2014. 
Let's move on to our business in Canada. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 110 basis points versus the prior year, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States and the inventory markdowns related to the Toronto, D.C. move partially offset by price increases and higher freight revenue. Excluding WFS, gross profit margins were down 30 basis points. Operating earnings in Canada declined 51% in the 2015 second quarter driven by the 9% sales decline, lower gross profit margins and negative expense leverage.  
Because of the effect of foreign exchange, we wanted to also share Canada's results in local currency. Operating expenses in Canada increased 10% in local currency due to the WFS acquisition, relocation to the new Toronto distribution center and SAP implementation cost. As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2014, we rolled off $4 million of capitalized software development cost. Operating earnings in Canada were down 44% in local currency, representing a 330 basis point decline in operating margin. We have taken measured actions primarily in Alberta to reduce headcount and freeze open rules. 
Operating earnings in the Other Businesses were $15 million in the 2015 second quarter, which included $2 million of restructuring charges. Operating earnings in the 2014 second quarter were essentially breakeven, which included $14 million for the retirement plan transition in Europe and $2 million for the write-off of capitalized software development costs for Mexico. Adjusting for these items, earnings increased $2 million versus the prior year. The results included strong performance of our Zoro U.S. and Japan, and also included an incremental $3 million in expense for the single channel online business in Europe. 
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $8 million expense in the 2015 second quarter versus a net $2 million expense in the 2014 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense associated with $1 billion in long-term debt issued in early June bearing an interest rate of 4.6%. In addition, the investment in clean energy made during the quarter generated losses that contributed to the increase in other expense. 
Accounting guidance requires us to record the tax credit provision based on a full year estimate of the annual rate applied to the year-to-date earnings. Accordingly, the 2015 second quarter includes the benefit of half the annual energy tax credits anticipated for the year. When netted against the losses generated in the quarter, the energy investment generated $6.4 million or $0.09 per share of earnings. On a full year basis, the expected impact is also $0.09 of earnings per share. The full year estimate takes into consideration the forecasted operating loss from the date of investment, associated tax benefit and the tax credits expected for the year. The tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% compared to 38.2% in the 2014 second quarter. Excluding the benefit of the energy tax credits for the first quarter of 2015 recorded in the second quarter, the tax rate for the 2015 second quarter was 36.9%. In comparison, the 2014 second quarter reflected a higher tax rate due to the effect of the retirement plan transition in Europe. Excluding the retirement plan transition cost, the tax rate was 37.7% in the 2014 second quarter. The company expects to benefit from the energy tax credits going forward, and is currently projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 36.6% to 37.2% for 2015. 
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $213 million versus $161 million in 2014. On April 16, 2015, the company announced a plan to repurchase $3 billion of stock over the next 3 years. In June, the company issued $1 billion in new 30-year debt to fund part of the share repurchase program. The net EPS impact of the buyback in the quarter was negative by $0.01 as the borrowing cost exceeded the share repurchase benefit. We continue to expect $0.08 to $0.12 per share benefit for the full year. We bought back 1.3 million shares of stock for $293 million in the second quarter, and ended the quarter with 13.7 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization.  Grainger returned a total of $373 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $80 million in dividends, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. Capital expenditures were $71 million in the quarter versus $90 million in the second quarter of 2014. While we still anticipate full year capital spending of $375 million to $425 million, we are likely to be at the low end of that range, spending will be back half weighted as the investment in the new distribution center in the northeast picks up. 
As reported in our 2015 second quarter earnings release, we revised our 2015 sales and earnings per share guidance to reflect a softer top line, lower gross profit margins and a lower effective tax rate. For the full year 2015, we now expect 0 to 2% sales growth and earnings per share of $12 to $12.50. This guidance assumes incremental growth spending of $150 million, although we are currently assessing our spending plan for the back half of the year given the tender of business. 
Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. We now expect sales to be flat to up 2%. This compares to our April guidance of 1% to 4%, and reflects a weaker economy and lower-than-expected sales in Oil and Gas and Heavy Manufacturing in both the United States and Canada. We've also revised our full year price realization estimate to negative 1% versus flat given the current deflationary environment. From an organic gross perspective, the midpoint of our sales guidance anticipates second half sales consistent with our second quarter results. The low end of our sales guidance at 0 is based on further weakness in the economy, Oil and Gas and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. And as a reminder, we anniversary-ed the WFS acquisition at the beginning of September. 
Moving on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we now expect gross profit margins to be down about 60 basis points. For the back half of 2015, we are expecting gross profit margins to contract about 60 to 80 basis points versus 2014. Gross profit margin compression in the second half is slightly worse than the second quarter as we lap prior year pricing actions. 
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we expect our operating margin to be down between 40 and 70 basis points, depending on volume. Growth and infrastructure investments will continue with the expectation of fueling market share gains. In the back half of the year, we intend to drive continued productivity and manage expenses to fund the incremental growth and infrastructure spending. However, margins versus the second half of 2014 are forecasted to decline 90 to 110 basis points primarily due to the anticipation of back half weighted growth spending. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information. 
The other interest and expense section of the income statement will look dramatically different going forward. Interest expense will increase in the second half of the year due to the new $1 billion debt offering, which carries a 4.6% interest rate. Also the loss from the clean energy investment is expected to be $9 million to $11 million per quarter for the third and fourth quarters. 
Finally, earnings per share. As noted in our revised guidance, we now expect EPS of $12 to $12.50, reflecting the headwind from the economy and the expected margin compression from lower gross profit margins and continued growth and infrastructure spending, partially offset by our productivity programs. As a reminder, similar to April guidance, our new EPS guidance reflects the benefit of the $0.08 to $0.12 of accretion from the $1 billion in incremental share repurchases in 2015. All of which should be realized in the back half of the year. Finally, our EPS guidance includes the lower tax rate of 36.6% to 37.2% for the full year. 
Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On August 13, we plan to release July sales. On August 19, Paul Miller, Vice President of Global E-commerce, Customer Information and Innovation, will present at the ITG Industrial Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And finally, we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on November 12, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois.

Our 2015 guidance issued on April 16, 2015, included 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $12.25 to $12.95.

Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 50 basis points to 42.6% versus 43.1% in 2014, due primarily to faster growth with lower gross margin customers, lower supplier rebates tied to volume and price deflation versus cost inflation driven by foreign exchange. Operating expenses for the company declined 3%, driven by lower payroll and benefits. The company generated $28 million of productivity savings to fund $25 million of incremental growth and infrastructure spending. Total company operating earnings were $357 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. The reported operating margin was 14.1%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the prior year. The adjusted operating margin was 14.2%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior year.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance.
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 1%. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: up 1% in April, flat in May and up 1% in June. Results for the quarter included 1 percentage point from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange.

Results for the quarter included 2 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Government, Commercial and Light Manufacturing were up in the mid-single digits; Retail was up in the low single digits; Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the low single digits; Reseller was down in the high single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the low teens.
Low oil prices continued to affect our Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the quarter.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 9% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales increased 2% in local currency and declined 9% in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The 2% sales increase consisted of 8 percentage points from the WFS acquisition and 4 points from price. This was partially offset by a 10 percentage point decline in volume. Based on our estimates, we believe the vast majority of the volume decline is attributable to direct and indirect exposure to oil and gas. On an organic basis, declines during the quarter in the Commercial, Oil and Gas, Retail, Construction, Heavy Manufacturing, Forestry and Transportation customer end markets more than offset growth to customers in the Government, Mining, Utilities and Light Manufacturing end markets. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 18% compared to all other provinces, which were up 3% in aggregate.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 13% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 7%, consisting of 21 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 14 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to the growth from the single-channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO and also the business in Mexico.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2015 versus 21 days in the same month of 2014. Daily sales increased 1% in June versus the prior year.

Low oil prices continued to affect our Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the month.
Daily sales in Canada for June were up 1% in local currency and declined 11% in U.S. dollars. The local currency increase was driven by 8 percentage points from the WFS acquisition and 4 percentage points from price, partially offset by an 11 percentage point decrease in volume. As a reminder, we will anniversary the WFS acquisition on September 2, 2015.
In Canada, on an organic basis, declines during the month in the Commercial, Oil and Gas, Retail, Construction, Heavy Manufacturing, Forestry, Light Manufacturing and Transportation customer end markets more than offset growth to customers in the Government, Mining and Utilities end markets. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 17% compared to all other provinces, which were flat to the prior year in aggregate.
Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 6% in June, consisting of 20 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by 14 percentage points decrease from foreign exchange. The daily sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S., Japan and Mexico. Sales growth in the month of July is currently trending slightly below the growth rate reported for June.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let's talk about performance by reportable segment.In the United States, gross profit margins for the quarter declined 70 basis points, primarily driven by faster growth with l",1654,"Thanks, Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let's talk about performance by reportable segment.
In the United States, gross profit margins for the quarter declined 70 basis points, primarily driven by faster growth with larger customers, higher sales to Zoro, reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these intersegment sales, and price deflation exceeding cost deflation. Excluding Zoro, gross profit margins were down 40 basis points versus the prior year. Operating expenses were down slightly in the quarter, driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits, which offset incremental growth and infrastructure spending of $23 million. Operating earnings for the U.S. segment increased 1% in the quarter, driven by the 2% sales growth and positive operating expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross profit margins.
We also wanted to provide a midyear update on our growth initiatives in the United States. Year-to-date, we have hired 80 sales representatives, with a plan to hire several hundred total by year-end. Most of the new sellers will call on our large customers where we see additional opportunity to gain share. In addition, eCommerce represented 40% of sales in the first half of the year, up from 35% in the first half of 2014.
Let's move on to our business in Canada. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 110 basis points versus the prior year, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States and the inventory markdowns related to the Toronto, D.C. move, partially offset by price increases and higher freight revenue. Excluding WFS, gross profit margins were down 30 basis points. Operating earnings in Canada declined 51% in the 2015 second quarter, driven by the 9% sales decline, lower gross profit margins and negative expense leverage.
Because of the effect of foreign exchange, we wanted to also share Canada's results in local currency. Operating expenses in Canada increased 10% in local currency due to the WFS acquisition, relocation to the new Toronto distribution center and SAP implementation costs. As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2014, we wrote off $4 million of capitalized software development costs. Operating earnings in Canada were down 44% in local currency, representing a 330 basis point decline in operating margin. We have taken measured actions primarily in Alberta to reduce headcount and freeze open roles.
Operating earnings in the Other Businesses were $15 million in the 2015 second quarter, which included $2 million of restructuring charges. Operating earnings in the 2014 second quarter were essentially breakeven, which included $14 million for the retirement plan transition in Europe and $2 million for the write-off of capitalized software development costs for Mexico. Adjusting for these items, earnings increased $2 million versus the prior year. The results included strong performance for Zoro U.S. and Japan and also included an incremental $3 million in expense for the single-channel online business in Europe.
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $8 million expense in the 2015 second quarter versus a net $2 million expense in the 2014 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense associated with the $1 billion in long-term debt issued in early June bearing an interest rate of 4.6%. In addition, the investment in clean energy made during the quarter generated losses that contributed to the increase in other expense.
Accounting guidance requires us to record the tax credit provision based on a full year estimate of the annual rate applied to the year-to-date earnings. Accordingly, the 2015 second quarter includes the benefit of half the annual energy tax credits anticipated for the year. When netted against the losses generated in the quarter, the energy investment generated $6.4 million or $0.09 per share of earnings. On a full year basis, the expected impact is also $0.09 of earnings per share. The full year estimate takes into consideration the forecasted operating loss from the date of investment, associated tax benefit and the tax credits expected for the year.
The tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% compared to 38.2% in the 2014 second quarter. Excluding the benefit of the energy tax credits for the first quarter of 2015 recorded in the second quarter, the tax rate for the 2015 second quarter was 36.9%. In comparison, the 2014 second quarter reflected a higher tax rate due to the effect of the retirement plan transition in Europe. Excluding the retirement plan transition cost, the tax rate was 37.7% in the 2014 second quarter. The company expects to benefit from the energy tax credits going forward and is currently projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 36.6% to 37.2% for 2015.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $213 million versus $161 million in 2014. On April 16, 2015, the company announced a plan to repurchase $3 billion of stock over the next 3 years. In June, the company issued $1 billion in new 30-year debt to fund part of the share repurchase program. The net EPS impact of the buyback in the quarter was negative by $0.01 as the borrowing costs exceeded the share repurchase benefit. We continue to expect $0.08 to $0.12 per share benefit for the full year. We bought back 1.3 million shares of stock for $293 million in the second quarter and ended the quarter with 13.7 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Grainger returned a total of $373 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $80 million in dividends, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. Capital expenditures were $71 million in the quarter versus $90 million in the second quarter of 2014. While we still anticipate full year capital spending of $375 million to $425 million, we are likely to be at the low end of that range. Spending will be back-half weighted as the investment in the new distribution center in the northeast picks up.
As reported in our 2015 second quarter earnings release, we revised our 2015 sales and earnings per share guidance to reflect a softer top line, lower gross profit margins and a lower effective tax rate. For the full year 2015, we now expect 0 to 2% sales growth and earnings per share of $12 to $12.50. This guidance assumes incremental growth spending of $150 million, although we are currently assessing our spending plan for the back half of the year given the tenor of business.
Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. We now expect sales to be flat to up 2%. This compares to our April guidance of 1% to 4% and reflects a weaker economy and lower-than-expected sales in Oil and Gas and Heavy Manufacturing in both the United States and Canada. We've also revised our full year price realization estimate to negative 1% versus flat given the current deflationary environment. From an organic growth perspective, the midpoint of our sales guidance anticipates second half sales consistent with our second quarter results. The low end of our sales guidance at 0 is based on further weakness in the economy, oil and gas and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. And as a reminder, we anniversary the WFS acquisition at the beginning of September.
Moving on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we now expect gross profit margins to be down about 60 basis points. For the back half of 2015, we are expecting gross profit margins to contract about 60 to 80 basis points versus 2014. Gross profit margin compression in the second half is slightly worse than the second quarter as we lap prior year pricing actions.
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we expect our operating margin to be down between 40 and 70 basis points, depending on volume. Growth and infrastructure investments will continue with the expectation of fueling market share gains. In the back half of the year, we intend to drive continued productivity and manage expenses to fund the incremental growth and infrastructure spending. However, margins versus the second half of 2014 are forecasted to decline 90 to 110 basis points, primarily due to the anticipation of back-half weighted growth spending. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information.
The other interest and expense section of the income statement will look dramatically different going forward. Interest expense will increase in the second half of the year due to the new $1 billion debt offering, which carries a 4.6% interest rate. Also, the loss from the clean energy investment is expected to be $9 million to $11 million per quarter for the third and fourth quarters.
Finally, earnings per share. As noted in our revised guidance, we now expect EPS of $12 to $12.50, reflecting the headwinds from the economy and the expected margin compression from lower gross profit margins and continued growth and infrastructure spending, partially offset by our productivity programs.
As a reminder, similar to April guidance, our new EPS guidance reflects the benefit of the $0.08 to $0.12 of accretion from the $1 billion in incremental share repurchases in 2015, all of which should be realized in the back half of the year. Finally, our EPS guidance includes the lower tax rate of 36.6% to 37.2% for the full year.
Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On August 13, we plan to release July sales. On August 19, Paul Miller, Vice President of Global E-commerce, Customer Information and Innovation, will present at the ITG Industrial Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And finally, we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on November 12, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois.

With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2015 second quarter results. Please also reference our 2015 second quarter earnings release issued on July 17, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this podcast.
Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.
Today, we reported results for the 2015 second quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year. We delivered a solid quarter from an EPS standpoint, and while our gross profit margin was less than we expected, we were able to generate positive cost leverage as an offset.
I'd like to share with you what we are seeing in the market. We remain in a soft demand environment. Deflationary commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar and the economy in Canada continue to be headwinds. Despite all of this, we continue to gain share with customers who value a broad product offering, inventory management services, technical services and fast reliable delivery. In addition, we're growing rapidly with small customers through Zoro and MonotaRO. And we remain focused on productivity to fund our growth and infrastructure investments and reduce the effect of lower gross profit margins.
Last month, we announced that D.G. Macpherson will assume the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer effective August 1. We expect this move will ensure tighter coordination between operating functions, business units and business models. Also last month, we issued $1 billion in new 30-year debt. We are using the proceeds as part of our $3 billion share buyback program announced on April 16.
Before we begin the review of results, I'd like to remind you that there were adjustments to reported results in the second quarters of both 2015 and '14. In 2015, we took $0.02 per share in charges related to restructuring at Fabory and the shutdown of the Brazil business. In 2014, we recorded a $0.15 per share charge related to the transition of Fabory's employee retirement plan in Europe.
During the 2015 second quarter, Grainger invested in a limited liability company established to produce clean energy. In addition to supporting the operations of this entity, we receive a pro rata share of energy tax credits. Tax credits earned, net of operating losses, from this investment lowered the company's effective tax rate in the 2015 second quarter and contributed approximately $0.09 per share to earnings. For the full year, energy credits are expected to result in a 1.4 percentage point reduction in the company's effective tax rate.
With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2015 second quarter. Company sales for the quarter increased 1% versus the 2014 second quarter. Excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions, organic sales increased 3%. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Reported operating earnings increased 5%, or 1% adjusted. Reported net earnings increased 7%, and adjusted net earnings were up 3%. Reported earnings per share were $3.25 for the quarter, an increase of 11% versus the 2014 second quarter. Excluding the adjustments from both years, earnings per share were $3.27, up 6% versus the prior year.
We also revised guidance for sales and earnings per share, which Bill will cover in detail at the end of the podcast. Our 2015 guidance issued on April 16, 2015, included 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $12.25 to $12.95. We now expect 2015 sales growth of 0% to 2% and earnings per share of $12 to $12.50, which includes the benefit of the energy tax credits.
Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 50 basis points to 42.6% versus 43.1% in 2014, due primarily to faster growth with lower gross margin customers, lower supplier rebates tied to volume and price deflation versus cost inflation driven by foreign exchange. Operating expenses for the company declined 3%, driven by lower payroll and benefits. The company generated $28 million of productivity savings to fund $25 million of incremental growth and infrastructure spending. Total company operating earnings were $357 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. The reported operating margin was 14.1%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the prior year. The adjusted operating margin was 14.2%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior year.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance.
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 1%. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: up 1% in April, flat in May and up 1% in June. Results for the quarter included 1 percentage point from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 3%, driven by 4 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses.
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 2%. Results for the quarter included 2 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Government, Commercial and Light Manufacturing were up in the mid-single digits; Retail was up in the low single digits; Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the low single digits; Reseller was down in the high single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the low teens.
Low oil prices continued to affect our Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the quarter.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 9% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales increased 2% in local currency and declined 9% in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The 2% sales increase consisted of 8 percentage points from the WFS acquisition and 4 points from price. This was partially offset by a 10 percentage point decline in volume. Based on our estimates, we believe the vast majority of the volume decline is attributable to direct and indirect exposure to oil and gas. On an organic basis, declines during the quarter in the Commercial, Oil and Gas, Retail, Construction, Heavy Manufacturing, Forestry and Transportation customer end markets more than offset growth to customers in the Government, Mining, Utilities and Light Manufacturing end markets. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 18% compared to all other provinces, which were up 3% in aggregate.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 13% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 7%, consisting of 21 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 14 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to the growth from the single-channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO and also the business in Mexico.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2015 versus 21 days in the same month of 2014. Daily sales increased 1% in June versus the prior year. The daily sales increase included 1 percentage point from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic daily sales increased 3%, driven by 4 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price.
In the United States, June daily sales increased 3%, driven by 3 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Light Manufacturing, Government, Retail and Commercial were up in the mid-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the low single digits; Reseller was down in the high single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the low teens.
Low oil prices continued to affect our Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the month.
Daily sales in Canada for June were up 1% in local currency and declined 11% in U.S. dollars. The local currency increase was driven by 8 percentage points from the WFS acquisition and 4 percentage points from price, partially offset by an 11 percentage point decrease in volume. As a reminder, we will anniversary the WFS acquisition on September 2, 2015.
In Canada, on an organic basis, declines during the month in the Commercial, Oil and Gas, Retail, Construction, Heavy Manufacturing, Forestry, Light Manufacturing and Transportation customer end markets more than offset growth to customers in the Government, Mining and Utilities end markets. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 17% compared to all other provinces, which were flat to the prior year in aggregate.
Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 6% in June, consisting of 20 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by 14 percentage points decrease from foreign exchange. The daily sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S., Japan and Mexico. Sales growth in the month of July is currently trending slightly below the growth rate reported for June.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

The gross profit margin in Canada declined 110 basis points versus the prior year, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States and the inventory markdowns related to the Toronto DC move, partially offset by price increases and higher freight revenue. Excluding WFS, gross profit margins were down 30 basis points. Operating earnings in Canada declined 51% in the 2015 second quarter, driven by the 9% sales decline, lower gross profit margins and negative expense leverage.
Because of the effect of foreign exchange, we wanted to also share Canada's results in local currency. Operating expenses in Canada increased 10% in local currency due to the WFS acquisition, relocation to the new Toronto distribution center and SAP implementation costs. As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2014, we wrote off $4 million of capitalized software development costs. Operating earnings in Canada were down 44% in local currency, representing a 330 basis point decline in operating margin. We have taken measured actions primarily in Alberta to reduce headcount and freeze open roles.
Operating earnings in the Other Businesses were $15 million in the 2015 second quarter, which included $2 million of restructuring charges. Operating earnings in the 2014 second quarter were essentially breakeven, which included $14 million for the retirement plan transition in Europe and $2 million for the write-off of capitalized software development costs for Mexico. Adjusting for these items, earnings increased $2 million versus the prior year. The results included strong performance for Zoro U.S. and Japan, and also included an incremental $3 million in expense for the single-channel online business in Europe.
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $8 million expense in the 2015 second quarter versus a net $2 million expense in the 2014 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense associated with the $1 billion in long-term debt issued in early June bearing an interest rate of 4.6%. In addition, the investment in clean energy made during the quarter generated losses that contributed to the increase in other expense.
Accounting guidance requires us to record the tax credit provision based on a full year estimate of the annual rate applied to the year-to-date earnings. Accordingly, the 2015 second quarter includes the benefit of half the annual energy tax credits anticipated for the year. When netted against the losses generated in the quarter, the energy investment generated $6.4 million or $0.09 per share of earnings. On a full year basis, the expected impact is also $0.09 of earnings per share. The full year estimate takes into consideration the forecasted operating loss from the date of investment, associated tax benefit and the tax credits expected for the year.
The tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% compared to 38.2% in the 2014 second quarter. Excluding the benefit of the energy tax credits for the first quarter of 2015 recorded in the second quarter, the tax rate for the 2015 second quarter was 36.9%. In comparison, the 2014 second quarter reflected a higher tax rate due to the effect of the retirement plan transition in Europe. Excluding the retirement plan transition cost, the tax rate was 37.7% in the 2014 second quarter. The company expects to benefit from the energy tax credits going forward and is currently projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 36.6% to 37.2% for 2015.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $213 million versus $161 million in 2014. On April 16, 2015, the company announced a plan to repurchase $3 billion of stock over the next 3 years. In June, the company issued $1 billion in new 30-year debt to fund part of the share repurchase program. The net EPS impact of the buyback in the quarter was negative by $0.01 as the borrowing costs exceeded the share repurchase benefit. We continue to expect $0.08 to $0.12 per share benefit for the full year. We bought back 1.3 million shares of stock for $293 million in the second quarter and ended the quarter with 13.7 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Grainger returned a total of $373 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $80 million in dividends, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. Capital expenditures were $71 million in the quarter versus $90 million in the second quarter of 2014. While we still anticipate full year capital spending of $375 million to $425 million, we are likely to be at the low end of that range. Spending will be back-half weighted as the investment in the new distribution center in the northeast picks up.
As reported in our 2015 second quarter earnings release, we revised our 2015 sales and earnings per share guidance to reflect a softer top line, lower gross profit margins and a lower effective tax rate. For the full year 2015, we now expect 0% to 2% sales growth and earnings per share of $12 to $12.50. This guidance assumes incremental growth spending of $150 million, although we are currently assessing our spending plan for the back half of the year given the tenor of business.
Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. We now expect sales to be flat to up 2%. This compares to our April guidance of 1% to 4% and reflects a weaker economy and lower-than-expected sales in Oil and Gas and Heavy Manufacturing in both the United States and Canada. We've also revised our full year price realization estimate to negative 1% versus flat given the current deflationary environment. From an organic growth perspective, the midpoint of our sales guidance anticipates second half sales consistent with our second quarter results. The low end of our sales guidance at 0 is based on further weakness in the economy, oil and gas and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. And as a reminder, we anniversary the WFS acquisition at the beginning of September.
Moving on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we now expect gross profit margins to be down about 60 basis points. For the back half of 2015, we are expecting gross profit margins to contract about 60 to 80 basis points versus 2014. Gross profit margin compression in the second half is slightly worse than the second quarter as we lap prior year pricing actions.
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we expect our operating margin to be down between 40 and 70 basis points, depending on volume. Growth and infrastructure investments will continue with the expectation of fueling market share gains. In the back half of the year, we intend to drive continued productivity and manage expenses to fund the incremental growth and infrastructure spending. However, margins versus the second half of 2014 are forecasted to decline 90 to 110 basis points, primarily due to the anticipation of back-half weighted growth spending. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information.
The other interest and expense section of the income statement will look dramatically different going forward. Interest expense will increase in the second half of the year due to the new $1 billion debt offering, which carries a 4.6% interest rate. Also, the loss from the clean energy investment is expected to be $9 million to $11 million per quarter for the third and fourth quarters.
Finally, earnings per share. As noted in our revised guidance, we now expect EPS of $12 to $12.50, reflecting the headwinds from the economy and the expected margin compression from lower gross profit margins and continued growth and infrastructure spending, partially offset by our productivity programs.
As a reminder, similar to April guidance, our new EPS guidance reflects the benefit of the $0.08 to $0.12 of accretion from the $1 billion in incremental share repurchases in 2015, all of which should be realized in the back half of the year. Finally, our EPS guidance includes the lower tax rate of 36.6% to 37.2% for the full year.

With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2015 Third Quarter Results. To supplement this podcast, please also reference our 2015 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website. 
Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risks and uncertainty. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. 
I'd like to begin by providing some context regarding the current environment for industrial companies. We've talked about the impact of oil and gas prices, the strong U.S. dollar and China's economic slowdown on our performance. In addition, the performance of the following key indicators over the past 12 months further illustrate these challenges. The ISM Purchasing Managers Index was 50.2 in September, down versus last year, indicating an economy no longer in expansion mode overall. The industrial production index has fallen for most of the year as well. The Canadian dollar has fallen 21%. Copper prices are down 22%. Cold rolled steel prices are down 25%, and crude oil prices are down 60%. The drop in the price of raw materials underscores the weak demand environment and oversupply of commodities and, in many cases, the weaknesses sped up in the fast 3 months. As these economic indicators decline, we've seen that downturn take hold in the industrial economy. In response, we have begun the process of bringing our cost structure in line with current trends and activity levels. We announced the closure of 26 branches and eliminated 170 field positions in the United States. In Canada, we have eliminated more than 100 roles and closed 4 branches since the beginning of June. We have substantially completed the closure of our business in Brazil. We continue to restructure our Fabory business in Europe, which is expected to be completed this year, and we decided to transition our business in Costa Rica from a local branch-based model to being served via our U.S.-based export operations. These actions resulted in $0.11 charged to earnings per share in the quarter. You can expect more actions in the fourth quarter and into next year. 
At the same time, we took advantage of our strong financial position to invest in the future growth and performance of the business as follows. We added more than 100 sales representatives in the third quarter and 300 year-to-date to better serve and penetrate large customers. We created a team to focus solely on our medium-sized business; we acquired Cromwell Group Holdings Ltd. in the U.K. to further our growth in attractive MRO markets and leverage our Internet expertise; we took advantage of our improved capital structure and weakness in the stock market to aggressively buy back stock; and we have made investments that lower our tax rate. You can expect us to share additional information at our Analyst Meeting on November 12. 
So let's take a look at our 2015 third quarter results and our revised sales and earnings guidance. Please note that the following announcement excludes the $0.11 per share of charges unless specifically noted. Please see Exhibit 1 for detail on these charges. Company sales declined 1%. Operating earnings were down 9%. Net earnings decreased 13%, reflecting higher interest expense. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.03 for the quarter, a decrease of 8% versus the 2014 third quarter. 
Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement on an adjusted basis. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 110 basis points to 41.9% versus 43% in 2014, primarily driven by faster-growth, lower-margin customers, lower supplier rebates tied to lower-than-expected volume and price deflation versus slight cost inflation due to the higher cost of imported U.S.-sourced products for the business in Canada. Operating expenses, excluding charges, were down 1% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits and included $43 million in incremental growth and infrastructure-related spending versus the 2014 third quarter. Company operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 13.9% versus 15% in the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance and other key items. 
As I mentioned, total company sales for the quarter were down 1%. This sales performance included 2 percentage points from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from unfavorable foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat, consisting of 1 percentage point from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price. By month, daily sales declined 1% in July, 2% in August and were flat in September. Sales in September included a 4 percentage point contribution from Cromwell. 
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under the group entitled Other Businesses. Sales in the U.S. segment, which accounted for 78% of total company revenues in the quarter, were flat. It is comprised of 1 percentage point from intercompany sales to Zoro and a 1 percentage point decline from price. Daily sales increased 1% in July, were flat in August and declined 2% in September. 
Let's review U.S. sales performance by customer and market for the quarter. Commercial, Light Manufacturing, Retail and Government were up in the low single digits. Contractor was down in the low single digits. Heavy Manufacturing and Reseller were down in the mid-single digits, and Natural Resources was down in the high-teens. Low oil prices continued to affect our Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of the relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the quarter. 
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 8% of total company revenues in the quarter and decreased 23%, down 8% in local currency. The 8% sales increase consisted of a 17 percentage point decline from volume, partially offset by 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 5 percentage points from price. Sales performance in Canada was driven by declines in the Construction, Oil and Gas, Retail, Commercial, Transportation, Government and Heavy and Light Manufacturing end markets. By month, daily sales in local currency declined 4% in July, 7% in August and 13% in September. We also the lapped the acquisition of WFS Enterprises Incorporated on September 2. 
Let's wrap up our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. The Other Businesses represented 14% of total company sales in the quarter. Sales for this group were up 18% and consisted of 12 percentage points of growth from the Cromwell acquisition and 22 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 16 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily driven by the single channel online businesses in Japan and in the United States. 
Earlier in the quarter, reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September 2015, the same as the prior year. Company sales were flat in September of 2015 versus September 2014. The sales performance included 4 percentage points from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. September was the first month to include sales from Cromwell and we lapped the WFS acquisition. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales declined 1%, primarily driven by lower volume. In the United States, September sales declined 2%, which included a 2 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales to Zoro. 
Let's review sales performance by customer and market in the United States for the month of September. Government was up in the mid-single digits. Light Manufacturing and Commercial were up in the low single digits. Retail was down in the low single digits. Contractor Reseller and Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits. Natural Resources was down in the low 20s. In the Government end market, we saw strong performance from state customers as we focus on 2 large departments of state budgets: the Department of Corrections and the Department of Transportation. For the month of September, the direct and indirect effect of the energy sector accelerated to a 2% drag on sales. 
Sales in Canada for September declined 28% in U.S. dollars and were down 13% in local currency. The 13% decrease consisted of an 18 percentage point decrease from volume, partially offset by 5 percentage points from price. On an organic basis, sales performance was driven by declines in the Construction, Oil and Gas, Commercial, Light and Heavy Manufacturing, Retail and Transportation end markets, partially offset by growth in the Utilities, Government, Mining and Forestry end markets. Sales for our Other Businesses increased 40% in September, consisting of 36 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition and 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 14 percentage point drag from unfavorable foreign exchange from the Other Businesses. Similar to the quarter, organic sales growth in September was driven by the single channel online businesses in Japan and the United States. 
Daily sales in the month of October are currently down in the low single digits, including the benefit from Cromwell. Excluding Cromwell, sales performance is currently down in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, October 2014 included 1% of sales from Ebola-related products. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reportable segment. As a reminder, all the figures exclude the $0.11 per share of charges unless specifically noted. 
Operating earnings in the United States decreased 5% versus the 2014 third quarter. This performance was driven by lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 120 basis points versus the prior year, primarily driven by price deflation exceeding cost deflation and higher sales to Zoro, reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these intercompany sales. Excluding Zoro, gross profit margins were down 90 basis points versus the prior year. Operating expenses decreased 2% in the quarter versus the prior year. Expenses were driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits, which were partially offset by incremental growth in infrastructure spending of $30 million. The operating margin for the U.S. segment decreased 80 basis points to 18.1% versus 18.9% in the prior year. In the absence of the growth spending, we realized attractive operating leverage. 
Let's move on to results for our business in Canada adjusted for restructuring. Operating earnings were down 83% in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The lower operating performance was primarily the result of lower sales, lower gross profit margins and higher operating expenses as a percent of sales, driven by incremental cost from the WFS acquisition and SAP implementation. Gross profit margins declined 130 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange from products from U.S.-based suppliers and the lower margins at WFS, partially offset by price increases. The operating margin in Canada for the third quarter was 2.2% versus 9.9% in the prior year. Incremental cost from the SAP implementation were $6 million in U.S. dollars. Excluding SAP cost, operating earnings were down 61% in U.S. dollars and the operating margin was 5%. 
On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses generated $15 million in operating earnings in the 2015 third quarter versus $5 million in the 2014 third quarter. The operating earnings increase for the quarter versus the prior year was driven by strong results from the single channel businesses in Japan and the United States and included a $2 million contribution from Cromwell, partially offset by an incremental $2 million in start-up costs for the single channel online business in Europe. Other income and expense was a net $21 million expense in the 2015 third quarter versus a net $3 million expense in the 2014 third quarter. The increase in expense was driven by $12 million in higher net interest expense and $6 million in losses on the company's clean energy investment. The incremental $12 million in net interest expense was driven by the $1 billion in long-term debt issued in June to buy back company shares. Beyond 2015, the company intends to issue new permanent debt of $400 million in both 2016 and 2017 to continue the share buyback program as announced in April. Our investment in a limited liability company established to produce clean energy generated loss of $6 million in the quarter. As part of supporting the operations of this entity, Grainger receives its shares of energy tax credits. For the full year, energy credits are expected to result in a reduction of approximately 1.3 percentage point in the company's effective tax rate. The company's tax rate for the quarter was 38.4% compared to 39.1% in the 2014 third quarter. The lower tax rate in 2015 reflects the benefit of the energy tax credits, partially offset by a higher proportion of earnings from the United States versus other jurisdictions with the lower tax rates. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 37.2% to 37.6% for the full year 2015. 
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $366 million versus $329 million in 2014. The company used the cash generated and cash on hand to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $82 million versus $84 million in 2014. Our full year capital spending range is now $300 million to $350 million, driven by postponing the construction of a new distribution center, moving SAP and Canada to 2016 and the timing of other supply chain infrastructure projects. We paid dividends of $77 million, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. In addition, we bought back 3.4 million shares of stock for $735 million and ended the quarter with 10.3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $82 million to shareholders in the quarter. 
As reported in our 2015 third quarter earnings release, we lowered our sales and earnings guidance for the year given the performance to date and the expectation of continued economic weakness. With the change in the industrial economy, our guidance reflects what we're seeing in our customers' business. 
Let's take a look at our current expectations. All figures include Cromwell, and all comparisons are to prior year unless otherwise noted. We'll begin with sales. For the full year, we now expect sales growth in the range of down 0.5% to up 0.5%. Excluding Cromwell, we expect sales to be down 2% to down 1%. For the fourth quarter, the new guidance implies a sales range of down 3% to up 0.5% sales growth. Excluding Cromwell, we expect sales to be down 7% to down 4% in the quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, we up against difficult comps as 2014 included a 1 percentage point lift from sales of Ebola-related safety products. 
Let's move on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we are forecasting gross margin contraction of about 80 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to decrease 150 basis points. The price deflation and the mix of faster growth with lower-margin customers are driving the decrease. The Cromwell acquisition also contributes lower gross profit margins by 20 basis points. 
Let's take a look at operating margins, which are adjusted to exclude charges. Keep in mind, these margins are inclusive of the gross profit factors discussed above. For the full year, we expect operating margin contraction of 85 to 100 basis points. This includes incremental growth in the infrastructure spending for the year at the high end of our range as detailed in Exhibit 4. For the fourth quarter, we're expecting operating margin contraction of 195 to 250 basis points. The contraction in gross margin drives most of the change, with the lack of operating expense leverage a factor based on a more conservative view of sales volume. Cromwell represents about a 50 basis point drag on operating margin in the quarter due to mix and eCommerce-related investments. 
Next, the tax rate. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 37.2% to 37.6% for the full year and for the 2015 fourth quarter. This range is higher than we forecasted in July because earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions represent a lower of company earnings. Clean energy investments are expected to contribute $0.09 per share to earnings in the full year. 
Please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On Thursday, November 12, we plan to release October sales, and we will host our annual Analyst Meeting at our headquarters in Lake Forest. On Tuesday, November 17, Bill Womacks, Vice President and Controller; and Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations, will participate in the Barclays Select Series Industrial Distribution Forum in New York City.

You can expect us to share additional information at our Analyst Meeting on November 12. 
So let's take a look at our 2015 third quarter results and our revised sales and earnings guidance. Please note that the following analysis excludes the $0.11 per share of charges, unless specifically noted. Please see Exhibit 1 for detail on these charges. Company sales declined 1%. Operating earnings were down 9%. Net earnings decreased 13%, reflecting higher interest expense. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.03 for the quarter, a decrease of 8% versus the 2014 third quarter. 
Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement on an adjusted basis. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 110 basis points to 41.9% versus 43% in 2014, primarily driven by faster growth with lower-margin customers, lower supplier rebates tied to lower-than-expected volume and price deflation versus slight cost inflation due to the higher cost of imported U.S.-sourced products for the business in Canada. Operating expenses, excluding charges, were down 1% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits and included $43 million in incremental growth and infrastructure-related spending versus the 2014 third quarter. Company operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 13.9% versus 15% in the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance and other key items. 
As I mentioned, total company sales for the quarter were down 1%. The sales performance included 2 percentage points from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from unfavorable foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat, consisting of 1 percentage point from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price. By month, daily sales declined 1% in July, 2% in August and were flat in September. Sales in September included a 4 percentage point contribution from Cromwell. 
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a group entitled Other Businesses. Sales in the U.S. segment, which accounted for 78% of total company revenues in the quarter, were flat. It is comprised of 1 percentage point from intercompany sales to Zoro and a 1 percentage point decline from price. Daily sales increased 1% in July, were flat in August and declined 2% in September. 
Let's review U.S. sales performance by customer and market for the quarter. Commercial, Light Manufacturing, Retail and Government were up in the low single digits. Contractor was down in the low single digits. Heavy Manufacturing and Reseller were down in the mid-single digits, and Natural Resources was down in the high teens. Low oil prices continued to affect our Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of the relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the quarter. 
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 8% of total company revenues in the quarter and decreased 23%, down 8% in local currency. The 8% sales decrease consisted of a 17 percentage point decline from volume, partially offset by 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 5 percentage points from price. Sales performance in Canada was driven by declines in the Construction, Oil and Gas, Retail, Commercial, Transportation, Government and Heavy and Light Manufacturing end markets. By month, daily sales in local currency declined 4% in July, 7% in August and 13% in September. We also lapped the acquisition of WFS Enterprises Inc. on September 2. 
Let's wrap up our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. The Other Businesses represented 14% of total company sales in the quarter. Sales for this group were up 18% and consisted of 12 percentage points of growth from the Cromwell acquisition and 22 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 16 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily driven by the single channel online businesses in Japan and in the United States. 
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September 2015, the same as the prior year. Company sales were flat in September of 2015 versus September 2014. The sales performance included 4 percentage points from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. September was the first month to include sales from Cromwell, and we lapped the WFS acquisition. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales declined 1%, primarily driven by lower volume. In the United States, September sales declined 2%, which included a 2 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales to Zoro. 
Let's review sales performance by customer and market in the United States for the month of September. Government was up in the mid-single digits. Light Manufacturing and Commercial were up in the low single digits. Retail was down in the low single digits. Contractor, Reseller and Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits. Natural Resources was down in the low 20s. In the Government end market, we saw strong performance from state customers, as we focused on 2 large departments of state budgets: the Department of Corrections and the Department of Transportation. For the month of September, the direct and indirect effect of the energy sector accelerated to a 2% drag on sales. 
Sales in Canada for September declined 28% in U.S. dollars and were down 13% in local currency. The 13% decrease consisted of an 18 percentage point decrease from volume, partially offset by 5 percentage points from price. On an organic basis, sales performance was driven by declines in the Construction, Oil and Gas, Commercial, Light and Heavy Manufacturing, Retail and Transportation end markets, partially offset by growth in the Utilities, Government, Mining and Forestry end markets. 
Sales for our Other Businesses increased 40% in September, consisting of 36 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition and 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 14 percentage point drag from unfavorable foreign exchange from the Other Businesses. Similar to the quarter, organic sales growth in September was driven by the single channel online businesses in Japan and the United States. 
Daily sales in the month of October are currently down in the low single digits, including the benefit from Cromwell. Excluding Cromwell, sales performance is currently down in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, October 2014 included 1% of sales from Ebola-related products.

Operating earnings in the United States decreased 5% versus the 2014 third quarter. This performance was driven by lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 120 basis points versus the prior year, primarily driven by price deflation exceeding cost deflation and higher sales to Zoro, reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these intercompany sales. Excluding Zoro, gross profit margins were down 90 basis points versus the prior year. 
Operating expenses decreased 2% in the quarter versus the prior year. Expenses were driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits, which were partially offset by incremental growth in infrastructure spending of $30 million. The operating margin for the U.S. segment decreased 80 basis points to 18.1% versus 18.9% in the prior year. In the absence of the growth spending, we realized attractive operating leverage. 
Let's move on to results for our business in Canada adjusted for restructuring. Operating earnings were down 83% in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The lower operating performance was primarily the result of lower sales, lower gross profit margins and higher operating expenses as a percent of sales, driven by incremental costs from the WFS acquisition and SAP implementation. Gross profit margins declined 130 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange from products from U.S.-based suppliers and the lower margins at WFS, partially offset by price increases. 
The operating margin in Canada for the third quarter was 2.2% versus 9.9% in the prior year. Incremental cost from the SAP implementation were $6 million in U.S. dollars. Excluding SAP cost, operating earnings were down 61% in U.S. dollars and the operating margin was 5%. 
On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses generated $15 million in operating earnings in the 2015 third quarter versus $5 million in the 2014 third quarter. The operating earnings increase for the quarter versus the prior year was driven by strong results from the single channel businesses in Japan and the United States and included a $2 million contribution from Cromwell, partially offset by an incremental $2 million in start-up costs for the single channel online business in Europe. 
Other income and expense was a net $21 million expense in the 2015 third quarter versus a net $3 million expense in the 2014 third quarter. The increase in expense was driven by $12 million in higher net interest expense and $6 million in losses on the company's clean energy investment. The incremental $12 million in net interest expense was driven by the $1 billion in long-term debt issued in June to buy back company shares. Beyond 2015, the company intends to issue new permanent debt of $400 million in both 2016 and 2017 to continue the share buyback program as announced in April. 
Our investment in a limited liability company established to produce clean energy generated a loss of $6 million in the quarter. As part of supporting the operations of this entity, Grainger receives its shares of energy tax credits. For the full year, energy credits are expected to result in a reduction of approximately 1.3 percentage point in the company's effective tax rate.  
The company's tax rate for the quarter was 38.4% compared to 39.1% in the 2014 third quarter. The lower tax rate in 2015 reflects the benefit of the energy tax credits, partially offset by a higher proportion of earnings from the United States versus other jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 37.2% to 37.6% for the full year 2015. 
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $366 million versus $329 million in 2014. The company used the cash generated and cash on hand to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $82 million versus $84 million in 2014. Our full year capital spending range is now $300 million to $350 million, driven by postponing the construction of a new Edmonton distribution center, moving SAP in Canada to 2016 and the timing of other supply chain infrastructure projects. 
We paid dividends of $77 million, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. In addition, we bought back 3.4 million shares of stock for $735 million and ended the quarter with 10.3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $82 million to shareholders in the quarter. 
As reported in our 2015 third quarter earnings release, we lowered our sales and earnings guidance for the year given the performance to date and the expectation of continued economic weakness. With the change in the industrial economy, our guidance reflects what we're seeing in our customers' business. 
Let's take a look at our current expectations. All figures include Cromwell, and all comparisons are to prior year unless otherwise noted. We'll begin with sales. For the full year, we now expect sales growth in the range of down 0.5% to up 0.5%. Excluding Cromwell, we expect sales to be down 2% to down 1%. For the fourth quarter, the new guidance implies a sales range of down 3% to up 0.5% sales growth. Excluding Cromwell, we expect sales to be down 7% to down 4% in the quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, we are up against difficult comps as 2014 included a 1 percentage point lift from sales of Ebola-related safety products. 
Let's move on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we are forecasting gross margin contraction of about 80 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to decrease 150 basis points. The price deflation and the mix of faster growth with lower-margin customers are driving the decrease. The Cromwell acquisition also contributes lower gross profit margins by 20 basis points. 
Let's take a look at operating margins, which are adjusted to exclude charges. Keep in mind, these margins are inclusive of the gross profit factors discussed above. For the full year, we expect operating margin contraction of 85 to 100 basis points. This includes incremental growth in infrastructure spending for the year at the high end of our range, as detailed in Exhibit 4. 
For the fourth quarter, we are expecting operating margin contraction of 195 to 250 basis points. The contraction in gross margin drives most of the change, with the lack of operating expense leverage a factor based on a more conservative view of sales volume. Cromwell represents about a 50 basis point drag on operating margin in the quarter due to mix and eCommerce-related investments. 
Next, the tax rate. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 37.2% to 37.6% for the full year and for the 2015 fourth quarter. This range is higher than we forecasted in July because earnings in lower-tax-rate jurisdictions represent a lower percentage of total company earnings. Clean energy investments are expected to contribute $0.09 per share to earnings in the full year. 
Please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On Thursday, November 12, we plan to release October sales, and we will host our annual Analyst Meeting at our headquarters in Lake Forest. On Tuesday, November 17, Will Lomax, Vice President and Controller; and Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations, will participate in the Barclays Select Series Industrial Distribution Forum in New York City.

With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2015 third quarter results. To supplement this podcast, please also reference our 2015 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website. 
Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements. 
I'd like to begin by providing some context regarding the current environment for industrial companies. We've talked about the impact of oil and gas prices, the strong U.S. dollar and China's economic slowdown on our performance. In addition, the performance of the following key indicators over the past 12 months further illustrates these challenges. The ISM Purchasing Managers' Index was 50.2 in September, down versus last year, indicating an economy no longer in expansion mode overall. The Industrial Production Index has fallen for most of the year as well. The Canadian dollar has fallen 21%. 
Copper prices are down 22%. Cold rolled steel prices are down 25% and crude oil prices are down 60%. The drop in the price of raw materials underscores the weak demand environment and oversupply of commodities and, in many cases, the weakness has sped up in the past 3 months. As these economic indicators decline, we've seen that downturn take hold in the industrial economy. 
In response, we have begun the process of bringing our cost structure in line with current trends and activity levels. We announced the closure of 26 branches and eliminated 170 field positions in the United States. In Canada, we have eliminated more than 100 roles and closed 4 branches since the beginning of June. We have substantially completed the closure of our business in Brazil. We continue to restructure our Fabory business in Europe, which is expected to be completed this year, and we decided to transition our business in Costa Rica from a local branch-based model to being served via our U.S.-based export operations. These actions resulted in an $0.11 charge to earnings per share in the quarter. You can expect more actions in the fourth quarter and into next year. 
At the same time, we took advantage of our strong financial position to invest in the future growth and performance of the business as follows. We added more than 100 sales representatives in the third quarter and 300 year-to-date to better serve and penetrate large customers. We created a team to focus solely on our medium-sized business. We acquired Cromwell Group (Holdings) Ltd. in the U.K. to further our growth in attractive MRO markets and leverage our Internet expertise. We took advantage of our improved capital structure and weakness in the stock market to aggressively buy back stock, and we have made investments that lower our tax rate. You can expect us to share additional information at our Analyst Meeting on November 12. 
So let's take a look at our 2015 third quarter results and our revised sales and earnings guidance. Please note that the following analysis excludes the $0.11 per share of charges, unless specifically noted. Please see Exhibit 1 for detail on these charges. Company sales declined 1%. Operating earnings were down 9%. Net earnings decreased 13%, reflecting higher interest expense. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.03 for the quarter, a decrease of 8% versus the 2014 third quarter. 
Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement on an adjusted basis. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 110 basis points to 41.9% versus 43% in 2014, primarily driven by faster growth with lower-margin customers, lower supplier rebates tied to lower-than-expected volume and price deflation versus slight cost inflation due to the higher cost of imported U.S.-sourced products for the business in Canada. Operating expenses, excluding charges, were down 1% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits and included $43 million in incremental growth and infrastructure-related spending versus the 2014 third quarter. Company operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 13.9% versus 15% in the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance and other key items. 
As I mentioned, total company sales for the quarter were down 1%. The sales performance included 2 percentage points from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from unfavorable foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat, consisting of 1 percentage point from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price. By month, daily sales declined 1% in July, 2% in August and were flat in September. Sales in September included a 4 percentage point contribution from Cromwell. 
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a group entitled Other Businesses. Sales in the U.S. segment, which accounted for 78% of total company revenues in the quarter, were flat. This comprised of 1 percentage point from intercompany sales to Zoro and a 1 percentage point decline from price. Daily sales increased 1% in July, were flat in August and declined 2% in September. 
Let's review U.S. sales performance by customer and market for the quarter. Commercial, Light Manufacturing, Retail and Government were up in the low single digits. Contractor was down in the low single digits. Heavy Manufacturing and Reseller were down in the mid-single digits, and Natural Resources was down in the high teens. Low oil prices continued to affect our Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of the relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the quarter. 
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 8% of total company revenues in the quarter and decreased 23%, down 8% in local currency. The 8% sales decrease consisted of a 17 percentage point decline from volume, partially offset by 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 5 percentage points from price. Sales performance in Canada was driven by declines in the Construction, Oil and Gas, Retail, Commercial, Transportation, Government and Heavy and Light Manufacturing end markets. By month, daily sales in local currency declined 4% in July, 7% in August and 13% in September. We also lapped the acquisition of WFS Enterprises Inc. on September 2. 
Let's wrap up our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. The Other Businesses represented 14% of total company sales in the quarter. Sales for this group were up 18% and consisted of 12 percentage points of growth from the Cromwell acquisition and 22 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 16 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily driven by the single channel online businesses in Japan and in the United States. 
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September 2015, the same as the prior year. Company sales were flat in September of 2015 versus September of 2014. The sales performance included 4 percentage points from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. September was the first month to include sales from Cromwell, and we lapped the WFS acquisition. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales declined 1%, primarily driven by lower volume. In the United States, September sales declined 2%, which included a 2 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales to Zoro. 
Let's review sales performance by customer and market in the United States for the month of September. Government was up in the mid-single digits. Light Manufacturing and Commercial were up in the low single digits. Retail was down in the low single digits. Contractor, Reseller and Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits. Natural Resources was down in the low 20s. In the Government end market, we saw strong performance from state customers, as we focused on 2 large departments of state budgets: the Department of Corrections and the Department of Transportation. For the month of September, the direct and indirect effect of the energy sector accelerated to a 2% drag on sales. 
Sales in Canada for September declined 28% in U.S. dollars and were down 13% in local currency. The 13% decrease consisted of an 18 percentage point decrease from volume, partially offset by 5 percentage points from price. On an organic basis, sales performance was driven by declines in the Construction, Oil and Gas, Commercial, Light and Heavy Manufacturing, Retail and Transportation end markets, partially offset by growth in the Utilities, Government, Mining and Forestry end markets. 
Sales for our Other Businesses increased 40% in September, consisting of 36 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition and 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 14 percentage point drag from unfavorable foreign exchange from the Other Businesses. Similar to the quarter, organic sales growth in September was driven by the single channel online businesses in Japan and the United States. 
Daily sales in the month of October are currently down in the low single digits, including the benefit from Cromwell. Excluding Cromwell, sales performance is currently down in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, October 2014 included 1% of sales from Ebola-related products. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reportable segment. As a reminder, all the figures exclude the $0.11 per share of charges unless specifically noted. 
Operating earnings in the United States decreased 5% versus the 2014 third quarter. This performance was driven by lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 120 basis points versus the prior year, primarily driven by price deflation exceeding cost deflation and higher sales to Zoro, reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these intercompany sales. Excluding Zoro, gross profit margins were down 90 basis points versus the prior year. 
Operating expenses decreased 2% in the quarter versus the prior year. Expenses were driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits, which were partially offset by incremental growth in infrastructure spending of $30 million. The operating margin for the U.S. segment decreased 80 basis points to 18.1% versus 18.9% in the prior year. In the absence of the growth spending, we realized attractive operating leverage. 
Let's move on to results for our business in Canada adjusted for restructuring. Operating earnings were down 83% in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The lower operating performance was primarily the result of lower sales, lower gross profit margins and higher operating expenses as a percent of sales, driven by incremental costs from the WFS acquisition and SAP implementation. Gross profit margins declined 130 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange from products from U.S.-based suppliers and the lower margins at WFS, partially offset by price increases. 
The operating margin in Canada for the third quarter was 2.2% versus 9.9% in the prior year. Incremental cost from the SAP implementation were $6 million in U.S. dollars. Excluding SAP cost, operating earnings were down 61% in U.S. dollars and the operating margin was 5%. 
On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses generated $15 million in operating earnings in the 2015 third quarter versus $5 million in the 2014 third quarter. The operating earnings increase for the quarter versus the prior year was driven by strong results from the single channel businesses in Japan and the United States and included a $2 million contribution from Cromwell, partially offset by an incremental $2 million in start-up costs for the single channel online business in Europe. 
Other income and expense was a net $21 million expense in the 2015 third quarter versus a net $3 million expense in the 2014 third quarter. The increase in expense was driven by $12 million in higher net interest expense and $6 million in losses on the company's clean energy investment. The incremental $12 million in net interest expense was driven by the $1 billion in long-term debt issued in June to buy back company shares. Beyond 2015, the company intends to issue new permanent debt of $400 million in both 2016 and 2017 to continue the share buyback program as announced in April. 
Our investment in a limited liability company established to produce clean energy generated a loss of $6 million in the quarter. As part of supporting the operations of this entity, Grainger receives its shares of energy tax credits. For the full year, energy credits are expected to result in a reduction of approximately 1.3 percentage point in the company's effective tax rate.  
The company's tax rate for the quarter was 38.4% compared to 39.1% in the 2014 third quarter. The lower tax rate in 2015 reflects the benefit of the energy tax credits, partially offset by a higher proportion of earnings from the United States versus other jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 37.2% to 37.6% for the full year 2015. 
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $366 million versus $329 million in 2014. The company used the cash generated and cash on hand to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $82 million versus $84 million in 2014. Our full year capital spending range is now $300 million to $350 million, driven by postponing the construction of a new Edmonton distribution center, moving SAP in Canada to 2016 and the timing of other supply chain infrastructure projects. 
We paid dividends of $77 million, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. In addition, we bought back 3.4 million shares of stock for $735 million and ended the quarter with 10.3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $82 million to shareholders in the quarter.
