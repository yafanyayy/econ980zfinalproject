For the quarter, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 5.6%. Total sales were 10.8% to $2.48 billion. Operating income increased by $42.1 million or 12.1% and operating margin for the quarter was 15.8%, a 20 basis point improvement from the prior year's fourth quarter.  Net income increased 12.2% to $239 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 13.7% to $1.16 compared with fourth quarter 2013 earnings of $1.02 per diluted share. 
For the full year fiscal 2014, total sales increased 9.7% to $8.6 billion. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 4.4% as a result of a 3.4% increase in traffic and a 90 basis point increase in average ticket. Operating income increased by $98.4 million to nearly $1.07 billion. Operating margin was a sector leading 12.4%, a 4 basis point increase versus the prior year. Net income was $645.6 million compared with $596.7 million last year and adjusted earnings per diluted share was a record $3.12, an increase of 14.7% compared with $2.72 per diluted share last year. 
I'm extremely proud of our team's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. We have great momentum in our business as we serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Back in 2014 for the first time in company history, we exceeded 1 billion customer transaction in a year. Our results continue to validate that Dollar Tree is part of the solution for million of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. Our merchants continue to deliver product that exceeds customer expectations and our store teams consistently provide a clean, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our focus continues to be on serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector while our values are greater than ever and our prices, as always, are just $1 per item. Our customers know that at Dollar Tree, you can splurge. Yes, you can afford it at Dollar Tree. Same-store sales were solid and accelerated throughout the quarter. Performance in the home, seasonal and basics divisions were tightly grouped and our sales increase resulted from strength in both basic consumables and discretionary products. Top-performing categories include party supplies, household products and food. Additionally, sales performance in the fourth quarter was relatively consistent across the country, with all zones achieving positive same-store sales increases. 
Our merchandising teams put together a terrific plan for the fourth quarter and the store teams work together to execute the plan. Immediately following Halloween, the store's transitioned swiftly for the upcoming holidays. When our doors opened on November 1, store presentations boldly communicated Dollar Tree was the go-to store for our customers' Thanksgiving and Christmas needs. In early November, we focused on first of the month consumables, including Thanksgiving-related foods like chicken broth, vegetables and soups. We placed emphasis on taking care of the customer needs related to holiday meals with baking basics, mixing bowls, oil pans, Turkey basters and food storage containers and we addressed the customer's needs related to holiday entertaining with catering trays, bowls and servers. Our Home for the Holidays promotion featured dinnerware, glassware, table linens and snack foods like cookies, mints and party mix all for a dollar. Immediately following Thanksgiving, our stores made a swift transition to holiday decorations, Toyland and great gift ideas. This year, merchants and storage worked together to build upon last year's introduction of the Last 10 Days strategy by bringing all of the last-minute categories together and remerchandising the front of the store with a purpose. Our goal is to be the gift supply headquarters for items like holiday tins, gift bags, tissue, wrapping paper, scissors and tape. If you need to wrap it, bag it, box it or tag it, Dollar Tree is the store for you. In addition to our seasonal energy throughout the quarter, our stores continue to highlight and promote our Million Dollars brands that provide great values to our customers. These are brands they know and trust like Bounty, paper towels, Crest toothpaste and many more.  Following the Christmas holidays, our stores transitioned quickly to party supplies for the big game season. At Dollar Tree, we operate in an environment of continuous improvement, always striving to improve from season to season. We ended the year with our inventory clean, well-balanced and stores prepared for the new fiscal year. Our Valentine's Day season was terrific, and our sell through was solid. 
Looking forward, we're positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have many opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores, increasing the productivity of all stores and further developing our newest formats, new markets and new channels as growth vehicles. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened 90 new stores and we relocated and expanded 6 existing stores for a total of 96 projects. For the full year 2014, we exceeded our new store target of 375 stores and opened 391 stores. Total square footage increased 7.4% over the prior year and we ended the year with a total of 5,367 stores across 48 states and 5 Canadian provinces. 
I'm extremely pleased with improvements in our inventory management. In 2014, we added 391 new stores and 3.2 million selling square feet, yet our overall inventory dollars remained essentially flat to the prior year and our inventory terms improved approximately 30 basis points. Our seasonal sell through was strong, our basic in-stock was maintained and when the customers were shopping, our stores were ready. Thanks to the efforts of our merchant, logistics and store teams, we started fiscal 2015 on plan with clean inventories, well-prepared to support first quarter 2015 sales plans.  For the full year 2015, our plan includes the opening of approximately 400 new stores and 75 relocations for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. Square footage is planned to increase 7.2% over fiscal 2014. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy on improving productivity in our existing stores. The components of this strategy include, first of all, category expansions. Our customers are finding more value as we continue to rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Customers are continuing to respond favorably to our powerful and relevant seasonal and party presentations. Our seasonal assortments continue to create merchandise energy as our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we strive to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Store teams continue to focus on customer engagement in our stores and especially at the checkout counters to drive impulse and related item sales. We are keenly focused on providing value and a shopping experience that exceeds the expectations of every customer in every store every day. Being first-of-the-month-ready is important to our customers. Our merchants and our store associates place increased emphasis on displays of basic consumable core items at the first of each month when more customers are shopping for their basic needs. Additionally, we are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the fourth quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 82 additional stores, bringing our 2014 total to 473 additional stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,621 stores with plans to continue adding this important category to more stores. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it is fast returning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including the higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customers. 
In addition to new Dollar Tree stores in the U.S., Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$ are key brands in our portfolio and key components of our growth strategy. In fourth quarter, we continue to grow our store count in Canada by adding 5 new stores. For the full year 2014, we added 30 net new stores, expanded 2 stores and ended the year with a total of 210 Dollar Tree Canada stores. We are building the merchant and store teams in Canada to better serve the Canadian customer. Leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants are sourcing higher value product and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We are pleased with the progress we're making in Canada and in fact, the fourth quarter comp for Dollar Tree Canada was the strongest quarter yet. We have significant growth potential in Canada. We're confident the Canadian market will support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores and this is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States. We want to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25 just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point. Our Deal$ format further extends our ability to serve more customers by lifting the restriction of the $1 price points, we have the opportunity to serve more customers with more categories. Deal$ stores provide low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. The stores operate using a multiple price point strategy, and they have the potential to generate higher store volume with a higher average ticket. We ended the year with a total of 219 Deal$ stores. 
In addition to Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$, our online business at Dollar Tree Direct is growing in size and performance. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness and attract more customers into our stores. In the fourth quarter, we significantly enhanced the functionality of the site's search feature on our website. Now, when customers search for a specific product, it provided relevant and related content for the product including videos, craft sheets, ratings and reviews. Our Dollar Tree customers are crafty, savvy, frugal and connected, and this enhanced site search functionality place all those traits. Also in Q4, Dollar Tree Direct introduced a new holiday Christmas section of our website. This section has provided a video, an interactive game and many great holiday craft and gift ideas. Based on a number of customers both old and new that flock to the site, we know it was a big hit. We continue to leverage social media to connect with customers. A few examples of our growth includes our loyalty program called The Value Seekers Club, which has grown nearly 80% over the past 12 months. Our email subscriber database has grown 26% and our Facebook fan base has increased by 31%. Social media continues to provide tremendous opportunities to communicate about exciting events and great products both in our stores and online. Whether customers prefer to contact Dollar Tree Direct via their phones, their tablets, their laptops or their desktops, we're ready and able to connect with them. We continue to be very pleased with the growth of both sales and visitors to our Dollar Tree Direct business. Please check us out at DollarTree.com. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our initial outlook for 2015."
27685,256795225,769573,"Dollar Tree, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Dollar Tree, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7% to $1.16 per diluted share. Once again, we are very pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 5.6% comp sales performance was compo",1310,"Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7% to $1.16 per diluted share. Once again, we are very pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 5.6% comp sales performance was composed of a 5% increase in traffic and a 0.5% increase in average ticket. Geographically, our performance was strongest in the Midwest and Southeast, as well as markets where we cycled significant weather disruptions from a year ago.  In our previous 8-K, we announced our same store sales for the first 2 months of the quarter was 5.2%. January was our strongest comp month of the quarter as we're recycling a large number of weather-related store closings from the prior year. 
Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 37.1% during the fourth quarter compared with 36.9% in the prior year fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points. The improvement was a result of the following: we gained 30 basis points of leverage in occupancy and distribution costs resulting from strong same-store sales; we experienced higher initial markup and reduced markdowns across many categories, but higher IMU reflects continued improvement in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model. Overall, merchandise mix contributed to margin rate. However, it was offset by our commitment to provide greater value to consumers in order to drive traffic and capture share. We continue to be pleased with the results we are seeing. Freight costs as a percentage of sales increased as domestic trucking rates were higher reflecting the effects of industry-wide driver shortages. The increase was partially offset by lower diesel costs. 
Excluding acquisition-related costs, SG&A expenses were 21.3% of sales for the quarter, flat compared to the fourth quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses increased 25 basis points for the quarter as store bonuses, retirement plan contributions and incentive compensation increased based on the company's strong performance. These are partially offset by reduced store payroll due to improved productivity and lower worker's compensation expenses. Store operating and corporate costs improved in the areas of utilities, repairs and maintenance, store supply, legal fees and depreciation offsetting the payroll-related expense increase. 
Adjusted operating income increased $42.1 million compared to the fourth quarter last year and adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points to 15.8%. For full year 2014, our operating margin was 12.4% consistent with last year despite persistent freight cost headwinds related to the domestic driver shortages in the trucking industry. The tax rate for the quarter was 36.6% versus 37.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This decrease was due to the reenactment of the work opportunity's tax credit for 2014 in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, the tax rate was 37.3% compared with 37.5% in 2013. 
Looking at the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at year end totaled $864.1 million versus $267.7 million at the end of fiscal 2013. Our consolidated inventory at year end was flat to last year, while selling square footage increased 7.4%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot actually decreased 6.9% and our inventory turn improved 30 basis points to 4.4x for the year. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for 2015. 
The company uses the retail inventory method to assign costs to store inventories. In fiscal 2010, the company made an inventory accounting change for its U.S. operations going from one inventory pool to approximately 30. Effective February 1, 2015, the first day of fiscal 2015, the company will adopt the same method for our Canadian operations. This change will facilitate improved decision-making and further enhance our assortment planning process. The company expects to record a non-recurring, noncash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of approximately $3 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2015. This impact is included in our guidance. There will be no effect on prior periods related to this change in inventory accounting. 
Capital expenditures were $71.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This compares with $46 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2014, capital expenditures were $325.6 million which was below our prior expectation of $360 million to $370 million and compares with $330.1 million in 2013. For 2015, we are currently planning consolidated capital expenditures to range from $465 million to $475 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, the addition of frozen or refrigerated capability to approximately 320 stores, IT system enhancements, the construction of a new Southeast distribution center and the expansion of our current Olive Branch, Mississippi distribution center. Please note that upon completion of the Family Dollar transaction, we may reconsider our 2015 capital expenditure plan based on a comprehensive review of the combined distribution network and related capacity. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $54.4 million for the fourth quarter versus $50.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. For 2014, total depreciation was $205.9 million, a 4 basis point improvement from last year. For 2015, depreciation and amortization is estimated to range from $215 million to $225 million. 
Our initial outlook for guidance for 2015 includes the following assumptions: We anticipate that freight costs will continue to be a headwind to gross margin for the year based on continued pressure on freight rates. We are budgeting lower diesel fuel costs than a year ago. As you have noticed, weather has presented early challenges throughout most of our Northern and Midwestern areas to this point in the first quarter. Easter will be 2 weeks earlier than the prior year, which represents an estimated $8 million headwind to sales. We are pleased to see agreement was reached last week in related to the West Coast ports. We may continue to experience some product delays as the port congestion is relieved in the upcoming months. The previously mentioned noncash charge of $0.01 per diluted share related to the inventory accounting change, and we do not anticipate any share repurchases in 2015 and we cannot predict future currency fluctuations so we do not adjust our guidance for any potential changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumed a tax rate of 38.4% for the first quarter and 38.3% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 206.9 million shares for the first quarter and 207.1 million shares for the full year. 
For the first quarter 2015, we are forecasting sales to range from $2.15 billion to $2.20 billion and diluted earnings per share excluding acquisition costs in the range of $0.69 to $0.74 which would represent a 3% to 10% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.67 per diluted share. the sales range implies a low- to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 6.9% square footage growth. Additionally, we have not included any acquisition-related cost in our first quarter guidance as we cannot currently forecast the timing of when these costs will be incurred. For the full fiscal year of 2015, we are forecasting sales in the range of $9.21 billion to $9.45 billion based on a low- to low mid-single digit increase in same-store sales and 7.2% square footage growth. Due to the earnings per share excluding acquisition-related costs are expected to range from $3.30 to $3.50. This represents an increase of 6% to 12% over 2014 earnings per diluted share, excluding acquisition-related cost of $3.12. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I did want to address one question that some of you expressed. Following the completion of the Family Dollar transaction, we will adopt segment reporting. This will provide you with visibility into the performance of both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar on a standalone basis. I will now turn the call back over to Bob."

Before going to Q&A, I want to make a few comments on our pending acquisition of Family Dollar.

Before going to Q&A, I want to make a few comments on our pending acquisition of Family Dollar. I'll tell you that we're more enthusiastic about the transaction today than when we originally announced our merger agreement in late July. We are extremely encouraged to see the overwhelming support from Family Dollar shareholders on their January 22 vote. Their approval was a crucial step in our moving forward with the transaction that will create a leading discount retailer in North America. I am pleased that throughout the process, Dollar Tree remained committed to its strategy and was able to gain shareholder approval without increasing our offer. I would like to personally commend Family Dollar's team members on their efforts over the past 7 months. While their reported results have not been stellar, we acknowledge that they've been operating through unique circumstances with great uncertainty regarding the future of the Family Dollar business and we're eager to welcome Family Dollar associates to the Dollar Tree team. We appreciate the dedication and efforts of Family Dollar's associates throughout integration planning process, and we look forward to working together to further grow and improve the Family Dollar brand. 
The strategic rationale for this combination is powerful. We are combining 2 very large companies with more than 13,000 stores achieving almost $19 billion in sales and more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA. We're combining 2 established and respected brands in the most economically resilient sector of retailing. The discount retail sector has flourished through all economic cycles. We're combining 2 complementary business models across fixed and multi-priced strategies, creating the ability to serve a broader range of customers and geography. The Dollar Tree target customers is largely a suburban customer, while the Family Dollar customer is largely urban and rural. We're combining complementary merchandise expertise, adding the Family Dollar strength and name brand consumable products to the Dollar Tree variety, seasonal and discretionary product and global sourcing power. This combination generates significant immediate opportunities for operational improvement and near-term opportunities for synergies. We have identified the opportunity to realize at least $300 million in annual run rate hard cost synergies by the end of year 3. 
We have categorized these synergies into 4 primary categories and have ranked them in order of magnitude. First is sourcing and procurement. Opportunities here will include lower cost of products through leveraging the size of our buys, rationalizing our vendor base, driving scale with common vendors, increasing direct-to-factory sourcing and increased efficiencies through global sourcing and the supply chain. Second is format optimization. We will operate and grow both banners, and we plan to rebanner our stores selectively to better match the brand to the market demographic and to improve productivity of the store. Most of the early rebannering will be Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores. Next is reduced overhead. Over time, we will reduce cost through shared services, reducing redundant public company and board cost and through systems integrations. And last, distribution and logistics through scale and operational efficiency. We expect to reduce inbound and outbound freight cost, both domestic and international. 
Additionally, primary areas of our initial focus will include, first of all, the customer. A focus on the needs of the value customer and delivering the merchandise assortment that serves their needs and their wants. This will include a mix of namebrand and private label basics alongside variety and seasonally relevant product. We will continue to return to EDLP and delivering value at competitive prices. Second, productivity. We will focus on improving sales per foot and inventory productivity by expanding high-performance categories and eliminating products that do not meet our sales and profitability threshold. We plan to focus on the customer experience and improving the table stakes by developing plans to consistently deliver the promise of a bright, clean and friendly store to shop. We will be tracking team metrics to monitor progress. We plan to focus on reducing field management turnover and providing appropriate incentives to the people who directly serve our customers. We plan to improve our new store remodeling expensive performance with a keen focus on profitability, improvement and metrics and ROIC. Overall, we will bring a disciplined approach to driving a key strategic initiative and a performance-oriented culture through the larger company through improved communications, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We are confident that placing our initial emphases in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
I will tell you that both companies are ready to integrate. The lengthy delays through this process have afforded us a significant amount of time to focus on integration planning. Our integration management office is comprised of 10 functional teams that have detailed strategies, objectives and tasks with assigned milestones for achieving these tasks. Our functional teams are dedicated to cost of goods sold, supply chain, indirect spending, merchandising, finance, human resources, information technology, general and administrative costs, including legal, internal audit and others, real estate and store operations. Our team is incredibly excited about this transformational opportunity to grow our business for the long term by adding the Family Dollar banner to the Dollar Tree portfolio of brands. As always, we will manage this business with a focus on what is best for our stakeholders, including our customers, our vendor partners, our associates and importantly, our long-term shareholders. 
Now back to Dollar Tree as previously mentioned, I'm extremely proud of the team's fourth quarter and full year performance, and I'm incredibly excited about Dollar Tree's future. The Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record level of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 7 consecutive years, quarter-after-quarter, Dollar Tree has delivered same-store sales increases of more than 1% every single quarter. Consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. For 6 consecutive years, our annual gross margin rate has exceeded 35%. At Dollar Tree, we are in control of our gross margin rate. It's all about the mix and having an extremely disciplined approach to sourcing product for our stores. We have consistently delivered solid margin rates through both inflationary and deflationary cycles. Our expenses are managed effectively, focused on overall returns. And as a result of driving sales, managing margins and controlling expenses, we have delivered 5 consecutive years of double-digit operating margins that continue to lead the discount retail sector. We remain committed to the concept our customers love and we are positioned for continued profitable growth for many years ahead. We have a talented management team that has a long history of retail success, and importantly, with the addition of Family Dollar, we will be a bigger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for, great value. 
Such a great time to be Dollar Tree. Our inventories are clean and fresh. The shelves are full of the right product for the first half of 2015, and our values have never been better.

In the fourth quarter, of course, with all the holiday needs and all the holiday priority merchandise that we have in those stores, consumables were 56.4%, which is down a little bit, it's usually about 60%, and our non-consumables up a little bit, 43.6%. So because of the holiday, we're able to sell a little more discretionary and seasonal stores in our Deal$ stores. The basket, the average ticket basket when we had items that are greater than $1, it was $15.62 and more than half of all transactions, 52.3%, had items greater than $1 in them. So our customers are understanding the merchandise and are understanding the assortment. They're responding appropriately. Average unit retail, average retail of one item that they bought was $3.35 in our Deal$ stores. And the greater than $1 item represented 51% of the Deal$ total sales.

This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014. For the quarter, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 5.6%. Total sales were 10.8% to $2.48 billio",1911,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014. For the quarter, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 5.6%. Total sales were 10.8% to $2.48 billion. Operating income increased by $42.1 million or 12.1%, and operating margin for the quarter was 15.8%, a 20 basis point improvement from the prior year's fourth quarter. Net income increased 12.2% to $239 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 13.7% to $1.16 compared with fourth quarter 2013 earnings of $1.02 per diluted share. 
For the full year fiscal 2014, total sales increased 9.7% to $8.6 billion. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 4.4% as a result of a 3.4% increase in traffic and a 90 basis point increase in average ticket. Operating income increased by $98.4 million to nearly $1.07 billion. Operating margin was a sector leading 12.4%, a 4 basis point increase versus the prior year. Net income was $645.6 million compared with $596.7 million last year, and adjusted earnings per diluted share was a record $3.12, an increase of 14.7% compared with $2.72 per diluted share last year. 
I'm extremely proud of our team's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. We have great momentum in our business as we serve a very loyal and growing customer base. In fact, in 2014, for the first time in company history, we exceeded 1 billion customer transactions in a year. Our results continue to validate that Dollar Tree is part of the solution for millions of consumers, as they strive to balance their household budgets. Our merchants continue to deliver product that exceeds customer expectations, and our store teams consistently provide a clean, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our focus continues to be on serving our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector, while our values are greater than ever and our prices, as always, are just $1 per item. Our customers know that at Dollar Tree, you can splurge. Yes, you can afford it at Dollar Tree. Same-store sales were solid and accelerated throughout the quarter. Performance in the home, seasonal and basics divisions were tightly grouped and our sales increase resulted from strength in both basic consumables and discretionary products. Top-performing categories include party supplies, household products and food. Additionally, sales performance in the fourth quarter was relatively consistent across the country, with all zones achieving positive same-store sales increases. 
Our merchandising teams put together a terrific plan for the fourth quarter and the store teams work together to execute the plan. Immediately following Halloween, the stores transitioned swiftly for the upcoming holidays. When our doors opened on November 1, store presentations boldly communicated Dollar Tree was the go-to store for our customers' Thanksgiving and Christmas needs. In early November, we focused on first of the month consumables, including Thanksgiving-related foods like chicken broth, vegetables and soups. We placed emphasis on taking care of the customer needs related to holiday meals, with baking basics, mixing bowls, oil pans, Turkey basters and food storage containers, and we addressed the customer's needs related to holiday entertaining with catering trays, bowls and servers. Our home for the holidays promotion featured dinnerware, glassware, table linens and snack foods, like cookies, mints and party mix, all for $1. 
Immediately following Thanksgiving, our stores made a swift transition to holiday decorations, Toyland and great gift ideas. This year, merchants and storage worked together to build upon last year's introduction of the Last 10 Days strategy by bringing all of the last-minute categories together, and re-merchandising the front of the store with a purpose. Our goal is to be the gift supply headquarters for items like holiday tins, gift bags, tissue, wrapping paper, scissors and tape. If you need to wrap it, bag it, box it or tag it, Dollar Tree is the store for you. In addition to our seasonal energy throughout the quarter, our stores continue to highlight and promote our million dollar brands that provide great values to our customers. These are brands they know and trust like Downy, paper towels, Crest toothpaste and many more.  Following the Christmas holidays, our stores transitioned quickly to party supplies for the big game season. At Dollar Tree, we operate in an environment of continuous improvement, always striving to improve from season to season. We ended the year with our inventory clean, well-balanced and stores prepared for the new fiscal year. Our Valentine's Day season was terrific, and our sell through was solid. 
Looking forward, we're positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have many opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores, increasing the productivity of all stores and further developing our newest formats, new markets and new channels as growth vehicles. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened 90 new stores and we relocated and expanded 6 existing stores for a total of 96 projects. For the full year 2014, we exceeded our new store target of 375 stores and opened 391 stores. Total square footage increased 7.4% over the prior year and we ended the year with a total of 5,367 stores across 48 states and 5 Canadian provinces. 
I'm extremely pleased with improvements in our inventory management. In 2014, we added 391 new stores and 3.2 million selling square feet, yet our overall inventory dollars remained essentially flat to the prior year and our inventory turns improved approximately 30 basis points. Our seasonal sell through was strong. Our basic in-stock was maintained, and when the customers were shopping, our stores were ready. Thanks to the efforts of our merchant, logistics and store teams, we started fiscal 2015 on plan with clean inventories, well-prepared to support first quarter 2015 sales plans.  For the full year 2015, our plan includes the opening of approximately 400 new stores and 75 relocations for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. Square footage is planned to increase 7.2% over fiscal 2014. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy on improving productivity in our existing stores. The components of this strategy include, first of all, category expansions. Our customers are finding more value as we continue to rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Customers are continuing to respond favorably to our powerful and relevant seasonal and party presentations. Our seasonal assortments continue to create merchandise energy as our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we strive to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Store teams continue to focus on customer engagement in our stores and especially at the checkout counters to drive impulse and related item sales. We are keenly focused on providing value and a shopping experience that exceeds the expectations of every customer in every store every day. Being first-of-the-month-ready is important to our customers. Our merchants and our store associates place increased emphasis on displays of basic consumable core items at the first of each month when more customers are shopping for their basic needs. Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the fourth quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 82 additional stores, bringing our 2014 total to 473 additional stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,621 stores with plans to continue adding this important category to more stores. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it is fast returning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including the higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customers. 
In addition to new Dollar Tree stores in the U.S., Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$ are key brands in our portfolio and key components of our growth strategy. In fourth quarter, we continued to grow our store count in Canada by adding 5 new stores. For the full year 2014, we added 30 net new stores, expanded 2 stores and ended the year with a total of 210 Dollar Tree Canada stores. We are building the merchant and store teams in Canada to better serve the Canadian customer. Leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants are sourcing higher value product and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We're pleased with the progress we're making in Canada, and in fact, the fourth quarter comp for Dollar Tree Canada was the strongest quarter yet. We have significant growth potential in Canada. We're confident the Canadian market will support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores and this is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States. We want to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25 just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point. Our Deal$ format further extends our ability to serve more customers. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price points, we have the opportunity to serve more customers with more categories. Deal$ stores provide low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. The stores operate using a multiple price point strategy, and they have the potential to generate higher store volume with a higher average ticket. We ended the year with a total of 219 Deal$ stores. 
In addition to Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$, our online business at Dollar Tree Direct is growing in size and performance. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness, and attract more customers into our stores. In the fourth quarter, we significantly enhanced the functionality of the site's search feature on our website. Now when customers search for a specific product, it provided relevant and related content for the product, including videos, craft sheets, ratings and reviews. Our Dollar Tree customers are crafty, savvy, frugal and connected, and this enhanced site search functionalities placed all those traits. Also, in Q4, Dollar Tree Direct introduced a new holiday Christmas section of our website. This section has provided a video, an interactive game and many great holiday craft and gift ideas. Based on a number of customers both old and new that flock to the site, we know it was a big hit. We continue to leverage social media to connect with customers. A few examples of our growth includes our loyalty program, called The Value Seekers Club, which has grown nearly 80% over the past 12 months. Our email subscriber database has grown 26%, and our Facebook fan base has increased by 31%. Social media continues to provide tremendous opportunities to communicate about exciting events and great products both in our stores and online. Whether customers prefer to contact Dollar Tree Direct via their phones, their tablets, their laptops or their desktops, we're ready and able to connect with them. We continue to be very pleased with the growth of both sales and visitors to our Dollar Tree Direct business. Please check us out at DollarTree.com. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our initial outlook for 2015."
27685,256795225,769904,"Dollar Tree, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Dollar Tree, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7% to $1.16 per diluted share. Once again, we are very pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 5.6% comp sales performance was compo",1309,"Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7% to $1.16 per diluted share. Once again, we are very pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 5.6% comp sales performance was composed of a 5% increase in traffic and a 0.5% increase in average ticket. Geographically, our performance was strongest in the Midwest and Southeast, as well as markets where we cycled significant weather disruptions from a year ago.  In our previous 8-K, we announced our same store sales for the first 2 months of the quarter was 5.2%. January was our strongest comp month of the quarter as we're recycling a large number of weather-related store closings from the prior year. 
Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 37.1% during the fourth quarter compared with 36.9% in the prior year fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points. The improvement was a result of the following: we gained 30 basis points of leverage in occupancy and distribution costs resulting from strong same-store sales; we experienced higher initial markup and reduced markdowns across many categories. The higher IMU reflects continued improvement in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model. Overall, merchandise mix contributed to margin rate. However, it was offset by our commitment to provide greater value to consumers in order to drive traffic and capture share. We continue to be pleased with the results we are seeing. Freight cost as a percentage of sales increased, as domestic trucking rates were higher, reflecting the effects of industry-wide driver shortages. The increase was partially offset by lower diesel cost.
Excluding acquisition-related costs, SG&A expenses were 21.3% of sales for the quarter, flat compared to the fourth quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses increased 25 basis points for the quarter as store bonuses, retirement plan contributions and incentive compensation increased based on the company's strong performance. These are partially offset by reduced store payroll due to improved productivity and lower worker's compensation expenses. Store operating and corporate costs improved in the areas of utilities, repairs and maintenance, store supply, legal fees and depreciation, offsetting the payroll-related expense increase. 
Adjusted operating income increased $42.1 million compared to the fourth quarter last year, and adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points to 15.8%. For full year 2014, our operating margin was 12.4%, consistent with last year despite persistent freight cost headwinds related to the domestic driver shortages in the trucking industry. The tax rate for the quarter was 36.6% versus 37.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This decrease was due to the reenactment of the work opportunity's tax credit for 2014 in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, the tax rate was 37.3% compared with 37.5% in 2013. 
Looking at the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at year end totaled $864.1 million versus $267.7 million at the end of fiscal 2013. Our consolidated inventory at year end was flat to last year, while selling square footage increased 7.4%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot actually decreased 6.9%, and our inventory turn improved 30 basis points to 4.4x for the year. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for 2015. 
The company uses the retail inventory method to assign costs to store inventories. In fiscal 2010, the company made an inventory accounting change for its U.S. operations going from one inventory pool to approximately 30. Effective February 1, 2015, the first day of fiscal 2015, the company will adopt the same method for our Canadian operations. This change will facilitate improved decision-making, and further enhance our assortment planning process. The company expects to record a non-recurring, noncash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of approximately $3 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2015. This impact is included in our guidance. There will be no effect on prior periods related to this change in inventory accounting. 
Capital expenditures were $71.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This compares with $46 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2014, capital expenditures were $325.6 million, which was below our prior expectation of $360 million to $370 million, and compares with $330.1 million in 2013. For 2015, we are currently planning consolidated capital expenditures to range from $465 million to $475 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, the addition of frozen or refrigerated capability to approximately 320 stores, IT system enhancements, the construction of a new Southeast distribution center and the expansion of our current Olive Branch, Mississippi distribution center. Please note that upon completion of the Family Dollar transaction, we may reconsider our 2015 capital expenditure plan based on a comprehensive review of the combined distribution network and related capacity. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $54.4 million for the fourth quarter versus $50.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. For 2014, total depreciation was $205.9 million, a 4 basis point improvement from last year. For 2015, depreciation and amortization is estimated to range from $215 million to $225 million. Our initial outlook for guidance for 2015 includes the following assumptions. We anticipate that freight costs will continue to be a headwind to gross margin for the year based on continued pressure on freight rates. We are budgeting lower diesel fuel costs than a year ago. As you have noticed, weather has presented early challenges throughout most of our Northern and Midwestern areas to this point in the first quarter. Easter will be 2 weeks earlier than the prior year, which represents an estimated $8 million headwind to sales. We are pleased to see agreement was reached last week in related to the West Coast ports. We may continue to experience some product delays as the port congestion is relieved in the upcoming months. The previously mentioned noncash charge of $0.01 per diluted share relates to the inventory accounting change, and we do not anticipate any share repurchases in 2015 and we cannot predict future currency fluctuations so we do not adjust our guidance for any potential changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumed a tax rate of 38.4% for the first quarter and 38.3% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 206.9 million shares for the first quarter and 207.1 million shares for the full year. 
For the first quarter 2015, we are forecasting sales to range from $2.15 billion to $2.20 billion, and diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition cost, in the range of $0.69 to $0.74 which would represent a 3% to 10% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.67 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low- to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 6.9% square footage growth. Additionally, we have not included any acquisition-related cost in our first quarter guidance, as we cannot currently forecast the timing of when these costs will be incurred. For the full fiscal year of 2015, we are forecasting sales in the range of $9.21 billion to $9.45 billion based on a low to -- low-mid-single digit increase in same-store sales and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related cost, are expected to range from $3.30 to $3.50. This represents an increase of 6% to 12% over 2014 earnings per diluted share, excluding acquisition-related cost of $3.12. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I did want to address one question that some of you expressed. Following the completion of the Family Dollar transaction, we will adopt segment reporting. This will provide you with the visibility into the performance of both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar on a standalone basis. I will now turn the call back over to Bob."

Before going to Q&A, I want to make a few comments on our pending acquisition of Family Dollar. I'll tell you that we're more enthusiastic about the transaction today than when we originally announced our merger agreement in la",1208,"Thank you very much, Kevin. Before going to Q&A, I want to make a few comments on our pending acquisition of Family Dollar. I'll tell you that we're more enthusiastic about the transaction today than when we originally announced our merger agreement in late July. We are extremely encouraged to see the overwhelming support from Family Dollar shareholders on their January 22 vote. Their approval was a crucial step in our moving forward with the transaction that will create a leading discount retailer in North America. I am pleased that throughout the process, Dollar Tree remained committed to its strategy, and was able to gain shareholder approval without increasing our offer. I would like to personally commend Family Dollar's team members on their efforts over the past 7 months. While their reported results have not been stellar, we acknowledge that they've been operating through unique circumstances with great uncertainty regarding the future of the Family Dollar business and we're eager to welcome Family Dollar associates to the Dollar Tree team. We appreciate the dedication and efforts of Family Dollar's associates throughout the integration planning process, and we look forward to working together to further grow and improve the Family Dollar brand. 
The strategic rationale for this combination is powerful. We are combining 2 very large companies with more than 13,000 stores achieving almost $19 billion in sales, and more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA. We're combining 2 established and respected brands in the most economically resilient sector of retailing. The discount retail sector has flourished through all economic cycles. We're combining 2 complementary business models across fixed and multi-priced strategies, creating the ability to serve a broader range of customers and geography. The Dollar Tree target customers is largely a suburban customer, while the Family Dollar customer is largely urban and rural. We're combining complementary merchandise expertise, adding the Family Dollar strength and name brand consumable products to the Dollar Tree variety, seasonal and discretionary product and global sourcing power. This combination generates significant immediate opportunities for operational improvement and near-term opportunities for synergies. We have identified the opportunity to realize at least $300 million in annual run rate hard cost synergies by the end of year 3. 
We have categorized these synergies into 4 primary categories and have ranked them in order of magnitude. First is sourcing and procurement. Opportunities here will include lower cost of products through leveraging the size of our buys, rationalizing our vendor base, driving scale with common vendors, increasing direct-to-factory sourcing and increased efficiencies through global sourcing and the supply chain. Second is format optimization. We will operate and grow both banners, and we plan to re-banner stores selectively to better match the brand to the market demographic, and to improve the productivity of the store. Most of the early re-bannering will be Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores. Next is reduced overhead. Over time, we will reduce cost through shared services, reducing redundant public company and board cost and through systems integrations, and last, distribution and logistics through scale and operational efficiency. We expect to reduce inbound and outbound freight cost, both domestic and international. 
Additionally, primary areas of our initial focus will include, first of all, the customer. A focus on the needs of the value customer and delivering the merchandise assortment that serves their needs and their wants. This will include a mix of name brand and private label basics alongside variety and seasonally relevant product. We will continue to return to EDLP and delivering value at competitive prices. Second, productivity. We will focus on improving sales per foot and inventory productivity by expanding high-performing categories and eliminating products that do not meet our sales and profitability threshold. We plan to focus on the customer experience, and improving the table stakes by developing plans to consistently deliver the promise of a bright, clean and friendly store to shop. We will be tracking team metrics to monitor progress. We plan to focus on reducing field management turnover and providing appropriate incentives to the people who directly serve our customers. We plan to improve our new store remodeling expansion performance with a keen focus on profitability, improvement and metrics and ROIC. Overall, we will bring a disciplined approach to driving a key strategic initiative and a performance-oriented culture to the larger company through improved communications, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We are confident that placing our initial emphases in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
I will tell you that both companies are ready to integrate. The lengthy delays through this process have afforded us a significant amount of time to focus on integration planning. Our integration management office is comprised of 10 functional teams that have detailed strategies, objectives and task with assigned milestones for achieving these tasks. Our functional teams are dedicated to cost of goods sold, supply chain, indirect spending, merchandising, finance, human resources, information technology, general and administrative cost, including legal, internal audit and others, real estate and store operations. Our team is incredibly excited about this transformational opportunity to grow our business for the long term by adding the Family Dollar banner to the Dollar Tree portfolio of brands. As always, we will manage this business with a focus on what is best for our stakeholders, including our customers, our vendor partners, our associates and importantly, our long-term shareholders. 
Now back to Dollar Tree. As I previously mentioned, I'm extremely proud of the team's fourth quarter and full year performance, and I'm incredibly excited about Dollar Tree's future. The Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record level of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 7 consecutive years, quarter-after-quarter, Dollar Tree has delivered same-store sales increases of more than 1% every single quarter. Consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. For 6 consecutive years, our annual gross margin rate has exceeded 35%. At Dollar Tree, we are in control of our gross margin rate. It's all about the mix and having an extremely disciplined approach to sourcing product for our stores. We have consistently delivered solid margin rates through both inflationary and deflationary cycles. Our expenses are managed effectively, focused on overall returns. And as a result of driving sales, managing margins and controlling expenses, we have delivered 5 consecutive years of double-digit operating margins that continue to lead the discount retail sector. We remain committed to the concept our customers love, and we are positioned for continued profitable growth for many years ahead. We have a talented management team that has a long history of retail success, and importantly, with the addition of Family Dollar, we will be a bigger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for, great value. Such a great time to be Dollar Tree. Our inventories are clean and fresh. The shelves are full of the right product for the first half of 2015, and our values have never been better.

Obviously, the offset is -- a partial offset is the fact that diesel is, today, running roughly $2.90 versus running, I think, last year in Q4. It was about $3.85. So it is down significantly which is the help to offset it. I think we look at the fact that we want to continue to drive sales. You've seen the -- we had some great success this year with investing in some brand products that -- our wow items to our consumers, the brands they know, brands that they love to be able to get at the dollar price point, and emergence has done a great job of sourcing those items and putting them in. So I think we'll continue to look at that at driving sales. I think  on an overall basis, next year, I think again at a low- to -- to low, mid-single digit comp, we expect to see a little bit of leverage on occupancy, as we have traditionally, in the last few years. So I think, overall, depending on where freight comes out, I think we're looking at gross profit flat and to up or down 10 basis point is kind of the way we think about it.

Total sales grew 10.8% to $2.48 billio",1911,"Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014. For the quarter, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 5.6%. Total sales grew 10.8% to $2.48 billion. Operating income increased by $42.1 million or 12.1%, and operating margin for the quarter was 15.8%, a 20 basis point improvement from the prior year's fourth quarter. Net income increased 12.2% to $239 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 13.7% to $1.16 compared with fourth quarter 2013 earnings of $1.02 per diluted share. 
For the full year fiscal 2014, total sales increased 9.7% to $8.6 billion. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 4.4% as a result of a 3.4% increase in traffic and a 90 basis point increase in average ticket. Operating income increased by $98.4 million to nearly $1.07 billion. Operating margin was a sector leading 12.4%, a 4 basis point increase versus the prior year. Net income was $645.6 million compared with $596.7 million last year, and adjusted earnings per diluted share was a record $3.12, an increase of 14.7% compared with $2.72 per diluted share last year. 
I'm extremely proud of our team's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. We have great momentum in our business as we serve a very loyal and growing customer base. In fact, in 2014, for the first time in company history, we exceeded 1 billion customer transactions in a year. Our results continue to validate that Dollar Tree is part of the solution for millions of consumers, as they strive to balance their household budgets. Our merchants continue to deliver product that exceeds customer expectations, and our store teams consistently provide a clean, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our focus continues to be on serving our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector, while our values are greater than ever and our prices, as always, are just $1 per item. Our customers know that at Dollar Tree, you can splurge. Yes, you can afford it at Dollar Tree. Same-store sales were solid and accelerated throughout the quarter. Performance in the home, seasonal and basics divisions were tightly grouped and our sales increase resulted from strength in both basic consumables and discretionary products. Top-performing categories include party supplies, household products and food. Additionally, sales performance in the fourth quarter was relatively consistent across the country, with all zones achieving positive same-store sales increases. 
Our merchandising teams put together a terrific plan for the fourth quarter and the store teams work together to execute the plan. Immediately following Halloween, the stores transitioned swiftly for the upcoming holidays. When our doors opened on November 1, store presentations boldly communicated Dollar Tree was the go-to store for our customers' Thanksgiving and Christmas needs. In early November, we focused on first of the month consumables, including Thanksgiving-related foods like chicken broth, vegetables and soups. We placed emphasis on taking care of the customer needs related to holiday meals, with baking basics, mixing bowls, foil pans, Turkey basters and food storage containers, and we addressed the customer's needs related to holiday entertaining with catering trays, bowls and servers. Our home for the holidays promotion featured dinnerware, glassware, table linens and snack foods, like cookies, mints and party mix, all for $1. 
Immediately following Thanksgiving, our stores made a swift transition to holiday decorations, Toyland and great gift ideas. This year, merchants and storage worked together to build upon last year's introduction of the Last 10 Days strategy by bringing all of the last-minute categories together, and re-merchandising the front of the store with a purpose. Our goal is to be the gift supply headquarters for items like holiday tins, gift bags, tissue, wrapping paper, scissors and tape. If you need to wrap it, bag it, box it or tag it, Dollar Tree is the store for you. In addition to our seasonal energy throughout the quarter, our stores continue to highlight and promote our million dollar brands that provide great values to our customers. These are brands they know and trust like Downy, paper towels, Crest toothpaste and many more.  Following the Christmas holidays, our stores transitioned quickly to party supplies for the big game season. At Dollar Tree, we operate in an environment of continuous improvement, always striving to improve from season to season. We ended the year with our inventory clean, well-balanced and stores prepared for the new fiscal year. Our Valentine's Day season was terrific, and our sell through was solid. 
Looking forward, we're positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have many opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores, increasing the productivity of all stores and further developing our newest formats, new markets and new channels as growth vehicles. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened 90 new stores and we relocated and expanded 6 existing stores for a total of 96 projects. For the full year 2014, we exceeded our new store target of 375 stores and opened 391 stores. Total square footage increased 7.4% over the prior year and we ended the year with a total of 5,367 stores across 48 states and 5 Canadian provinces. 
I'm extremely pleased with improvements in our inventory management. In 2014, we added 391 new stores and 3.2 million selling square feet, yet our overall inventory dollars remained essentially flat to the prior year and our inventory turns improved approximately 30 basis points. Our seasonal sell through was strong. Our basic in-stock was maintained, and when the customers were shopping, our stores were ready. Thanks to the efforts of our merchant, logistics and store teams, we started fiscal 2015 on plan with clean inventories, well-prepared to support first quarter 2015 sales plans.  For the full year 2015, our plan includes the opening of approximately 400 new stores and 75 relocations for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. Square footage is planned to increase 7.2% over fiscal 2014. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy on improving productivity in our existing stores. The components of this strategy include, first of all, category expansions. Our customers are finding more value as we continue to rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Customers are continuing to respond favorably to our powerful and relevant seasonal and party presentations. Our seasonal assortments continue to create merchandise energy as our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we strive to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Store teams continue to focus on customer engagement in our stores and especially at the checkout counters to drive impulse and related item sales. We are keenly focused on providing value and a shopping experience that exceeds the expectations of every customer in every store every day. Being first-of-the-month-ready is important to our customers. Our merchants and our store associates place increased emphasis on displays of basic consumable core items at the first of each month when more customers are shopping for their basic needs. Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the fourth quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 82 additional stores, bringing our 2014 total to 473 additional stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,621 stores with plans to continue adding this important category to more stores. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it is fast returning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including the higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customers. 
In addition to new Dollar Tree stores in the U.S., Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$ are key brands in our portfolio and key components of our growth strategy. In fourth quarter, we continued to grow our store count in Canada by adding 5 new stores. For the full year 2014, we added 30 net new stores, expanded 2 stores and ended the year with a total of 210 Dollar Tree Canada stores. We are building the merchant and store teams in Canada to better serve the Canadian customer. Leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants are sourcing higher value product and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We're pleased with the progress we're making in Canada, and in fact, the fourth quarter comp for Dollar Tree Canada was the strongest quarter yet. We have significant growth potential in Canada. We're confident the Canadian market will support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores and this is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States. We want to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25 just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point. Our Deal$ format further extends our ability to serve more customers. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price points, we have the opportunity to serve more customers with more categories. Deal$ stores provide low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. The stores operate using a multiple price point strategy, and they have the potential to generate higher store volume with a higher average ticket. We ended the year with a total of 219 Deal$ stores. 
In addition to Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$, our online business at Dollar Tree Direct is growing in size and performance. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness, and attract more customers into our stores. In the fourth quarter, we significantly enhanced the functionality of the site's search feature on our website. Now when customers search for a specific product, it provided relevant and related content for the product, including videos, craft sheets, ratings and reviews. Our Dollar Tree customers are crafty, savvy, frugal and connected, and this enhanced site search functionalities placed all those traits. Also, in Q4, Dollar Tree Direct introduced a new holiday Christmas section of our website. This section has provided a video, an interactive game and many great holiday craft and gift ideas. Based on a number of customers both old and new that flock to the site, we know it was a big hit. We continue to leverage social media to connect with customers. A few examples of our growth includes our loyalty program, called The Value Seekers Club, which has grown nearly 80% over the past 12 months. Our email subscriber database has grown 26%, and our Facebook fan base has increased by 31%. Social media continues to provide tremendous opportunities to communicate about exciting events and great products both in our stores and online. Whether customers prefer to contact Dollar Tree Direct via their phones, their tablets, their laptops or their desktops, we're ready and able to connect with them. We continue to be very pleased with the growth of both sales and visitors to our Dollar Tree Direct business. Please check us out at DollarTree.com. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our initial outlook for 2015."
27685,256795225,770059,"Dollar Tree, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Dollar Tree, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7% to $1.16 per diluted share. Once again, we are very pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 5.6% comp sales performance was compo",1309,"Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7% to $1.16 per diluted share. Once again, we are very pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 5.6% comp sales performance was composed of a 5% increase in traffic and a 0.5% increase in average ticket. Geographically, our performance was strongest in the Midwest and Southeast, as well as markets where we cycled significant weather disruptions from a year ago.  In our previous 8-K, we announced our same store sales for the first 2 months of the quarter was 5.2%. January was our strongest comp month of the quarter as we're cycling a large number of weather-related store closings from the prior year. 
Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 37.1% during the fourth quarter compared with 36.9% in the prior year fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points. The improvement was a result of the following: we gained 30 basis points of leverage in occupancy and distribution costs resulting from strong same-store sales; we experienced higher initial markup and reduced markdowns across many categories. The higher IMU reflects continued improvement in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model. Overall, merchandise mix contributed to margin rate. However, it was offset by our commitment to provide greater value to consumers in order to drive traffic and capture share. We continue to be pleased with the results we are seeing. Freight cost as a percentage of sales increased, as domestic trucking rates were higher, reflecting the effects of industry-wide driver shortages. The increase was partially offset by lower diesel cost.
Excluding acquisition-related costs, SG&A expenses were 21.3% of sales for the quarter, flat compared to the fourth quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses increased 25 basis points for the quarter as store bonuses, retirement plan contributions and incentive compensation increased based on the company's strong performance. These are partially offset by reduced store payroll due to improved productivity and lower worker's compensation expenses. Store operating and corporate costs improved in the areas of utilities, repairs and maintenance, store supply, legal fees and depreciation, offsetting the payroll-related expense increase. 
Adjusted operating income increased $42.1 million compared to the fourth quarter last year, and adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points to 15.8%. For full year 2014, our operating margin was 12.4%, consistent with last year despite persistent freight cost headwinds related to the domestic driver shortages in the trucking industry. The tax rate for the quarter was 36.6% versus 37.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This decrease was due to the reenactment of the work opportunity's tax credit for 2014 in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, the tax rate was 37.3% compared with 37.5% in 2013. 
Looking at the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at year end totaled $864.1 million versus $267.7 million at the end of fiscal 2013. Our consolidated inventory at year end was flat to last year, while selling square footage increased 7.4%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot actually decreased 6.9%, and our inventory turn improved 30 basis points to 4.4x for the year. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for 2015. 
The company uses the retail inventory method to assign costs to store inventories. In fiscal 2010, the company made an inventory accounting change for its U.S. operations going from one inventory pool to approximately 30. Effective February 1, 2015, the first day of fiscal 2015, the company will adopt the same method for our Canadian operations. This change will facilitate improved decision-making, and further enhance our assortment planning process. The company expects to record a non-recurring, noncash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of approximately $3 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2015. This impact is included in our guidance. There will be no effect on prior periods related to this change in inventory accounting. 
Capital expenditures were $71.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This compares with $46 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2014, capital expenditures were $325.6 million, which was below our prior expectation of $360 million to $370 million, and compares with $330.1 million in 2013. For 2015, we are currently planning consolidated capital expenditures to range from $465 million to $475 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, the addition of frozen or refrigerated capability to approximately 320 stores, IT system enhancements, the construction of a new Southeast distribution center and the expansion of our current Olive Branch, Mississippi distribution center. Please note that upon completion of the Family Dollar transaction, we may reconsider our 2015 capital expenditure plan based on a comprehensive review of the combined distribution network and related capacity. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $54.4 million for the fourth quarter versus $50.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. For 2014, total depreciation was $205.9 million, a 4 basis point improvement from last year. For 2015, depreciation and amortization is estimated to range from $215 million to $225 million. Our initial outlook for guidance for 2015 includes the following assumptions. We anticipate that freight costs will continue to be a headwind to gross margin for the year based on continued pressure on freight rates. We are budgeting lower diesel fuel costs than a year ago. As you have noticed, weather has presented early challenges throughout most of our Northern and Midwestern areas to this point in the first quarter. Easter will be 2 weeks earlier than the prior year, which represents an estimated $8 million headwind to sales. We are pleased to see agreement was reached last week in related to the West Coast ports. We may continue to experience some product delays as the port congestion is relieved in the upcoming months. The previously mentioned noncash charge of $0.01 per diluted share relates to the inventory accounting change, and we do not anticipate any share repurchases in 2015 and we cannot predict future currency fluctuations so we do not adjust our guidance for any potential changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumed a tax rate of 38.4% for the first quarter and 38.3% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 206.9 million shares for the first quarter and 207.1 million shares for the full year. 
For the first quarter 2015, we are forecasting sales to range from $2.15 billion to $2.20 billion, and diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition cost, in the range of $0.69 to $0.74 which would represent a 3% to 10% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.67 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low- to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 6.9% square footage growth. Additionally, we have not included any acquisition-related cost in our first quarter guidance, as we cannot currently forecast the timing of when these costs will be incurred. For the full fiscal year of 2015, we are forecasting sales in the range of $9.21 billion to $9.45 billion based on a low to -- low-mid-single digit increase in same-store sales and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related cost, are expected to range from $3.30 to $3.50. This represents an increase of 6% to 12% over 2014 earnings per diluted share, excluding acquisition-related cost of $3.12. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I did want to address one question that some of you expressed. Following the completion of the Family Dollar transaction, we will adopt segment reporting. This will provide you with the visibility into the performance of both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar on a standalone basis. I will now turn the call back over to Bob."

Before going to Q&A, I want to make a few comments on our pending acquisition of Family Dollar. I'll tell you that we're more enthusiastic about the transaction today than when we originally announced our merger agreement in la",1208,"Thank you very much, Kevin. Before going to Q&A, I want to make a few comments on our pending acquisition of Family Dollar. I'll tell you that we're more enthusiastic about the transaction today than when we originally announced our merger agreement in late July. We are extremely encouraged to see the overwhelming support from Family Dollar shareholders on their January 22 vote. Their approval was a crucial step in our moving forward with the transaction that will create a leading discount retailer in North America. I am pleased that throughout the process, Dollar Tree remained committed to its strategy, and was able to gain shareholder approval without increasing our offer. I would like to personally commend Family Dollar's team members on their efforts over the past 7 months. While their reported results have not been stellar, we acknowledge that they've been operating through unique circumstances with great uncertainty regarding the future of the Family Dollar business and we're eager to welcome Family Dollar associates to the Dollar Tree team. We appreciate the dedication and efforts of Family Dollar's associates throughout the integration planning process, and we look forward to working together to further grow and improve the Family Dollar brand. 
The strategic rationale for this combination is powerful. We are combining 2 very large companies with more than 13,000 stores achieving almost $19 billion in sales, and more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA. We're combining 2 established and respected brands in the most economically resilient sector of retailing. The discount retail sector has flourished through all economic cycles. We're combining 2 complementary business models across fixed and multi-priced strategies, creating the ability to serve a broader range of customers and geography. The Dollar Tree target customers is largely a suburban customer, while the Family Dollar customer is largely urban and rural. We're combining complementary merchandise expertise, adding the Family Dollar strength and name brand consumable products to the Dollar Tree variety, seasonal and discretionary product and global sourcing power. This combination generates significant immediate opportunities for operational improvement and near-term opportunities for synergies. We have identified the opportunity to realize at least $300 million in annual run rate hard cost synergies by the end of year 3. 
We have categorized these synergies into 4 primary categories and have ranked them in order of magnitude. First is sourcing and procurement. Opportunities here will include lower cost of products through leveraging the size of our buys, rationalizing our vendor base, driving scale with common vendors, increasing direct-to-factory sourcing and increased efficiencies through global sourcing and the supply chain. Second is format optimization. We will operate and grow both banners, and we plan to re-banner stores selectively to better match the brand to the market demographic, and to improve the productivity of the store. Most of the early re-bannering will be Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores. Next is reduced overhead. Over time, we will reduce cost through shared services, reducing redundant public company and board cost and through systems integrations, and last, distribution and logistics through scale and operational efficiency. We expect to reduce inbound and outbound freight cost, both domestic and international. 
Additionally, primary areas of our initial focus will include, first of all, the customer. A focus on the needs of the value customer and delivering the merchandise assortment that serves their needs and their wants. This will include a mix of name brand and private label basics alongside variety and seasonally relevant product. We will continue to return to EDLP and delivering value at competitive prices. Second, productivity. We will focus on improving sales per foot and inventory productivity by expanding high-performing categories and eliminating products that do not meet our sales and profitability threshold. We plan to focus on the customer experience, and improving the table stakes by developing plans to consistently deliver the promise of a bright, clean and friendly store to shop. We will be tracking key metrics to monitor progress. We plan to focus on reducing field management turnover and providing appropriate incentives to the people who directly serve our customers. We plan to improve our new store remodeling expansion performance with a keen focus on profitability, improvement and metrics and ROIC. Overall, we will bring a disciplined approach to driving a key strategic initiative and a performance-oriented culture to the larger company through improved communications, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We are confident that placing our initial emphases in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
I will tell you that both companies are ready to integrate. The lengthy delays through this process have afforded us a significant amount of time to focus on integration planning. Our integration management office is comprised of 10 functional teams that have detailed strategies, objectives and task with assigned milestones for achieving these tasks. Our functional teams are dedicated to cost of goods sold, supply chain, indirect spending, merchandising, finance, human resources, information technology, general and administrative cost, including legal, internal audit and others, real estate and store operations. Our team is incredibly excited about this transformational opportunity to grow our business for the long term by adding the Family Dollar banner to the Dollar Tree portfolio of brands. As always, we will manage this business with a focus on what is best for our stakeholders, including our customers, our vendor partners, our associates and importantly, our long-term shareholders. 
Now back to Dollar Tree. As I previously mentioned, I'm extremely proud of the team's fourth quarter and full year performance, and I'm incredibly excited about Dollar Tree's future. The Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record level of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 7 consecutive years, quarter-after-quarter, Dollar Tree has delivered same-store sales increases of more than 1% every single quarter. Consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. For 6 consecutive years, our annual gross margin rate has exceeded 35%. At Dollar Tree, we are in control of our gross margin rate. It's all about the mix and having an extremely disciplined approach to sourcing product for our stores. We have consistently delivered solid margin rates through both inflationary and deflationary cycles. Our expenses are managed effectively, focused on overall returns. And as a result of driving sales, managing margins and controlling expenses, we have delivered 5 consecutive years of double-digit operating margins that continue to lead the discount retail sector. We remain committed to the concept our customers love, and we are positioned for continued profitable growth for many years ahead. We have a talented management team that has a long history of retail success, and importantly, with the addition of Family Dollar, we will be a bigger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for, great value. Such a great time to be Dollar Tree. Our inventories are clean and fresh. The shelves are full of the right product for the first half of 2015, and our values have never been better.

Obviously, the offset is -- a partial offset is the fact that diesel is, today, running roughly $2.90 versus running, I think, last year in Q4 it was about $3.85. So it is down significantly which is the help to offset it. I think we look at the fact that we want to continue to drive sales. You've seen the -- we had some great success this year with investing in some brand products that -- our wow items to our consumers, the brands they know, brands that they love to be able to get at the dollar price point, and emergence has done a great job of sourcing those items and putting them in. So I think we'll continue to look at that at driving sales. I think  on an overall basis, next year, I think again at a low- to -- to low, mid-single digit comp, we expect to see a little bit of leverage on occupancy, as we have traditionally, in the last few years. So I think, overall, depending on where freight comes out, I think we're looking at gross profit flat and to up or down 10 basis point is kind of the way we think about it. And again, it's always about managing through the business where there are items that our freights' up.

Fourth quarter always has opportunities to show more value on higher margin products with more of the discretionary product. Our discretionary product grew at a little faster rate than our consumer product in the fourth quarter, for example. So while we drove a terrific comp, we drove more of the comp with discretionary variety products. So that's a good thing. But I wouldn't read anything on to the annual numbers, as we've always had the strategy of as we got better cost or better prices, reinvesting some of that, not taking it straight in the gross margin, but reinvesting it to more value for the customer and that's what you see when you see the consistency of our gross profit over the years. So no change in the strategy. I think what you see in there is just the fourth quarter effort and initiative. Are there any more questions?"

This morning, we announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 3.4% in the quarter, driven by both increased traffic and increased average tick",2080,"Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 3.4% in the quarter, driven by both increased traffic and increased average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 3.1%. Total sales grew 8.8% to $2.18 billion. Operating income increased by $11.3 million or 4.9% and operating margin for the quarter was 11.2% compared to 11.6% from the prior year's first quarter. Net income increased 5.8% to $146.3 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 6% to $0.71 compared with first quarter 2014 earnings of $0.67 per diluted share. 
First quarter results continue to validate the relevance of Dollar Tree. Customers are shopping with us more often, we're attracting new customers everyday and when the customers are in the store,  they're buying more. Comp sales for the quarter grew as a result of increases in both traffic and average ticket. This was a unique quarter with several factors impacting Dollar Tree and other retailers. In particular, a calendar shift with Easter falling 2 weeks earlier this year, we estimate the impact of holiday calendar shift was a negative $8 million to sales, and additionally, the recent West Coast port slowdown increased in the severity and lasted longer than expected and it negatively impacted our earnings as higher-margin import merchandise was delayed in getting to the stores. This resulted in lost high-margin sales in the first quarter, incremental transportation and delivery cost per shipment that had to be diverted to alternate facilities and increased labor costs as stores managed uncertain product flow and delivery reschedules. The good news is that we are reasonably caught up in the DCs, the merchandise flow of our imports coming through the West Coast is more normalized, product is shipping to the stores more efficiently and our customers are seeing fresh, new, high-value merchandise in the stores. I am particularly proud of our merchandise, logistics and store teams who worked hard to execute the plan during this timeframe. Despite these challenges, both sales and earnings were at the midpoint of our range of guidance for the quarter. 
Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store everyday. Our merchants do a great job sourcing products that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements and our store teams focus on providing a clean, fun and friendly shopping experience. Customers know that when they pull into the parking lot at Dollar Tree, everything's going to be priced at just $1 per item. Our merchandise values are better than ever and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector. 
First quarter same-store sales on a constant currency basis were solid at 3.4%. Both traffic and average ticket increased, and as expected, March was our strongest comp month reflecting the Easter calendar shift. Adjusting for the holiday shift, same-store sales were relatively balanced by month throughout the quarter. Sales performance across the home, seasonal and basics divisions were tightly grouped and our sales increase resulted from strength in both basic consumables and discretionary products with discretionary products leading the way. Top-performing categories included party supplies, food and household products. Geographically, with the exception of our Western zone, comp sales performance across the country was relatively consistent in the first quarter. Delayed receipts related to port congestions primarily impacted our Western stores. Despite these challenges, our Western zone still produced slightly positive same-store sales in the first quarter. Seasonal energy was high throughout the quarter beginning with Valentine's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well-stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for that special purpose or that special person. Seasonal sell through was good and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to St. Patrick's Day and Easter.  While the seasonal display in February, they quickly turned to green in early March with hats, necklaces, socks and party supplies for St. Patrick's Day. And for Easter, our customers found jellybeans, Easter bunnies, chocolate candy baskets and basket stuffers, everything necessary to build colorful, cost-effective Easter baskets for the kids. And for the party planners, our high-value assortment of entertaining needs, including baking products, plates, bowls, cups and napkins, was well-received. 
We continue to invest in our customers by offering high-value product. In addition to the seasonal energy in first quarter, our President's Day event emphasized unbelievable values on many name brand bonus buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. We offered tremendous values and all priced at just $1 per item. And not to forget the basics throughout the quarter, we highlighted our million dollar brands with signing and special displays of this everyday items that provide great boundaries to our customers especially to meet their spring cleaning and spring decorating needs. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced and stores prepared for Mother's Day and summer fun. As we entered May in our fiscal second quarter, we've been pleased with early sales and traffic trends. 
Looking forward, we are positioned for increased relevance to our customer's sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores, increasing the productivity of all of our stores and further developing our new formats, new markets and new channels at growth vehicles. In the first quarter,  we opened 93 new stores and we relocated and expanded 10 existing stores for a total of 103 projects. Total square footage increased 7.1%. We ended the quarter with 5,454 stores and we're on track with our plan for fiscal 2015, which includes 400 new stores and 75 relocations and expansion for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. As a reminder, square footage growth for the full year is planned to increase 7.2% over fiscal 2014. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve productivity of our existing stores. Some of them drive the business initiative include first of all, our category expansions where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortment, pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Seasonal relevance is always important at Dollar Tree. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the season at the $1 price point. Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt is throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you will always find unexpected value and being first of the month ready is important. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the first quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 96 additional stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,716 stores and we're growing. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it's fast returning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including the higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customer. 
In addition to Dollar Tree stores in the U.S., Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$ are key brands in our portfolio and key components of our growth strategy. In the first quarter, we grew our store count in Canada by opening 10 new stores bringing our Dollar Tree Canada store base to 218 in stores. We are building the merchant and stores teams in Canada to better serve the Canadian customer. We're leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants are sourcing higher value product and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Canada, and we followed our strong Q4 performance with another solid quarter in Q1, growing comp sales for increases in both average ticket and transaction count. 
We have significant growth potential in Canada. We're confident the Canadian market will support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores and this is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States. We want to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of CAD 1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the USD 1 price point. 
Our Deal$ format further extends our ability to serve more customers. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point is providing the opportunity to serve more customers with more categories. Our Deal$ stores provide great values on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. The stores operate using a multi price point strategy and have the potential to generate greater revenues with the higher average ticket. We concluded the first quarter with a total of 221 Deal$ stores. 
In addition to Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$, we're pleased with the growth and performance of our online business. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness and attract more customers into our stores. For 2015 we have a focused commitment to driving traffic to our website. In addition to creating brand awareness and brand advocacy, we are committed to driving sales to both our e-commerce division and our stores. In the first quarter, we saw more than 12 million visits to our website through desktops, laptops, pads and phones. To help drive traffic to our site, we're employing a tremendous opportunity to reach out to existing and potential customers using a variety of marketing mechanisms. These include e-mails, social media, search engine marketing, video marketing and our Value Seekers Club. In fact, in Q1, we connected with 2 million customers via Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Pinterest. These avenues enable us to better understand what our customers like, what they want and how we can serve them better. Additionally, we continue to utilize themes on our site to display our exciting lines of product to support events, whether the theme is Valentine's Day, St. Patrick Day, Easter, Spring Fling or Summer Fun, we have great selections of products at tremendous values. In April, we launched our graduation event which runs through June. Our stores are well-stocked with the right colors to provide their customers with fantastic values for their graduation party needs. Customers are using our store color finder tool on our website to quickly identify which of their local source have their school colors. We recently distributed our summer catalog to more than 600,000 existing and potential customers. The catalog is chock-full of amazing offers to provide customers with great summer items all priced at just $1. As technology evolves and markets change, our e-commerce team continues to have success in staying on point with our tech-savvy customers and connecting with them effectively and efficiently. 
With multiple formats, inventory management is very important. It's something we watch carefully and our inventory continues to be extremely well-managed and our turns continue to increase. In the past 12 months. We've grown our store base by 7.4%, yet our overall inventory dollars have grown only 4.9%. Our seasonal sell through in first quarter was strong, our basic in stock was maintained and when the customers were shopping our stores, we're ready to serve them. Thanks to the efforts of our merchant, logistics and support teams, inventory turns increased for the quarter again. And we're well-prepared to support second quarter 2015 sales plans. 
As you know, we've always supported our plan growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We are now in the final stages of determining the location for a new and an additional DC in the southeast. We plan to break ground on DC 11 this year and have the facility online up and running and operating in Q3 of 2016. We will provide more details on this project as our plans are finalized. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for 2015."

Once again, we are pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 3.4% comp sales performance was composed of a 2.1% increase in traffic and a 1.3% increase in average ticket. Geographically, our sales performance was nicely balanced across the zones, with the exception of the Western zone as they experienced majority of the port disruption impact. However, despite experiencing delayed shipments, our Western zone produced slightly positive same-store sales. 
Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 34.4% during the first quarter compared with 34.8% in the prior year's first quarter. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable for the following factors: freight costs as a percentage of sales increased as domestic trucking rates were higher. The increase was partially offset by lower diesel costs. Additionally, we incurred added freight cost by rerouting some imports to alternate ports. Secondly, we incurred approximate 10 basis point unfavorable impact related to the $2 million noncash charge for the change in the inventory accounting method for our Canadian operations to conform Canada's policy to our U.S. policy. This charge was expected and disclosed in the guidance provided in February for the first quarter. Results for the quarter also negatively impacted our margin results. 
Excluding acquisition-related costs, SG&A expenses were 23.2% of sales for the quarter, flat as a percent of sales compared to the first quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses increased 10 basis points for the quarter as store bonuses increased based on the company sales performance and insurance costs related to health care claims increased, either partially offset by reduced store payroll due to improved productivity. Depreciation expense decreased by approximately 10 basis points as a result of leverage from the same-store sales increase. 
Adjusted operating income increased $11.3 million compared to the first quarter last year and adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points compared to last year's company record first quarter operating margin to 11.2%. Nonoperating expenses for the first quarter increased $111.5 million from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the financing for our pending acquisition of Family Dollar. As projected, our -- on our prior earnings call, our tax rate for the quarter was 38.4% versus 38.2% in the first quarter of last year. 
Looking at the balance sheet and of the cash flow, cash and cash equivalents at quarter and totaled $870.4 million compared to $387.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2015 [ph]. We also have restricted cash of $7.2 billion related to the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and Term Loan B for the Family Dollar acquisition. Proceeds are being held in an escrow account until the closing of the acquisition. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 4.9% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot decreased 2.1%. Our inventory turn increased in the first quarter, and we expect continued improvement in inventory turns for the full year. We believe current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives in the second quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $66.9 million in the first quarter of 2015 versus $71.9 million in the first quarter of last year. For the full year 2015, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $465 million to $475 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 320 stores, IT system enhancement and the construction of our new Southwest distribution center. Depreciation and amortization totaled $52.8 million for the first quarter versus $50.7 million in the first quarter of last year. For 2015, we expect depreciation and amortization to range from $215 million to $225 million. Our guidance for 2015 takes into account the actual performance in the first quarter, and except for small refinements to the share count and the tax rate is unchanged from that which we issued on February 26. It includes the following assumptions: First, we completed our May 1 ocean freight negotiations with no material change from our prior assumptions. As always, we cannot predict the direction of diesel prices for the next year. For this reason, our guidance assumes that diesel prices will remain similar to the current levels on average for fiscal 2015. We also cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.3% for the second quarter and 38.1% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 207.1 million shares for the second quarter and for the full year. 
Sales and earnings per share outlook then for the second quarter are as follows: For the second quarter of 2015, we are forecasting sales to range from $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion and diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related costs in the range of $0.63 to $0.68, which would represent a 3% to 11% increase compared to the second quarter of 2014 earnings excluding acquisition-related costs of $0.61 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low to low mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 8% share footage growth. Additionally, we have not included any acquisition-related cost in our second quarter outlook as we cannot currently forecast the timing of when these costs will be incurred. 
Our outlook for the remaining 3 quarters remains unchanged. For the full fiscal year of 2015 we are now forecasting sales in the range of $9.24 billion and $9.42 billion based on a low to low mid-single digit increase in same-store sales and 7.3% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share excluding acquisition-related costs are now expected to range from $3.32 to $3.47. This represents an increase of 6% to 11% over 2014 earnings per diluted share, excluding acquisition-related costs of $3.12.

Before going to Q&A, I know you all want to hear the latest news on our acquisition of Family Dollar. I hope you have seen the press release, and in addition I will tell you that the strategic rationale for the deal is more compelling than ever. We know much more now than we did 12 months ago and are even more enthusiastic about the long-term transformative nature of this transaction for Dollar Tree. I know you are aware it's an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations. It is the largest of any previous retail merger. Needless to say, this process has taken longer than any of us anticipated. We are continuing to work very hard to close transaction as soon as possible and our current expectation is that we can have this transaction completed in early July. Throughout this lengthy process, we have continued with our integration planning. Our integration teams have developed detailed strategies, objectives and tasks with assigned milestones for achieving these tasks. We have great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. The synergies will be achieved through a combination of both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, also called rebannering, logistics and overhead. Our prior year as a focus will be on the customer, involving merchandise assortment increase value and better meet their needs. The customer experience in the stores, we want to create a more exciting, inviting and customer friendly environment. To do that, we're going to have to lower the field turnover, we're going to have to support store initiatives and develop a more performance-based culture throughout the company. Of course, we want to and are going to continue to work very hard on plans to increase store productivity by modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity and existing stores while improving new store remodeling expansion performance. We plan to employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are ready to integrate. Our teams are incredibly excited about this opportunity to grow our business for the long term by adding the Family Dollar banner to the Dollar Tree portfolio of brands. As always, we will manage this business with a focus on what is best for our stakeholders, including our customers, our vendor partners, our associates and importantly, our long-term shareholders. I'm pleased with our position at Dollar Tree in the market as the leader in value retailing at the fixed price of $1, and I'm incredibly excited about Dollar Tree's future. The Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 29 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. Our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. We remain committed to the concept our customers love, and we are positioned for continued profitable growth for many years ahead. We have a talented management team that has a long history of retail success, and importantly, we look forward to welcoming the Family Dollar organization into our company. 
With the addition of Family Dollar, we will be a bigger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for: great value. It's great time to be Dollar Tree. Our inventories are clean and fresh, the shelves are full of the right product, and our values have never been better.

But the evidence is there that our West Coast stores underperformed. We did, we scrambled all quarter, really starting the last year but got a little more severe in the first quarter. We did all the things that we were able to do as far as shipping merchandise earlier to get it into the stores earlier. We used alternate ports, we used different modes of transportation once we got into those ports to get it to the right place and we just scrambled all quarter. The effect was we actually had our Easter product in and our Valentines product in, but it was all the other things, all the basics that we import, the housewares and all the textiles and all those apparel items for the upcoming summer season and all those things that were slow in getting in. Then, of course, once they hit the coast, as you know, they were just anchored out there, lots of ships anchored with lots of containers. They continue to unload, but it was slower. And all the freight that was coming into those West Coast ports starting backing up, which made it even more complex. We were negatively impacted in multiple ways, first of all, top line sales, especially in the West Coast stores, and it was the higher margin product that was delayed, it was our imports. So top line sales were impacted, margin was impacted. Freight, we spent more money on transportation and we had more costs as products were rerouted to alternate ports. And then, of course, the disruption in the stores as the store teams had planned to set whatever product, whatever promotion it was just -- it always came but it was late. And the timing was off which made our stores really work a lot harder. There was more uncertainty and unloading the product when the product was coming in and getting it on the shelves. So all of that together, just really hard to put your finger  around it. I will tell you that we finished. We're still with the disruption, we still hit the midpoint of our range of guidance on sales and earnings, if not for the port disruption, it would have been better."

Regards to the first part of your question, the freight costs, we do expect freight cost to be a headwind as we go through the year. And it's not only the driver piece of it, but it's also the fact that as we went through the economic down cycle, there are many less firms out there today, trucking firms and so the competition has gotten less in some respects. And I think the trucking industry is taking a different view of understanding the lane, certain lanes need to be profitable. And so we looked at their models to make sure that it made sense. So there's been pressure on an overall basis. So we start seeing that in the second half of last year and a lot of that was driver-related, some of that was again just the firms themselves. And so we again, we expect to see that throughout the year. And it is built into our guidance. As far as it relates to shrink, that's been a little bit tougher start of the year for shrink than we had anticipated. The loss prevention team and the stores are very focused on it, as always. Anything that we always view the things that we focus on we can make changes to it in effect. And so that's our focus right now.

We exist very well together as far as serving different customer needs, different products and for different reasons. So we're complementary in real estate, we're complementary in customers, we aspire to more the suburban customer, although we have -- we aspire to the suburban customer, the Family Dollar model aspires to that urban lower income customer and rural customer. So these 2 companies just fit incredibly well together as the opportunity is there to grow both banners, to put the right store in front of the right customer. We have tremendous room for growth at Dollar Tree. We've got over 5,000 stores now. We have for years been saying we could have 7,000 Dollar Tree stores. It's probably more than that. We just need to remodel it. And on the Family Dollar side, I only know what I've read and what you've read, but they have over 8,000 stores and they've said in their public comments that they could have 12,000. So we believe that, that is still there to be done. We believe that through the combination, we can leverage the size and scale of our buying power. We know that there are synergies and cost of good sold as we combine these companies. We know there are many back-office, synergies and savings that we can have. We know that there's huge opportunity. Combined, we have billions of dollars of spend on indirect product, things that we buy not for resale. So with that size of an opportunity together, we expect that we will get better cost, more efficiencies and improve the overall business of both companies.

But it's first about the floor plan. What do you want to show the customer? Where is the opportunity to serve the customer better? By expanding this category, can we improve sales per foot and margin per foot in our Family Dollar Stores? Then the real power of this is the combination of the 2 companies, the buying power of each so even if you don't sell the same item, we're dealing with the same categories.  In Dollar Tree, we of the same department, we have the same vendor base, we deal with the same vendors. It's just that we buy different items in many cases. So leveraging this common vendor relationships with a larger size and larger scale, we believe can be more productive and more efficient for the vendor base and that should turn into better prices for the combined Family Dollar, Dollar Tree. We already know we've been doing a lot of work. We already know there's huge synergies and exact items in both sale sell that we can get lower costs. One of us has the lower cost than the other now, so we know what that is. And then there's the similar items where it's not exactly the same item, but it's a similar item. It may be 4-packet Dollar Tree, it might be an 8-packet Family Dollar, but it's the same item with a different put up with the same vendor.

I've not quantified the exact number of stores for anyone because it's still changing. But I have said there are hundreds of opportunities to improve the productivity through our rebanner strategy. Again we see this one as our largest opportunity as we get the right banner in front of the right customers, the appropriate customers for that banner. It's an opportunity also to take a less productive story and quickly improve the productivity. The process is going to go something like this. Upon completion of transaction, we're planning to quickly rebanner a small group of test stores to verify that our analysis is correct and that our procedures are efficient and that we are touching the right things in the right order. We're going to closely track that, analyze it and if necessary, modify processes at that time for again, efficiency and then foresee to rebanner additional stores in waves. All of our initial rebanners are going to be Family Dollars to Dollar Trees. Once we close and we have complete access to the Family Dollar real estate information and their predictive model, we'll run the same process on Dollar Tree stores to determine if some of them will be more productive as Family Dollar stores and my point of view is that there will be some that should go the other way. But ultimately our strategy will be to have the banner in each market that best serves the customer of that market and provide the greatest return on investment. Second part of that question was sales per square foot, Family Dollar versus the lagging of sales in square foot. Well look, it's I think as we've gone through, there's a couple of big issues. First of all, the real estate strategy, in our opinion and in what we've seen, is the move more towards the suburban markets has not been as good. The Family Dollar Stores tend to be more productive and as urban and rural markets. And I think again sort of with the merchandise mix going a little more suburban and a little bit away from the diversity customer, the diverse customer, that low income customer, they have already identified and announced that their high low strategy was not working. And Howard and the Family Dollar management team rightfully, in our opinion, chose to go back to an everyday low price strategy and they've seen some, by their reports, they've seen some good results from that. And by the way, I think that's the right action especially with that low income customer they serve. So why is the sale per square foot lagging? Well, I believe they've gotten away from their customer. I believe by getting back to that lower income customer owning those opening price points that those customers need so far as merchandise the allocation of space and their stores and providing better opening price points and better merchandising strategy as far as price point, name brand, private label, how do you offer the most value to the customer, expanding the floor plans, expanding those departments that those customers respond more to and shrinking the ones that they don't. So that's it. I believe it's retailing 101. Honestly, I'm not trying to make it sound simple because there's a lot of stores and there's a lot of geography and there's a lot of diversity and there's a lot of competition, all the things that we face as retailers. Nothing is ever simple. But it is very clear to me in these steps and why they're lagging and it's very fixable in my mind. They've already begun some of it and I think, we'll absolutely bring more power to that."

Deal$, we've great excitement around our Deal$ brand. We built it from the beginning. Organically, we bought a company called Deal$ from Supervalu which was mostly a single price point company and we transformed it into a multi price point banner that sells we lifted the restriction of the price point to sell more product and more assortment and serve more customers. We like where we are with that at Deal$. Everything is not $1 but everything is a value. The mix in a Deal$ store is a little -- is not exactly like a Family Dollar Stores, it's a little more discretionary product, whereas Family Dollar is 70 plus percent consumer-products, Deal$ is more like 60% consumer products. So it's more of a 60/40 split. We think the Deal$ brand has made some inroads into the suburban markets with the multi price point strategy and we think the acquisition and the merger of Family Dollar will just only help that now. Down the line I can tell you that Deal$, a location here or there, there's 200 plus Deal$ stores, I can tell you that location here or there might not change to any of the others, but that's not contemplated at this point in time. It's -- my goal is to continue to build the Deal$ brand at this point. Family Dollar in Canada, I think Family Dollar would be terrific in Canada. I think the Canadian market would respond very well to another, a value, a multi price point value retailer like Family Dollar. So down the line, over the course of the future and at some point we will consider aiming that. Right now, as I know you know, we're focused, we're laser-focused on closing this deal in integration. And we need to get the company's integrated, we need to get the infrastructure reallocated, we need to get the merchandise mix reassorted, we need to get the customers reengaged. We need to do a lot of things with the integration. So anything that we would with Family Dollar in Canada would come more than 3 years out probably, sometimes off into the future. We're going to stay focused on integration and the combination as long as we need to. 7% growth, I'm not sure what your question was there but..."

Basically, you got to ask them on that right now, we don't own the company, but I believe they pulled back from where they were at high store openings for sure. They reduced their new store opening not because there's not plenty of room for them but because as I looked at their business, they weren't happy as we wouldn't be happy with the productivity of those new stores and they were pulling back as they were reviewing their strategy again, changing everyday low price, reassorting the stores to a large degree. So 2 questions there, one is, I'll to answer it, for the near-term, I believe the Family Dollar brand, we will continue to open these stores but it would be at a reduced rate would be our plan for the near-term. For the long-term, there are huge opportunities for growth at the Family Dollar brand and again, I believe the management team there has set potential for 12,000 Family Dollar Stores in the U.S. and I think that's probably right. Alongside growing our Dollar Tree brand, not changed our Dollar Tree growth or square footage or square footage growth strategy. Now we will have to take a look at how many stores can you rebanner and how many stores can you open and how many stores should you open at one time. As always, we will do this very methodically and very thoughtfully, and we will do it as efficiently as possible.

So again, it does -- we did take a hit back at that point in time and felt that for the better part of the year. That DC continues to become more efficient as we continue to add stores to it. It opened up obviously with less than a full load of what it's capacity would be and it's ramped up over time, and it probably has a little bit more capacity left. So again we're always looking to get more efficiency out of our distribution centers, but that doesn't necessarily -- i don't feel like there's a large benefit coming in the second quarter because of that. And then as far as the second part of your question, Paul, related to what comp does it takes to leverage SG&A, I mean, I think historically we have said a 2 to 3 comp will typically get us some leverage, a little leverage. It did not this quarter. I think if you go back a year ago in Q1, we had a 2% comp and 40 basis points of leverage in SG&A. As I've stated before, it ebbs and flows depending on what's going on in the business and what kind of initiatives we may or may not be driving through the company. So but I still think that roughly 3% comp is -- 2% to 3% comp is a reasonable range to think about as far as leveraging SG&A."

I will tell you that it was a much smaller acquisition, but it was total, it was a whole new country, it wasn't the 51st state. Canada is clearly a different country, regulatory requirements, culturally, language, believe it or not, duplicate labels, languages on your labels, there's a lot of intricacies entering Canada. I thought we handled most of them fairly well. The big challenge that we've had in Canada in my opinion is first of all, even though people you would think would be aware of the brand is we had no brand density. So we rebannered all those stores early on to Dollar Tree Canada from Dollar Giant. And because we don't think Dollar Giant had any brand equity either, we built more stores, and as we're getting more market density, we are building brand awareness and we're seeing some of the improvement now. So that's one of the things. Secondly, we had to build a brand-new management team and Canadian merchants and get that in place, so as always, the devil is in the details and most of the time, it's people. People, culture, Family Dollar is not a different country, but it's a different -- a little different culture, different concept and we have to be very -- we have to work together very well. It's one of the learnings that I would say on any acquisition we've ever done, it really comes down to the people and the culture and the motivation. To that, having said that, I really have great admiration for the Family Dollar organization. What they do, they do some things much better than we do, and we see that and we are happy to join in on the things that they do better and there's some things we think we can lend to the Family Dollar team also. And they've been very open to anything that we talk about so far. They still run their own business, we don't own the business yet, but in our discussion, pre-integration discussions, we're always talking about those types of things and cultural things and how do we benefit from the combination and where's the opportunity to reduce costs, increase margin and drive sales. So we are one mind of that. But that's really the big learning, I guess. And over my history and years of doing this, we've done several acquisitions. I've always asked other people that do acquisitions, so tell me one thing. We ought to be very careful of and it's always a people issue, it's always about culture, it's always about combining a diverse organization, a different organization. There are egos involved that have to be respected and of course everybody has a role. You got to get everybody pulling together. So we are aware of those things. I think we are just going to be fine as long as we're aware of it. I shared this with our management team and with our organization. And by the way I've also shared, we owned that part, not the Family Dollar people. We own the concept of bringing them in and with respect and respecting what they've done and what they built over 50-some years building that brand, the Infrastructure they built, it was very strong and very solid, the organization that they've built, the technology that they've built, the process and procedures. So it's up to us to engage with them and to bring these 2 cultures together."

There are many ways to bring value to a customer, especially a low income customer. What they -- what a low income customer needs may be not the same as someone with a high income level. And what I mean by that is as we go through the assortments, there's price competitiveness, we would intend to be competitive in the market with all the name brands and all the same items, that's sort of a cost to poker. If you're going to be in this business, you have to be competitive on the name brands and the same items. I think there's opportunity for product development, they have some pretty good private labels already. I think there's probably more room for that in rationalizing the assortment so that every item has a place, every item has a mission. What's the value statement in the category? Is it good, better, best? Is it private label versus name brand? Is it twice as much for the same price or is it the same amount for half the price? I think more attention to opening price points, a customer that has limited income may want that biggest package of the name brand but they may be very competitive. You can buy it for the same price anywhere, but you may not just have that much money in your pocket, so you may also have to have an option for that customer that says it may not be the name brand but it's a big jug of whatever and it really works and we stand behind the quality and all that goes with that. So it's not as simple than say price reinvestment. I believe we can lower retails and improve margin. But having said that, I'm talking about the mix, frankly. And we're going to be very focused on that customer, especially that low income customer, what they need, what the price points are that really motivate them. How do we deliver value overall with a combination of name brands, private labels. And then also the discretionary product. I believe that people -- if you're poor, you don't want to feel poor. When you walk into the store, you want a shopping environment that you're happy with that respects you as a human being and offers you the things that you need. So a lot of effort is going to be focused on the store and on the customer from day 1. And we will invest. I would say, more than price investment, I would say investment in the stores is where we're going to be really focused. Now we're going to pay for it somehow. There's no free investment. So we're going to have to look really hard to where we can find the synergies and the opportunity to reduce costs in order to reinvest in the stores. Some of it may be price, some of it may be anything that increases the value to the customer, might be the shopping experience too, and I believe there's big opportunity in that."

This morning, we announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 3.4% in the quarter, driven by both increased traffic and increased average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 3.1%. Total sales grew 8.8% to $2.18 billion. Operating income increased by $11.3 million or 4.9%, and operating margin for the quarter was 11.2% compared to 11.6% from the prior year's first quarter. Net income increased 5.8% to $146.3 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 6% to $0.71 compared with first quarter 2014 earnings of $0.67 per diluted share. 
First quarter results continue to validate the relevance of Dollar Tree. Customers are shopping with us more often. We're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the store,  they're buying more. Comp sales for the quarter grew as a result of increases in both traffic and average ticket. This was a unique quarter with several external factors impacting Dollar Tree and other retailers. In particular, a calendar shift with Easter falling 2 weeks earlier this year, we estimate the impact of the holiday calendar shift was a negative $8 million to sales. And additionally, the recent West Coast port slowdown increased in severity. It lasted longer than expected, and it negatively impacted our earnings as higher-margin import merchandise was delayed in getting to the stores. This resulted in lost high-margin sales in the first quarter, incremental transportation and delivery cost per shipments that had to be diverted to alternate facilities and increased labor costs as stores managed uncertain product flow and delivery schedules. The good news is that we are reasonably caught up in the DCs, the merchandise flow of our imports coming through the West Coast is more normalized, product is shipping to the stores more efficiently and our customers are seeing fresh, new, high-value merchandise in the stores. I am particularly proud of our merchandise, logistics and store teams who worked hard to execute the plan during this time frame. Despite these challenges, both sales and earnings were at the midpoint of our range of guidance for the quarter. 
Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements, and our store teams focus on providing a clean, fun and friendly shopping experience. Customers know that when they pull into the parking lot at Dollar Tree, everything's going to be priced at just $1 per item. Our merchandise values are better than ever and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector. 
First quarter same-store sales on a constant currency basis were solid at 3.4%. Both traffic and average ticket increased, and as expected, March was our strongest comp month reflecting the Easter calendar shift. Adjusting for the holiday shift, same-store sales were relatively balanced by month throughout the quarter. Sales performance across the home, seasonal and basics divisions were tightly grouped and our sales increase resulted from strength in both basic consumables and discretionary products with discretionary products leading the way. Top-performing categories included party supplies, food and household products. Geographically, with the exception of our Western zone, comp sales performance across the country was relatively consistent in the first quarter. Delayed receipts related to port congestion primarily impacted our Western stores. Despite these challenges, our Western zone still produced slightly positive same-store sales in the first quarter. Seasonal energy was high throughout the quarter, beginning with Valentine's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well-stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for that special purpose or that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to St. Patrick's Day and Easter.  While the seasonal display shout red in February, they quickly turned to green in early March with hats, necklaces, socks and party supplies for St. Patrick's Day. And for Easter, our customers found jellybeans, Easter bunnies, chocolate candy baskets and basket stuffers, everything necessary to build colorful, cost-effective Easter baskets for the kids. And for the party planners, our high-value assortment of entertaining needs, including baking products, plates, bowls, cups and napkins, was well-received. 
We continue to invest in our customers by offering high-value product. In addition to the seasonal energy in first quarter, our President's Day event emphasized unbelievable values on many name brand bonus buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. We offered tremendous values and all priced at just $1 per item. And not to forget the basics throughout the quarter, we highlighted our million dollar brands with signing and special displays of these everyday items that provide great values to our customers, especially to meet their spring cleaning and spring decorating needs. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced and stores prepared for Mother's Day and Summer Fun. As we entered May in our fiscal second quarter, we've been pleased with early sales and traffic trends. 
Looking forward, we are positioned for increased relevance to our customer's sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores, increasing the productivity of all of our stores and further developing our new formats, new markets and new channels of growth vehicles.
In the first quarter,  we opened 93 new stores and we relocated and expanded 10 existing stores for a total of 103 projects. Total square footage increased 7.1%. We ended the quarter with 5,454 stores, and we're on track with our plan for fiscal 2015, which includes 400 new stores and 75 relocations and expansion for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. As a reminder, square footage growth for the full year is planned to increase 7.2% over fiscal 2014. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive-the-business initiatives include, first of all, our category expansions where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortment, pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Seasonal relevance is always important at Dollar Tree. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt is throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value and being first-of-the-month ready is important. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the first quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 96 additional stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,716 stores and we're growing. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it is fast returning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including the higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customer. 
In addition to Dollar Tree stores in the U.S., Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$ are key brands in our portfolio and key components of our growth strategy. In the first quarter, we grew our store count in Canada by opening 10 new stores, bringing our Dollar Tree Canada store base to 218 in stores. We're building the merchant and store teams in Canada to better serve the Canadian customer. We're leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree. Our merchants are sourcing higher-value product, and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Canada, and we followed our strong Q4 performance with another solid quarter in Q1, growing comp sales for increases in both average ticket and transaction count. 
We have significant growth potential in Canada. We're confident the Canadian market will support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores and this is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States. We want to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of CAD 1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the USD 1 price point. 
Our Deal$ format further extends our ability to serve more customers. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, it is providing the opportunity to serve more customers with more categories. Our Deal$ stores provide great values on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. The stores operate using a multi-price point strategy and have the potential to generate greater revenues with a higher average ticket. We concluded the first quarter with a total of 221 Deal$ stores. 
In addition to Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$, we're pleased with the growth and performance of our online business. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness and attract more customers into our stores. For 2015, we have a focused commitment to driving traffic to our website. In addition to creating brand awareness and brand advocacy, we are committed to driving sales to both our e-commerce division and our stores. In the first quarter, we saw more than 12 million visits to our website through desktops, laptops, pads and phones. To help drive traffic to our site, we're employing a tremendous effort to reach out to existing and potential customers using a variety of marketing mechanisms. These include e-mails, social media, search engine marketing, video marketing and our Value Seekers Club. In fact, in Q1, we connected with 2 million customers via Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Pinterest. These avenues enable us to better understand what our customers like, what they want and how we can serve them better. Additionally, we continue to utilize themes on our site to display our exciting lines of product to support events. Whether the theme is Valentine's Day, St. Patrick Day, Easter, Spring Fling or Summer Fun, we have great selections of products at tremendous values. In April, we launched our graduation event which runs through June. Our stores are well-stocked with the right colors to provide their customers with fantastic values for their graduation party needs. Customers are using our Store Color Finder tool on our website to quickly identify which of their local stores have their school colors. We recently distributed our summer catalog to more than 600,000 existing and potential customers. The catalog is chock-full of amazing offers to provide customers with great summer items all priced at just $1. As technology evolves and markets change, our e-commerce team continues to have success and staying on point with our tech-savvy customers and connecting with them effectively and efficiently. 
With multiple formats, inventory management is very important. It's something we watch carefully, and our inventory continues to be extremely well-managed and our turns continue to increase. In the past 12 months, we've grown our store base by 7.4%, yet our overall inventory dollars have grown only 4.9%. Our seasonal sell-through in first quarter was strong. Our basic in-stock was maintained. And when the customers were shopping our stores, we're ready to serve them. Thanks to the efforts of our merchant, logistics and store teams, inventory turns increased for the quarter again, and we're all well-prepared to support second quarter 2015 sales plans.
As you know, we've always supported our plan growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We are now in the final stages of determining the location for a new and an additional DC in the Southeast. We plan to break ground on DC11 this year and have the facility online up and running and operating in Q3 of 2016. We will provide more details on this project as our plans are finalized. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for 2015."

As Bob mentioned, our adjusted first quarter earnings increased 6% to $0.71 per diluted share. Once again, we are pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 3.4% comp sales performance was composed of a",1024,"Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our adjusted first quarter earnings increased 6% to $0.71 per diluted share. Once again, we are pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 3.4% comp sales performance was composed of a 2.1% increase in traffic and a 1.3% increase in average ticket. Geographically, our sales performance was nicely balanced across the zones, with the exception of the Western zone as they experienced the majority of the port disruption impact. However, despite experiencing delayed shipments, our Western zone still produced slightly positive same-store sales. 
Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 34.4% during the first quarter compared with 34.8% in the prior year's first quarter. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable for the following factors: freight costs as a percentage of sales increased as domestic trucking rates were higher. The increase was partially offset by lower diesel costs. Additionally, we incurred added freight costs by rerouting some imports to alternate ports. Secondly, we incurred an approximate 10 basis point unfavorable impact related to the $2 million noncash charge for the change in the inventory accounting method for our Canadian operations to conform Canada's policy to our U.S. policy. This charge was expected and disclosed in the guidance provided in February for the first quarter. Shrink results for the quarter also negatively impacted our margin results. 
Excluding acquisition-related costs, SG&A expenses were 23.2% of sales for the quarter, flat as a percent of sales compared to the first quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses increased 10 basis points for the quarter as store bonuses increased based on the company's sales performance and insurance costs related to health care claims increased, either partially offset by reduced store payroll due to improved productivity. Depreciation expense decreased by approximately 10 basis points as a result of leverage from the same-store sales increase. 
Adjusted operating income increased $11.3 million compared to the first quarter last year, and adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points compared to last year's company record first quarter operating margin to 11.2%. Nonoperating expenses for the first quarter increased $111.5 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the financing for our pending acquisition of Family Dollar. As projected, our prior -- on our prior earnings call, our tax rate for the quarter was 38.4% versus 38.2% in the first quarter of last year. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $870.4 million compared to $387.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2014. We also have restricted cash of $7.2 billion related to the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and Term Loan B for the Family Dollar acquisition. Proceeds are being held in an escrow account until the closing of the acquisition. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 4.9% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot decreased 2.1%. Our inventory turn increased in the first quarter, and we expect continued improvement in inventory turns for the full year. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the second quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $66.9 million in the first quarter of 2015 versus $71.9 million in the first quarter of last year. For the full year 2015, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $465 million to $475 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 320 stores, IT system enhancement and the construction of our new Southwest distribution center. Depreciation and amortization totaled $52.8 million for the first quarter versus $50.7 million in the first quarter of last year. For 2015, we expect depreciation and amortization to range from $215 million to $225 million. Our guidance for 2015 takes into account the actual performance in the first quarter, and except for small refinements to the share count and the tax rate, is unchanged from that which we issued on February 26. It includes the following assumptions: first, we completed our May 1 ocean freight negotiations with no material change from our prior assumptions. As always, we cannot predict the direction of diesel prices for the next year. For this reason, our guidance assumes that diesel prices will remain similar to the current levels on average throughout fiscal 2015. We also cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.3% for the second quarter and 38.1% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 207.1 million shares for the second quarter and for the full year.
Sales and earnings per share outlook then for the second quarter are as follows: for the second quarter of 2015, we are forecasting sales to range from $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion and diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related costs in the range of $0.63 to $0.68, which would represent a 3% to 11% increase compared to the second quarter of 2014 earnings, excluding acquisition-related costs of $0.61 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low to low mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 8% square footage growth. Additionally, we have not included any acquisition-related costs in our second quarter outlook as we cannot currently forecast the timing of when these costs will be incurred. 
Our outlook for the remaining 3 quarters remains unchanged. For the full fiscal year of 2015 we are now forecasting sales in the range of $9.24 billion and $9.42 billion based on a low to low mid-single digit increase in same-store sales and 7.3% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related costs, are now expected to range from $3.32 to $3.47. This represents an increase of 6% to 11% over 2014 earnings per diluted share, excluding acquisition-related costs of $3.12. 
And I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

Before going to Q&A, I know that you all want to hear the latest news on our acquisition of Family Dollar. I hope you have seen the press release. In addition, I will tell you that the strategic rationale for the deal is more compelling than ever. We know much more now than we did 12 months ago and are even more enthusiastic about the long-term transformative nature of this transaction for Dollar Tree. I know you are aware this is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations. It is the largest of any previous retail merger. Needless to say, this process has taken longer than any of us anticipated. We're continuing to work very hard to close transaction as soon as possible, and our current expectation is that we can have this transaction completed in early July. Throughout this lengthy process, we have continued with our integration planning. Our integration teams have developed detailed strategies, objectives and tasks with assigned milestones for achieving these tasks. We have great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, also called rebannering, logistics and overhead. Our priority areas of focus will be on the customer, involving the merchandise assortment to increase value and better meet their needs. The customer experience in the stores. We want to create a more exciting, inviting and customer-friendly environment. To do that, we're going to have to lower the field turnover. We're going to have to support store initiatives and develop a more performance-based culture throughout the company. And of course, we want to and are going to -- continuing to work very hard on plans to increase store productivity by modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity in existing stores, while improving new store remodeling expansion performance. We plan to employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are ready to integrate. Our teams are incredibly excited about this opportunity to grow our business for the long term by adding the Family Dollar banner to the Dollar Tree portfolio of brands. As always, we will manage this business with a focus on what is best for our stakeholders, including our customers, our vendor partners, our associates, and importantly, our long-term shareholders. I'm pleased with our position at Dollar Tree in the market as the leader in value retailing at the fixed price of $1, and I'm incredibly excited about Dollar Tree's future. The Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 29 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. Our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. We remain committed to the concept our customers love, and we are positioned for continued profitable growth for many years ahead. We have a talented management team that has a long history of retail success. And importantly, we look forward to welcoming the Family Dollar organization into our company. 
With the addition of Family Dollar, we will be a bigger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for: great value. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree. Our inventories are clean and fresh. The shelves are full of the right product, and our values have never been better.

But the evidence is there that our West Coast stores underperformed. We did -- we scrambled all quarter, really starting the last year but got a little more severe in the first quarter. We did all the things that we were able to do as far as shipping merchandise earlier to get it into the stores earlier. We used alternate ports. We used different modes of transportation once we got into those ports to get it to the right place, and we just scrambled all quarter. The effect was we actually had our Easter product in and our Valentines product in, but it was all the other things, all the basics that we import, the housewares and all the textiles and all those apparel items for the upcoming summer season and all those things that were slow in getting in. And then, of course, once they hit the coast, as you know, they were just anchored out there, lots of ships anchored with lots of containers. They continue to unload, but it was slower. And all the freight that was coming into those West Coast ports starting backing up, which made it even more complex. We were negatively impacted in multiple ways. First of all, top line sales, especially in the West Coast stores, and it was the higher-margin product that was delayed, it was our imports. So top line sales were impacted, margin was impacted. Freight, we spent more money on transportation and we had more costs as product was rerouted to alternate ports. And then, of course, the disruption in the stores as the store teams had planned to set whatever product or whatever promotion. It was just -- it always came but it was late. And the timing was off, which made our stores really work a lot harder. There was more uncertainty in unloading the product when the product was coming in and getting it on the shelves. So all of that together, it's just really hard to put your finger  around it. I will tell you that we finished. We still, with the disruption, we still hit the midpoint of our range of guidance on sales and earnings. If not for the port disruption, it would have been better."

In regards to the first part of your question, the freight costs, we do expect freight cost to be a headwind as we go through the year. And it's not only the driver piece of it, but it's also the fact that as we went through the economic down cycle, there are many less firms out there today, trucking firms, and so the competition has gotten less in some respects. And I think the trucking industry has taken a different view of understanding the lane. Certain lanes need to be profitable. And so they've relooked at their models to make sure that it made sense and so there's been pressure on an overall basis. So we start seeing that in the second half of last year and a lot of that was driver related, but some of it was again just the firms themselves. And so we, again, we expect to see that throughout the year. And it is built into our guidance. As far as it relates to shrink, it has been a little bit tougher start of the year for shrink than we had anticipated. The loss prevention team and the stores are very focused on it, as always. Anything that we always view, the things that we focus on, we can make changes to and affect. And so that's our focus right now. But -- and I wouldn't disagree with your concept of the fact that less inventory should make it a little easier to protect it.

We aspire to different customers and we aspire to different real estate, but we're both large companies and there are instances now where we have Family Dollars and others, in most cases, frankly, within a few miles of us. When we open a new store, it is my understanding and what I believe is it doesn't really impact the Family Dollar business. When Family Dollar opens a new store near us, I can tell you it does not materially impact our Dollar Tree business. We exist very well together as far as serving different customer needs, different products and for different reasons. So we're complementary in real estate. We're complementary in customers. We aspire to more the suburban customer, although we have some of -- we aspire to the suburban customer. The Family Dollar model aspires to that urban lower income customer and rural customer. So these 2 companies just fit incredibly well together as the opportunity is there to grow both banners, to put the right store in front of the right customer. We have tremendous room for growth at Dollar Tree. We've got over 5,000 stores now. We have for years been saying that we could have 7,000 Dollar Tree stores. It's probably more than that. We just need to remodel it. And on the Family Dollar side, I only know what I've read and what you've read, but they have over 8,000 stores and they've said in their public comments that they could have 12,000. So we believe that, that is still there to be done. We believe that through the combination, we can leverage the size and scale of our buying power. We know that there are synergies and cost of goods sold as we combine these companies. We know there are many back-office synergies and savings that we can have. We know that there's huge opportunity. Combined, we have billions of dollars of spend on indirect product, things that we buy not for resale. So with that size of an opportunity together, we expect that we will get better cost, more efficiencies and improve the overall business of both companies. So it's just a huge opportunity. It's transformational. This is the one opportunity where you put the 2 together, 1 plus 1 does equal 2-point-something. One does not take away from the other, from the customer's point of view."

We can get enough feedback to know that what we're thinking is right or directionally right. But it's first about the floor plan. What do you want to show the customer? Where is the opportunity to serve the customer better? By expanding this category, can we improve sales per foot and margin per foot in our Family Dollar Stores? Then the real power of this is the combination of the 2 companies, the buying power of each. So even if we don't sell the same item, we're dealing with the same categories.  In Dollar Tree, we have the same department. We have the same vendor base. We deal with the same vendors. It's just that we buy different items in many cases. So leveraging these common vendor relationships with a larger size and larger scale, we believe can be more productive and more efficient for the vendor base and that should turn into better prices for the combined Family Dollar, Dollar Tree. We already know we've been doing a lot of work. We already know there are huge synergies in exact items on both sale sell that we can get lower costs on. One of us has a lower cost than the other now, so we know what that is. And then there's the similar items where it's not exactly the same item, but it's a similar item. It may be 4-packet Dollar Tree, it might be an 8-packet Family Dollar, but it's the same item with a different put-up and the same vendor. The idea of going out to bid or working with those vendors to get the best price for the total company is a powerful synergy that we have and one that we intend to begin leveraging on day 1."

I've not quantified the exact number of stores for anyone because it's still changing. But I have said there are hundreds of opportunities to improve the productivity through our rebanner strategy. Again, we see this as one of the largest opportunities as we get the right banner in front of the right customers, the appropriate customers for that banner. It's an opportunity also to take a less productive story and quickly improve the productivity. The process is going to go something like this. Upon completion of the transaction, we're planning to quickly rebanner a small group of test stores to verify that our analysis is correct and that our procedures are efficient and that we are touching the right things in the right order. We're going to closely track that, analyze it, and if necessary, modify processes at that time for, again, efficiency and then proceed to rebanner additional stores in waves. All of our initial rebanners are going to be Family Dollars to Dollar Trees. Once we close and we have complete access to the Family Dollar real estate information and their predictive model, we'll run the same process on Dollar Tree stores to determine if some of them will be more productive as Family Dollar stores and my point of view is that there will be some that should go the other way. But ultimately, our strategy will be to have the banner in each market that best serves the customer of that market and provides the greatest return on investment. Second part of that question was sales per square foot, Family Dollar versus the lagging of sales in square foot. Well, look, it's -- I think as we've gone through, there's a couple of big issues. First of all, the real estate strategy, in our opinion and in what we've seen, is the move more towards the suburban markets has not been as good. The Family Dollar Stores tend to be more productive in those urban and rural markets. And I think again sort of with the merchandise mix going a little more suburban and a little bit away from the diversity customer, the diverse customer, that low-income customer, they have already identified and announced that their high-low strategy was not working. And Howard and the Family Dollar management team rightfully, in our opinion, chose to go back to an everyday low price strategy and they've seen some, by their reports, they've seen some good results from that. And by the way, I think that's the right action, especially with that low-income customer they serve. So why is the sale per square foot lagging? Well, I believe they've gotten away from their customer. I believe by getting back to that lower-income customer owning those opening price points that those customers need so far as merchandise the allocation of space and their stores and providing better opening price points and better merchandising strategy as far as price point, name brand, private label, how do you offer the most value to the customer, expanding the floor plans, expanding those departments that those customers respond more to and shrinking the ones that they don't. So that's it. I believe it's retailing 101. Honestly, I'm not trying to make it sound simple because there's a lot of stores and there's a lot of geography and there's a lot of diversity and there's a lot of competition, all the things that we face as retailers. Nothing is ever simple. But it is very clear to me in these steps and why they're lagging and it is very fixable in my mind. They've already begun some of it and I think we'll absolutely bring more power to that."

Deal$, we have great excitement around our Deal$ brand. We built it from the beginning. Organically, we bought a company called Deal$ from SUPERVALU, which was mostly a single price point company and we transformed it into a multi-price point banner that sells -- we've lifted the restriction of the price point to sell more product and more assortment and serve more customers. We like where we are with that at Deal$. Everything is not $1, but everything is a value. The mix in a Deal$ store is a little -- is not exactly like a Family Dollar Store, it's a little more discretionary product, whereas Family Dollar is 70-plus percent consumer products, Deal$ is more like 60% consumer products. So it's more of a 60/40 split. We think the Deal$ brand has made some inroads into the suburban markets with the multi-price point strategy, and we think the acquisition and the merger of Family Dollar will just only help that. Now down the line, I can't tell you that Deal$, a location here or there, there's 200-plus Deal$ stores, I can't tell you that location here or there might not change to any of the others, but that's not contemplated at this point in time. It's -- my goal is to continue to build the Deal$ brand at this point. Family Dollar in Canada, I think Family Dollar would be terrific in Canada. I think the Canadian market would respond very well to another, a value -- a multi-price point value retailer like Family Dollar. So down the line, over the course of the future, at some point, we will consider aiming that. Right now, as I know you know this, we are focused, we are laser-focused on closing this deal and integration. And we need to get the companies integrated. We need to get the infrastructure reallocated. We need to get the merchandise mix reassorted. We need to get the customers reengaged. We need to do a lot of things with the integration. So anything that we would do with Family Dollar in Canada would come more than 3 years out probably, sometime off into the future. We're going to stay focused on integration and the combination as long as we need to."

It will be -- I think they've already pulled back from their original plan. I'm not really sure on that. Basically, you got to ask them on that right now, we don't own the company, but I believe they pulled back on where they were at their high store openings for sure. They reduced their new store opening not because there's not plenty of room for them but because as I looked at their business, they weren't happy, as we wouldn't be happy, with the productivity of those new stores and they were pulling back as they were reviewing their strategy again, changing the everyday low price, reassorting the stores to a large degree. So 2 questions there, one is, I'll to answer it, for the near term, I believe the Family Dollar brand, we will continue to open these stores but it will be at a reduced rate would be our plan for the near term. For the long term, there are huge opportunities for growth in the Family Dollar brand, and again, I believe the management team there has set the potential for 12,000 Family Dollar stores in the U.S. and I think that's probably right. Alongside growing our Dollar Tree brand, we have not changed our Dollar Tree growth or square footage or square footage growth strategy. Now we will have to take a look at how many stores can you rebanner and how many stores can you open and how many stores should you open at one time. As always, we will do this very methodically and very thoughtfully, and we will do it as efficiently as possible. We're driven more by doing it right than by the numbers, but anecdotally, I'm not looking to pull back the growth on Dollar Tree."

So again, it does -- we did take a hit back at that point in time and felt that for the better part of the year. That DC continues to become more efficient as we continue to add stores to it. It opened up, obviously, with less than a full load of what its capacity would be and it's ramped up over time and it probably has a little bit more capacity left. So again, we're always looking to get more efficiency out of our distribution centers, but don't necessarily -- I don't feel like there's a large benefit coming in the second quarter because of that. And then as far as the second part of your question, Paul, related to what comp does it take to leverage SG&A, I mean, I think historically we have said a 2% to 3% comp will typically get us some leverage, a little leverage. It did not this quarter. I think if you go back a year ago in Q1, we had a 2% comp and we have 40 basis points of leverage in SG&A. So as I've stated before, it ebbs and flows depending on what's going on in the business and what kind of initiatives we may or may not be driving through the company. So -- but I still think that roughly 3% comp is -- 2% to 3% comp is a reasonable range to think about as far as leveraging SG&A."

I will tell you that it was a much smaller acquisition, but it was a total -- it was a whole new country and it wasn't the 51st state. Canada is clearly a different country, regulatory requirements, culturally, language, believe it or not, duplicate labels or languages on your labels. There's a lot of intricacies in entering Canada. I thought we handled most of them fairly well. The big challenge that we've had in Canada, in my opinion, is, first of all, even though people you would think would be aware of the brand is we had no brand density. So we rebannered all those -- rebranded all those stores early on to Dollar Tree Canada from Dollar Giant because we didn't think Dollar Giant had any brand equity either. We built more stores. And as we're getting more market density, we are building brand awareness and we're seeing some of the improvement now. So that's one of the things. Secondly, we had to build a brand-new management team and Canadian merchants and get that in place. So as always, the devil is in the details and most of the time, it's people, people, culture. Family Dollar is not a different country, but it's a different -- a little different culture. It's a different concept, and we have to be very -- we have to work together very well. It's one of the learnings that I would say on any acquisition we've ever done, it really comes down to the people and the culture and the motivation. To that, having said that, I really have great admiration for the Family Dollar organization. What they do, they do some things much better than we do, and we see that and we are happy to join in on the things that they do better and there's some things we think we can lend to the Family Dollar team also. And they've been very open to anything that we talk about so far. They're still running their own business, we don't own the business yet. But in our discussions, pre-integration discussions, we're always talking about those types of things and cultural things and how do we benefit from the combination and where's the opportunity to reduce costs, increase margin and drive sales. So we are of one mind of that. But that's really the big learning, I guess. And over my history and years of doing this, we've done several acquisitions. I've always asked other people that do acquisitions, so tell me one thing we ought to be very careful of and it's always a people issue. It's always about culture. It's always about combining a diverse organization, a different organization. There are egos involved that have to be respected and, of course, everybody has a role. You got to get everybody pulling together. So we're aware of those things. I think we're going to be just fine as long as we stay aware of it. I've shared this with our management team and with our organization. And by the way, I've also shared that we own that part, not the Family Dollar people. We own the concept of bringing them in with respect and respecting what they've done and what they've built over 50-some years, building that brand, the infrastructure that they built that is very strong and very solid, the organization that they've built, the technology that they've built, the process and procedures. So it's up to us to engage with them and to bring these 2 cultures together."

There are many ways to bring value to a customer, especially a low-income customer. What they -- what a low-income customer needs may be not the same as someone with a higher-income level. And what I mean by that is as we go through the assortments, there's price competitiveness. We would intend to be competitive in the market on all the name brands, on all the same items. That's sort of a cost of poker. If you're going to be in this business, you have to be competitive on the name brands and the same items. I think there's an opportunity for product development. They have some pretty good private labels already. I think there's probably more room for that in rationalizing the assortment so that every item has a place, every item has a mission. What's the value statement in the category? And is it good, better, best? Is it private label versus name brand? Is it twice as much for the same price or is it the same amount for half the price? I think more attention to opening price points. A customer that has limited income may want that biggest package of the name brand but they -- and it may be very competitive. You can buy it for the same price anywhere, but you may just not have that much money in your pocket. So you may also have to have an option for that customer that says it may not be the name brand but it's a big jug of whatever and it really works and we stand behind the quality and all that goes with that. So it's not as simple as just saying price reinvestment. I believe we can lower retails and improve margin. But having said that, I'm talking about the mix, frankly. And we're going to be very focused on that customer, especially that low-income customer, what they need, what the price points are that really motivate them. How do we deliver value overall with a combination of name brands, private labels. And then also the discretionary product. I believe that people -- if you're poor, you don't want to feel poor. When you walk into the store, you want a shopping environment that you're happy with that respects you as a human being and offers you the things that you need. So a lot of effort is going to be focused on the store and on the customer from day 1. And we will invest. I would say, more than price investment, I would say investment in the stores is where we're going to be really focused. Now we have to pay for that somehow. There is no free investment. So we're going to have to look really hard at where we can find the synergies and the opportunity to reduce costs in order to reinvest in the stores. Some of it may be price, some of it may be anything that increases the value to that customer, might be the shopping experience too, and I believe there's big opportunity in that."

This morning, we announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 3.4% in the quarter, driven by both increased traffic and increased average tick",2076,"Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 3.4% in the quarter, driven by both increased traffic and increased average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 3.1%. Total sales grew 8.8% to $2.18 billion. Operating income increased by $11.3 million or 4.9%, and operating margin for the quarter was 11.2% compared to 11.6% from the prior year's first quarter. Net income increased 5.8% to $146.3 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 6% to $0.71 compared with first quarter 2014 earnings of $0.67 per diluted share. 
First quarter results continue to validate the relevance of Dollar Tree. Customers are shopping with us more often. We're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the store,  they're buying more. Comp sales for the quarter grew as a result of increases in both traffic and average ticket. This was a unique quarter with several external factors impacting Dollar Tree and other retailers. In particular, a calendar shift with Easter falling 2 weeks earlier this year, we estimate the impact of the holiday calendar shift was a negative $8 million to sales. And additionally, the recent West Coast port slowdown increased in severity. It lasted longer than expected, and it negatively impacted our earnings as higher-margin import merchandise was delayed in getting to the stores. This resulted in lost high-margin sales in the first quarter, incremental transportation and delivery cost per shipments that had to be diverted to alternate facilities and increased labor costs as stores managed uncertain product flow and delivery schedules. The good news is that we are reasonably caught up in the DCs, the merchandise flow of our imports coming through the West Coast is more normalized, product is shipping to the stores more efficiently and our customers are seeing fresh, new, high-value merchandise in the stores. I am particularly proud of our merchandise, logistics and store teams who worked hard to execute the plan during this time frame. Despite these challenges, both sales and earnings were at the midpoint of our range of guidance for the quarter. 
Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements, and our store teams focus on providing a clean, fun and friendly shopping experience. Customers know that when they pull into the parking lot at Dollar Tree, everything's going to be priced at just $1 per item. Our merchandise values are better than ever and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector. 
First quarter same-store sales on a constant currency basis were solid at 3.4%. Both traffic and average ticket increased, and as expected, March was our strongest comp month reflecting the Easter calendar shift. Adjusting for the holiday shift, same-store sales were relatively balanced by month throughout the quarter. Sales performance across the home, seasonal and basics divisions were tightly grouped and our sales increase resulted from strength in both basic consumables and discretionary products, with discretionary products leading the way. Top-performing categories included party supplies, food and household products. Geographically, with the exception of our Western zone, comp sales performance across the country was relatively consistent in the first quarter. Delayed receipts related to port congestion primarily impacted our Western stores. Despite these challenges, our Western zone still produced slightly positive same-store sales in the first quarter. Seasonal energy was high throughout the quarter, beginning with Valentine's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well-stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for that special purpose or that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to St. Patrick's Day and Easter.  While the seasonal display shout red in February, they quickly turned to green in early March with hats, necklaces, socks and party supplies for St. Patrick's Day. And for Easter, our customers found jellybeans, Easter bunnies, chocolate candy baskets and basket stuffers, everything necessary to build colorful, cost-effective Easter baskets for the kids. And for the party planners, our high-value assortment of entertaining needs, including baking products, plates, bowls, cups and napkins, was well-received. 
We continue to invest in our customers by offering high-value product. In addition to the seasonal energy in first quarter, our President's Day event emphasized unbelievable values on many name brand bonus buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. We offered tremendous values and all priced at just $1 per item. And not to forget the basics. Throughout the quarter, we highlighted our million dollar brands with signing and special displays of these everyday items that provide great values to our customers, especially to meet their spring cleaning and spring decorating needs. We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced and stores prepared for Mother's Day and Summer Fun. As we entered May in our fiscal second quarter, we've been pleased with early sales and traffic trends. 
Looking forward, we are positioned for increased relevance to our customers' sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores, increasing the productivity of all of our stores and further developing our new formats, new markets and new channels of growth vehicles.
In the first quarter,  we opened 93 new stores and we relocated and expanded 10 existing stores for a total of 103 projects. Total square footage increased 7.1%. We ended the quarter with 5,454 stores, and we're on track with our plan for fiscal 2015, which includes 400 new stores and 75 relocations and expansion for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. As a reminder, square footage growth for the full year is planned to increase 7.2% over fiscal 2014. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive-the-business initiatives include, first of all, our category expansions where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortment, pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Seasonal relevance is always important at Dollar Tree. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt is throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value and being first-of-the-month ready is important. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the first quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 96 additional stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,716 stores and we're growing. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it is fast returning, more frequently purchased, and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including the higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customer. 
In addition to Dollar Tree stores in the U.S., Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$ are key brands in our portfolio and key components of our growth strategy. In the first quarter, we grew our store count in Canada by opening 10 new stores, bringing our Dollar Tree Canada store base to 218 stores. We're building the merchant and store teams in Canada to better serve the Canadian customer. We're leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree. Our merchants are sourcing higher-value product, and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Canada, and we followed our strong Q4 performance with another solid quarter in Q1, growing comp sales through increases in both average ticket and transaction count. 
We have significant growth potential in Canada. We're confident the Canadian market will support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores and this is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States. We want to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of CAD 1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the USD 1 price point. 
Our Deal$ format further extends our ability to serve more customers. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, it is providing the opportunity to serve more customers with more categories. Our Deal$ stores provide great values on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. The stores operate using a multi-price point strategy and have the potential to generate greater revenues with a higher average ticket. We concluded the first quarter with a total of 221 Deal$ stores. 
In addition to Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$, we're pleased with the growth and performance of our online business. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness and attract more customers into our stores. For 2015, we have a focused commitment to driving traffic to our website. In addition to creating brand awareness and brand advocacy, we are committed to driving sales to both our e-commerce division and our stores. In the first quarter, we saw more than 12 million visits to our website through desktops, laptops, pads and phones. To help drive traffic to our site, we're employing a tremendous effort to reach out to existing and potential customers using a variety of marketing mechanisms. These include e-mails, social media, search engine marketing, video marketing and our Value Seekers Club. In fact, in Q1, we connected with 2 million customers via Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Pinterest. These avenues enable us to better understand what our customers like, what they want and how we can serve them better. Additionally, we continue to utilize themes on our site to display our exciting lines of product to support events. Whether the theme is Valentine's Day, St. Patrick Day, Easter, Spring Fling or Summer Fun, we have great selections of products at tremendous values. In April, we launched our graduation event which runs through June. Our stores are well-stocked with the right colors to provide their customers with fantastic values for their graduation party needs. Customers are using our Store Color Finder tool on our website to quickly identify which of their local stores have their school colors. We recently distributed our summer catalog to more than 600,000 existing and potential customers. The catalog is chock-full of amazing offers to provide customers with great summer items all priced at just $1. As technology evolves and markets change, our e-commerce team continues to have success and staying on point with our tech-savvy customers and connecting with them effectively and efficiently. 
With multiple formats, inventory management is very important. It's something we watch carefully, and our inventory continues to be extremely well-managed and our turns continue to increase. In the past 12 months, we've grown our store base by 7.4%, yet our overall inventory dollars have grown only 4.9%. Our seasonal sell-through in first quarter was strong. Our basic in-stock was maintained. And when the customers were shopping our stores, we're ready to serve them. Thanks to the efforts of our merchant, logistics and store teams, inventory turns increased for the quarter again, and we're all well-prepared to support second quarter 2015 sales plans.
As you know, we've always supported our planned growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We are now in the final stages of determining the location for a new and an additional DC in the Southeast. We plan to break ground on DC11 this year and have the facility online up and running and operating in Q3 of 2016. We will provide more details on this project as our plans are finalized. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for 2015."

As Bob mentioned, our adjusted first quarter earnings increased 6% to $0.71 per diluted share. Once again, we are pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 3.4% comp sales performance was composed of a",1025,"Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our adjusted first quarter earnings increased 6% to $0.71 per diluted share. Once again, we are pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 3.4% comp sales performance was composed of a 2.1% increase in traffic and a 1.3% increase in average ticket. Geographically, our sales performance was nicely balanced across the zones, with the exception of the Western zone as they experienced the majority of the port disruption impact. However, despite experiencing delayed shipments, our Western zone still produced slightly positive same-store sales. 
Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 34.4% during the first quarter compared with 34.8% in the prior year's first quarter. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to the following factors: freight costs as a percentage of sales increased as domestic trucking rates were higher. The increase was partially offset by lower diesel costs. Additionally, we incurred added freight costs by rerouting some imports to alternate ports. Secondly, we incurred an approximate 10 basis point unfavorable impact related to the $2 million noncash charge for the change in the inventory accounting method for our Canadian operations to conform Canada's policy to our U.S. policy. This charge was expected and disclosed in the guidance provided in February for the first quarter. Shrink results for the quarter also negatively impacted our margin results. 
Excluding acquisition-related costs, SG&A expenses were 23.2% of sales for the quarter, flat as a percent of sales compared to the first quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses increased 10 basis points for the quarter as store bonuses increased based on the company's sales performance, and insurance costs related to health care claims increased. These were partially offset by reduced store payroll due to improved productivity. Depreciation expense decreased by approximately 10 basis points as a result of leverage from the same-store sales increase. 
Adjusted operating income increased $11.3 million compared to the first quarter last year, and adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points compared to last year's company record first quarter operating margin to 11.2%. Nonoperating expenses for the first quarter increased $111.5 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the financing for our pending acquisition of Family Dollar. As projected, our prior -- on our prior earnings call, our tax rate for the quarter was 38.4% versus 38.2% in the first quarter of last year. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $870.4 million compared to $387.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2014. We also have restricted cash of $7.2 billion related to the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and Term Loan B for the Family Dollar acquisition. Proceeds are being held in an escrow account until the closing of the acquisition. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 4.9% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot decreased 2.1%. Our inventory turn increased in the first quarter, and we expect continued improvement in inventory turns for the full year. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the second quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $66.9 million in the first quarter of 2015 versus $71.9 million in the first quarter of last year. For the full year 2015, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $465 million to $475 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 320 stores, IT system enhancement and the construction of our new Southwest distribution center. Depreciation and amortization totaled $52.8 million for the first quarter versus $50.7 million in the first quarter of last year. For 2015, we expect depreciation and amortization to range from $215 million to $225 million. Our guidance for 2015 takes into account the actual performance in the first quarter, and except for small refinements to the share count and the tax rate, is unchanged from that which we issued on February 26. It includes the following assumptions: first, we completed our May 1 ocean freight negotiations with no material change from our prior assumptions. As always, we cannot predict the direction of diesel prices for the next year. For this reason, our guidance assumes that diesel prices will remain similar to the current levels on average throughout fiscal 2015. We also cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.3% for the second quarter and 38.1% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 207.1 million shares for the second quarter and for the full year.
Sales and earnings per share outlook then for the second quarter are as follows: for the second quarter of 2015, we are forecasting sales to range from $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion and diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related costs in the range of $0.63 to $0.68, which would represent a 3% to 11% increase compared to the second quarter of 2014 earnings, excluding acquisition-related costs of $0.61 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low to low mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 8% square footage growth. Additionally, we have not included any acquisition-related costs in our second quarter outlook as we cannot currently forecast the timing of when these costs will be incurred. 
Our outlook for the remaining 3 quarters remains unchanged. For the full fiscal year of 2015 we are now forecasting sales in the range of $9.24 billion and $9.42 billion based on a low to low mid-single digit increase in same-store sales and 7.3% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related costs, are now expected to range from $3.32 to $3.47. This represents an increase of 6% to 11% over 2014 earnings per diluted share, excluding acquisition-related costs of $3.12. 
And I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

Before going to Q&A, I know that you all want to hear the latest news on our acquisition of Family Dollar. I hope you have seen the press release. In addition, I will tell you that the strategic rationale for the deal is more compelling than ever. We know much more now than we did 12 months ago and are even more enthusiastic about the long-term transformative nature of this transaction for Dollar Tree. I know you are aware this is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations. It is the largest of any previous retail merger. Needless to say, this process has taken longer than any of us anticipated. We're continuing to work very hard to close the transaction as soon as possible, and our current expectation is that we can have this transaction completed in early July. Throughout this lengthy process, we have continued with our integration planning. Our integration teams have developed detailed strategies, objectives and tasks with assigned milestones for achieving these tasks. We have great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, also called rebannering, logistics and overhead. Our priority areas of focus will be on the customer, evolving the merchandise assortment to increase value and better meet their needs. The customer experience in the stores. We want to create a more exciting, inviting and customer-friendly environment. To do that, we're going to have to lower the field turnover. We're going to have to support store initiatives and develop a more performance-based culture throughout the company. And of course, we want to and are going to -- continuing to work very hard on plans to increase store productivity by modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity in existing stores, while improving new store remodeling expansion performance. We plan to employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are ready to integrate. Our teams are incredibly excited about this opportunity to grow our business for the long term by adding the Family Dollar banner to the Dollar Tree portfolio of brands. As always, we will manage this business with a focus on what is best for our stakeholders, including our customers, our vendor partners, our associates, and importantly, our long-term shareholders. I'm pleased with our position at Dollar Tree in the market as the leader in value retailing at the fixed price of $1, and I'm incredibly excited about Dollar Tree's future. The Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 29 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. Our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. We remain committed to the concept our customers love, and we are positioned for continued profitable growth for many years ahead. We have a talented management team that has a long history of retail success. And importantly, we look forward to welcoming the Family Dollar organization into our company. 
With the addition of Family Dollar, we will be a bigger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for: great value. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree. Our inventories are clean and fresh. The shelves are full of the right product, and our values have never been better.

But the evidence is there that our West Coast stores underperformed. We did -- we scrambled all quarter, really starting last year but got a little more severe in first quarter. We did all the things that we were able to do as far as shipping merchandise earlier to get it into the stores earlier. We used alternate ports. We used different modes of transportation once we got into those ports to get it to the right place, and we just scrambled all quarter. The effect was we actually had our Easter product in and our Valentines product in, but it was all the other things, all the basics that we import, the housewares and all the textiles and all those apparel items for the upcoming summer season and all those things that were slow in getting in. And then, of course, once they hit the coast, as you know, they were just anchored out there, lots of ships anchored with lots of containers. They continued to unload, but it was slower. And all the freight that was coming into those West Coast ports starting backing up, which made it even more complex. We were negatively impacted in multiple ways. First of all, top line sales, especially in the West Coast stores, and it was the higher-margin product that was delayed, it was our imports. So top line sales were impacted, margin was impacted. Freight, we spent more money on transportation and we had more costs as product was rerouted to alternate ports. And then, of course, the disruption in the stores as the store teams had planned to set whatever product or whatever promotion. It was just -- it always came but it was late. And the timing was off, which made our stores really work a lot harder. There was more uncertainty in unloading the product when the product was coming in and getting it on the shelves. So all of that together, it's just really hard to put your finger  around it. I will tell you that we finished. We still, with the disruption, we still hit the midpoint of our range of guidance on sales and earnings. If not for the port disruption, it would have been better."

And so they've relooked at their models to make sure that it made sense and so there's been pressure on an overall basis. So we started seeing that in the second half of last year and a lot of that was driver related, but some of it was again just the firms themselves. And so we, again, we expect to see that throughout the year. And it is built into our guidance. As far as it relates to shrink, it has been a little bit tougher start of the year for shrink than we had anticipated. The loss prevention team and the stores are very focused on it, as always. Anything that we always view, the things that we focus on, we can make changes to and affect. And so that's our focus right now. But -- and I wouldn't disagree with your concept of the fact that less inventory should make it a little easier to protect it. So it's a little bit of a trend that we didn't anticipate, but we're very focused on getting it corrected going forward."

We are side-by-side now as a matter of fact in many places and many cases. We aspire to different customers and we aspire to different real estate, but we're both large companies and there are instances now where we have Family Dollars and others, in most cases, frankly, within a few miles of us. When we open a new store, it is my understanding and what I believe is it doesn't really impact the Family Dollar business. When Family Dollar opens a new store near us, I can tell you it does not materially impact our Dollar Tree business. We exist very well together as far as serving different customer needs, different products and for different reasons. So we're complementary in real estate. We're complementary in customers. We aspire to more the suburban customer, although we have some of all -- we aspire to the suburban customer. The Family Dollar model aspires to that urban lower income customer and a rural customer. So these 2 companies just fit incredibly well together as the opportunity is there to grow both banners, to put the right store in front of the right customer. We have tremendous room for growth at Dollar Tree. We've got over 5,000 stores now. We have for years been saying that we could have 7,000 Dollar Tree stores. It's probably more than that. We just need to remodel it. And on the Family Dollar side, I only know what I've read and what you've read, but they have over 8,000 stores and they've said in their public comments that they could have 12,000. So we believe that, that is still there to be done. We believe that through the combination, we can leverage the size and scale of our buying power. We know that there are synergies and cost of goods sold as we combine these companies. We know there are many back-office synergies and savings that we can have. We know that there's huge opportunity. Combined, we have billions of dollars of spend on indirect product, things that we buy not for resale. So with that size of an opportunity together, we expect that we will get better cost, more efficiencies and improve the overall business of both companies. So it's just a huge opportunity. It's transformational. This is the one opportunity where you put the 2 together, 1 plus 1 does equal 2-point-something. One does not take away from the other, from the customer's point of view."

We can get enough feedback to know that what we're thinking is right or directionally right. But it's first about the floor plan. What do you want to show the customer? Where is the opportunity to serve the customer better? By expanding this category, can we improve sales per foot and margin per foot in our Family Dollar Stores? Then the real power of this is the combination of the 2 companies, the buying power of each. So even if we don't sell the same item, we're dealing with the same categories.  In Dollar Tree, we have the same departments. We have the same vendor base. We deal with the same vendors. It's just that we buy different items in many cases. So leveraging these common vendor relationships with a larger size and larger scale, we believe can be more productive and more efficient for the vendor base and that should turn into better prices for the combined Family Dollar, Dollar Tree. We already know we've been doing a lot of work. We already know there are huge synergies in exact items on both sale sell that we can get lower costs on. One of us has a lower cost than the other now, so we know what that is. And then there's the similar items where it's not exactly the same item, but it's a similar item. It may be 4-packet Dollar Tree, it might be an 8-packet Family Dollar, but it's the same item with a different put-up and the same vendor. The idea of going out to bid or working with those vendors to get the best price for the total company is a powerful synergy that we have and one that we intend to begin leveraging on day 1."

I've not quantified the exact number of stores for anyone because it's still changing. But I have said there are hundreds of opportunities to improve the productivity through our rebanner strategy. Again, we see this as one of the largest opportunities as we get the right banner in front of the right customers, the appropriate customers for that banner. It's an opportunity also to take a less productive story and quickly improve the productivity. The process is going to go something like this. Upon completion of the transaction, we're planning to quickly rebanner a small group of test stores to verify that our analysis is correct and that our procedures are efficient and that we are touching the right things in the right order. We're going to closely track that, analyze it, and if necessary, modify processes at that time for, again, efficiency and then proceed to rebanner additional stores in waves. All of our initial rebanners are going to be Family Dollars to Dollar Trees. Once we close and we have complete access to the Family Dollar real estate information and their predictive model, we'll run the same process on Dollar Tree stores to determine if some of them would be more productive as Family Dollar stores and my point of view is that there will be some that should go the other way. But ultimately, our strategy will be to have the banner in each market that best serves the customer of that market and provides the greatest return on investment. Second part of that question was sales per square foot, Family Dollar versus the lagging of sales in square foot. Well, look, it's -- I think as we've gone through, there's a couple of big issues. First of all, the real estate strategy, in our opinion and in what we've seen, is the move more towards the suburban markets has not been as good. The Family Dollar Stores tend to be more productive in those urban and rural markets. And I think again sort of with the merchandise mix going a little more suburban and a little bit away from the diversity customer, the diverse customer, that low-income customer, they have already identified and announced that their high-low strategy was not working. And Howard and the Family Dollar management team rightfully, in our opinion, chose to go back to an everyday low price strategy and they've seen some, by their reports, they've seen some good results from that. And by the way, I think that's the right action, especially with that low-income customer they serve. So why is the sale per square foot lagging? Well, I believe they've gotten away from their customer. I believe by getting back to that lower-income customer owning those opening price points that those customers need so far as merchandise the allocation of space and their stores and providing better opening price points and better merchandising strategy as far as price point, name brand, private label, how do you offer the most value to the customer, expanding the floor plans, expanding those departments that those customers respond more to and shrinking the ones that they don't. So that's it. I believe it's retailing 101. Honestly, I'm not trying to make it sound simple because there's a lot of stores and there's a lot of geography and there's a lot of diversity and there's a lot of competition, all the things that we face as retailers. Nothing is ever simple. But it is very clear to me the missteps and why they're lagging and it is very fixable in my mind. They've already begun some of it and I think we'll absolutely bring more power to that."

Deal$, we have great excitement around our Deal$ brand. We built it from the beginning. Organically, we bought a company called Deal$ from SUPERVALU, which was mostly a single price point company and we've transformed it into a multi-price point banner that sells -- we've lifted the restriction of the price point to sell more product and more assortment and serve more customers. We like where we are with that at Deal$. Everything is not $1, but everything is a value. The mix in a Deal$ store is a little -- is not exactly like a Family Dollar Store, it's a little more discretionary product, whereas Family Dollar is 70-plus percent consumer products, Deal$ is more like 60% consumer products. So it's more of a 60/40 split. We think the Deal$ brand has made some inroads into the suburban markets with the multi-price point strategy, and we think the acquisition and the merger of Family Dollar will just only help that. Now down the line, I can't tell you that Deal$, a location here or there, there's 200-plus Deal$ stores, I can't tell you that location here or there might not change to any of the others, but that's not contemplated at this point in time. It's -- my goal is to continue to build the Deal$ brand at this point. Family Dollar in Canada, I think Family Dollar would be terrific in Canada. I think the Canadian market would respond very well to another, a value -- a multi-price point value retailer like Family Dollar. So down the line, over the course of the future, at some point, we will consider aiming that. Right now, as I know you know this, we are focused, we are laser-focused on closing this deal and integration. And we need to get the companies integrated. We need to get the infrastructure reallocated. We need to get the merchandise mix reassorted. We need to get the customers reengaged. We need to do a lot of things with the integration. So anything that we would do with Family Dollar in Canada would come more than 3 years out probably, sometime off into the future. We're going to stay focused on integration and the combination as long as we need to."

For the long term, there are huge opportunities for growth in the Family Dollar brand, and again, I believe the management team there has set the potential for 12,000 Family Dollar stores in the U.S. and I think that's probably right. Alongside growing our Dollar Tree brand, we have not changed our Dollar Tree growth or square footage or square footage growth strategy. Now we will have to take a look at how many stores can you rebanner and how many stores can you open and how many stores should you open at one time. As always, we will do this very methodically and very thoughtfully, and we will do it as efficiently as possible. We're driven more by doing it right than by the numbers, but anecdotally, I'm not looking to pull back the growth on Dollar Tree."

So again, it does -- we did take a hit back at that point in time and felt that for the better part of a year. That DC continues to become more efficient as we continue to add stores to it. It opened up, obviously, with less than a full load of what its capacity would be and it's ramped up over time and it probably has a little bit more capacity left. So again, we're always looking to get more efficiency out of our distribution centers, but don't necessarily -- I don't feel like there's a large benefit coming in the second quarter because of that. And then as far as the second part of your question, Paul, related to what comp does it take to leverage SG&A, I mean, I think historically we have said a 2% to 3% comp will typically get us some leverage, a little leverage. It did not this quarter. I think if you go back a year ago in Q1, we had a 2% comp and we have 40 basis points of leverage in SG&A. So as I've stated before, it ebbs and flows depending on what's going on in the business and what kind of initiatives we may or may not be driving through the company. So -- but I still think that roughly 3% comp is -- 2% to 3% comp is a reasonable range to think about as far as leveraging SG&A."

I will tell you that it was a much smaller acquisition, but it was a total -- it was a whole new country and it wasn't the 51st state. Canada is clearly a different country, regulatory requirements, culturally, language, believe it or not, duplicate labels or languages on your labels. There's a lot of intricacies in entering Canada. I thought we handled most of them fairly well. The big challenge that we've had in Canada, in my opinion, is, first of all, even though people you would think would be aware of the brand is we had no brand density. So we've rebannered all those -- rebranded all those stores early on to Dollar Tree Canada from Dollar Giant because we didn't think Dollar Giant had any brand equity either. We built more stores. And as we're getting more market density, we are building brand awareness and we're seeing some of the improvement now. So that's one of the things. Secondly, we had to build a brand-new management team and Canadian merchants and get that in place. So as always, the devil is in the details and most of the time, it's people, people, culture. Family Dollar is not a different country, but it's a different -- a little different culture. It's a different concept, and we have to be very -- we have to work together very well. It's one of the learnings that I would say on any acquisition we've ever done, it really comes down to the people and the culture and the motivation. To that, having said that, I really have great admiration for the Family Dollar organization. What they do, they do some things much better than we do, and we see that and we are happy to join in on the things that they do better and there's some things we think we can lend to the Family Dollar team also. And they've been very open to anything that we talk about so far. They're still running their own business, we don't own the business yet. But in our discussions, pre-integration discussions, we're always talking about those types of things and cultural things and how do we benefit from the combination and where's the opportunity to reduce costs, increase margin and drive sales. So we are of one mind of that. But that's really the big learning, I guess. And over my history and years of doing this, we've done several acquisitions. I've always asked other people that do acquisitions, so tell me one thing we ought to be very careful of and it's always a people issue. It's always about culture. It's always about combining a diverse organization, a different organization. There are egos involved that have to be respected and, of course, everybody has a role. You got to get everybody pulling together. So we're aware of those things. I think we're going to be just fine as long as we stay aware of it. I've shared this with our management team and with our organization. And by the way, I've also shared that we own that part, not the Family Dollar people. We own the concept of bringing them in with respect and respecting what they've done and what they've built over 50-some years, building that brand, the infrastructure that they built that is very strong and very solid, the organization that they've built, the technology that they've built, the process and procedures. So it's up to us to engage with them and to bring these 2 cultures together."

There are many ways to bring value to a customer, especially a low-income customer. What they -- what a low-income customer needs may be not the same as someone with a higher-income level. And what I mean by that is as we go through the assortments, there's price competitiveness. We would intend to be competitive in the market on all the name brands, on all the same items. That's sort of cost of poker. If you're going to be in this business, you have to be competitive on the name brands and the same items. I think there's an opportunity for product development. They have some pretty good private labels already. I think there's probably more room for that in rationalizing the assortment so that every item has a place, every item has a mission. What's the value statement in the category? And is it good, better, best? Is it private label versus name brand? Is it twice as much for the same price or is it the same amount for half the price? I think more attention to opening price points. A customer that has limited income may want that biggest package of the name brand but they -- and it may be very competitive. You can buy it for the same price anywhere, but you may just not have that much money in your pocket. So you may also have to have an option for that customer that says it may not be the name brand but it's a big jug of whatever and it really works and we stand behind the quality and all that goes with that. So it's not as simple as just saying price reinvestment. I believe we can lower retails and improve margin. But having said that, I'm talking about the mix, frankly. And we're going to be very focused on that customer, especially that low-income customer, what they need, what the price points are that really motivate them. How do we deliver value overall with a combination of name brands, private labels. And then also the discretionary product. I believe that people -- even if you're poor, you don't want to feel poor. When you walk into the store, you want a shopping environment that you're happy with that respects you as a human being and offers you the things that you need. So a lot of effort is going to be focused on the store and on the customer from day 1. And we will invest. I would say, more than price investment, I would say investment in the stores is where we're going to be really focused. Now we're going to have to pay for that somehow. There is no free investment. So we're going to have to look really hard at where we can find the synergies and the opportunity to reduce costs in order to reinvest in the stores. Some of it may be price, some of it may be anything that increases the value to that customer, might be the shopping experience too, and I believe there's big opportunity in that."

This morning, we announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. With the closing of the Family Dollar transition -- transaction on July 6, this is our first sales and earnings report for the combined companies. This report includes 1 month of Family Dollar's sales and operations combined with a full quarter Dollar Tree performance. All Family Dollar Stores are reported as new stores. 
In the Dollar Tree segment of our business, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7%. This is on top of a 4.5% increase in second quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket with traffic increasing. The most. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 2.4%. 
Total sales at Dollar Tree stores for the second quarter were 8.3% to $2.2 billion. This was at the midpoint of our previously announced guidance of $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by $22.4 million or 10.5% to $234.9 million, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 20 basis points to 10.7% compared to 10.5% from the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment increased 10.1% to $138.9 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 9.8% to $0.67 compared with second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings of $0.61 per diluted share. This was near the top end of our previously announced guidance of $0.63 to $0.68 per diluted share. 
I'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was our 30th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Second quarter results continue to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping with us more often. We're attracting new customers everyday, and when the customers are in the stores, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter. Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gaining new customers in every store every day. Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements, and our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full of fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandise values are better than ever, and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector. 
Seasonal energy was high in May beginning with Mother's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well-stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy per month. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes and celebrations surrounding Memorial Day, picnic schools, beaches and Summer Fun. Reflecting the seasonal strength of Mother's Day and Memorial Day, May was the strongest month for comp store sales in the quarter. For the full quarter, same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products. Top-performing categories include candy and food, party, snacks and beverage and household supplies. Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was the strongest in the Southwest followed by the Midwest, Southeast, Northeast and West Coast. All 5 geographic zones produced positive same-store sales in the quarter. We continue to invest in our customers by offering unbelievable values on many name brands and bonus buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. 
And let's not forget the basics. Throughout the quarter, we continue to highlight our million dollars brands with signage and special displays of those everyday items that provide terrific value to our customers. 
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. In the second quarter, we opened a total of 130 new stores and relocated or expanded 27 stores for a total of 157 projects. The new stores included 121 U.S. Dollar Tree stores, 3 Dollar Tree Canada stores and 2 Deal$ stores. Additionally, on August 1, we hosted grand openings at the first 4 of our rebannered Family Dollar to Dollar Tree stores. Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 7.8%. We ended the quarter with 5,583 stores, and we're on track with our plan for fiscal 2015, which includes 400 new stores, 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of drive the business initiatives include category expansions where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. 
Seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the season. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Merchandise synergy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store at Dollar Tree, you will always find an unexpected value. And being first of the month already, we place special emphasis on basic, consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. 
Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 159 additional stores for a total of 255 additional stores here to date. We currently refrigerated products in 3,875 stores, and we continue to grow. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it's fast returning, more frequently purchased  and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customers. 
We continue to support planned growth by building infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We recently began construction of Dollar Tree DC number 11, a 1.5 million square-foot automated facility in Cherokee County, South Carolina. This facility will provide capacity and increase efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. We plan to have the facility operational in third quarter of 2016. 
I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in the second quarter. Our Dollar Tree business continues to deliver operating margins that lead the value retail sector. Our customer base is large and growing. Both traffic and average ticket increased in the second quarter. We have an experienced and talented merchandising team that continues to do a tremendous job of finding and delivering traffic values to our customers with margins that meet our thresholds. In second quarter, merchandise margin increased over the prior year. We announced and began construction on Dollar Tree DC 11, and we completed the acquisition of Family Dollar, immediately transitioning from integration planning to integration execution of the 2 companies. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization. I am more enthusiastic than ever about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. With the successful completion of the acquisition of Family Dollar on July 6, we are now much larger and more diverse organization able to benefit from scale and deliver even greater values. With more than 13,800 stores across North America, supported by a solid and scalable infrastructure, this combination provides the unique opportunity to leverage our multiple banners to better serve a broader range of customers while enhancing our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third year postclosing. These synergies will be driven through 4 primary avenues: sourcing and procurement; our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; distribution and logistics; and fourth, overhead and corporate SG&A. As previously stated, we expect to spend approximately $300 million in onetime cost to achieve these synergies. 
Our priority areas of focus for Family Dollar will be on, first of all, the customer. We will be evolving the merchandise assortments to increase value and better meet the needs; the customer experience, creating a more exciting, inviting and customer-friendly shopping environment; lowering field management turnover supporting our store initiatives and developing a more performance-based culture throughout the company and increasing store productivity. We will be modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity in existing stores while improving new store remodeling and expansion performance. Our 100-day action plan includes 7 key initiatives. First of all, communicating organizational leadership changes and establishing management cadence and coordination. As planned, effective on day 1, Gary Philbin, my business partner for the past 15 years, took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar, and Mike Salinsky was promoted to the role of Chief Operating Officer at Dollar Tree. Immediately, we began standing up workgroups and establishing a weekly and monthly cadence across banner meetings. We began defining coordinated merchandise planning and buying across banners. We are consolidating reporting and financial management tools. We've created a stub year plan to align the Family Dollar calendar with the Dollar Tree retail calendar by the end of the year. We're developing a combined real estate review and approval process. Our goal is to put the right banner in the right location to best serve the customer and to ensure we're using an appropriate pro forma analysis with appropriate hurdle rates for profitability. We are completing our compensation and organizational leveling review, bringing both organizations to a common title hierarchy with a common compensation and benefit plan and a common calendar. 
Second, we immediately kicked off plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies. One of our largest energy opportunities is using our size, scale and efficiency to buy back. We currently spend about $10 billion on items for resale and another $3 billion for products and services we buy for use in the business. Immediately following closing, our merchandising teams met to share detailed cost information to identify and quantify specific opportunities and to develop a strategic action plan to obtain the best cost in both banners. The cost of goods sold initiative is focused in 3 primary areas. The first area is aligning exact match products carried by both companies and obtaining the lowest costs for both banners. Second is a review of similar match products. Here, our merchants are aligning specifications and combining purchasing power to reduce cost. Third is payment term parity, which will benefit the combined company with savings from harmonizing payment terms. The plans have been develops, the initiative has launched and we're well on our way to achieving our goals of reducing cost of goods sold. Additionally, our procurement teams are addressing our indirect spend. These are items and services that we buy that are used in the business. The opportunity to use our size and efficiency to reduce costs is significant. These items and services have been grouped in 2 [ph] ways to be addressed over time through a blend of negotiations, options, RFPs and form of bid processes. This process has also begun, and we're on track to achieve our first 100-day goals. 
Third, we have officially kicked of our store rebanner process. We are very excited about the opportunity to rebanners store locations to better serve our customers while improving the overall productivity of these individual stores. Our initial focus will be transforming hundreds of underperforming Family Dollar Stores into Dollar Tree stores. Using the Dollar Tree real estate model, we're reviewing underperforming Family Dollar Stores to determine if they would perform more profitably as Dollar Tree stores. Upon closing, we immediately began the process to rebanner 4 test stores. The test was to validate that we had all the necessary steps in place to facilitate a smooth conversion. The individual stores closed were approximately 2 weeks as we liquidate the Family Dollar merchandise, convert the decor, signing and fixtures, train the store teams and bring in the Dollar Tree inventory. These first 4 test scores reopened on August 1, less than 4 weeks following the completion of the acquisition. While very early in the process, these stores experienced successful grand openings as Dollar Tree stores. We have since rebannered and opened 39 more for a total of 43 stores as of last Friday, August 28, with similar grand opening results. Going forward, we've developed a list of stores to be rebannered each week through the end of October, and assuming continued success, we will reengage these efforts in 2016. By the end of October, we expect to have more than 150 stores converted. We're very pleased with the process and with the early results. Feedback from customers in these markets has been positive. Fourth, in the first 100 days, we plan to establish cross-organizational IT access and finalize our initial technology integration strategy. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have very good technology platforms, and there are no significant gaps or immediate needs. Through our integration planning, we have developed a road map to strategically combine our technology over time. The timing of these changes will be driven by the size of achievable synergies versus the expected cost. Our current plan or road map includes 4 primary phases. Immediately in Phase 1, we're addressing back-office system consolidations. Phase 2 addresses system alignment related to the transportation, workforce and HR support and business intelligence. Phase 3 addresses consolidation of core merchandising systems, including forecasting and replenishment. And Phase 4 addresses projects related to distribution center management, point-of-sale and real estate. 
Fifth, we are developing and initiating plans to better serve the Family Dollar customer and to build sales momentum. Raising the table state is a key priority and a significant opportunity in our integration efforts. Our first 100-day plans include clearing aged and nonproductive inventory while improving our in-stock position on everyday basis. This includes reclaiming prime space for impactful displays for our fourth quarter seasonal and promotional assortment and continuing the analysis of productivity by category. 
Sixth, we will be finalizing supply chain road map and initiating the multibanner supply chain project. Working with a cross-banner functional team and third-party supply chain consultants, we are developing plans for integrating our warehouse management systems and making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing our space need by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners out of each facility. This is a very large project with a very significant opportunity for long-term synergies. 
Seventh, we're further developing and initiating plans to reduce cost with a shared services model. Over time, we will be combining our efforts to support both banners with a shared service organization and human resources, finance, information technology, logistics, legal, strategy and audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization while reducing costs. 
This is a high-level overview, some of the components of our 100-day action plan. There are some quick and easy wins here and some that will take a great deal of work. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once but to prioritize our areas of focus them to get it right the first time in build the overall business for the long term. It is a process, it will take time, but the size of the price is worth it.

As Bob mentioned, we are pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter. The Dollar Tree segment performed well within the range of guidance that we provided. As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year compa",1601,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning. As Bob mentioned, we are pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter. The Dollar Tree segment performed well within the range of guidance that we provided. As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comparisons for the next 4 quarters will be more complex than normal since there's no prior-year data for the Family Dollar segment. 
Total sales for the second quarter grew 48.3% to $3.01 billion, which includes 4 weeks of Family Dollar sales. Excluding the $812 million of Family Dollar sales, the Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.3%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7% versus a strong 4.5% in the prior year second quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 2.4%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar Stores and newly rebannered stores are conceded new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $161.1 million or 23.2% to $855.2 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. The majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $105.9 million. A few factors to note are, as a result of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition, a preliminary purchase accounting adjustments of $116.3 million was recorded for the step-up in basis of Family Dollar inventory to its fair value. Of this amount, $55 million is amortizable, of which $11.1 million was amortized during the second quarter to cost of goods sold and negatively impacted gross margin results. We expect an additional $38.1 million will be amortized to cost of goods sold over the remaining 6 months of 2015. 
During the second quarter, we also took a $60 million markdown reserve for SKU rationalization and planed liquidations related to Family Dollar inventory that will not be carried going forward. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.1% during the second quarter compared with 34.2% in the prior year second quarter. The 10 basis point decline as a percent of sales was driven by higher strength and occupancy costs, partially offset by improved merchandise costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 49.7% to $731.8 million from $489 million in last year's second quarter. The majority of the $242.7 million increase related to $200.9 million of Family Dollar expense, which included $6.5 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights recorded in connection with the acquisition and $6.5 million of additional depreciation for the harmonization of the combined company policies. For the second quarter, we incurred $17.7 million or 55 basis points of expenses related to the Family Dollar acquisition compared to $7.5 million or 35 basis points of acquisition expenses in the second quarter of 2014. 
As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 20 basis points to 24.3% in the second quarter from 24.1% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acquisition costs, SG&A expense as a percent of sales was consistent with the prior year at 23.7%. Adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment was $514.4 million or 23.4% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represented a 30 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2014 adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment of 23.7%. The decrease was driven by improved store labor productivity, lower incentive comp and lower legal fees as a percent of sales. Operating income for the combined organization decreased to $123.4 million compared with $205 million in the same period last year. This decrease is a result of lower gross profit margin and higher SG&A expenses, as previously mentioned. 
Adjusted operating income for the Dollar Tree segment increased $22.4 million to $234.9 million or 10.7% of sales compared to 10.5% of sales in the prior year second quarter. Nonoperating expenses for the second quarter totaled $265.6 million and were comprised of the following: a $1.7 million expense due to an unfavorable fair market value adjustment on diesel fuel swaps; a net interest expense of $263.9 million in the quarter compared to $8.4 million in the prior year second quarter. This increase included interest on the long-term debt for the acquisition and $89.5 million breakage fee related to the prepayment of the Dollar Tree senior notes and a $39.5 million prepayment fee related to the Term Loan B refinancing; a $17.4 million write-off of original issue discount; and a $5.9 million write-off of deferred financing cost related to Term Loan B refinancing. 
The quarterly run rate for interest expense going forward will be approximately $100 million, including deferred financing cost amortization. 
For the second quarter, the company had a net loss of $98 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Excluding acquisition-related adjustments, the company had net income of $53.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share. 
Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment was $138.9 million or $0.67 per adjusted diluted share, a 9.8% increase when compared to the reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 per diluted share in the prior year second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was a benefit of 31.1% compared to an expense of 38.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily result of the pretax income loss in the second -- in the quarter and the nondeductible acquisition costs. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.3 billion compared to $467.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2014. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 6.7% greater than at the same time last year, while sellings increased 7.8%. Consolidated inventory for selling per square foot decreased 1%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. 
Consolidated capital expenditures were $100.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 versus $88.3 million in the second quarter of last year. For the full year 2015, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $600 million to $615 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores; rebanner of select Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores; the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability approximately 425 Dollar Tree stores, up from the previous expectation of 320; IT system enhancements; and the construction of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $89.5 million for the second quarter versus $49.9 million in the second quarter last year. For 2015, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million. This range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items. First, it includes $46 million of depreciation above the the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lines accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of assets based on purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase price valuation of Family Dollar leases. 
For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $4.78 billion to $4.87 billion. For the full year of 2015, we are now estimating total sales to range from $15.3 billion to $15.52 billion. Both of these estimates are based on low single digits same-store sales increase. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.7 million shares for Q3 and 223.5 million shares for the full year. 
Our expectations for the Dollar Tree segment of our business in the back half have not materially changed from our original expectation as we entered the year. However, as a result of the recently completed acquisition, this significant integration initiatives and the divestiture process, we are not providing earnings per share guidance for the third quarter or full year at this time. 
I would like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar Stores and excludes stores that are rebannered from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree. We will experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into our rebannered strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales in the back half of 2015. 
I would like to briefly speak to the divestiture process. Related to our acquisition, we reached an agreement to divest 330 Family Dollar Stores to Sycamore Partners to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission's divestiture requirements. These 330 stores represent approximately $45.5 million in annual operating income. Around schedule of close under the divestitures sale later this year. The closing of the divestiture transaction will not change our future net asset because of the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree's assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet, our Form 10-Q being filed today. The divestiture will have 2 effects on our future income. In addition to losing the operating income associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs and setup costs related to transition services. 
Over a period expected we know more than 24 months, we will be providing certain support transition services and expect to be reimbursed by the buyer by this direct offering of cost and support services. 
I will now turn the call back over to Bob."

The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers, the largest of any previous retail merger, and it will take some time. It is early in the integration process, and I am more enthusiastic than ever about the long-term opportunity to provide substantially increased shareholder value. We have great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that in placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margin, expense control and greater cost and satisfaction. 
Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to introduce Gary Philbin to our call. Effective immediately upon closing, Gary took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar. This is a key role that has been vacant for about 18 months, and the organization was in need of direction and leadership following the lengthy acquisition process. Many of you already know Gary. We've worked together, improving and growing the Dollar Tree in the past 15 years. And I have tremendous confidence in his ability as retailer and as a leader. Gary?"

First, let me say we are only 8 weeks into the integration, and we are enthusiastic about the initial progress and this incredible opportunity ahead of us. I am pleased with the dedication and focus of the entire Family Dollar team. As you know, Family Dollar's a well-established brand that has been successful for more than 50 years. I think our FD, Family Dollar business, is not broken. We simply need to roll up our sleeves, focus on what's important, and we have a work to do to polish up this well-known brand. 
Bob provided a high-level strategic overview of our 100-day action plan. I would like to provide greater detail into the execution components and our areas of focus on improving the Family Dollar's customer shopping experience. 
Our goal is to consistently provide great value, affordable prices and relevant items in a store environment as convenient, clean, reliable and productive. To accomplish this goal, we're going to build on 4 basic fundamentals: right product value, well-run stores, smart choices for our customer and consistency of in-stocks on everyday items. Nothing I said here is new to retail. This is really Retail 101. We are focused on consistent execution combined with a relentless focus on our customer. It's important to understand that we will be making investments to improve what we refer to Table 6, and these investments will include delivering on the consistency of a clean store benchmark, catching up on deferred maintenance, investing in the right amount of payroll to drive both productivity and enhance the customer experience and improving the overall efficiency of our in-store processes. 
Importantly, we are kicking off a process to clear nongo-forward merchandising in the stores. So you're likely to see clearance activity over the next couple of months as we gear up for having our shelves stock with basic, everyday items and to show off our great seasonal product. This will have an impact on margins near term, but it's actually the right thing to do for our business in the long term. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I just want to say again, I'm proud to be part of the Family Dollar team. I am pleased with the work being done, and I'm excited about the opportunities this will present both for our vendor community and our Family Dollar team members as we improve and grow the Family Dollar brand.

I want to close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 30 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. 
With the addition of Family Dollar, we're a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for, great value in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us. Over the past 3 weeks, I've had the privilege to attend and present at both Family Dollar's Annual Leadership Conference and Dollar Tree's Annual Field Management Meeting. I could not be more proud of our combined organizations. Our field management and our leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated.

There's a big opportunity for product development to create even more value for that low-end customer. So as we speak of serving a low-end customer and bringing value to that customer, there's more than one way to do it, and it's not all about price on name brand products.

Some of them they are a little off the mark, and they're underperforming for that reason. As you know that over the past few years, I think they opened up a few more in suburban locations than maybe normal. I don't know that -- what normal was. But it seemed like from what I have been told, they are aiming more suburban locations. We see more suburban locations. And as we run those, the lower-performing stores, we're finding some of those rural and suburban locations that are underperforming that when we run through our model, they turn out to be good Dollar Tree stores. And good Dollar Tree stores meet our Dollar Tree criteria for opening a new Dollar Tree store. These are not -- these are size that we would open as a Dollar Tree new store as we've been looking at those locations. So what we're taking is the lower-performing stores. They're either lower-performing because they are maybe a little off the Family Dollar mark. They're lower performing because maybe the model pro formas weren't exactly  aligned. And by the way, with our Dollar Tree margin, we can make a lot more money in a location. Our margins are much higher than the Family Dollar margin. Our mix of product is much different than the Family Dollar product. So long answer to your question, but these are -- we're looking at these being good Dollar Tree stores. We're taking the lowest-performing and the low-performing Dollar Tree, converting them into good Dollar Tree stores. Some of them are going to be breakout homeruns, amongst the best of our Dollar Tree stores on a sales per foot. And some of them are likely going to be underperforming the first year. I believe that the breakout homeruns will outweigh. We're early in this, but I believe the breakout homeruns will outweigh the underperformers and that most of them are going to be right there in the middle hitting whatever we expected from a Dollar Tree store. It's only been a few weeks. We've only had some grand openings so far, but I would tell you, I'm pleased with the grand openings. And I visited the first 4 test stores when we opened them. I visited all 4 them, and they look like Dollar Tree stores ended up like Dollar Tree locations and they're in Dollar Tree towns. Customers were pleased to see our Dollar Tree open up in place of the Family Dollar. So I'm expecting to be at least as good as a Dollar Tree in new store."

The big, I think, power going forward, in addition to that, is going to be into the like items. Not exactly the same items, but they're close. It may be a private label item that we compare to and specs are a little different. So by aligning the specs and putting that out for bid, if it's a basic item, we think we know we can provide some of value by combining our buying power of these 2 large businesses on those into product development, just leveraging our buying power to develop products for our stores, whether it's Dollar Tree or Family Dollar or both. So huge opportunities continuing on the buying side. The near term is an exact match.

We have, at Family Dollar, a separate team focused on that lower-income customer, the needs-based customer, more of a consumer product customer. 70%-ish, something like that, is consumer products. So the buying teams are staying separate. We're connecting them at the top through merchandise managers and divisional vice presidents in that area. We're coordinating and buying with vendors. We're coordinating the activities on items by comparing buying plans and merging those as we go on to buying trips, as we go to Asia, as we go to market wherever it is, New York, going to show, some kind of thing. A little coordination but I believe it is very important to keep the focus clearly on the Family Dollar banner. We intend to continue opening up Family Dollar Stores as well as Dollar Tree stores. Sometimes they're pretty close to each other, so I'd like to be able to do that and have that difference in the banners when you walk inside, have the difference and merchandise assortment. So the merchandise assortment at Family Dollar is evolving. It will be changing as we discussed -- as I've discussed in the past. The synergies, I think, we've said in the past 25% of the synergies in the first year, we think we can get up to 75% of them by the end of the second full year and then 100% by the end of 3 full years. So that's something like, what, 75, 150, 75, something like that, 150 additional in the second year. So 75, 225 and 300 if you look at it that way. The early synergies are across the board. There's going to be a lot of sourcing and procurement. There will be some in banner optimization. I've said that we're going to do over 150 banner, new rebannering stores this year. So that's a real number. Overhead, we're working through that in every segment of our business. Some of that is going to be driven by our information technology integration. Some of it requires the integration of the technology, for example, in logistics. The ability to ship both banners out of every building is going to require a lot of technology help. So that will be probably later in the process. Earlier in the process are the things about overhead and improvements in SG&A through better, more efficient procurement and buying power."

So some of that business slipped forward anytime the first of month follows on the weekend and the checks come out different cadence in this case versus last year. It all came out the first and the third came out last year. This year only the first checks came out. So there's a little Slide in the final week of July. But overall, it was fairly consistent through the quarter. And again, every time there's a great holiday, we have a lot of energy at our Dollar Tree stores and you see more traffic and you see more sales from the holiday. Back-to-school started well. It's not over. One of the things that we're experiencing as well as all of retail, I guess, right now is Labor Day is a week later. Labor Day drives a lot of things in a retail business. It drives seasonal sales to sort of and oh the summer, I guess, the school disclosed end of summer for retailers and for customers. And that's when a lot of the school starts. Some schools right here around I realize some starting to. But still a large percentage of school starts after Labor Day. Well, that's a week later this year. So the sales cadence on our back-to-school looks good, but we still got to -- haven't finished with back-to-school yet. So we'll be finishing that up this weekend.

From the standpoint of store growth, initially, there was a number out there around 550 on Family Dollar for their fiscal year. Appropriately, that dropped down to about 300. So we have slowed down store growth as we take a look under the hood, take a look under assortments to drive sales per square foot. I'm sitting in on every real estate meeting to identify really what the strategy, what is working or do we need to recalibrate. And so we'll take a look on both sides of that.

This morning, we announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015.

This morning, we announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. With the closing of the Family Dollar transition -- transaction on July 6, this is our first sales and earnings report for the combined companies. This report includes 1 month of Family Dollar sales and operations combined with a full quarter of Dollar Tree performance. All Family Dollar stores are reported as new stores. 
In the Dollar Tree segment of our business, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7%. This is on top of a 4.5% increase in second quarter of last year. Sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket, with traffic increasing the most. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 2.4%. 
Total sales at Dollar Tree stores for the second quarter were 8.3% to $2.2 billion. This was at the midpoint of our previously announced guidance of $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by $22.4 million or 10.5% to $234.9 million, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 20 basis points to 10.7% compared to 10.5% from the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment increased 10.1% to $138.9 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 9.8% to $0.67 compared with second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings of $0.61 per diluted share. This was near the top end of our previously announced guidance of $0.63 to $0.68 per diluted share. 
I'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was our 30th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Second quarter results continue to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping with us more often. We're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the stores, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter. 
Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements. And our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full of fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandise values are better than ever, and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector. 
Seasonal energy was high in May beginning with Mother's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for mom. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes and celebrations surrounding Memorial Day, picnic, schools, beaches and Summer Fun. Reflecting the seasonal strength of Mother's Day and Memorial Day, May was the strongest month for comp store sales in the quarter. For the full quarter, same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products. Top-performing categories include candy and food, party, snacks and beverage and household supplies. 
Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was the strongest in the Southwest followed by the Midwest, Southeast, Northeast and West Coast. All 5 geographic zones produced positive same-store sales in the quarter. We continue to invest in our customers by offering unbelievable values on many name brands and Bonus Buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. 
And not to forget the basics. Throughout the quarter, we continue to highlight our million-dollar brands with signage and special displays of those everyday items that provide terrific value to our customers. 
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the second quarter, we opened a total of 130 new stores and relocated or expanded 27 stores for a total of 157 projects. The new stores included 121 U.S. Dollar Tree stores, 3 Dollar Tree Canada stores and 2 Deals stores. Additionally, on August 1, we hosted grand openings at the first 4 of our rebannered Family Dollar to Dollar Tree stores. Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 7.8%. We ended the quarter with 5,583 stores, and we're on track with our plan for fiscal 2015, which includes 400 new stores, 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive-the-business initiatives include: category expansions, where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products; seasonal relevance, our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store at Dollar Tree. You'll always find an unexpected value. And being first-of-the-month ready, we place special emphasis on basic, consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. 
Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 159 additional stores for a total of 255 additional stores year-to-date. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 3,875 stores, and we continue to grow. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it's faster turning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customer. 
We continue to support planned growth by building infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We recently began construction of Dollar Tree DC #11, a 1.5 million square-foot, automated facility in Cherokee County, South Carolina. This facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. We plan to have the facility operational in third quarter of 2016. 
I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in the second quarter. Our Dollar Tree business continues to deliver operating margins that lead the value retail sector. Our customer base is large and growing. Both traffic and average ticket increased in the second quarter. We have an experienced and talented merchandising team that continues to do a tremendous job of finding and delivering terrific values to our customers with margins that meet our thresholds. In second quarter, merchandise margin increased over the prior year. We announced and began construction on Dollar Tree DC 11, and we completed the acquisition of Family Dollar, immediately transitioning from integration planning to integration execution of the 2 companies. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization. I am more enthusiastic than ever about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. With the successful completion of the acquisition of Family Dollar on July 6, we are now a much larger and more diverse organization, able to benefit from scale and deliver even greater values. With more than 13,800 stores across North America, supported by a solid and scalable infrastructure, this combination provides the unique opportunity to leverage our multiple banners to better serve a broader range of customers while enhancing our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. 
We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third year post closing. These synergies will be driven through 4 primary avenues: sourcing and procurement; our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; distribution and logistics; and fourth, overhead and corporate SG&A. As previously stated, we expect to spend approximately $300 million in onetime costs to achieve these synergies. 
Our priority areas of focus for Family Dollar will be on, first of all, the customer, we will be evolving the merchandise assortments to increase value and better meet their needs; the customer experience, creating a more exciting, inviting and customer-friendly shopping environment; lowering field management turnover, supporting our store initiatives and developing a more performance-based culture throughout the company and increasing store productivity. We will be modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity in existing stores while improving new store remodel and expansion performance. 
Our 100-day action plan includes 7 key initiatives. First of all, communicating organizational leadership changes and establishing management cadence and coordination. As planned, effective on day 1, Gary Philbin, my business partner for the past 15 years, took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar, and Mike Witynski was promoted to the role of Chief Operating Officer at Dollar Tree. Immediately, we began standing up workgroups and establishing a weekly and monthly cadence of cross-banner meetings. We began defining coordinated merchandise planning and buying across banners. We are consolidating reporting and financial management tools. We've created a stub-year plan to align the Family Dollar calendar with the Dollar Tree retail calendar by the end of the year. We're developing a combined real estate review and approval process. Our goal is to put the right banner in the right location to best serve the customer and to ensure we're using an appropriate pro forma analysis with appropriate hurdle rates for profitability. We are completing our compensation and organization leveling review, bringing both organizations to a common title hierarchy with a common compensation and benefit plan and a common calendar. 
Second, we immediately kicked off plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies. One of our largest synergy opportunities is using our size, scale and efficiency to buy better. We currently spend about $10 billion on items for resale and another $3 billion for products and services we buy for use in the business. Immediately following closing, our merchandising teams met to share detailed cost information to identify and quantify specific opportunities and to develop a strategic action plan to obtain the best cost in both banners. 
The ""cost of goods sold"" initiative is focused in 3 primary areas. The first area is aligning exact match products carried by both companies and obtaining the lowest cost for both banners. Second is a review of similar match products. Here, our merchants are aligning specifications and combining purchasing power to reduce cost. Third is payment term parity, which will benefit the combined company with savings from harmonizing payment terms. The plans have been developed. The initiative has launched and we're well on our way to achieving our goals of reducing cost of goods sold. 
Additionally, our procurement teams are addressing our indirect spend. These are items and services that we buy that are used in the business. The opportunity to use our size and efficiency to reduce costs is significant. These items and services have been grouped into waves to be addressed over time through a blend of negotiations, options, RFPs and formal bid processes. This process has also begun, and we're on track to achieve our first 100-day goals. 
Third, we have officially kicked of our store rebanner process. We are very excited about the opportunity to rebanner store locations to better serve our customers while improving the overall productivity of these individual stores. Our initial focus will be transforming hundreds of underperforming Family Dollar stores into Dollar Tree stores. Using the Dollar Tree real estate model, we're reviewing underperforming Family Dollar stores to determine if they would perform more profitably as Dollar Tree stores. 
Upon closing, we immediately began the process to rebanner 4 test stores. The test was to validate that we had all the necessary steps in place to facilitate a smooth conversion. The individual stores closed for approximately 2 weeks as we liquidate the Family Dollar merchandise, convert the decor, signing and fixtures, train the store teams and bring in the Dollar Tree inventory. These first 4 test stores reopened on August 1, less than 4 weeks following the completion of the acquisition. While very early in the process, these stores experienced successful grand openings as Dollar Tree stores. We have since rebannered and opened 39 more for a total of 43 stores as of last Friday, August 28, with similar grand opening results. Going forward, we've developed a list of stores to be rebannered each week through the end of October, and assuming continued success, we will reengage these efforts in 2016. By the end of October, we expect to have more than 150 stores converted. We're very pleased with the process and with the early results. Feedback from customers in these markets has been positive. 
Fourth, in the first 100 days, we plan to establish cross-organizational IT access and finalize our initial technology integration strategy. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have very good technology platforms, and there are no significant gaps or immediate needs. Through our integration planning, we've developed a road map to strategically combine our technology over time. The timing of these changes will be driven by the size of achievable synergies versus the expected cost. 
Our current plan or road map includes 4 primary phases. Immediately in phase 1, we're addressing back-office system consolidations. Phase 2 addresses system alignment related to transportation, workforce and HR support and business intelligence. Phase 3 addresses consolidation of core merchandising systems, including forecasting and replenishment. And Phase 4 addresses projects related to distribution center management, point-of-sale and real estate. 
Fifth, we're developing and initiating plans to better serve the Family Dollar customer and to build sales momentum. Raising the table stakes is a key priority and a significant opportunity in our integration efforts. Our first 100-day plans include clearing aged and nonproductive inventory while improving our in-stock position on everyday basics. This includes reclaiming prime space for impactful displays for our fourth quarter seasonal and promotional assortment and continuing the analysis of productivity by category. 
Sixth, we will be finalizing the supply chain road map and initiating the multi-banner supply chain project. Working with a cross-banner functional team and third-party supply chain consultants, we're developing plans for integrating our warehouse management systems and making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing our space need by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners out of each facility. This is a very large product -- project with a very significant opportunity for long-term synergies. 
Seventh, we're further developing and initiating plans to reduce costs with a shared services model. Over time, we will be combining our efforts to support both banners with a shared service organization in human resources, finance, information technology, logistics, legal, strategy and audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization while reducing costs. 
This is a high-level overview of some of the components of our 100-day action plan. There are some quick and easy wins here and some that will take a great deal of work. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall business for the long term. It is a process. It will take time, but the size of the price is worth it. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for 2015."

As Bob mentioned, we were pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter. The Dollar Tree segment performed well within the range of guidance that we provided. As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comp",1610,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning. As Bob mentioned, we were pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter. The Dollar Tree segment performed well within the range of guidance that we provided. As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comparisons for the next 4 quarters will be more complex than normal since there's no prior year data for the Family Dollar segment. 
Total sales for the second quarter grew 48.3% to $3.01 billion, which includes 4 weeks of Family Dollar sales. Excluding the $812 million in Family Dollar sales, the Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.3%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7% versus a strong 4.5% in the prior year second quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations same-store sales grew 2.4%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered stores are considered new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $161.1 million or 23.2% to $855.2 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. The majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $105.9 million. A few factors to note are, as a result of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition, a preliminary purchase accounting adjustment of $116.3 million was recorded for the step up in basis of Family Dollar inventory to its fair value. Of this amount, $55 million is amortizable, of which $11.1 million was amortized during the second quarter to cost of goods sold and negatively impacted gross margin results. We expect an additional $38.1 million will be amortized to cost of goods sold over the remaining 6 months of 2015. 
During the second quarter, we also took a $60 million markdown reserve for SKU rationalization and planned liquidations related to Family Dollar inventory that will not be carried going forward. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.1% during the second quarter compared with 34.2% in the prior year second quarter. The 10 basis point decline as a percent of sales was driven by higher strength and occupancy costs, partially offset by improved merchandise costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 49.7% to $731.8 million from $489 million in last year's second quarter. The majority of the $242.7 million increase related to $200.9 million of Family Dollar expense, which included $6.5 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights recorded in connection with the acquisition and $6.5 million of additional depreciation for the harmonization of the combined company policies. For the second quarter, we incurred $17.7 million or 55 basis points of expenses related to the Family Dollar acquisition compared to $7.5 million or 35 basis points of acquisition expenses in the second quarter of 2014. 
As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 20 basis points to 24.3% in the second quarter from 24.1% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acquisition costs, SG&A expense as a percent of sales was consistent with the prior year at 23.7%. Adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment was $514.4 million or 23.4% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represented a 30 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2014 adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment of 23.7%. The decrease was driven by improved store labor productivity, lower incentive comp and lower legal fees as a percent of sales. Operating income for the combined organization decreased to $123.4 million compared with $205 million in the same period last year. This decrease is a result of lower gross profit margin and higher SG&A expenses, as previously mentioned. 
Adjusted operating income for the Dollar Tree segment increased $22.4 million to $234.9 million or 10.7% of sales compared to 10.5% of sales in the prior year second quarter. Nonoperating expenses for the second quarter totaled $265.6 million and were comprised of the following: a $1.7 million expense due to an unfavorable fair market value adjustment on diesel fuel swaps; a net interest expense of $263.9 million in the quarter compared to $8.4 million in the prior year second quarter. This increase included interest on the long-term debt for the acquisition and $89.5 million breakage fee related to the prepayment of the Dollar Tree senior notes and a $39.5 million prepayment fee related to the Term Loan B refinancing; a $17.4 million write-off of original issue discount; and a $5.9 million write-off of deferred financing cost related to the Term Loan B refinancing. The quarterly run rate for interest expense going forward will be approximately $100 million, including deferred financing cost amortization. 
For the second quarter, the company had a net loss of $98 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Excluding acquisition-related adjustments, the company had net income of $53.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share. 
Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment was $138.9 million or $0.67 per adjusted diluted share, a 9.8% increase when compared to the reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 per diluted share in the prior year second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was a benefit of 31.1% compared to an expense of 38.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of the pretax income loss in the second -- in the quarter and the nondeductible acquisition costs. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.3 billion compared to $467.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2014. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 6.7% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.8%. Consolidated inventory per selling per square foot decreased 1%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. Consolidated capital expenditures were $100.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 versus $88.3 million in the second quarter of last year. 
For the full year 2015, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $600 million to $615 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional few development stores; rebanner of select Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores; the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 425 Dollar Tree stores, up from the previous expectation of 320; IT system enhancements; and the construction of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $89.5 million for the second quarter versus $49.9 million in the second quarter last year. For 2015, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million. This range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items. First, it includes $46 million of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lines accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase price valuation of Family Dollar leases. 
For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $4.78 billion to $4.87 billion. For the full year of 2015, we are now estimating total sales to range from $15.3 billion to $15.52 billion. Both of these estimates are based on low single digits same-store sales increase. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.7 million shares for Q3 and 223.5 million shares for the full year. 
Our expectations for the Dollar Tree segment of our business in the back half have not materially changed from our original expectation as we entered the year. However, as a result of the recently completed acquisition, the significant integration initiatives and the divestiture process, we are not providing earnings per share guidance for the third quarter or full year at this time. 
I would like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree. We will experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebannered strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales in the back half of 2015. 
I would like to briefly speak to the divestiture process. Related to our acquisition, we reached an agreement to divest 330 Family Dollar stores to Sycamore Partners to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission's divestiture requirements. These 330 stores represent approximately $45.5 million in annual operating income. We're on schedule to close on the divestiture sale later this year. The closing of the divestiture transaction will not change our future net assets because the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree's assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in our Form 10-Q being filed today. The divestiture will have 2 effects on our future income: In addition to losing the operating income associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs and setup costs related to transition services. Over a period expected to be no more than 24 months, we will be providing certain support and transition services and expect to be reimbursed by the buyer for these direct operating costs and support services. 
I will now turn the call back over to Bob."

The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers, the largest of any previous retail merger, and it will take some time. It is early in the integration process, and I'm more enthusiastic than ever about the long-term opportunity to provide substantially increased shareholder value. 
We have great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that in placing our initial emphasis in these areas, we can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margin, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to introduce Gary Philbin to our call. Effective immediately upon closing, Gary took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar. This is a key role that had been vacant for about 18 months, and the organization was in need of direction and leadership following the lengthy acquisition process. Many of you already know Gary. We've worked together, improving and growing the Dollar Tree business for the past 15 years, and I have tremendous confidence in his ability as a retailer and as a leader. Gary?"

First, let me say we are only 8 weeks into the integration, and we are enthusiastic about the initial progress and this incredible opportunity ahead of us. I'm pleased with the dedication and focus of the entire Family Dollar team. As you know, Family Dollar's a well-established brand that has been successful for more than 50 years. I think our FD, Family Dollar business, is not broken. We simply need to roll up our sleeves, focus on what's important, and we have work to do to polish up this well-known brand. 
Bob provided a high-level strategic overview of our 100-day action plan. I would like to provide greater detail into the execution components and our areas of focus on improving the Family Dollar's customer shopping experience. 
Our goal is to consistently provide great value, affordable prices and relevant items in a store environment that is convenient, clean, reliable and productive. To accomplish this goal, we're going to build on 4 basic fundamentals: great product value, well-run stores, smart choices for our customers and consistency of in stocks on everyday items. Nothing I said here is new to retail. This is really Retail 101. We are focused on consistent execution, combined with a relentless focus on our customer. It's important to understand that we will be making investments to improve what we refer to table stakes, and these investments will include delivering on the consistency of a clean-store benchmark, catching up on deferred maintenance, investing in the right amount of payroll to drive both productivity and enhance the customer experience and improving the overall efficiency of our in-store processes. 
Importantly, we are kicking off a process to clear non-go-forward merchandise in the stores. So you're likely to see clearance activity over the next couple of months as we gear up for having our shelves stocked with basic, everyday items and to show off our great seasonal product. This will have an impact on margins near term, but it's absolutely the right thing to do for our business in the long term. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I just want to say again, I'm proud to be part of the Family Dollar team. I am pleased with the work being done, and I'm excited about the opportunities this will present, both for our vendor community and our Family Dollar team members as we improve and grow the Family Dollar brand. 
Now let me turn it back over to Bob."

I want to close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 30 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. 
With the addition of Family Dollar, we're a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for: great value in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us. Over the past 3 weeks, I've had the privilege to attend and present at both Family Dollar's Annual Leadership Conference and Dollar Tree's annual field management meeting. I could not be more proud of our combined organizations. Our field management and our leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated.

At some point in time, these 330 stores will be -- that are currently included in our base will go away. And then we also have costs around that to help support that, as we said. And so the timing of those costs are not as able to be tied down maybe as tight at this moment as we'd like. So there is a lot of moving pieces. I think we know what they are, but it does create a little more uncertainty in creating a number. I mean, we've taken great pride in being able to provide credible guidance, and that's important to us. And we want to make sure that we have the best information to make this -- to be able to make that and give that you at the end of the day."

Based on those comments, it sounds like the prior guidance for core Dollar Tree remains relatively intact on a profitability side.

Some of them, they're a little off the mark, and they're underperforming for that reason. As you know that over the past few years, I think they opened up a few more in suburban locations than maybe normal. I don't know that -- what normal was. But it seemed like in what I've been told is that they were aiming more suburban locations. We see more suburban locations. And as we run those, the lower-performing stores, we're finding some of those rural and suburban locations that are underperforming that when we run through our model, they turn out to be good Dollar Tree stores. And good Dollar Tree stores meet our Dollar Tree criteria for opening a new Dollar Tree store. These are not -- these are size that we would open as a Dollar Tree new store and as we've been looking at those locations. So what we're taking is the lower-performing stores. They're either lower performing because they're maybe a little off the Family Dollar mark. They're lower performing because maybe the model, the pro formas weren't exactly aligned. And by the way, with our Dollar Tree margin, we can make a lot of money in a location. Our margins are much higher than the Family Dollar margins. Our mix of product is much different than the Family Dollar products. So a long answer to your question, but these are -- we're looking at these being good Dollar Tree stores. We're taking the lowest-performing and the low-performing Family Dollars, converting them into good Dollar Tree stores. Some of them are going to be breakout home runs amongst the best of our Dollar Tree stores on a sales per foot. And some of them are likely going to be underperforming the first year. I believe that the breakout home runs will outweigh. We're early in this, but I believe that breakout home runs will outweigh the underperformers and that most of them are going to be right there in the middle hitting whatever we expected from a Dollar Tree store. It's only been a few weeks. We've only had some grand openings so far. But I will tell you, I'm pleased with the grand openings. And I visited the first 4 test stores when we opened them. I visited all 4 of them, and they look like Dollar Tree stores and they look like Dollar Tree locations and they're in Dollar Tree towns. Customers were pleased to see our Dollar Tree open up in the place of the Family Dollar. So I'm expecting it to be at least as good as a Family -- as a Dollar Tree new store."

I mean, somebody's paying -- you'll be paying the same or somebody is paying a lower -- paying lower than we believe that both of us deserve that lower cost. So that was pretty much as we thought it would be. The big, I think, power going forward, in addition to that, is going to be into the like items. Not exactly the same items, but they're close. It may be a private label item that we compare to, and specs are a little different. So by aligning the specs and putting that out for bid, if it's a basic item, we think -- we know we can drive some more value by combining our buying power of these 2 large businesses on those into a product development, just leveraging our buying power to develop product for our stores, whether it's Dollar Tree or Family Dollar or both. So huge opportunities continuing on the buying side. The near term is the exact match. The near match or the close match, like items, I guess, is taking a little bit longer, but may even be a bigger part of the synergy as we go forward. And then not [indiscernible] we get all the things that we buy that we don't sell. We just buy them in expense items and services and things that we buy to use.

We have a terrific Dollar Tree buying team that understands and is focused on delivering tremendous value to our Dollar Tree customer for $1 price and at margins that we're pleased to have. We have, at Family Dollar, a separate team focused on that lower-income customer, the needs-based customer, more of a consumer product customer. 70%-ish, something like that, is consumer products. So the buying teams are staying separate. We're connecting them over -- at the top through merchandise managers and divisional vice presidents in that area. We're coordinating or buying with vendors. We're coordinating the activities on items and -- comparing buying plans and merging those as we go onto buying trips, as we go to Asia, as we go to market, wherever it is, New York, going to shows and that kind of thing. So a lot of coordination, but we -- I believe it's very important to keep the focus clearly on the Family Dollar banner. We intend to continue opening up Family Dollar stores as well as Dollar Tree stores. Sometimes, they're pretty close to each other, so I'd like to be able to do that and have a difference in the banners when you walk inside, have a difference in the merchandise assortment. So the merchandise assortment at Family Dollar is evolving. It will be changing, as we discussed -- as I've discussed in the past. The synergies, I think we've said in the past 25% of the synergies in the first year. We think we can get up to 75% of them by the end of the second full year and then 100% by the end of 3 full years. So that's something like, what, 75, 150, 75, something like that. 150 additional in the second year. So 75, 225 and 300 if you look at it that way. The early synergies are across the board. There are going to be a lot of sourcing and procurement. There will be some in banner optimization. I've said that we're going to do over 150 banner -- new -- rebannering stores this year. So that's a real number. Overhead, we're working through that in every segment of our business. Some of that's going to be driven by our information technology integration. Some of it requires the integration of the technology, for example, in logistics. The ability to ship both banners out of every building is going to require a lot of technology help. So that will be probably later in the process. Earlier in the process are the things about overhead and improvements in SG&A through better -- more efficient procurement and through buying power."

I initially said in the prepared remarks that May, driven by a couple of terrific holidays, Mother's Day and Memorial Day, you have that seasonal energy, that holiday excitement. So that drove the highest comps for us. June wasn't far behind. July was running pretty much consistent. We did lose a first of the month to a end of July week. So some of that business slipped forward. Anytime the first of the month follows on the weekend, then the checks come out in a different cadence, in this case, versus last year. It all came out -- the first and the third came out last year. This year, only the first checks came out. So there was a little slide in that final week of July. But overall, it was fairly consistent through the quarter. And again, every time there's a great holiday, we have a lot of energy in our Dollar Tree stores and you see more traffic and you see more sales from the holiday. Back-to-school started well. It's not over. One of the things that we're experiencing as well as all of retail, I guess, right now is Labor Day is a week later. Labor Day drives a lot of things in the retail business. It drives seasonal sale at sort of the end of the summer, I guess. The pool is closed end of the summer for retailers and for customers. And that's when a lot of the school starts. Some schools right here around, I realize some are starting to put denims. But still, a large percentage of school starts after Labor Day. Well, that's a week later this year. So the sales cadence on our back-to-school looks good, but we still got to -- haven't finished with back-to-school yet. So we'll be finishing that up this weekend. It should be terrific weekend in our Dollar Tree stores. If you have one near, drop in, you'll see a lot of sidewalk sales and summer excitement and all that goes with ending the summer season as well as getting ready to go to back to school."

From the standpoint of store growth, initially, there was a number out there around 550 on Family Dollar for their fiscal year. Appropriately, that dropped down to about 300. So we have slowed down store growth as we take a look under the hood, take a look at the assortments to drive sales per square foot. I'm sitting in on every real estate meeting to identify really what the strategy, where is it working or do we need to recalibrate. And so we'll take a look on both sides of that [indiscernible], where does Family Dollar work best, and really, more than anything, how do we find the right compelling assortments and our operational initiatives to drive higher sales productivity."

This morning, we announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015.

This morning, we announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. With the closing of the Family Dollar transition -- transaction on July 6, this is our first sales and earnings report for the combined companies. This report includes 1 month of Family Dollar sales and operations combined with a full quarter of Dollar Tree performance. All Family Dollar stores are reported as new stores. 
In the Dollar Tree segment of our business, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7%. This is on top of a 4.5% increase in second quarter of last year. Sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket, with traffic increasing the most. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 2.4%. 
Total sales at Dollar Tree stores for the second quarter grew 8.3% to $2.2 billion. This was at the midpoint of our previously announced guidance of $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion. Adjusted operating income increased by $22.4 million or 10.5% to $234.9 million, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 20 basis points to 10.7% compared to 10.5% from the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment increased 10.1% to $138.9 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 9.8% to $0.67 compared with second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings of $0.61 per diluted share. This was near the top end of our previously announced guidance of $0.63 to $0.68 per diluted share. 
I'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was our 30th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Second quarter results continue to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping with us more often. We're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the store, they're buying more. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter. 
Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements. And our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandise values are better than ever, and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector. 
Seasonal energy was high in May beginning with Mother's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for mom. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes and celebrations surrounding Memorial Day: picnics, pools, beaches and Summer Fun. Reflecting the seasonal strength of Mother's Day and Memorial Day, May was the strongest month for comp store sales in the quarter. For the full quarter, same-store sales increased as the result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products. Top-performing categories include candy and food, party, snacks and beverage and household supplies. 
Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was the strongest in the Southwest followed by the Midwest, Southeast, Northeast and West Coast. All 5 geographic zones produced positive same-store sales in the quarter. We continue to invest in our customers by offering unbelievable values on many name brands and Bonus Buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. 
And not to forget the basics. Throughout the quarter, we continue to highlight our million-dollar brands with signage and special displays of those everyday items that provide terrific value to our customers. 
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. 
In the second quarter, we opened a total of 130 new stores and relocated or expanded 27 stores for a total of 157 projects. The new stores included 121 U.S. Dollar Tree stores, 3 Dollar Tree Canada stores and 2 Deals stores. Additionally, on August 1, we hosted grand openings at the first 4 of our rebannered Family Dollar to Dollar Tree stores. Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 7.8%. We ended the quarter with 5,583 stores, and we're on track with our plan for fiscal 2015, which includes 400 new stores, 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive-the-business initiatives include: category expansions, where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products; seasonal relevance, our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you'll always find an unexpected value. And being first-of-the-month ready, we place special emphasis on basic, consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. 
Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 159 additional stores for a total of 255 additional stores year-to-date. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 3,875 stores, and we continue to grow. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin, but it's faster turning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customer. 
We continue to support planned growth by building infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We recently began construction of Dollar Tree DC #11, a 1.5 million square-foot, automated facility in Cherokee County, South Carolina. This facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. We plan to have the facility operational in third quarter of 2016. 
I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in second quarter. Our Dollar Tree business continues to deliver operating margins that lead the value retail sector. Our customer base is large and growing. Both traffic and average ticket increased in second quarter. We have an experienced and talented merchandising team that continues to do a tremendous job of finding and delivering terrific values to our customers with margins that meet our thresholds. In second quarter, merchandise margin increased over the prior year. We announced and began construction on Dollar Tree DC 11, and we completed the acquisition of Family Dollar, immediately transitioning from integration planning to integration execution of the 2 companies. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization. I am more enthusiastic than ever about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. With the successful completion of the acquisition of Family Dollar on July 6, we are now a much larger and more diverse organization, able to benefit from scale and deliver even greater values. With more than 13,800 stores across North America, supported by a solid and scalable infrastructure, this combination provides the unique opportunity to leverage our multiple banners to better serve a broader range of customers while enhancing our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. 
We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third year post-closing. These synergies will be driven through 4 primary avenues: sourcing and procurement; our rebanner program for optimizing store formats; distribution and logistics; and fourth, overhead and corporate SG&A. As previously stated, we expect to spend approximately $300 million in onetime costs to achieve these synergies. 
Our priority areas of focus for Family Dollar will be on, first of all, the customer, we will be evolving the merchandise assortments to increase value and better meet their needs; the customer experience, creating a more exciting, inviting and customer-friendly shopping environment; lowering field management turnover; supporting our store initiatives and developing a more performance-based culture throughout the company and increasing store productivity. We will be modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity in existing stores while improving new store remodel and expansion performance. 
Our 100-day action plan includes 7 key initiatives. First of all, communicating organizational leadership changes and establishing management cadence and coordination. As planned, effective on day 1, Gary Philbin, my business partner for the past 15 years, took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar, and Mike Witynski was promoted to the role of Chief Operating Officer at Dollar Tree. Immediately, we began standing up workgroups and establishing a weekly and monthly cadence of cross-banner meetings. We began defining coordinated merchandise planning and buying across banners. We are consolidating reporting and financial management tools. We've created a stub-year plan to align the Family Dollar calendar with the Dollar Tree retail calendar by the end of the year. We're developing a combined real estate review and approval process. Our goal is to put the right banner in the right location to best serve the customer and to ensure we're using an appropriate pro forma analysis with appropriate hurdle rates for profitability. We are completing our compensation and organization leveling review, bringing both organizations to a common title hierarchy with a common compensation and benefit plan and a common calendar. 
Second, we immediately kicked off plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies. One of our largest synergy opportunities is using our size, scale and efficiency to buy better. We currently spend about $10 billion on items for resale and another $3 billion for products and services we buy for use in the business. Immediately following closing, our merchandising teams met to share detailed cost information to identify and quantify specific opportunities and to develop a strategic action plan to obtain the best cost in both banners. 
The ""cost of goods sold"" initiative is focused in 3 primary areas. The first area is aligning exact match products carried by both companies and obtaining the lowest cost for both banners. Second is a review of similar match products. Here, our merchants are aligning specifications and combining purchasing power to reduce cost. Third is payment term parity, which will benefit the combined company with savings from harmonizing payment terms. The plans have been developed. The initiative has launched and we're well on our way to achieving our goals of reducing cost of goods sold. 
Additionally, our procurement teams are addressing our indirect spend. These are items and services that we buy that are used in the business. The opportunity to use our size and efficiency to reduce cost is significant. These items and services have been grouped into waves to be addressed over time through a blend of negotiations, options, RFPs and formal bid processes. This process has also begun, and we're on track to achieve our first 100-day goals. 
Third, we have officially kicked of our store rebanner process. We are very excited about the opportunity to rebanner store locations to better serve our customers while improving the overall productivity of these individual stores. Our initial focus will be transforming hundreds of underperforming Family Dollar stores into Dollar Tree stores. Using the Dollar Tree real estate model, we're reviewing underperforming Family Dollar stores to determine if they would perform more profitably as Dollar Tree stores. 
Upon closing, we immediately began the process to rebanner 4 test stores. The test was to validate that we had all the necessary steps in place to facilitate a smooth conversion. The individual stores close for approximately 2 weeks as we liquidate the Family Dollar merchandise, convert the decor, signing and fixtures, train the store teams and bring in the Dollar Tree inventory. These first 4 test stores reopened on August 1, less than 4 weeks following the completion of the acquisition. While very early in the process, these stores experienced successful grand openings as Dollar Tree stores. We have since rebannered and opened 39 more for a total of 43 stores as of last Friday, August 28, with similar grand opening results. Going forward, we've developed a list of stores to be rebannered each week through the end of October, and assuming continued success, we will reengage these efforts in 2016. By the end of October, we expect to have more than 150 stores converted. We're very pleased with the process and with the early results. Feedback from customers in these markets has been positive. 
Fourth, in the first 100 days, we plan to establish cross-organizational IT access and finalize our initial technology integration strategy. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have very good technology platforms, and there are no significant gaps or immediate needs. Through our integration planning, we've developed a road map to strategically combine our technology over time. The timing of these changes will be driven by the size of achievable synergies versus the expected cost. 
Our current plan or road map includes 4 primary phases. Immediately in Phase 1, we're addressing back-office system consolidations. Phase 2 addresses system alignment related to transportation, workforce and HR support and business intelligence. Phase 3 addresses consolidation of core merchandising systems, including forecasting and replenishment. And Phase 4 addresses projects related to distribution center management, point-of-sale and real estate. 
Fifth, we're developing and initiating plans to better serve the Family Dollar customer and to build sales momentum. Raising the table stakes is a key priority and a significant opportunity in our integration efforts. Our first 100-day plans include clearing aged and nonproductive inventory while improving our in-stock position on everyday basics. This includes reclaiming prime space for impactful displays for our fourth quarter seasonal and promotional assortment and continuing the analysis of productivity by category. 
Sixth, we will be finalizing the supply chain road map and initiating the multi-banner supply chain project. Working with a cross-banner functional team and third-party supply chain consultants, we're developing plans for integrating our warehouse management systems and making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing our space need by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners out of each facility. This is a very large product -- project with a very significant opportunity for long-term synergies. 
Seventh, we're further developing and initiating plans to reduce costs with a shared services model. Over time, we will be combining our efforts to support both banners with a shared service organization in human resources, finance, information technology, logistics, legal, strategy and audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization while reducing costs. 
This is a high-level overview of some of the components of our 100-day action plan. There are some quick and easy wins here and some that will take a great deal of work. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall business for the long term. It is a process. It will take time, but the size of the prize is worth it. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for 2015."

As Bob mentioned, we were pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter. The Dollar Tree segment performed well within the range of guidance that we provided. As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comp",1608,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning. As Bob mentioned, we were pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter. The Dollar Tree segment performed well within the range of guidance that we provided. As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comparisons for the next 4 quarters will be more complex than normal since there's no prior year data for the Family Dollar segment. 
Total sales for the second quarter grew 48.3% to $3.01 billion, which includes 4 weeks of Family Dollar sales. Excluding the $812 million in Family Dollar sales, the Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.3%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7% versus a strong 4.5% in the prior year second quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 2.4%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered stores are considered new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation. 
Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $161.1 million or 23.2% to $855.2 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. The majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $105.9 million. A few factors to note are, as a result of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition, a preliminary purchase accounting adjustment of $116.3 million was recorded for the step up in basis of Family Dollar inventory to its fair value. Of this amount, $55 million is amortizable, of which $11.1 million was amortized during the second quarter to cost of goods sold and negatively impacted gross margin results. We expect an additional $38.1 million will be amortized to cost of goods sold over the remaining 6 months of 2015. 
During the second quarter, we also took a $60 million markdown reserve for SKU rationalization and planned liquidations related to Family Dollar inventory that will not be carried going forward. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.1% during the second quarter compared with 34.2% in the prior year second quarter. The 10 basis point decline as a percent of sales was driven by higher shrink in occupancy costs, partially offset by improved merchandise costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 49.7% to $731.8 million from $489 million in last year's second quarter. The majority of the $242.7 million increase related to $200.9 million of Family Dollar expense, which included $6.5 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights recorded in connection with the acquisition and $6.5 million of additional depreciation for the harmonization of the combined company policies. For the second quarter, we incurred $17.7 million or 55 basis points of expenses related to the Family Dollar acquisition compared to $7.5 million or 35 basis points of acquisition expenses in the second quarter of 2014. 
As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 20 basis points to 24.3% in the second quarter from 24.1% in the same quarter last year. Excluding acquisition costs, SG&A expense as a percent of sales was consistent with the prior year at 23.7%. Adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment was $514.4 million or 23.4% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represented a 30 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2014 adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment of 23.7%. The decrease was driven by improved store labor productivity, lower incentive comp and lower legal fees as a percent of sales. Operating income for the combined organization decreased to $123.4 million compared with $205 million in the same period last year. This decrease is a result of lower gross profit margin and higher SG&A expenses, as previously mentioned. 
Adjusted operating income for the Dollar Tree segment increased $22.4 million to $234.9 million or 10.7% of sales compared to 10.5% of sales in the prior year second quarter. Nonoperating expenses for the second quarter totaled $265.6 million and were comprised of the following: a $1.7 million expense due to an unfavorable fair market value adjustment on diesel fuel swaps; a net interest expense of $263.9 million in the quarter compared to $8.4 million in the prior year second quarter. This increase included interest on the long-term debt for the acquisition, an $89.5 million breakage fee related to the prepayment of the Dollar Tree senior notes and a $39.5 million prepayment fee related to the Term Loan B refinancing; a $17.4 million write-off of original issue discount; and a $5.9 million write-off of deferred financing cost related to the Term Loan B refinancing. The quarterly run rate for interest expense going forward will be approximately $100 million, including deferred financing cost amortization. 
For the second quarter, the company had a net loss of $98 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Excluding acquisition-related adjustments, the company had net income of $53.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share. 
Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment was $138.9 million or $0.67 per adjusted diluted share, a 9.8% increase when compared to the reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 per diluted share in the prior year second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was a benefit of 31.1% compared to an expense of 38.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of the pretax income loss in the second -- in the quarter and the nondeductible acquisition costs. 
Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.3 billion compared to $467.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2014. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 6.7% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.8%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot decreased 1%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. Consolidated capital expenditures were $100.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 versus $88.3 million in the second quarter of last year. 
For the full year 2015, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $600 million to $615 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional few development stores; rebanner of select Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores; the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 425 Dollar Tree stores, up from the previous expectation of 320; IT system enhancements; and the construction of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $89.5 million for the second quarter versus $49.9 million in the second quarter last year. For 2015, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million. This range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items. First, it includes $46 million of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lines accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase price valuation of Family Dollar leases. 
For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $4.78 billion to $4.87 billion. For the full year of 2015, we are now estimating total sales will range from $15.3 billion to $15.52 billion. Both of these estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.7 million shares for Q3 and 223.5 million shares for the full year. 
Our expectations for the Dollar Tree segment of our business in the back half have not materially changed from our original expectation as we entered the year. However, as a result of the recently completed acquisition, the significant integration initiatives and the divestiture process, we are not providing earnings per share guidance for the third quarter or full year at this time. 
I would like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree. We will experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales in the back half of 2015. 
I would like to briefly speak to the divestiture process. Related to our acquisition, we reached an agreement to divest 330 Family Dollar stores to Sycamore Partners to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission's divestiture requirements. These 330 stores represent approximately $45.5 million in annual operating income. We're on schedule to close on the divestiture sale later this year. The closing of the divestiture transaction will not change our future net assets because the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree's assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in our Form 10-Q being filed today. The divestiture will have 2 effects on our future income: in addition to losing the operating income associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs and setup costs related to transition services. Over a period expected to be no more than 24 months, we will be providing certain support and transition services and expect to be reimbursed by the buyer for these direct operating costs and support services. 
I will now turn the call back over to Bob."

The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers, the largest of any previous retail merger, and it will take some time. It is early in the integration process, and I'm more enthusiastic than ever about the long-term opportunity to provide substantially increased shareholder value. 
We have great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that in placing our initial emphasis in these areas, we can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margin, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. 
Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to introduce Gary Philbin to our call. Effective immediately upon closing, Gary took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar. This is a key role that had been vacant for about 18 months, and the organization was in need of direction and leadership following the lengthy acquisition process. Many of you already know Gary. We've worked together, improving and growing the Dollar Tree business for the past 15 years, and I have tremendous confidence in his ability as a retailer and as a leader. Gary?"

First, let me say we are only 8 weeks into the integration, and we are enthusiastic about the initial progress and this incredible opportunity ahead of us. I'm pleased with the dedication and focus of the entire Family Dollar team. As you know, Family Dollar's a well-established brand that has been successful for more than 50 years. I think our FD, Family Dollar business, is not broken. We simply need to roll up our sleeves, focus on what's important, and we have work to do to polish up this well-known brand. 
Bob provided a high-level strategic overview of our 100-day action plan. I would like to provide greater detail into the execution components and our areas of focus on improving the Family Dollar's customer shopping experience. 
Our goal is to consistently provide great value, affordable prices and relevant items in a store environment that is convenient, clean, reliable and productive. To accomplish this goal, we're going to build on 4 basic fundamentals: great product value, well-run stores, smart choices for our customers and consistency of in-stocks on everyday items. Nothing I said here is new to retail. This is really Retail 101. We are focused on consistent execution, combined with a relentless focus on our customer. It's important to understand that we will be making investments to improve what we refer to table stakes, and these investments will include delivering on the consistency of a clean-store benchmark, catching up on deferred maintenance, investing in the right amount of payroll to drive both productivity and enhance the customer experience and improving the overall efficiency of our in-store processes. 
Importantly, we are kicking off a process to clear non-go-forward merchandise in the stores. So you're likely to see clearance activity over the next couple of months as we gear up for having our shelves stocked with basic, everyday items and to show off our great seasonal product. This will have an impact on margins near term, but it's absolutely the right thing to do for our business in the long term. 
Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I just want to say again, I'm proud to be part of the Family Dollar team. I am pleased with the work being done, and I'm excited about the opportunities this will present, both for our vendor community and our Family Dollar team members as we improve and grow the Family Dollar brand. 
Now let me turn it back over to Bob."

I want to close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 30 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. 
With the addition of Family Dollar, we're a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for: great value in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us. Over the past 3 weeks, I've had the privilege to attend and present at both Family Dollar's Annual Leadership Conference and Dollar Tree's annual field management meeting. I could not be more proud of our combined organizations. Our field management and our leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated.

So my question is, a, core profitability for Dollar Tree impact; and b, why might you be expecting a 1% to 1.5% comp for core Dollar Tree moving forward. And is that what we should expect longer term?"

Some of them, they're a little off the mark, and they're underperforming for that reason. As you know that over the past few years, I think they opened up a few more in suburban locations than may be normal. I don't know that -- what normal was. But it seemed like, and what I've been told, is that they were aiming more at suburban locations. We see more suburban locations. And as we run those lower-performing stores, we're finding some of those rural and suburban locations that are underperforming that when we run through our model, they turn out to be good Dollar Tree stores. And good Dollar Tree stores meet our Dollar Tree criteria for opening a new Dollar Tree store. These are not -- these are sites that we would open as a Dollar Tree new store and we've been looking at those locations. So what we're taking is the lower-performing stores. They're either lower performing because they're maybe a little off the Family Dollar mark. They're lower performing because maybe the model, the pro formas, weren't exactly aligned. And by the way, with our Dollar Tree margin, we can make a lot of money in a location. Our margins are much higher than the Family Dollar margins. Our mix of product is much different than the Family Dollar product. So a long answer to your question, but these are -- we're looking at these being good Dollar Tree stores. We're taking the lowest-performing and the low-performing Family Dollars, converting them into good Dollar Tree stores. Some of them are going to be breakout home runs, amongst the best of our Dollar Tree stores, on a sales per foot. And some of them are likely going to be underperforming the first year. I believe that the breakout home runs will outweigh. We're early in this, but I believe that breakout home runs will outweigh the underperformers and that most of them are going to be right there in the middle hitting whatever we expected from a Dollar Tree store. It's only been a few weeks. We've only had some grand openings so far. But I will tell you, I'm pleased with the grand openings. And I visited the first 4 test stores when we opened them. I visited all 4 of them, and they look like Dollar Tree stores and they look like Dollar Tree locations and they're in Dollar Tree towns. Customers were pleased to see our Dollar Tree open up in the place of the Family Dollar. So I'm expecting it to be at least as good as a Family -- as a Dollar Tree new store."

I mean, somebody's paying -- you're either paying the same or somebody is paying a lower. If you're paying lower then we believe that both of us deserve that lower cost. So that was pretty much as we thought it would be. The big, I think, power going forward, in addition to that, is going to be into the like items. Not exactly the same items, but they're close. It may be a private label item that we compare to, and specs are a little different. So by aligning the specs and putting that out for bid, if it's a basic item, we think -- we know we can drive some more value by combining our buying power of these 2 large businesses on those, and through product development, just leveraging our buying power to develop product for our stores, whether it's Dollar Tree or Family Dollar or both. So huge opportunities continuing on the buying side. The near term is the exact match. The near match or the close match, like items, I guess, is taking a little bit longer, but may even be a bigger part of the synergy as we go forward. And then not to forget all the things that we buy that we don't sell. We just buy them in expense items and services and things that we buy to use. That's about $3 billion that we have to work with, and every dollar we save on expenses drops right straight to the bottom line."

We have a terrific Dollar Tree buying team that understands and is focused on delivering tremendous value to our Dollar Tree customer for $1 price and at margins that we're pleased to have. We have, at Family Dollar, a separate team focused on that lower-income customer, the needs-based customer, more of a consumer product customer. 70%-ish, something like that, is consumer products. So the buying teams are staying separate. We're connecting them over -- at the top through merchandise managers and divisional vice presidents and that area. We're coordinating or buying with vendors. We're coordinating the activities on items and -- comparing buying plans and merging those as we go onto buying trips, as we go to Asia, as we go to market in, wherever it is, New York, going to shows and that kind of thing. So a lot of coordination, but we -- I believe it's very important to keep the focus clearly on the Family Dollar banner. We intend to continue opening up Family Dollar stores as well as Dollar Tree stores. Sometimes, they're pretty close to each other, so I'd like to be able to do that and have a difference in the banners when you walk inside, have a difference in the merchandise assortment. So the merchandise assortment at Family Dollar is evolving. It will be changing, as we discussed -- as I've discussed in the past. The synergies, I think we've said in the past it's 25% of the synergies in the first year. We think we can get up to 75% of them by the end of the second full year and then 100% by the end of 3 full years. So that's something like, what, 75, 150, 75, something like that. 150 additional in the second year. So 75, 225 and 300 if you look at it that way. The early synergies are across the board. There are going to be a lot of sourcing and procurement. There will be some in banner optimization. I've said that we're going to do over 150 banner -- new -- rebannering stores this year. So that's a real number. Overhead, we're working through that in every segment of our business. Some of that's going to be driven by our information technology integration. Some of it requires the integration of the technology, for example, in logistics. The ability to ship both banners out of every building is going to require a lot of technology help. So that will be probably later in the process. Earlier in the process are the things about overhead and improvements in SG&A through better -- more efficient procurement and through buying power."

As I initially said in the prepared remarks that May, driven by a couple of terrific holidays, Mother's Day and Memorial Day, you have that seasonal energy, that holiday excitement. So that drove the highest comps for us. June wasn't far behind. July was running pretty much consistent. We did lose a first of the month to a end-of-July week. So some of that business slipped forward. Anytime the first of the month follows on the weekend, then the checks come out in a different cadence, in this case, versus last year. It all came out -- the first and the third came out last year. This year, only the first checks came out. So there was a little slide in that final week of July. But overall, it was fairly consistent through the quarter. And again, every time there's a great holiday, we have a lot of energy in our Dollar Tree stores and you see more traffic and you see more sales from the holiday. Back-to-school started well. It's not over. One of the things that we're experiencing as well as all of retail, I guess, right now is Labor Day is a week later. Labor Day drives a lot of things in the retail business. It drives seasonal sale at sort of the end of the summer, I guess. The pools close end of the summer for retailers and for customers. And that's when a lot of the school starts. Some schools run year round, I realize, some start at different times. But still, a large percentage of schools start after Labor Day. Well, that's a week later this year. So the sales cadence on our back-to-school looks good, but we still got to -- haven't finished with back-to-school yet. So we'll be finishing that up this weekend. It should be terrific weekend in our Dollar Tree stores. If you have one near, drop in, you'll see a lot of sidewalk sales and summer excitement and all that goes with ending the summer season as well as getting ready to go to back to school."

As Gary described, we'll pull back to -- when I say pull back, from peak numbers that Family Dollar has done. Next year will be a pull-back year also. Past that, I think we've got to say that as we get more confidence in the new model, we'll ramp it back up. It's there to be done. There's plenty of room for the Family Dollar stores. We're excited about what we can do with it. We just need this time for the rest of this year and probably next year in order to get confidence that the new model -- now we'll open up stores, but it won't be the peak numbers that we've seen in the past.

This morning, we announced results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Total sales increased to $4.95 billion and same-store sales increased 2.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted cash EPS increased 30.",2206,"Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Total sales increased to $4.95 billion and same-store sales increased 2.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted cash EPS increased 30.4% to $1.33 per share versus $1.02 per share in the prior year's third quarter. 
Despite what continues to be viewed by many as a challenging retail environment, I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance and especially with our continued progress in integrating our recent acquisition of Family Dollar. There have been no surprises that would change our outlook on this strategic rationale. There's only increased excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead as a larger, stronger and more diversified organization.
We're only one full quarter into the integration and both our teams are line strategically and collaborating to deliver solid results. Accomplishments in the third quarter include another solid quarter for the Dollar Tree banner. As expected, Dollar Tree delivered a low single-digit positive sales comp, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.1%, and that was on top of a strong 5.9% increase in the third quarter last year. This was the most difficult quarterly comparison for the year.
On a 2-year stack to basis, our same-store sales accent learned from the second quarter to the third quarter just as they had done from the first quarter to the second. Sales growth in Q3 was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. 
We're making meaningful progress on integrating the Family Dollar banner. Only one full quarter end, the stores will cleaner, the shelves are better stocked, we've cleaned up all inventory and the end caps are more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving from store teams and customers has been positive.
We've developed and announced plans to rebanner our Deals locations. Our full resources and energy are being focused on our 2 primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. And on November 2, we announced the successful completion of our required divestiture of 330 Family Dollar Stores. I'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was the 31st consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales.
Third quarter results continue to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand as customers are shopping with us more often, we're attracting new customers everyday and when the customers are on the store, they're more. Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day.
Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements. And our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandise values are better than ever.
Seasonal energy was high beginning in August with back-to-school. In addition to dominant displays of back-to-school basics, the customers responded favorably to brightly colored fashion stationary, teacher supplies, classroom essentials and lunchbox valued, all priced at $1. In September, we celebrated Dollar Tree's 29th anniversary with Bonus Buys and wow items for our customers. Key categories included cleaning supplies, home office essentials, snacks and a broad assortment of special values from our million-dollar brands. Our stores refilled with well-known national brands and high-value private labels throughout the event.
Seasonally, our store teams transitioned efficiently from back-to-school to fall harvest and Halloween. In September, Dollar Tree became Halloween headquarters with major statements in Halloween costumes, makeup, home decor, candy and party supplies. Customers responded enthusiastically and our sell-through was improved over last year. Dollar Tree stores are now set and prepared for Christmas and fourth quarter holiday shopping season.
For the third quarter, same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both our basic consumables and discretionary products. The top-performing categories in the quarter included snacks and beverage, candy and food, household supplies and beauty and eyewear.
Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the Midwest, followed by the mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast. All 6 geographic zones produced positive same-store sales for the quarter. Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customer's sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores.
In the third quarter, we opened a total of 118 new Dollar Tree stores and relocated or expanded 16 stores for a total of 134 projects. Additionally, during the quarter, we rebannered 143 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores, and we're pleased with the results. We're now targeting a total of 200 conversions in this fiscal year.
Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 9.9% compared to the prior year, and we ended the quarter with 5,841 Dollar Tree stores in North America. In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive-the-business initiatives include category expansions, customers realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in our pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Seasonal relevance, our storefront change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point.
Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store at Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value. And being first-of-the-month ready, we place special emphasis on basic consumables core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the third quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 135 additional stores for a total of 390 stores year-to-date. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,148 stores and growing.
We continue to support land growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. Construction on our newest D.C. and Cherokee County South Carolina is well underway, as 1.5 million square-foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We plan to have the facility operational in Q3 of 2016.
Additionally, to support continued growth in our California markets, we are expanding our stock and distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet, an increase of 55%. This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of our second quarter in 2016.
Again, I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in the third quarter. Our Dollar Tree segment continues to deliver sector operating margins, our customer base is large and growing, and we're on schedule with our integration of Family Dollar. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization. I view the strategic rationale as more compelling than ever.
In the early days of integration, we found nothing that diminishes our vision and plans for value creation. In fact, I'm even more enthusiastic about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. Our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar are on the customer, the shopping experience and the value creation.
In the third quarter, we kicked off our red tag clearance event while continuing the review of our merchandise assortments and category flow, refining real estate plans, reviewing and refining marketing plans, and defining the table stakes in our stores. With our red tackler clearance events, we identified markdown and cleared out all slow-moving and non-productive inventory. In doing so, we reclaimed our and caps to make way for fresh, new and seasonal merchandise, and to refresh our discretionary sections in apparel, home and seasonal. All of these are important categories as we enter the holidays. The red tag event was well-executed across stores, customers responded to the additional savings, and we have cleared more than $135 million at retail and aims in non-productive inventory.
Merchandise assortments are under review. Our focus is on providing product and value that best meets our customer's needs. We're paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing, private label products and roles, while rationalizing SKUs for increased productivity and a focus on basic and stock levels.
In real estate, we're analyzing portfolio data to gain a better understanding of customer and demographic targets. This is a system in the identification of additional stores that will have better Dollar Tree demographics for potential rebanner and identifying metrics for improving new store productivity and our return on investment.
We're extremely focused on opportunities to improve the customer experience. The table stakes' requirement are being refined, quantified and rolled out for testing. Table stakes include store standards and conditions, the customer experience, merchandise relevance and customer engagement, to name a few of the key metrics. Many of these metrics are less about investment and more about disciplines and benchmarks. Customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. For table stakes initiatives that requires investments, we plan to manage with the same disciplined approach that reviews at Dollar Tree for many years, identifying and paying special attention to the customer facing metrics with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement.
We're making great progress on delivering announced synergies. We have confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year post closing. In fact, I'll be disappointed if we don't exceed this number. As a reminder, these synergies will be driven through 4 primary avenues: Sourcing and procurement, our rebanner program for optimizing store formats, distribution and logistics, and overhead and corporate SG&A. As announced, we expect to spend approximately $300 million in one-time costs to achieve the synergies.
We still have a lot of work ahead of us. But at this stage, we're clearly on track to achieve our year 1 milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies. Plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies are well underway. Our exact match initiative to provide the lowest costs on identical items across both banners is nearly complete with expected results, no surprises. The review of similar match items continues. Positive results are growing.
We're achieving payment term parity with savings from harmonizing payment terms, auctions, RFPs and a formal bid process are well underway on expense items. Our savings continue to build toward expectations. During the third quarter, we rebannered an additional 143 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree, bringing our total of converted stores to 147. We are continuing to rebanner stores into November and fourth quarter, and we're now targeting a total of 200 conversions for fiscal 2015. The preliminary results are meeting expectations and feedback from both store teams and customers has been positive. We're well on our way towards finalizing the supply chain roadmap and initiating the multi-banner supply chain project. With a cross organizational functional team, we're integrating our warehouse management systems, and we're making plans to rationalize of the fleet of combined VCs, analyzing space needs by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners out of all facilities. This is a very large project with significant opportunity for long-term synergies. Our first pilot facilities plan to be operational in the third quarter 2016.
We continued to make progress in reducing costs through a shared services model. we're Combining back-office functions to support both banners through a shared services organization. Over time, these shared services will include human resources, finance, information technology, supply chain and logistics, legal strategic planning and internal audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization through a more cost-effective approach.
On October 13, we announced plans to rebanner all 222 deals locations in 2016. For nearly a decade, our committed team of deals associate has done a great job of consistently providing customers with terrific values. With the acquisition of Family Dollar, we're confident that we can provide more focus and better serve our Deals customers and markets through our primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. We will begin the conversion of Deals in January with plans to complete the rebannering of all Deals stores by the end of July 2016.
Only a few months into the integration, we've made great progress. There are some quick and easy wins and some that will take more time and a great deal of work. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once, but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall benefits of business for the long term. It is a process. It will take more than a few months, but the return is worth it. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2015."

As a result of the recent acquisition, year-over-year comparisons for the next several quarters will be very complex. However, we have added tables to the press release, which we believe will be helpful in understanding the ongoing business. Total sales for the third quarter grew 136% to $4.95 billion, which includes our first full quarter Family Dollar sales.
Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.4% to $2.27 billion, while Family Dollar segment sales increased 6.1% to $2.67 billion. Same-store sales, on a constant currency basis, increased 2.1% versus a very strong 5.9% in the prior year's third quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket increases.
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.7%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar Stores and newly rebannered stores are considered new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation. We are pleased with Family Dollar sales during the quarter. We saw low- to mid single-digit positive same-store sales each month during the quarter. September was the strongest month, driven by the timing of our red tag clearance event. Geographically, sales strength was relatively balanced by region.
Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $674.7 million or 93% to $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. The majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $627.8 million. A few factors to note are: During the quarter, $38.4 million was amortized to cost of goods sold related to the inventory step-up and negatively impacted gross margin results; this amount was higher than originally projected based an inventory sell-through. The total dollar amount to be amortized has not changed. 
We currently estimate an additional $11 million will be amortized to cost of goods sold in Q4. During the third quarter, we took an additional $30 [ph] million in markdowns related -- markdown-related expense in the Family Dollar banner for our red tag clearance event. We've opted take advantage of that success and traffic of the clearance event to clear additional inventory that was deemed nongo-forward.
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34% during the third quarter compared with 34.6% in the prior year third quarter. This 60 basis point decline, as a percent of sales, was partly driven by a decrease in markdown related to increased third-party product testing, increased freight and higher distribution centered labor costs. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 23.5% during the third quarter compared with 24.3% in the comparable period -- comparable prior year period. Excluding the $38.4 million of inventory step-up amortization and the $30 million dollars of additional clearance markdowns, gross profit margin was 24 point -- 25.4% for the quarter. The improvement of 110 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved markdown, lower markdowns, improvement in freight and distribution costs, partially offset by higher occupancy cost.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 132.7% to $1.18 billion from $505.6 million in last year's third quarter. The majority of the $670.7 million increase related to $628.9 million of Family Dollar expense. Q3 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment, as a percent of sales, was 24.1%, consistent with the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $20.3 million of acquisition and integration-related costs, while the prior year included $14.3 million of acquisition-related costs.
Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A improved to 23.3% for Q3 compared to 23.5% for the prior year's quarter. This 20 basis point improvement was driven primarily by lower incentive comp and legal fees.
SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment, as a percent of sales, was 23.5% compared to 23% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $6.8 million of integration and divestiture cost, $19.8 million of depreciation for harmonization of policies and fair market value adjustments and $19.2 million of favorable lease rate amortization. The prior year's comparable period include $30.6 million of restructuring charges and $9.7 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A increased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.8% from 21.4% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increase repair and maintenance expense in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition and integrated related costs for Dollar Tree segment increased $11.1 million to $245.1 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income decreased 40 basis points to 10.8% compared to 11.2% of sales from the prior year's third quarter.
Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $23.1 million to $96.1 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income increased 70 basis points to 3.6% compared to 2.9% of sales in the prior year's comparable period. Nonoperating expenses for the third quarter totaled $99 million and were comprised primarily of net interest expense of $98.4 million in the quarter.
For the third quarter, the company had net income of $81.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings per share, as detailed in the press release table, was $0.49 per diluted share. On an adjusted cash EPS basis, earnings per share for the quarter increased 30.4% to $1.33 per share compared to $1.02 per share in last year's third quarter. In our earnings release issued this morning, we provided a detailed reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash earnings and adjusted cash earnings per share.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34.3% compared to 36.5% in the prior year's quarter. The lower rate was primarily attributable to an increase in work opportunity tax credits, or WOTC, in relation to the income for the third quarter and a decrease in state tax expense. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end totaled $1.1 billion compared to $407.6 million at the end of the third quarter of last year. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end was 12.1% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 9.9%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 2%.
We believe that current inventory levels are perfect to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter. For the Family Dollar segment, we are extremely pleased with our clearance event, which eliminated aged and non-productive inventory. And at the end of the quarter, inventory decreased 0.3% compared to the prior year. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments until our current imaging levels are appropriate for the fourth quarter.
Capital expenditures were $169.5 million in the third quarter of 2015 versus $94.2 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2015, we are planning for capital -- consolidated capital expenditures to range from $505 million to $525 million.
Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, rebanner select Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores, the addition of frozen or refrigerated capability to approximately 425 stores, IT system enhancements, the construction of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center and the expansion of our stock in California dissolution center. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $168.7 million for the third quarter versus $50.9 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million.
As discussed with Q2, this range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items. First, it includes $46 million of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in value of assets base and purchase price allocation.
Secondly includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase price valuation of Family Dollar leases. Our guidance takes into account our actual performance for the first 3 quarters of 2015, as well as our visibility and forecast for the remainder of the year.
Our guidance includes the following assumptions. I'd like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar Stores and excludes stores that were rebannered from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been owned by Dollar Tree or opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months. We will continue to experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comes as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy and analysis and our outlook for same-store sales.
On October 13, we announced our 2016 plans to rebanner all of our deal store locations so that we can place all of our focus on our 2 primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The conversion process will be similar to that we are using to convert the Family Dollar stores to Dollar Trees. We expect to have this initiative completed by the end of July 2016.
Our guidance includes $12.5 million of markdown reserves, accelerated depreciation and other rebannering expense. This represents our best estimate at this time to complete the rebannering of Deal stores to Dollar Tree stores.
On November 2, just after our third quarter ended, we announced the successful completion of our required divestiture of 330 Family Dollar Stores. These 330 stores represented approximately $45.5 million in annual operating come. In terms of the sales have not been disclosed and the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree's assets and liabilities has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. 
The divestiture will have 2 effects on our future income. In addition to losing the operating, associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs, incentive costs related to transition services. Over a period expected to be no more than 24 months, we will be providing certain support transition services and expect to be reimbursed by the buyer for these direct operating costs and support services. The expected financial effect of the divestitures, which includes the loss of their operating come from the 330 stores, along with the cost of the transition services agreement, is included in our guidance.
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 37.9% for the fourth quarter. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.8 million share for Q4 and 223.5 million shares for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.32 billion to $5.42 billion. For fiscal 2015, we are now estimating total sales to range from $15.45 billion to $15.55 billion. Both of these estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase.
We have attached to our press release our cancellation of the forecasted Q4 range of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash earnings per share. We are forecasting net income to range from $213.2 million to $242.2 million and adjusted cash earnings per diluted share of $2.32 to $2.51 for the fourth quarter.

The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations, 180,000 people and 23 distribution centers, which based on store count is the largest of any previous retail merger. While we are very early in the integration process, I'm pleased with our progress.
We have great confidence in our ability and the opportunity and the ability to achieve at least $300 million and annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization to improve communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We are confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand for improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.
I'll close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history.
For 31 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree had delivered positive same-store sales increases through good times and difficult times, and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector.
With the addition of Family Dollar, we are larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more customers with exactly what they're looking for, great value in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us.
Operator, we're now ready for your questions."

The category we've used are ongoing, but the priority going into the fourth quarter was just to make sure that our holiday merchandise and a lot of our discretionary categories were in place. So during the fourth quarter, you're not going to see wholesale changes in categories. We are focused purely on getting the holiday merchandise, noncredit customer, and I think we have our best opportunity this year to have a great sell on lots of the seasonal, relevant items.

As far as working with our vendors going forward, our plan is to work with them to provide the best product to our customers, to sell it. And we want to drive product sales from our vendor partners. The way we go-to-market, we prefer, in many cases, to take those incentives and apply to the cost of goods and situate that we can share that value with a customer. We're going to make money by selling product and not by collecting funds. Now having said that, we don't expect the funds to go away. We expect to work with our vendor partners to use them in such a way that we can drive more cartons, more cases of their product through our doors. So I'm excited about to the transition. I think you can get, as a retailer, many retailers, I think get too focused on getting the funds, not focused enough on the customer cannot focused enough on driving value for the customer. And we're just as exactly as we've done it, Dollar Tree, we're always focused on the customer, getting the best price that we possibly can that includes getting our share of the funding where possible, but getting the lowest price possible so that we can price the product appropriately and drive more chaste sales through the front doors. And our vendor partners have the same goal, by the way. So we're completely aligned on that strategy. And I think that plans are coming together very, very nicely."

I can tell you that the 2 things that Kevin mentioned, there are things that we do in the normal course of business. We have doubled down on our testing, testing more times, especially on some of the categories that are more subject to compliance issues. And the idea is we don't want to fail. We want to make sure that we're providing the safe product for our customers and we double down on our testing. I think that's a one-time, not that we're not going to continue testing, but what you saw there was a little bit of a bubble based on a change in the way we are doing our testing that will smooth out over time. I have great confidence we'll be able to manage that for the long haul. The second thing was the big largest impact next was our DC productivity was lower in third quarter. And there's a couple of things there. And they're all, you can point to them, we can identify them and we can fix to them over time. But we are here at peak inventory times at Dollar Tree. We are receiving all the products for -- in the third quarter for our third quarter, as well as our fourth quarter sales. It's a peak inventory time. And at the same time, we decided to rebanner a couple of hundred Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree, and we scrambled around to buy the product and insert that into the inventory equation, receiving it in the appropriate DCs ad maybe signing things a little different, moving things around, as well as rebannering our Deal stores, which over time, we're not going to start that until January. But just the planning and getting things positioned for that reduced our overall productivity at a time when our buildings are in absolutely maxed peak capacity. As I mentioned a couple of times, we are building a new distribution center of 1,500,000 square feet. We always build ahead of the need, but just ahead of the need in South Carolina to serve Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern Dollar Tree stores, as well as expanding our stock and distribution center over 50% for next year. So we're opening up more capacity while we are doing a lot of things in addition to what we originally planned in our distribution model. The result was we had some distribution productivity lag. At the same time, our outbound transportation, which is something we've talked about before, was also a little higher than it has been in the past. So all in all, things are identifiable, opportunity to improve, and we will improve on those. But that was really the main components of the track on the gross profit number in the third quarter."

Over time, we're going to be combining both banners under one supply chain with all of our buildings, supply and product for all banners with the ability to supply merchandise for all banners. At the same time, we're looking at rationalizing our buildings and also, identifying where the capacity needs are going to be for the future. All of that is going on right now. What that means, though, is over time, we will have lower supply chain costs. We're looking for more productivity out of our buildings. We're looking for reducing stem miles as we're able to service both Family Dollar Stores and Dollar Tree stores out of the same building. So there's a lot of opportunity to lower costs going forward and to improve our service to our stores through the combined power of the -- this combined supply chain. Let me add one more thing, I don't think I gave you an answer on the margin for Dollar Tree going forward. Merchandise margin for Dollar Tree going forward, I don't think, we're always in control of that. It's more about the mix than it is the items because we don't have to have anything. Say again, we changed a lot of our product every year. And our buyers go-to-market with the same goal, that is to offer the best value for $1 at a margin that fits our margin requirement. So we are still in control of our merchandise margin at Dollar Tree. We have this one quarter where we've got some little noise in there, frankly. But like I said, that's identifiable. That's fixable. We're going to prove that over time. But the merchandise markup at Dollar Tree is still absolutely in our control. And I don't see any pressures to change that. Frankly, our sourcing opportunities are -- improved with both the size of our pencil now, as well as the economic conditions around the world, especially in China, it's really a buyers market out there now."

So I think, in general, I think flattish operating margins for the Tree is a reasonable thought process. I think on the Family Dollar side, I think it's, as I think about it, it's really around how does the holiday sell-through go. And Gary talked about the holiday merchandise and the focus on that.

There is some degree of cannibalization this year from 200 stores that we're rebannering. There will be some cannibalization next year from the additional rebanner stores, as well as the rebannering of the Deals stores to Dollar Tree and some of them to Family Dollar. So there will be continue to be some cannibalization. There always is when we look at these stores to rebanner, as well as when we look at new stores, though, we look at the sales projections for the particular store. We also look at the -- any cannibalization that's going to occur in the market. So we look at surrounding stores, and we define what we think the cannibalization is going to be. We then look at the market returns when we're opening up the new stores. And we're going to continue to do that. We've done it with the rebanner stores from Family Dollar. We're doing it with the deal stores going into Dollar Tree. And we'll do it with our stores. So cannibalization is just part of it after you open up of the first store, the second store, is some cannibalization in the market. So -- but I will tell you we've done our homework on it. We're pleased with the results that we're getting also from the ones that we've already rebannered. The Deal stores that we are going to rebanner, we've built that model of real estate model per Dollar Tree. So that's one of the reasons that most of those are turning into Dollar Tree stores because they all serve our interest better and with higher returns as Dollar Tree's if you're going to Family Dollar. So cannibalization is part of it. We'll talk about it. We'll point it out, but it's really the growth in the market and growth in the business for the company that's most important."

So we start with a cadence that was already discounted in store somewhere between 10%, 15%, 20% off, and then restart our markdown cadence of 50%, 75%, 90%. So when you think about the units that we cleared out, the actual retail sales that we were receiving from that pile of goods was fairly static over that time. I think the good news on the clearance was when folks came in for that event, they tend to buy something else in store at our regular retails. And so I think the energy in just getting our stores cleaned up a bit, getting our end cups reclaimed, organizing occurrence event, which is no small test, to make it look like something, all served us pretty well. Maybe just to tag on to Bob's comments. There's an art and science to pricing. and the science piece is, we do want to be grounded against our strategy on competition. You always have an eye on that. But what we're really focused on Family Dollar is what's most meaningful to our customers? What is it that they need for first of the month? What's the best goods that they are looking to buy on a weekly and monthly basis? And so our strategy is one that talks to what's on promotion? What's on shelf? The addition for Family Dollar of a private label can be polished up and really enhance opening price point and some of the assortment cash we have is a great one, not to mention the addition of -- we have a great import program, but that can also drive additional value into the store. So we really see all those arrows in our quiver as we get rooted in what do we need to be competitive, but really stay focused on what a Family Dollar customer needs to drive value into her basket on a weekly and monthly basis. So that's our approach we're taking as we go to our category reviews and looking into '16."

At the same time, they've seen lower gasoline prices. They've seen higher food prices. They've seen higher rent prices. They've seen higher health care costs. They've seen higher taxes. So there's still a concern. there's still under pressure. The concept that Dollar Tree and at Family Dollar of serving those people is serving us well. At Dollar Tree, we've said that we are right for all times. We have great products of that people need every day, consumer products, things you got to by to live, things that you have to have everyday and the price is only $1, alongside things that maybe discretionary that you'd like to have, but everything's $1. So through good times and difficult times, we've tended to do very well and usually better than the market at Dollar Tree. At Family Dollar, where that low income customer, the more we focus on what that lower-income customer needs offering the great value, improving our in-stock, giving the better shopping experience, exceeding their expectations when they go into our stores, to better serve, we're going to be specially during difficult times because the -- that lower-income customer really needs as Family Dollar and Dollar Tree in order to make ends meet throughout the month. So that's your question. I mean, I think they are great pulls, gasoline prices are lower, but not much offsets in there will. And they've got to come along way really to get their head back above water in many of them.
In closing, I just like to make one quick comment sort of in regard to that last question, and I'll close with this. But as a combined organization, both banners, our focus on growing our earnings power for years to come, there's a lot of things that we're doing right now that are in regard to getting us positioned and for the future. Our decisions are always with our eyes on the horizon, but managing in realtime. So what you're going to see from us is our decisions are going to be made for the longer term. I'm not telling you it's going to make forever to bring value. I'm just saying our decisions are based on building this large entity, combining 2 great banners for the long term. But we are dedicated to managing the business in realtime. And that means every month, every day, every quarter, it means every expense line on the P&L, it means looking at our customer in the eye and trying to deliver the product that they need from us and identifying the position that we hold in the market using our size and our leverage to offer the greatest values for that customer. So we're going to do both. And I think I'd like to tell you that my expectations that we're going to continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. This is the first full quarter that we've had the combined companies. I think we had one month in the last earnings release. But so first full quarter that we've had, and we've shown improvement. And some slight improvement, mind you, but improvement. And I think I would tell you that I expect that to continue quarter-over-quarter. We'll show improvement. We're going to share with you all the information that we know that is pertinent to where we're going with this thing. We're not going to -- I guess, surprise anybody with it, but we're not going to give you information until we can absolutely get our arms around it and share with you how that looks going forward.

Adjusted cash EPS increased 30.",2206,"Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Total sales increased to $4.95 billion and same-store sales increased 2.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted cash EPS increased 30.4% to $1.33 per share versus $1.02 per share in the prior year's third quarter. 
Despite what continues to be viewed by many as a challenging retail environment, I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance and especially with our continued progress in integrating our recent acquisition of Family Dollar. There have been no surprises that would change our outlook on the strategic rationale. There's only increased excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead as a larger, stronger and more diversified organization.
We're only one full quarter into the integration and both our teams are aligned strategically and collaborating to deliver solid results. Accomplishments in the third quarter include another solid quarter for the Dollar Tree banner. As expected, Dollar Tree delivered a low single-digit positive sales comp, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.1%, and that was on top of a strong 5.9% increase in the third quarter last year. This was the most difficult quarterly comparison for the year.
On a 2-year stack to basis, our same-store sales accelerated from the second quarter to the third quarter just as they had done from the first quarter to the second. Sales growth in Q3 was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. 
We're making meaningful progress on integrating the Family Dollar banner. Only one full quarter in, the stores are cleaner, the shelves are better stocked, we've cleaned up all the inventory and the end caps are more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving from store teams and customers has been positive.
We've developed and announced plan to rebanner our Deals locations. Our full resources and energy are being focused on our 2 primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. And on November 2, we announced the successful completion of our required divestiture of 330 Family Dollar stores. I'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was the 31st consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales.
Third quarter results continued to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand as customers are shopping with us more often, we're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the store, they're buying more. Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day.
Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements. And our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandise values are better than ever.
Seasonal energy was high beginning in August with back-to-school. In addition to dominant displays of back-to-school basics, the customers responded favorably to brightly colored fashion stationery, teacher supplies, classroom essentials and lunchbox values, all priced at $1. In September, we celebrated Dollar Tree's 29th anniversary with Bonus Buys and WOW! items for our customers. Key categories included cleaning supplies, home office essentials, snacks and a broad assortment of special values from our million-dollar brands. Our stores were filled with well-known national brands and high-value private labels throughout the event.
Seasonally, our store teams transitioned efficiently from back-to-school to fall harvest and Halloween. In September, Dollar Tree became Halloween headquarters with major statements in Halloween costumes, makeup, home decor, candy and party supplies. Customers responded enthusiastically and our sell-through was improved over last year. Dollar Tree stores are now set and prepared for Christmas and fourth quarter holiday shopping season.
For the third quarter, same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both our basic consumables and discretionary products. The top-performing categories in the quarter included snacks and beverage, candy and food, household supplies and beauty and eyewear.
Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the Midwest, followed by the mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast. All 6 geographic zones produced positive same-store sales for the quarter. 
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customer's sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores.
In the third quarter, we opened a total of 118 new Dollar Tree stores and relocated or expanded 16 stores for a total of 134 projects. Additionally, during the quarter, we rebannered 143 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores, and we're pleased with the results. We're now targeting a total of 200 conversions in this fiscal year. Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 9.9% compared to the prior year, and we ended the quarter with 5,841 Dollar Tree stores in North America. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive-the-business initiatives include category expansions, customers realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in our pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products; seasonal relevance, our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. 
Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store at Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value. And being first-of-the-month ready, we place special emphasis on basic consumables, core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the third quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 135 additional stores for a total of 390 stores year-to-date. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,148 stores and growing.
We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. Construction on our newest DC and Cherokee County, South Carolina is well underway, as 1.5 million square-foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We plan to have the facility operational in Q3 of 2016.
Additionally, to support continued growth in our California markets, we're expanding our Stockton distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet, an increase of 55%. This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of our second quarter in 2016.
Again, I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in the third quarter. Our Dollar Tree segment continues to deliver sector-leading operating margins, our customer base is large and growing, and we're on schedule with our integration of Family Dollar. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization. I view the strategic rationale as more compelling than ever.
In the early days of integration, we found nothing that diminishes our vision and plans for value creation. In fact, I'm even more enthusiastic about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. Our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar are on the customer, the shopping experience and the value equation.
In the third quarter, we kicked off our red tag clearance event while continuing the review of our merchandise assortments and category flow, refining real estate plans, reviewing and refining marketing plans, and defining the table stakes in our stores. With our red tag clearance events, we identified markdown and cleared out old, slow-moving and nonproductive inventory. In doing so, we reclaimed our end caps to make way for fresh, new and seasonal merchandise, and to refresh our discretionary sections in apparel, home and seasonal. All of these are important categories as we enter the holidays. The red tag event was well executed across stores, customers responded to the additional savings, and we have cleared more than $135 million at retail aged and non-productive inventory.
Merchandise assortments are under review. Our focus is on providing product and value that best meets our customer's needs. We're paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing, private label products and roles, while rationalizing SKUs for increased productivity and a focus on basic and stock levels.
In real estate, we're analyzing portfolio data to gain a better understanding of customer and demographic targets. This is assisting in the identification of additional stores that we have better Dollar Tree demographics for potential rebanner and identifying metrics for improving new store productivity and our return on investment.
We're extremely focused on opportunities to improve the customer experience. The table stakes' requirements are being refined, quantified and rolled out for testing. Table stakes include store standards and conditions, the customer experience, merchandise relevance and customer engagement, to name a few of the key metrics. Many of these metrics are less about investment and more about disciplines and benchmarks. Customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. For table stakes initiatives that require investments, we plan to manage with the same disciplined approach that we've used at Dollar Tree for many years, identifying and paying special attention to the customer-facing metrics with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement.
We're making great progress on delivering announced synergies. We have confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year post closing. In fact, I'll be disappointed if we don't exceed this number. As a reminder, these synergies will be driven through 4 primary avenues: Sourcing and procurement, our rebanner program for optimizing store formats, distribution and logistics, and overhead and corporate SG&A. As announced, we expect to spend approximately $300 million in onetime costs to achieve these synergies.
We still have a lot of work ahead of us. But at this stage, we're clearly on track to achieve our year 1 milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies. Plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies are well underway. Our exact match initiative to provide the lowest costs on identical items across both banners is nearly complete with expected results, no surprises. The review of similar match items continues. Positive results are growing.
We are achieving payment term parity with savings from harmonizing payment terms, auctions, RFPs and a formal bid process are well underway on expense items. Our savings continued to build toward expectations. 
During the third quarter, we rebannered an additional 143 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree, bringing our total of converted stores to 147. We are continuing to rebanner stores into November and fourth quarter, and we're now targeting a total of 200 conversions for fiscal 2015. The preliminary results are meeting expectations, and feedback from both store teams and customers has been positive. 
We're well on our way towards finalizing the supply chain roadmap and initiating the multi-banner supply chain project. With a cross organizational functional team, we're integrating our warehouse management systems, and we're making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing space needs by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners out of all facilities. This is a very large project with significant opportunity for long-term synergies. Our first pilot facilities plan to be operational in third quarter of 2016.
We continue to make progress on reducing costs through a shared services model. We're combining back-office functions to support both banners through a shared services organization. Over time, these shared services will include human resources, finance, information technology, supply chain and logistics, legal, strategic planning and internal audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization through a more cost-effective approach.
On October 13, we announced plan to rebanner all 222 Deals locations in 2016. For nearly a decade, our committed team of Deals associate has done a great job of consistently providing customers with terrific values. With the acquisition of Family Dollar, we're confident that we can provide more focus and better serve our Deals customers and markets through our primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. We will begin the conversion of Deals in January with plans to complete the rebannering of all Deals stores by the end of July 2016.
Only a few months into the integration, we've made great progress. There are some quick and easy wins and some that will take more time and a great deal of work. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once, but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall benefits of business for the long term. It is a process. It will take more than a few months, but the return is worth it. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2015."

Same-store sales, on a constant currency basis, increased 2.1% versus a very strong 5.9% in the prior year's third quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket increases.
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.7%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar Stores and newly rebannered stores are considered new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation. We were pleased with Family Dollar sales during the quarter. We saw low to mid-single-digit positive same-store sales each month during the quarter. September was the strongest month, driven by the timing of our red tag clearance event. Geographically, sales strength was relatively balanced by region.
Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $674.7 million or 93% to $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. The majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $627.8 million. A few factors to note are: During the quarter, $38.4 million was amortized to cost of goods sold related to the inventory step-up and negatively impacted gross margin results. This amount was higher than originally projected based an inventory sell-through. The total dollar amount to be amortized has not changed. 
We currently estimate an additional $11 million will be amortized to cost of goods sold in Q4. During the third quarter, we took an additional $13 million in markdowns related -- markdown-related expense in the Family Dollar banner for our red tag clearance event. We ought to take advantage of the success and traffic of the clearance event to clear additional inventory that was deemed nongo-forward.
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34% during the third quarter compared with 34.6% in the prior year's third quarter. The 60 basis point decline, as a percent of sales, was primarily driven by a decrease in mark-on related to increased third-party product testing, increased freight and higher distribution center labor costs. 
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 23.5% during the third quarter compared with 24.3% in the comparable period -- comparable prior year period. Excluding the $38.4 million of inventory step-up amortization and the $13 million of additional clearance markdowns, gross profit margin was 24 point -- 25.4% for the quarter. The improvement of 110 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved mark-on, lower markdowns, improvement in freight and distribution costs, partially offset by higher occupancy costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 132.7% to $1.18 billion from $505.6 million in last year's third quarter. The majority of the $670.7 million increase related to $628.9 million of Family Dollar expense. 
Q3 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment, as a percent of sales, was 24.1%, consistent with the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $20.3 million of acquisition and integration-related costs, while the prior year included $14.3 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A improved to 23.3% for Q3 compared to 23.5% for the prior year's quarter. This 20 basis point improvement was driven primarily by lower incentive comp and legal fees.
SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment, as a percent of sales, was 23.5% compared to 23% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $6.8 million of integration and divestiture cost, $19.8 million of depreciation for harmonization of policies and fair market value adjustments and $19.2 million of favorable lease rate amortization. The prior year's comparable period included $30.6 million of restructuring charges and $9.7 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A increased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.8% from 21.4% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increase repair and maintenance expense in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition and integrated related costs for Dollar Tree segment increased $11.1 million to $245.1 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income decreased 40 basis points to 10.8% compared to 11.2% of sales from the prior year's third quarter.
Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $23.1 million to $96.1 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income increased 70 basis points to 3.6% compared to 2.9% of sales in the prior year's comparable period. 
Nonoperating expenses for the third quarter totaled $99 million and were comprised primarily of net interest expense of $98.4 million in the quarter.
For the third quarter, the company had net income of $81.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings per share, as detailed in the press release table, was $0.49 per diluted share. On an adjusted cash EPS basis, earnings per share for the quarter increased 30.4% to $1.33 per share compared to $1.02 per share in last year's third quarter. In our earnings release issued this morning, we provided a detailed reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash earnings and adjusted cash earnings per share.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34.3% compared to 36.5% in the prior year's quarter. The lower rate was primarily attributable to an increase in Work Opportunity Tax Credits, or WOTC, in relation to income for the third quarter and a decrease in state tax expense. 
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.1 billion compared to $407.6 million at the end of the third quarter of last year. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 12.1% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 9.9%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 2%.
We believe that current inventory levels are perfect to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter. For the Family Dollar segment, we are extremely pleased with our clearance event, which eliminated aged and non-productive inventory. And at the end of the quarter, inventory decreased 0.3% compared to the prior year. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and feel our current inventory levels are appropriate for the fourth quarter.
Capital expenditures were $169.5 million in the third quarter of 2015 versus $94.2 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2015, we are planning for capital -- consolidated capital expenditures to range from $505 million to $525 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional few development stores, rebanner of select Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 425 stores, IT system enhancements, the construction of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center and the expansion of our Stockton, California distribution center. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $168.7 million for the third quarter versus $50.9 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million.
As discussed with Q2, this range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items. First, it includes $46 million of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of assets based on purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase price valuation of Family Dollar leases. Our guidance takes into account our actual performance for the first 3 quarters of 2015 as well as our visibility and forecast for the remainder of the year.
Our guidance includes the following assumptions. I'd like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that were rebannered from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been owned by Dollar Tree or opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months. We will continue to experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy and analysis and our outlook for same-store sales.
On October 13, we announced our 2016 plans to rebanner all of our Deals store locations so that we can place all of our focus on our 2 primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The conversion process will be similar to that we are using to convert Family Dollar stores to Dollar Trees. We expect to have this initiative completed by the end of July 2016.
Our guidance includes $12.5 million of markdown reserves, accelerated depreciation and other rebannering expense. This represents our best estimate at this time to complete the rebannering of Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores.
On November 2, just after our third quarter ended, we announced the successful completion of our required divestiture of 330 Family Dollar stores. These 330 stores represented approximately $45.5 million in annual operating income. Terms of the sales have not been disclosed and the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree's assets and liabilities has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. 
The divestiture will have 2 effects on our future income. In addition to losing the operating income associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs and setup costs related to transition services. Over a period expected to be no more than 24 months, we will be providing certain support and transition services, and expect to be reimbursed by the buyer for these direct operating costs in support services. The expected financial effect of the divestitures, which includes the loss of the operating come from the 330 stores, along with the cost of the transition services agreement, is included in our guidance. 
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 37.9% for the fourth quarter. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.8 million shares for Q4 and 223.5 million shares for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.32 billion to $5.42 billion. For fiscal 2015, we are now estimating total sales to range from $15.45 billion to $15.55 billion. Both of these estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase.
We have attached to our press release a reconciliation of the forecasted Q4 range of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash earnings per share. We are forecasting net income to range from $213.2 million to $242.2 million and adjusted cash earnings per diluted share of $2.32 to $2.51 for the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations, 180,000 people and 23 distribution centers, which based on store count is the largest of any previous retail merger. While we are very early in the integration process, I'm pleased with our progress.
We have great confidence in our ability and the opportunity and the ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.
I'll close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 31 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree had delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times, and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector.
With the addition of Family Dollar, we're a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for, great value in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us.

The category we've used are ongoing, but the priority going to the fourth quarter was just to make sure that our holiday merchandise and a lot of our discretionary categories were in place. So during the fourth quarter, you're not going to see wholesale changes in categories. We are focused purely on getting the holiday merchandise out in front of the customer, and I think we have our best opportunity this year to have a great sell on lots of the seasonal relevant items.

As far as working with our vendors going forward, our plan is to work with them to provide the best product to our customers, to sell it. And we want to drive product sales from our vendor partners. The way we go-to-market, we prefer, in many cases, to take those incentives and apply it to the cost of goods in such a way that we can share that value with the customer. We're going to make money by selling product and not by collecting funds. Now having said that, we don't expect them, the funds to go away. We expect to work with our vendor partners to use them in such a way that we can drive more cartons, more cases of their product through our doors. So I'm excited about the transition.

I can tell you that the 2 things that Kevin mentioned, there are things that we do in the normal course of business. We have doubled down on our testing, testing more times, especially on some of the categories that are more subject to compliance issues. And the idea is we don't want to fail. We want to make sure that we're providing the safe product for our customers and we double down on our testing. I think that's a onetime, not that we're not going to continue testing, but what you saw there was a little bit of a bubble based on a change in the way we are doing our testing that will smooth out over time. I have great confidence we'll be able to manage that for the long haul. The second thing was the big -- largest impact was our DC productivity was lower in third quarter. And there's a couple of things there. And they're all -- you can point to them, we can identify them, and we can fix them over time, but we are here at peak inventory times at Dollar Tree. We are receiving all the products for -- in the third quarter for our third quarter as well as our fourth quarter sales. It was a peak inventory time. And at the same time, we decided to rebanner a couple of hundred Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and we've scrambled around to buy the product and insert that into the inventory equation, receiving it in the appropriate DCs and maybe signing things a little differently, moving things around, as well as rebannering our Deals stores, which, over time, we're not going to start that until January. But just the planning and getting things positioned for that reduced our overall productivity at a time when our buildings are in absolutely maxed peak capacity. As I mentioned a couple of times, we are building a new distribution center of 1,500,000 square feet. We always build ahead of the need, but just ahead of the need in South Carolina to serve Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern Dollar Tree stores as well as expanding our Stockton distribution center over 50% for next year. So we're opening up more capacity while we're doing a lot of things in addition to what we'd originally planned in our distribution model. The result was we had some distribution productivity lag. At the same time, our outbound transportation, which is something we've talked about before, was also a little higher than it has been in the past. So all in all, things are identifiable opportunity to improve, and we will improve on those. But that was really the main components of the drag on the gross profit number in the third quarter."

What that means, though, is over time, we will have lower supply chain costs. We're looking for more productivity out of our buildings. We're looking for reducing stem miles as we're able to service both Family Dollar stores and Dollar Tree stores out of the same building. So there's a lot of opportunity to lower costs going forward and to improve our service to our stores through the combined power of this combined supply chain. Let me add one more thing, I don't think I gave you an answer on the margin for Dollar Tree going forward. Merchandise margin for Dollar Tree going forward, I don't think -- we're always in control of that. It's more about the mix than it is the items because we don't have to have anything. Say again, we changed a lot of our product every year. And our buyers go to market with the same goal that is to offer the best value for $1 at a margin that fits our margin requirement. So we're still in control of our merchandise margin at Dollar Tree. We have this 1 quarter where we've got some little noise in there, frankly. But like I said, that's identifiable. That's fixable. We're going to prove that over time. But the merchandise markup at Dollar Tree is still absolutely in our control, and I don't see any pressures to change that. Frankly, our sourcing opportunities are improved with both the size of our pencil now, as well as the economic conditions around the world, especially in China, it's really a buyers market out there now."

So that's -- a big piece of that is markdowns, which is going to affect the gross margin. But excluding that, I think we would potentially see maybe a little pressure from freight and DC cost in the quarter, but expect SG&A cost to continue to leverage. Obviously, in the quarter just ended, on basically a 2% comp, we leveraged 20 basis points, which felt like a pretty good performance with everything going on. So I think, in general, I think flattish operating margins for the Tree is a reasonable thought process. I think on the Family Dollar side, I think it's -- as I think about it, it's really around how does the holiday sell-through go. And Gary talked about the holiday merchandise and the focus on that. And that will determine, I think, how that plays out at the end of the day. We're very excited about it and have high expectations, but that will be a big piece of it. I think on Family Dollar, on the SG&A side, in general, my expectation would be to show improvement from where we were in Q3. Q3, we were up 40 basis points year-over-year. I wouldn't expect that would necessarily be up 40 basis points. But if we can get somewhere to -- closer to flat, we'd be in a better position, I think."

So we started with a cadence that was already discounted in stores somewhere between 10%, 15%, 20% off, and then we started our markdown cadence of 50%, 75%, 90%. So when you think about the units that we cleared out, the actual retail sales that we were receiving from that pile of goods was fairly static over that time. I think the good news on the clearance was when folks came in for that event, they tend to buy something else in store at our regular retails. And so I think the energy in just getting our stores cleaned up a bit, getting our end cups reclaimed, organizing a clearance event, which is no small a task to make it look like something, all served us pretty well. Maybe just to tag on to Bob's comments, there's an art and science to pricing. And the science piece is we do want to be grounded against our strategy on competition. You always have an eye on that. But what we're really focused on at Family Dollar is what's most meaningful to our customers? What is it that they need for first of the month? What's the basket set they are looking to buy on a weekly and monthly basis? And so our strategy is one that talks to what's on promotion, what's on shelf? The addition for Family Dollar of a private label program that can be polished up and really enhance opening price point and some of the assortment caps we have is a great one, not to mention the addition of -- we have a great import program, but that can also drive additional value into the store. So we really see all those arrows in our quiver as we get rooted in what do we need to be competitive, but really stay focused on what a Family Dollar customer needs to drive value into her basket on a weekly and monthly basis.

At the same time, they've seen lower gasoline prices. They've seen higher food prices. They've seen higher rent prices. They've seen higher health care costs. They've seen higher taxes. So there's still a concern. They're still under pressure. The concept at Dollar Tree and at Family Dollar of serving those people is serving us well. At Dollar Tree, we've said that we are right for all times. We have great products that people need every day, consumer products, things you got to buy to live, things that you have to have every day, and the price is only $1, alongside things that maybe discretionary that you'd like to have, but everything is $1. So through good times and difficult times, we've tended to do very well, and usually better than the market at Dollar Tree. At Family Dollar, with that low-income customer, the more we focus on what that lower-income customer needs, offering the great value, improving our in-stock, giving a better shopping experience, exceeding their expectations when they go into our stores, that better served we're going to be specially during difficult times because the -- that lower-income customer really needs us at Family Dollar and at Dollar Tree in order to make ends meet throughout the month. So that's your question. I mean, I think they are grateful that gasoline prices are lower, but not much else is in their world. And they've got to come a long way really to get their head back above water for many of them.
In closing, I just like to make one comment sort of in regard to that last question, and I'll close with this. But as a combined organization, both banners, our focus is on growing our earnings power for years to come. There's a lot of things that we're doing right now that are in regard to getting us positioned and for the future. Our decisions are always with our eyes on the horizon, but managing in real time. So what you're going to see from us is our decisions are going to be made for the longer term. And I'm not telling you it's going to take forever to make -- to bring value. I'm just saying our decisions are based on building this large entity, combining 2 great banners for the long term. But we are dedicated to managing the business in real time. And that means every month, every day, every quarter, it means every expense line on the P&L, it means looking at our customer in the eye and trying to deliver the product that they need from us and identifying the position that we hold in the market using our size and our leverage to offer the greatest values for that customer. So we're going to do both. And I think I'd like to tell you that my expectation is we're going to continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. This is the first full quarter that we've had the combined companies. I think we have 1 month in the last earnings release. But it's first full quarter that we've had, and we've shown improvement. And some slight improvement, mind you, but improvement. And I think I would tell you that I expect that to continue quarter-over-quarter. We'll show improvement. We're going to share with you all the information that we know that is pertinent to where we're going with this thing. We're not going to surprise anybody with it, but we're not going to give you information until we can absolutely get our arms around it and share with you how that looks going forward.

Total sales increased to $4.95 billion and same-store sales increased 2.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted cash EPS increased 30.4% to $1.33 per share versus $1.02 per share in the prior year's third quarter. 
Despite what continues to be viewed by many as a challenging retail environment, I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance and especially with our continued progress in integrating our recent acquisition of Family Dollar. There have been no surprises that would change our outlook on the strategic rationale. There's only increased excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead as a larger, stronger and more diversified organization.
We're only one full quarter into the integration and both our teams are aligned strategically and collaborating to deliver solid results. Accomplishments in the third quarter include another solid quarter for the Dollar Tree banner. As expected, Dollar Tree delivered a low single-digit positive sales comp, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.1%, and that was on top of a strong 5.9% increase in the third quarter last year. This was the most difficult quarterly comparison for the year.
On a 2-year stacked basis, our same-store sales accelerated from the second quarter to the third quarter just as they had done from the first quarter to the second. Sales growth in Q3 was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. 
We're making meaningful progress on integrating the Family Dollar banner. Only one full quarter in, the stores are cleaner, the shelves are better stocked, we've cleaned up old inventory and the end caps are more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving from store teams and customers has been positive.
We've developed and announced plan to rebanner our Deals locations. Our full resources and energy are being focused on our 2 primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. And on November 2, we announced the successful completion of our required divestiture of 330 Family Dollar stores. I'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was the 31st consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales.
Third quarter results continued to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand as customers are shopping with us more often, we're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers are in the store, they're buying more. Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day.
Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements. And our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandise values are better than ever.
Seasonal energy was high beginning in August with back-to-school. In addition to dominant displays of back-to-school basics, the customers responded favorably to brightly colored fashion stationery, teacher supplies, classroom essentials and lunchbox values, all priced at $1. In September, we celebrated Dollar Tree's 29th anniversary with Bonus Buys and WOW! items for our customers. Key categories included cleaning supplies, home office essentials, snacks and a broad assortment of special values from our million-dollar brands. Our stores were filled with well-known national brands and high-value private labels throughout the event.
Seasonally, our store teams transitioned efficiently from back-to-school to fall harvest and Halloween. In September, Dollar Tree became Halloween headquarters with major statements in Halloween costumes, makeup, home decor, candy and party supplies. Customers responded enthusiastically and our sell-through was improved over last year. Dollar Tree stores are now set and prepared for Christmas and fourth quarter holiday shopping season.
For the third quarter, same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both our basic consumables and discretionary products. The top-performing categories in the quarter included snacks and beverage, candy and food, household supplies and beauty and eyewear.
Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the Midwest, followed by the mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast. All 6 geographic zones produced positive same-store sales for the quarter. 
Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customer's sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores.
In the third quarter, we opened a total of 118 new Dollar Tree stores and relocated or expanded 16 stores for a total of 134 projects. Additionally, during the quarter, we rebannered 143 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores, and we're pleased with the results. We're now targeting a total of 200 conversions in this fiscal year. Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 9.9% compared to the prior year, and we ended the quarter with 5,841 Dollar Tree stores in North America. 
In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive-the-business initiatives include category expansions, customers realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in our pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products; seasonal relevance, our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. 
Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value. And being first-of-the-month ready, we place special emphasis on basic consumables, core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the third quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 135 additional stores for a total of 390 stores year-to-date. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,148 stores and growing.
We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. Construction on our newest DC and Cherokee County, South Carolina is well underway, as 1.5 million square-foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We plan to have the facility operational in Q3 of 2016.
Additionally, to support continued growth in our California markets, we're expanding our Stockton distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet, an increase of 55%. This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of our second quarter in 2016.
Again, I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in the third quarter. Our Dollar Tree segment continues to deliver sector-leading operating margins, our customer base is large and growing, and we're on schedule with our integration of Family Dollar. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization. I view the strategic rationale as more compelling than ever.
In the early days of integration, we found nothing that diminishes our vision and plans for value creation. In fact, I'm even more enthusiastic about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. Our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar are on the customer, the shopping experience and the value equation.
In the third quarter, we kicked off our red tag clearance event while continuing the review of our merchandise assortments and category flow, refining real estate plans, reviewing and refining marketing plans, and defining the table stakes in our stores. With our red tag clearance events, we identified markdown and cleared out old, slow-moving and nonproductive inventory. In doing so, we reclaimed our end caps to make way for fresh, new and seasonal merchandise, and to refresh our discretionary sections in apparel, home and seasonal. All of these are important categories as we enter the holidays. The red tag event was well executed across stores, customers responded to the additional savings, and we have cleared more than $135 million at retail in aged and non-productive inventory.
Merchandise assortments are under review. Our focus is on providing product and value that best meets our customer's needs. We're paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing, private label products and roles, while rationalizing SKUs for increased productivity and a focus on basic in stock levels.
In real estate, we're analyzing portfolio data to gain a better understanding of customer and demographic targets. This is assisting in the identification of additional stores that will have better Dollar Tree demographics for potential rebanner and identifying metrics for improving new store productivity and our return on investment.
We're extremely focused on opportunities to improve the customer experience. The table stakes' requirements are being refined, quantified and rolled out for testing. Table stakes include store standards and conditions, the customer experience, merchandise relevance and customer engagement, to name a few of the key metrics. Many of these metrics are less about investment and more about disciplines and benchmarks. Customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. For table stakes initiatives that require investments, we plan to manage with the same disciplined approach that we've used at Dollar Tree for many years, identifying and paying special attention to the customer-facing metrics with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement.
We're making great progress on delivering announced synergies. We have confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year post closing. In fact, I'll be disappointed if we don't exceed this number. As a reminder, these synergies will be driven through 4 primary avenues: Sourcing and procurement, our rebanner program for optimizing store formats, distribution and logistics, and overhead and corporate SG&A. As announced, we expect to spend approximately $300 million in onetime costs to achieve these synergies.
We still have a lot of work ahead of us. But at this stage, we're clearly on track to achieve our year 1 milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies. Plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies are well underway. Our exact match initiative to provide the lowest costs on identical items across both banners is nearly complete with expected results, no surprises. The review of similar match items continues. Positive results are growing.
We are achieving payment term parity with savings from harmonizing payment terms, auctions, RFPs and a formal bid process are well underway on expense items. Our savings continued to build toward expectations. 
During the third quarter, we rebannered an additional 143 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree, bringing our total of converted stores to 147. We are continuing to rebanner stores into November and fourth quarter, and we're now targeting a total of 200 conversions for fiscal 2015. The preliminary results are meeting expectations, and feedback from both store teams and customers has been positive. 
We're well on our way towards finalizing the supply chain roadmap and initiating the multi-banner supply chain project. With a cross organizational functional team, we're integrating our warehouse management systems, and we're making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing space needs by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners out of all facilities. This is a very large project with significant opportunity for long-term synergies. Our first pilot facilities plan to be operational in third quarter of 2016.
We continue to make progress on reducing costs through a shared services model. We're combining back-office functions to support both banners through a shared services organization. Over time, these shared services will include human resources, finance, information technology, supply chain and logistics, legal, strategic planning and internal audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization through a more cost-effective approach.
On October 13, we announced plans to rebanner all 222 Deals locations in 2016. For nearly a decade, our committed team of Deals associates has done a great job of consistently providing customers with terrific values. With the acquisition of Family Dollar, we're confident that we can provide more focus and better serve our Deals customers and markets through our primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. We will begin the conversion of Deals in January with plans to complete the rebannering of all Deals stores by the end of July 2016.
Only a few months into the integration, we've made great progress. There are some quick and easy wins and some that will take more time and a great deal of work. The timing of some will be dependent on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once, but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall benefits of business for the long term. It is a process. It will take more than a few months, but the return is worth it. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2015."

As a result of the recent acquisition, year-over-year comparisons for the next several quarters will be very complex. However, we have added tables to the press release, which we believe will be helpful in understanding the ongoing business. Total sales for the third quarter grew 136% to $4.95 billion, which includes our first full quarter of  Family Dollar sales.
Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.4% to $2.27 billion, while Family Dollar segment sales increased 6.1% to $2.67 billion. Same-store sales, on a constant currency basis, increased 2.1% versus a very strong 5.9% in the prior year's third quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket increases.
Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.7%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar Stores and newly rebannered stores are considered new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation. We were pleased with Family Dollar sales during the quarter. We saw low to mid-single-digit positive same-store sales each month during the quarter. September was the strongest month, driven by the timing of our red tag clearance event. Geographically, sales strength was relatively balanced by region.
Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $674.7 million or 93% to $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. The majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $627.8 million. A few factors to note are: During the quarter, $38.4 million was amortized to cost of goods sold related to the inventory step-up and negatively impacted gross margin results. This amount was higher than originally projected based an inventory sell-through. The total dollar amount to be amortized has not changed. 
We currently estimate an additional $11 million will be amortized to cost of goods sold in Q4. During the third quarter, we took an additional $13 million in markdowns related -- markdown-related expense in the Family Dollar banner for our red tag clearance event. We ought to take advantage of the success and traffic of the clearance event to clear additional inventory that was deemed non-go-forward.
Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34% during the third quarter compared with 34.6% in the prior year's third quarter. The 60 basis point decline, as a percent of sales, was primarily driven by a decrease in mark-on related to increased third-party product testing, increased freight and higher distribution center labor costs. 
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 23.5% during the third quarter compared with 24.3% in the comparable period -- comparable prior year period. Excluding the $38.4 million of inventory step-up amortization and the $13 million of additional clearance markdowns, gross profit margin was 24 point -- 25.4% for the quarter. The improvement of 110 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved mark-on, lower markdowns, improvement in freight and distribution costs, partially offset by higher occupancy costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 132.7% to $1.18 billion from $505.6 million in last year's third quarter. The majority of the $670.7 million increase related to $628.9 million of Family Dollar expense. 
Q3 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment, as a percent of sales, was 24.1%, consistent with the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $20.3 million of acquisition and integration-related costs, while the prior year included $14.3 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A improved to 23.3% for Q3 compared to 23.5% for the prior year's quarter. This 20 basis point improvement was driven primarily by lower incentive comp and legal fees.
SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment, as a percent of sales, was 23.5% compared to 23% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $6.8 million of integration and divestiture cost, $19.8 million of depreciation for harmonization of policies and fair market value adjustments and $19.2 million of favorable lease rate amortization. The prior year's comparable period included $30.6 million of restructuring charges and $9.7 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A increased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.8% from 21.4% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased repair and maintenance expense in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition and integrated related costs for Dollar Tree segment increased $11.1 million to $245.1 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income decreased 40 basis points to 10.8% compared to 11.2% of sales from the prior year's third quarter.
Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $23.1 million to $96.1 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income increased 70 basis points to 3.6% compared to 2.9% of sales in the prior year's comparable period. 
Nonoperating expenses for the third quarter totaled $99 million and were comprised primarily of net interest expense of $98.4 million in the quarter.
For the third quarter, the company had net income of $81.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings per share, as detailed in the press release table, was $0.49 per diluted share. On an adjusted cash EPS basis, earnings per share for the quarter increased 30.4% to $1.33 per share compared to $1.02 per share in last year's third quarter. In our earnings release issued this morning, we provided a detailed reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash earnings and adjusted cash earnings per share.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34.3% compared to 36.5% in the prior year's quarter. The lower rate was primarily attributable to an increase in Work Opportunity Tax Credits, or WOTC, in relation to income for the third quarter and a decrease in state tax expense. 
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.1 billion compared to $407.6 million at the end of the third quarter of last year. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 12.1% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 9.9%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 2%.
We believe that current inventory levels are perfect to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter. For the Family Dollar segment, we are extremely pleased with our clearance event, which eliminated aged and non-productive inventory. And at the end of the quarter, inventory decreased 0.3% compared to the prior year. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and feel our current inventory levels are appropriate for the fourth quarter.
Capital expenditures were $169.5 million in the third quarter of 2015 versus $94.2 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2015, we are planning for capital -- consolidated capital expenditures to range from $505 million to $525 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, rebanner of select Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 425 stores, IT system enhancements, the construction of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center and the expansion of our Stockton, California distribution center. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $168.7 million for the third quarter versus $50.9 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million.
As discussed with Q2, this range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for 2 items. First, it includes $46 million of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies of the 2 companies and the increase in the value of assets based on purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase price valuation of Family Dollar leases. Our guidance takes into account our actual performance for the first 3 quarters of 2015 as well as our visibility and forecast for the remainder of the year.
Our guidance includes the following assumptions. I'd like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that were rebannered from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been owned by Dollar Tree or opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months. We will continue to experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy and analysis and our outlook for same-store sales.
On October 13, we announced our 2016 plans to rebanner all of our Deals store locations so that we can place all of our focus on our 2 primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The conversion process will be similar to that we are using to convert Family Dollar stores to Dollar Trees. We expect to have this initiative completed by the end of July 2016.
Our guidance includes $12.5 million of markdown reserves, accelerated depreciation and other rebannering expense. This represents our best estimate at this time to complete the rebannering of Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores.
On November 2, just after our third quarter ended, we announced the successful completion of our required divestiture of 330 Family Dollar stores. These 330 stores represented approximately $45.5 million in annual operating income. Terms of the sales have not been disclosed and the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree's assets and liabilities has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. 
The divestiture will have 2 effects on our future income. In addition to losing the operating income associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs and setup costs related to transition services. Over a period expected to be no more than 24 months, we will be providing certain support and transition services, and expect to be reimbursed by the buyer for these direct operating costs in support services. The expected financial effect of the divestitures, which includes the loss of the operating income from the 330 stores, along with the cost of the transition services agreement, is included in our guidance. 
Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 37.9% for the fourth quarter. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.8 million shares for Q4 and 223.5 million shares for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.32 billion to $5.42 billion. For fiscal 2015, we are now estimating total sales to range from $15.45 billion to $15.55 billion. Both of these estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase.
We have attached to our press release a reconciliation of the forecasted Q4 range of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash earnings per share. We are forecasting net income to range from $213.2 million to $242.2 million and adjusted cash earnings per diluted share of $2.32 to $2.51 for the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call back over to Bob."

The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations, 180,000 people and 23 distribution centers, which based on store count is the largest of any previous retail merger. While we are very early in the integration process, I'm pleased with our progress.
We have great confidence in our ability and the opportunity and the ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year 3. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.
I'll close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 31 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree had delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times, and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector.
With the addition of Family Dollar, we're a larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for, great value in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us.

I can tell you that the 2 things that Kevin mentioned, there are things that we do in the normal course of business. We have doubled down on our testing, testing more times, especially on some of the categories that are more subject to compliance issues. And the idea is we don't want to fail. We want to make sure that we're providing the safe product for our customers and we doubled down on our testing. I think that's a onetime, not that we're not going to continue testing, but what you saw there was a little bit of a bubble based on a change in the way we are doing our testing that will smooth out over time. I have great confidence we'll be able to manage that for the long haul. The second thing was the big -- largest impact was our DC productivity was lower in third quarter. And there's a couple of things there. And they're all -- you can point to them, we can identify them, and we can fix them over time, but we are here at peak inventory times at Dollar Tree. We are receiving all the products for -- in the third quarter for our third quarter as well as our fourth quarter sales. It was a peak inventory time. And at the same time, we decided to rebanner a couple of hundred Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and we've scrambled around to buy the product and insert that into the inventory equation, receiving it in the appropriate DCs and maybe signing things a little differently, moving things around, as well as rebannering our Deals stores, which, over time, we're not going to start that until January. But just the planning and getting things positioned for that reduced our overall productivity at a time when our buildings are at absolutely maxed peak capacity. As I mentioned a couple of times, we are building a new distribution center of 1,500,000 square feet. We always build ahead of the need, but just ahead of the need in South Carolina to serve Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern Dollar Tree stores as well as expanding our Stockton distribution center over 50% for next year. So we're opening up more capacity while we're doing a lot of things in addition to what we'd originally planned in our distribution model. The result was we had some distribution productivity lag. At the same time, our outbound transportation, which is something we've talked about before, was also a little higher than it has been in the past. So all in all, things are identifiable opportunity to improve, and we will improve on those. But that was really the main components of the drag on the gross profit number in the third quarter."

Over time, we're going to be combining both banners under one supply chain with all of our buildings supplying product for all banners with the ability to supply merchandise for all banners. At the same time, we're looking at rationalizing our buildings and also, identifying where the capacity needs are going to be for the future. All of that is going on right now. What that means, though, is over time, we will have lower supply chain costs. We're looking for more productivity out of our buildings. We're looking for reducing stem miles as we're able to service both Family Dollar stores and Dollar Tree stores out of the same building. So there's a lot of opportunity to lower costs going forward and to improve our service to our stores through the combined power of this combined supply chain. Let me add one more thing, I don't think I gave you an answer on the margin for Dollar Tree going forward. Merchandise margin for Dollar Tree going forward, I don't think -- we're always in control of that. It's more about the mix than it is the items because we don't have to have anything. I'll say again, we changed a lot of our product every year. And our buyers go to market with the same goal that is to offer the best value for $1 at a margin that fits our margin requirement. So we're still in control of our merchandise margin at Dollar Tree. We have this 1 quarter where we've got some little noise in there, frankly. But like I said, that's identifiable. That's fixable. We're going to prove that over time. But the merchandise markup at Dollar Tree is still absolutely in our control, and I don't see any pressures to change that. Frankly, our sourcing opportunities are improved with both the size of our pencil now, as well as the economic conditions around the world, especially in China, it's really a buyers market out there now."

Obviously, in the quarter just ended, on basically a 2% comp, we leveraged 20 basis points, which felt like a pretty good performance with everything going on. So I think, in general, I think flattish operating margins for the Tree is a reasonable thought process. I think on the Family Dollar side, I think it's -- as I think about it, it's really around how does the holiday sell-through go. And Gary talked about the holiday merchandise and the focus on that. And that will determine, I think, how that plays out at the end of the day. We're very excited about it and have high expectations, but that will be a big piece of it. I think on Family Dollar, on the SG&A side, in general, my expectation would be to show improvement from where we were in Q3. Q3, we were up 40 basis points year-over-year. I wouldn't expect that would necessarily be up 40 basis points. But if we can get somewhere to -- closer to flat, we'd be in a better position, I think."

So when you think about the units that we cleared out, the actual retail sales that we were receiving from that pile of goods was fairly static over that time. I think the good news on the clearance was when folks came in for that event, they tend to buy something else in store at our regular retails. And so I think the energy in just getting our stores cleaned up a bit, getting our end caps reclaimed, organizing a clearance event, which is no small a task to make it look like something, all served us pretty well. Maybe just to tag on to Bob's comments, there's an art and science to pricing. And the science piece is we do want to be grounded against our strategy on competition. You always have an eye on that. But what we're really focused on at Family Dollar is what's most meaningful to our customers? What is it that they need for first of the month? What's the basket set they are looking to buy on a weekly and monthly basis? And so our strategy is one that talks to what's on promotion, what's on shelf? The addition for Family Dollar of a private label program that can be polished up and really enhance opening price point and some of the assortment caps we have is a great one, not to mention the addition of -- we have a great import program, but that can also drive additional value into the store. So we really see all those arrows in our quiver as we get rooted in what do we need to be competitive, but really stay focused on what a Family Dollar customer needs to drive value into her basket on a weekly and monthly basis. So that's our approach we're taking as we go through our category reviews and looking into '16."

Is your sense that your core customer is a bit more confident now has a little bit more money in their pocket? Or are all your gains more market share driven?"

They've seen lower gasoline prices, and that's helpful. But at the same time, it's not enough to -- that lower-income customer. It's not just enough to make a change your shopping habits. At the same time, they've seen lower gasoline prices. They've seen higher food prices. They've seen higher rent prices. They've seen higher health care costs. They've seen higher taxes. So there's still a concern. They're still under pressure. The concept at Dollar Tree and at Family Dollar of serving those people is serving us well. At Dollar Tree, we've said that we are right for all times. We have great products that people need every day, consumer products, things you got to buy to live, things that you have to have every day, and the price is only $1, alongside things that may be discretionary that you'd like to have, but everything is $1. So through good times and difficult times, we've tended to do very well, and usually better than the market at Dollar Tree. At Family Dollar, with that low-income customer, the more we focus on what that lower-income customer needs, offering the great value, improving our in-stock, giving a better shopping experience, exceeding their expectations when they go into our stores, the better served we're going to be specially during difficult times because the -- that lower-income customer really needs us at Family Dollar and at Dollar Tree in order to make ends meet throughout the month. So that's your question. I mean, I think they are grateful that gasoline prices are lower, but not much else is in their world. And they've got to come a long way really to get their head back above water for many of them.
In closing, I just like to make one comment sort of in regard to that last question, and I'll close with this. But as a combined organization, both banners, our focus is on growing our earnings power for years to come. There's a lot of things that we're doing right now that are in regard to getting us positioned and for the future. Our decisions are always with our eyes on the horizon, but managing in real time. So what you're going to see from us is our decisions are going to be made for the longer term. And I'm not telling you it's going to take forever to make -- to bring value. I'm just saying our decisions are based on building this large entity, combining 2 great banners for the long term. But we are dedicated to managing the business in real time. And that means every month, every day, every quarter, it means every expense line on the P&L, it means looking at our customer in the eye and trying to deliver the product that they need from us and identifying the position that we hold in the market using our size and our leverage to offer the greatest values for that customer. So we're going to do both. And I think I'd like to tell you that my expectation is we're going to continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. This is the first full quarter that we've had the combined companies. I think we had 1 month in the last earnings release. But it's first full quarter that we've had, and we've shown improvement. And some slight improvement, mind you, but improvement. And I think I would tell you that I expect that to continue quarter-over-quarter. We'll show improvement. We're going to share with you all the information that we know that is pertinent to where we're going with this thing. We're not going to surprise anybody with it, but we're not going to give you information until we can absolutely get our arms around it and share with you how that looks going forward. So thank you for your time. 
And before I turn it back to Randy, I just want to say thank you for your support, and hope everybody has a great Thanksgiving."
