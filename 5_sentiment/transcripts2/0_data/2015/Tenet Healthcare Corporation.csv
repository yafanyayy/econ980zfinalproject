Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Last evening, we reported Tenet's strongest quarterly EBITDA in more than 10 years.

Last evening, we reported Tenet's strongest quarterly EBITDA in more than 10 years. We generated admissions growth that was among the highest in the industry as well as strong growth in adjusted admissions. Approximately 70% of our volume improvement had little or nothing to do with health reform, demonstrating the underlying strength of our business. This non-ACA core volume growth alone is the strongest in 5 years for Tenet and came from across the spectrum, including inpatient admissions, commercial admissions, outpatient visits, surgeries and emergency department visits.
With regard to our strategy to maximize our opportunity under the ACA, the Path to Health program we launched in 2013 remained active for the second open enrollment period. Program utilizes Conifer's financial counselors, direct-mail marketing programs, hospital-based enrollment activities and community events. We held nearly 800 outreach and enrollment events, reaching tens of thousands of people in our priority markets. I'm very pleased that our daily enrollments have increased by more than 60% during this enrollment period, and we estimate that we will exceed the number of exchange enrollments that we achieved last year even though the enrollment period is shorter. This will include a combination of renewals and newly insured individuals.
We negotiated and renewed a number of contracts with key national and regional payers in the fourth quarter. At this point, we've completed contracts covering more than 90% of our expected commercial revenue for 2015. I'm pleased that we continue to be very well positioned in the network of many of the most cost-effective and popular plans offered on the exchanges. This year, we are contracted with over 83%, the lowest-cost plans on the silver level. That's an excellent number and should provide a competitive advantage to us yet again as we gain share in this important market.
We also continued to advance our efforts with new care models. We now have ACOs in more than half of our markets and have plans to develop several additional ACOs this year to further accelerate our movement from volume to value.
Our outpatient business is thriving, continues to be a great success story for Tenet. Visits to our outpatient centers increased significantly during the quarter and almost all of the growth was organic. We had a growing network of 210 facilities at the end of the year, up from 183 at the end of 2013. We also acquired 2 new surgery centers and opened 2 med post-surg care centers just in the first 2 months of this year.
Our outpatient centers continue to attract consumers who want quality care at a lower cost as well as potential partners looking to leverage our development and operational capabilities. As health care delivery evolves and consumers shop for more affordable solutions, Tenet is strategically positioned to capture the benefits of this fundamental shift. We see many opportunities to continue this growth, both within and apart from our acute care hospital markets.
Conifer also reported an outstanding quarter with a 24% increase in revenues. Its annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $1.3 billion. Conifer generated $64 million in EBITDA during the quarter, which is a 78% increase over the fourth quarter of last year and reflects consolidation of the Vanguard business and the continuing increase in margin on our business with Catholic Health Initiatives. On an annualized basis, Conifer is delivering roughly $0.25 billion in EBITDA.
In January, Catholic Health Initiatives and Conifer announced an extension and expansion of their partnership to 2032. Conifer will provide patient access, revenue integrity and patient financial services to more than 90 CHI hospitals. This is a significant milestone in the Conifer-CHI relationship, which underscores Conifer's industry-leading capabilities and the meaningful value it brings to innovative systems like CHI. CHI has more than delivered upon its initial commitment to our Conifer partnership and now owns 24% of Conifer as was anticipated when it formed in the relationship in 2012.
Conifer also continues to gain recognition as a leader in the industry. In December, the Black Book 2014 User Survey ranked Conifer #1 both revenue cycle and value-based care services.
Slide 3 summarizes some of the actions we are taking to optimize our hospital portfolio. As we've shared with you in the past, we are committed to building leadership positions in the markets in which we compete. Our objective is to be either #1 or #2 and we currently hold these positions in 21 of our 31 markets. 
Increasingly, we see partnerships with an attractive vehicle to improve our position where we already have a presence or expand our footprint to new geographies. Partnerships can have all the strategic benefits of an acquisition but with a much lower capital commitment. 
In December, we signed a Letter of Intent to create a new joint venture with Baptist Health System in Birmingham, Alabama. The partnership will build upon the strength of both Baptist and our Brookwood Medical Center. It will our enhance our collective ability to provide higher-quality, lower-cost, more convenient care to a larger geographic area. 
The combined network will be a competitive market-leading system with 5 hospitals, 77 primary and specialty care locations and 1,500 affiliated physicians. It will also give us the capability to pursue new care and payment models. We see this as a win for all parties with a wide array of benefits for the community, our patients, our new partner, our employees and our shareholders.
We now have plans to expand our presence in Arizona through a joint venture with Dignity Health and Ascension, which are both highly respected nonprofit health systems. Under the terms of the JV, Tenet will become the majority partner with management responsibility for all operations with the 3-hospital Carondelet Health Network in Tucson. 
This transaction will connect Carondelet to a much larger statewide health care system, including the growing accountable care organization that we currently have with Dignity. From our perspective, this is a unique opportunity to extend our presence with beyond Phoenix into the attractive Tucson market, and it's consistent with our strategy to create new innovative models for patient care.
Also in the last few weeks, you may have seen media reports indicating Tenet's exploration strategic option for our hospitals in Atlanta and North Carolina. We are actively looking at various attractive alternatives and are pleased with the level of interest.
Finally, we terminated our discussions to acquire 5 hospitals in Connecticut in partnership with Health System. While this was a disappointing outcome after more than 2 years of hard work, conditions proposed by state regulators would have impeded our ability to restore the hospital's long-term operational and financial stability. Moreover, we are unable to achieve any level of certainty regarding either the timing or outcome of the regulatory process had we continued to pursue the acquisition.
In summary, we're making great progress on a number of fronts. We remain focused on the core strategies that are driving performance, implementing value-based health care solutions, building leading positions in our markets, investing in faster-growing higher-margin businesses and innovating with new care models. 
Our results in the fourth quarter and for all of 2014 provide tangible evidence of our progress. We're entering 2015 on a solid foundation with projected top line and bottom line improvements and are optimistic about the opportunities ahead. 
With that overview, let me turn it to Dan Cancelmi for more color on the quarter and our outlook for the year. Dan?"
107911,283891422,768468,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2015",2015-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 to take a closer look at the underlying drivers of our earnings growth.We generated $646 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which was at the top of our outlook and compa",1715,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 to take a closer look at the underlying drivers of our earnings growth.
We generated $646 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which was at the top of our outlook and compares favorably to $444 million last year. Slide 4 shows that even after adjusting for a few large items that had a net positive impact on the quarter, we drove normalized EBITDA growth of $86 million or 19%. 
To compute our core EBITDA growth for the quarter, we also backed out the benefits that we generated from Vanguard synergies and the Affordable Care Act. These items are very real and the list we captured from them is expected to be sustained. However, if we exclude them, as well as the related Medicare cuts, we still drove an impressive core EBITDA growth of 9%. 
The quarter capped off a strong year for us. We grew EBITDA by $176 million in 2014 on a pro forma basis or an increase of 10%.
Slide 5 shows that if we make the same type of adjustments, we increased normalized EBITDA by 14% and generated core EBITDA growth of 6% in 2014.
Slide 6 summarizes some of the highlights of the quarter. We generated strong volume growth, achieving a 4% increase in same-hospital admissions and a 4.5% increase in adjusted admissions. About 70% of the increase in our same-hospital adjusted admissions was core growth and unrelated to the growth we're generating from the ACA. Our volume trends were broad-based as we drove increases in adjusted admissions in 12 of the 14 states in which we operate hospitals. 
We also drove strong volume growth in our commercial business, which is our most profitable. Our commercial admissions trends in 2014 was the strongest we've generated in more than a decade.
Growth in outpatient visits remained very strong, increasing 9.6%. 92% of this outpatient growth was organic. Completing the volume picture, we grew surgeries by 7.5% and increased emergency department visits by 7.2%. In summary, we're very pleased with the strength of the volume growth we delivered.
The combination of strong volumes, the improved commercial pricing and the California Provider Fee has resulted in strong revenue growth in the quarter. We generated a $583 million increase in net operating revenues after bad debts, which is an increase of 15%. 
Excluding the revenue contribution from the California Provider Fees related to prior quarters, we increased patient revenue net of bad debts per adjusted admission by 4.9%. We also delivered very favorable growth in commercial Managed Care revenue, with revenue per commercial admission increasing 6.7%. The commercial pricing on the outpatient side was more modest, increasing by 0.9% per visit. This reflects the impact of the growth we are driving in new outpatient access points, including Urgent Care Centers. 
Bad debt expense declined as a percentage of revenue by 80 basis points to 7.4% in the quarter. The improved bad debt performance is primarily due to a $27 million decline in same-hospital uninsured and charity revenues as a result of the expansion of insurance coverage under the ACA. For the full year 2014, bad debt expense declined 150 basis points on a pro forma basis to 7.3% of revenue, down from 8.8% of revenue in 2013.
In 2015, the midpoint of our guidance for bad debt expense anticipates an additional 30 basis points decline, with a range of 6.75% to 7.25% as a result of the benefits we anticipate capturing from the ACA.
Selected operating expenses per adjusted admission increased by 3.8% in the quarter on a same-hospital basis. The increase was 2.6% excluding physician employment growth. On a full year pro forma basis, our cost only increased 1.4%. In 2015, we expect to do a little better, with growth in selected operating expenses per adjusted admission of 0% to 1%.
Turning to cash flows. Adjusted cash flows from operations in the quarter was $279 million. Net of capital expenditures of $199 million, adjusted free cash flow was $80 million. As we noted in our earnings release, our cash flows have been impacted by the fact that California and Texas owed us about $300 million in aggregate as of December 31 related to the California Provider Fee program, Texas DSH and Texas uncompensated care 1115 Waiver revenues. 
Cash flows were also negatively impacted by temporary buildup in receivables at certain hospitals acquired from Vanguard due to our implementation of a new billing system at these hospitals. While this slowed down cash flows in the second half of the year by about $80 million, the system change will enhance the future performance of these hospitals. The temporary buildup in the receivables caused by the system conversion has already started to come down this year. Likewise, we anticipate the $300 million of receivables from the California and Texas Medicaid programs to begin declining in 2015.
Turning to our services business. Conifer had another great quarter, driving a 78% increase in EBITDA to $64 million. Conifer's revenues increased by 24% to $327 million or an annualized run rate of about $1.3 billion. Keep in mind that the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally strong for Conifer. We anticipate Conifer's EBITDA to be about $240 million in 2015.
In early January, we provided our 2015 outlook for adjusted EBITDA. Slide 7 summarizes the key assumptions included in our outlook. I'll simply note in terms of volumes that the 2015 growth rates are assumed to moderate compared to our 2014 growth. Our outlook assumes admissions growth of 1.5% to 2.5% and adjusted admissions growth of 2.5% to 3.5%.
We expect to grow our exchange volumes 60% to 80% over our 2014 volumes. Given the way we grew exchange volumes throughout 2014, the growth we anticipate this year annualizes the exchange volumes we generated in the fourth quarter plus an additional growth from uninsured individuals who signed up during the recent open enrollment period.
In terms of pricing, we are projecting an increase in total net revenues per adjusted admission of 1% to 2%. We anticipate mid-single-digit percentage growth from improved terms in our commercial Managed Care contracts, which will be partially offset by anticipated growth in government volumes and our Urgent Care business, both of which have lower reimbursement levels. 
We expect our bad debt ratio to be in the range of 6.75% to 7.25% compared to 7.3% in 2014. Here, we are anticipating the uninsured and underinsured book of business will continue to gain incremental coverage under the ACA.
On the cost side, we continue to expect growth in controllable operating expenses per adjusted admission on a same-hospital basis to be in the 0% to 1% range this year. On a total company basis, including cost growth that is not directly tied to volume growth such as the growth at Conifer which is related to new business, we expect expenses per adjusted admission to increase 1.5% to 2.5%.
We expect to achieve EBITDA growth in 2015 of approximately 8% as shown on Slide 8. This includes absorbing about $50 million associated with the decline in HIT incentives, net of costs. This outlook includes normalized EBITDA growth of 10% and core growth of about 6%, which excludes the contributions from incremental Vanguard synergies and the ACA.
Finally, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $475 million to $525 million in the first quarter of this year. I want to mention a few things to consider as you think about our quarterly progression of EBITDA in 2015.
Volumes and bad debt expense continue to be influenced by a shift to higher deductible health plans, which may push more volumes into the fourth quarter and could cause bad debt expense to move higher in the first quarter due to the reset of deductibles. In addition, it may take some time for the newly insured to seek inpatient and outpatient services, so the volume benefit from increased exchange enrollment will likely be weighted towards the second half of the year.
As for the California Provider Fee program, for the first time in a while, revenue should be fairly predictable each quarter this year at a little more than $40 million and closer to the $170 million for the full year. 
The synergies that we are achieving from Vanguard as well as other cost initiatives should continue to ramp throughout the year. And HIT incentives will only be about $5 million in the first quarter compared to $65 million for the full year.
Turning to Slide 9. In summary, we are driving strong growth across all of our major business lines. We are well advanced in our transformation from a regional operator of hospitals to a diversified health care services company with broad geographic reach. 
We achieved strong results in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and we've implemented business strategies that are building solid momentum and driving year-over-year growth. These growth drivers are expected to be supplemented by incremental contributions we will realize from Vanguard synergies and the ACA, all of which can be expected to generate attractive growth going forward.
Finally, before we open the call for questions, I want to share with you that Tom Rice has decided to retire and spend more time with his family. Tom has led Tenet's Investor Relations effort for nearly 12 years, during which time he has worked tirelessly to be responsive to the needs of the investment community. We're very grateful to Tom for his hard work and dedication and for providing continuity over a period of significant change for both our company and the industry. 
As part of this news, we are also pleased to announce the promotion of Brendan Strong into the role of Vice President of Investor Relations. Brendan joined Tenet in September in our northeast region where he has been working on strategic and operational initiatives. Many of you might remember him from his time working in the equity research departments of Lehman Brothers and Barclays where he focused on the health care sector. Tom plans to retire at the end of March, and he and Brendan will be working closely over the next month to ensure a seamless transition.

And so the Connecticut deal really was about our partnership with Haven and about putting together a statewide network in Connecticut, some of which may have lapped over borders but would have been more, for example, Western Massachusetts where we're not currently a provider.

We did -- you're right. We'll have a little bit of a lift from the fact that Detroit will have a full year from Medicaid expansion in Michigan.

Last evening, we reported Tenet's strongest quarterly EBITDA in more than 10 years. We generated admissions growth that was among the highest in the industry as well as strong growth in adjusted admissions. Approximately 70% of our volume improvement had little or nothing to do with health reform, demonstrating the underlying strength of our business. This non-ACA core volume growth alone is the strongest in 5 years for Tenet and came from across the spectrum, including inpatient admissions, commercial admissions, outpatient visits, surgeries and emergency department visits.
With regard to our strategy to maximize our opportunity under the ACA, the Path to Health program we launched in 2013 remained active for the second open enrollment period. Program utilizes Conifer's financial counselors, direct-mail marketing programs, hospital-based enrollment activities and community events. We held nearly 800 outreach and enrollment events, reaching tens of thousands of people in our priority markets. I'm very pleased that our daily enrollments have increased by more than 60% during this enrollment period, and we estimate that we will exceed the number of exchange enrollments that we achieved last year even though the enrollment period is shorter. This will include a combination of renewals and newly insured individuals.
We negotiated and renewed a number of contracts with key national and regional payers in the fourth quarter. At this point, we've completed contracts covering more than 90% of our expected commercial revenue for 2015. I'm pleased that we continue to be very well positioned in the network of many of the most cost-effective and popular plans offered on the exchanges. This year, we are contracted with over 83% of the lowest-cost plans on the silver level. That's an excellent number and should provide a competitive advantage to us yet again as we gain share in this important new market.
We also continued to advance our effort with new care models. We now have ACOs in more than half of our markets and have plans to develop several additional ACOs this year to further accelerate our movement from volume to value.
Our outpatient business is thriving, continues to be a great success story for Tenet. Visits to our outpatient centers increased significantly during the quarter and almost all of the growth was organic. We had a growing network of 210 facilities at the end of the year, up from 183 at the end of 2013. We also acquired 2 new surgery centers and opened 2 med post-surg care centers just in the first 2 months of this year.
Our outpatient centers continue to attract consumers who want quality care at a lower cost as well as potential partners looking to leverage our development and operational capabilities. As health care delivery evolves and consumers shop for more affordable solutions, Tenet is strategically positioned to capture the benefits of this fundamental shift. We see many opportunities to continue this growth, both within and apart from our acute care hospital markets.
Conifer also reported an outstanding quarter with a 24% increase in revenues. Its annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $1.3 billion. Conifer generated $64 million in EBITDA during the quarter, which is a 78% increase over the fourth quarter of last year and reflects consolidation of the Vanguard business and the continuing increase in margin on our business with Catholic Health Initiatives. On an annualized basis, Conifer is delivering roughly $0.25 billion in EBITDA.
In January, Catholic Health Initiatives and Conifer announced an extension and expansion of their partnership to 2032. Conifer will provide patient access, revenue integrity and patient financial services to more than 90 CHI hospitals. This is a significant milestone in the Conifer-CHI relationship, which underscores Conifer's industry-leading capabilities and the meaningful value it brings to innovative systems like CHI. CHI has more than delivered upon its initial commitment to our Conifer partnership and now owns 24% of Conifer, as was anticipated when we formed the relationship in 2012.
Conifer also continues to gain recognition as a leader in the industry. In December, the Black Book 2014 user survey ranked Conifer #1 in both revenue cycle and value-based care services.
Slide 3 summarizes some of the actions we are taking to optimize our hospital portfolio. As we've shared with you in the past, we are committed to building leadership positions in the markets in which we compete. Our objective is to be either #1 or #2, and we currently hold these positions in 21 of our 31 markets.
Increasingly, we see partnerships with an attractive vehicle to improve our position where we already have a presence or expand our footprint to new geographies. Partnerships can have all the strategic benefits of an acquisition but with a much lower capital commitment.
In December, we signed a letter of intent to create a new joint venture with Baptist Health System in Birmingham, Alabama. The partnership will build upon the strength of both Baptist and our Brookwood Medical Center. It will enhance our collective ability to provide higher-quality, lower-cost, more convenient care to a larger geographic area.
The combined network will be a competitive market-leading system with 5 hospitals, 77 primary and specialty care locations and 1,500 affiliated physicians. It will also give us the capability to pursue new care and payment models. We see this as a win for all parties with a wide array of benefits for the community, our patients, our new partner, our employees and our shareholders.
We now have plans to expand our presence in Arizona through a joint venture with Dignity Health and Ascension, which are both highly respected nonprofit health systems. Under the terms of the JV, Tenet will become the majority partner with management responsibility for all operations of the 3-hospital Carondelet Health Network in Tucson.
This transaction will connect Carondelet to a much larger state-wide health care system, including the growing accountable care organization that we currently have with Dignity. From our perspective, this is a unique opportunity to extend our presence beyond Phoenix into the attractive Tucson market, and it's consistent with our strategy to create new innovative models for patient care.
Also in the last few weeks, you may have seen media reports indicating Tenet's exploration of strategic options for our hospitals in Atlanta and North Carolina. We are actively looking at various attractive alternatives and are pleased with the level of interest.
Finally, we terminated our discussions to acquire 5 hospitals in Connecticut in partnership with Yale New Haven Health System. While this was a disappointing outcome after more than 2 years of hard work, conditions proposed by state regulators would have impeded our ability to restore the hospital's long-term operational and financial stability. Moreover, we are unable to achieve any level of certainty regarding either the timing or outcome of the regulatory process if we had continued to pursue the acquisition.
In summary, we're making great progress on a number of fronts. We remain focused on the core strategies that are driving performance, implementing value-based health care solutions, building leading  positions in our markets, investing in faster-growing, higher-margin businesses and innovating with new care models.
Our results in the fourth quarter and for all of 2014 provide tangible evidence of our progress. We are entering 2015 on a solid foundation with projected top line and bottom line improvements and are optimistic about the opportunities ahead.
With that overview, let me turn it to Dan Cancelmi for more color on the quarter and our outlook for the year. Dan?"
107911,283891422,768733,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2015",2015-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 to take a closer look at the underlying drivers of our earnings growth.We generated $646 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which was at the top of our outlook and compa",1722,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 to take a closer look at the underlying drivers of our earnings growth.
We generated $646 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which was at the top of our outlook and compares favorably to $444 million last year. Slide 4 shows that even after adjusting for a few large items that had a net positive impact on the quarter, we drove normalized EBITDA growth of $86 million or 19%.
To compute our core EBITDA growth for the quarter, we also backed out the benefits that we generated from Vanguard synergies and the Affordable Care Act. These items are very real, and the lift we captured from them is expected to be sustained. However, if we exclude them as well as the related Medicare cuts, we still drove an impressive core EBITDA growth of 9%.
The quarter capped off a strong year for us. We grew EBITDA by $176 million in 2014 on a pro forma basis or an increase of 10%.
Slide 5 shows that if we make the same type of adjustments, we increased normalized EBITDA by 14% and generated core EBITDA growth of 6% in 2014.
Slide 6 summarizes some of the highlights of the quarter. We generated strong volume growth, achieving a 4% increase in same-hospital admissions and a 4.5% increase in adjusted admissions. About 70% of the increase in our same-hospital adjusted admissions was core growth and unrelated to the growth we're generating from the ACA. Our volume trends were broad based, as we drove increases in adjusted admissions in 12 of the 14 states in which we operate hospitals.
We also drove strong volume growth in our commercial business, which is our most profitable. Our commercial admissions trends in 2014 were the strongest we've generated in more than a decade.
Growth in outpatient visits remained very strong, increasing 9.6%. 92% of this outpatient growth was organic. Completing the volume picture, we grew surgeries by 7.5% and increased emergency department visits by 7.2%. In summary, we're very pleased with the strength of the volume growth we delivered.
The combination of strong volumes, the improved commercial pricing and the California Provider Fees resulted in strong revenue growth in the quarter. We generated a $583 million increase in net operating revenues after bad debts, which is an increase of 15%.
Excluding the revenue contribution from the California Provider Fees related to prior quarters, we increased patient revenue net of bad debts per adjusted admission by 4.9%. We also delivered very favorable growth in commercial managed care revenue, with revenue per commercial admission increasing 6.7%. The commercial pricing on the outpatient side was more modest, increasing by 0.9% per visit. This reflects the impact of the growth we are driving in new outpatient access points, including Urgent Care Centers. 
Bad debt expense declined as a percentage of revenue by 80 basis points to 7.4% in the quarter. The improved bad debt performance is primarily due to a $27 million decline in same-hospital uninsured and charity revenues as a result of the expansion of insurance coverage under the ACA. For the full year 2014, bad debt expense declined 150 basis points on a pro forma basis to 7.3% of revenue, down from 8.8% of revenue in 2013.
In 2015, the midpoint of our guidance for bad debt expense anticipates an additional 30 basis points decline, with a range of 6.75% to 7.25% as a result of the benefits we anticipate capturing from the ACA.
Selected operating expenses per adjusted admission increased by 3.8% in the quarter on a same-hospital basis. The increase was 2.6% excluding physician employment growth. On a full year pro forma basis, our cost only increased 1.4%. In 2015, we expect to do a little better, with growth in selected operating expenses per adjusted admission of 0% to 1%.
Turning to cash flows. Adjusted cash flows from operations in the quarter was $279 million. Net of capital expenditures of $199 million, adjusted free cash flow was $80 million. As we noted in our earnings release, our cash flows have been impacted by the fact that California and Texas owed us about $300 million in aggregate as of December 31 related to the California Provider Fee program, Texas DSH and Texas uncompensated care 1115 Waiver revenues.
Cash flows were also negatively impacted by a temporary buildup in receivables at certain hospitals acquired from Vanguard due to our implementation of a new billing system at these hospitals. While this slowed down cash flows in the second half of the year by about $80 million, the system change will enhance the future performance of these hospitals. The temporary buildup in the receivables caused by the system conversion has already started to come down this year. Likewise, we anticipate the $300 million of receivables from the California and Texas Medicaid programs to begin declining in 2015.
Turning to our services business. Conifer had another great quarter, driving a 78% increase in EBITDA to $64 million. Conifer's revenues increased by 24% to $327 million or an annualized run rate of about $1.3 billion. Keep in mind that the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally strong for Conifer. We anticipate Conifer's EBITDA to be about $240 million in 2015.
In early January, we provided our 2015 outlook for adjusted EBITDA. Slide 7 summarizes the key assumptions included in our outlook. I'll simply note in terms of volumes that the 2015 growth rates are assumed to moderate compared to our 2014 growth. Our outlook assumes admissions growth of 1.5% to 2.5% and adjusted admissions growth of 2.5% to 3.5%.
We expect to grow our exchange volumes 60% to 80% over our 2014 volumes. Given the way we grew exchange volumes throughout 2014, the growth we anticipate this year annualizes the exchange volumes we generated in the fourth quarter plus an additional growth from uninsured individuals who signed up during the recent open enrollment period.
In terms of pricing, we are projecting an increase in total net revenues per adjusted admission of 1% to 2%. We anticipate mid-single-digit percentage growth from improved terms in our commercial managed care contracts, which will be partially offset by anticipated growth in government volumes and our urgent care business, both of which have lower reimbursement levels.
We expect our bad debt ratio to be in the range of 6.75% to 7.25% compared to 7.3% in 2014. Here, we are anticipating the uninsured and underinsured book of business will continue to gain incremental coverage under the ACA.
On the cost side, we continue to expect growth in controllable operating expenses per adjusted admission on a same-hospital basis to be in the 0% to 1% range this year. On a total company basis, including cost growth that is not directly tied to volume growth, such as the growth of volume -- such as the growth at Conifer, which is related to new business, we expect expenses per adjusted admission to increase 1.5% to 2.5%.
We expect to achieve EBITDA growth in 2015 of approximately 8% as shown on Slide 8. This includes absorbing about $50 million associated with the decline in HIT incentives, net of costs. This outlook includes normalized EBITDA growth of 10% and core growth of about 6%, which excludes the contributions from incremental Vanguard synergies and the ACA.
Finally, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $475 million to $525 million in the first quarter of this year.
I want to mention a few things to consider as you think about our quarterly progression of EBITDA in 2015.
Volumes and bad debt expense continue to be influenced by a shift to higher deductible health plans, which may push more volumes into the fourth quarter and could cause bad debt expense to move higher in the first quarter due to the reset of deductibles. In addition, it may take some time for the newly insured to seek inpatient and outpatient services, so the volume benefit from increased exchange enrollment will likely be weighted toward the second half of the year.
As for the California Provider Fee program, for the first time in a while, revenue should be fairly predictable each quarter this year at a little more than $40 million and closer to $170 million for the full year.
The synergies that we are achieving from Vanguard as well as other cost initiatives should continue to ramp throughout the year. And HIT incentives will only be about $5 million in the first quarter compared to $65 million for the full year.
Turning to Slide 9. In summary, we are driving strong growth across all of our major business lines. We are well advanced in our transformation from a regional operator of hospitals to a diversified health care services company with broad geographic reach.
We achieved strong results in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and we've implemented business strategies that are building solid momentum and driving year-over-year growth. These growth drivers are expected to be supplemented by incremental contributions we will realize from Vanguard synergies and the ACA, all of which can be expected to generate attractive growth going forward.
Finally, before we open the call for questions, I want to share with you that Tom Rice has decided to retire and spend more time with his family. Tom has led Tenet's investor relations effort for nearly 12 years, during which time he has worked tirelessly to be responsive to the needs of the investment community. We're very grateful to Tom for his hard work and dedication and for providing continuity over a period of significant change for both our company and the industry.
As part of this news, we are also pleased to announce the promotion of Brendan Strong into the role of Vice President of Investor Relations. Brendan joined Tenet in September in our Northeast region where he's been working on strategic and operational initiatives. Many of you might remember him from his time working in the equity research departments of Lehman Brothers and Barclays where he focused on the health care sector. Tom plans to retire at the end of March, and he and Brendan will be working closely over the next month to ensure a seamless transition.

So the -- something like the Birmingham example that I gave you, those hospitals were not available for purchase. This was -- a joint venture was the only structure that they would have contemplated. So Keith, why don't you just talk just a little more generally about this? Because I think it's an emerging theme.

I think we're well positioned for the future. So when you think about that kind of concept, sometimes who you'd want to partner with could be a high-quality system that you can't acquire. So the other option for us is to do joint ventures with those systems. These are things that are not in banker books, they're not on the market.

And so it gives us sort of the optionality when we're [ph] in market. And there the smaller [ph] decision is you do a joint venture to get into a larger position or you have to either be the best or you can acquire. The issue is if someone doesn't want to be acquired and they want to stay in the business, then you do the joint venture. And most of the joint ventures with the not-for-profit systems, over time, we've allowed them, if they prefer to move into a non-sort-of-active role and more into a foundation role in the market, they can.

We did see a sequential growth from exchange -- on the exchange business. Obviously, we believe we're very well positioned from a contracting perspective. 80-plus percent of our hospitals are -- have contracts with the 2 most affordable plans in our markets. So we think we're an attractive option for patients who have this coverage. In terms of the sequential growth throughout the year, obviously, the first quarter was a slow start due to the enrollment issues. But we built the exchange business as we move throughout the year. And when you think about Q4 maybe versus Q3, some of that have to do with people meeting their deductibles and having a little bit more feeling [ph] as if they -- in utilizing the service systems, they maybe then have a deductible burn. That's a trend at least we've seen with our employee population related to some of our health plans. So we are obviously happy to be able to generate incremental business, and we think we can build on that as we go through this year."

We just have 2 hospitals in Philadelphia, and 1 of them is a children's hospital. And generally speaking, most of the children's population was previously covered. So it's certainly less than $10 million, probably $5 million or less. And -- but when we think globally about '15 in terms of the incremental benefits from health care reform, a large component of that, we believe, is going to be attributable to exchange growth as we move through the year, with a somewhat smaller -- a smaller component related to the Medicaid book of business. We did -- I think you're right, we'll have a little bit of a lift from the fact that Detroit will have a full year from Medicaid expansion in Michigan. But what we're seeing so far in '15 is Medicaid business continues to grow, and we anticipate Medicaid volumes to build in 2015 even in our -- the 5 expansion states. So if I would -- if you want to think about it from a modeling perspective, maybe roughly 3/4 or more may be weighted towards exchange and then maybe the other 25% or so related to incremental Medicaid business we've been capturing."

So it's sort of the transition or migration from one form of coverage to another type of coverage. When we think about this year, we anticipate being able to grow that book of business from a -- we're well positioned from a contracting perspective, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, based on the fact that we have over 90% of our revenues already under contract in 2015.

Last evening, we reported Tenet's strongest quarterly EBITDA in more than 10 years. We generated admissions growth that was among the highest in the industry as well as strong growth in adjusted admissions. Approximately 70% of our volume improvement had little or nothing to do with health reform, demonstrating the underlying strength of our business. This non-ACA core volume growth alone was the strongest in 5 years for Tenet and came from across the spectrum, including inpatient admissions, commercial admissions, outpatient visits, surgeries and emergency department visits.
With regard to our strategy to maximize our opportunity under the ACA, the Path to Health program we launched in 2013 remained active for the second open enrollment period. Program utilizes Conifer's financial counselors, direct-mail marketing programs, hospital-based enrollment activities and community events. We held nearly 800 outreach and enrollment events, reaching tens of thousands of people in our priority markets. I'm very pleased that our daily enrollments have increased by more than 60% during this enrollment period, and we estimate that we will exceed the number of exchange enrollments that we achieved last year even though the enrollment period is shorter. This will include a combination of renewals and newly insured individuals.
We negotiated and renewed a number of contracts with key national and regional payers in the fourth quarter. At this point, we've completed contracts covering more than 90% of our expected commercial revenue for 2015. I'm pleased that we continue to be very well positioned in the networks of many of the most cost-effective and popular plans offered on the exchanges. This year, we are contracted with over 83% of the lowest-cost plans on the silver level. That's an excellent number and should provide a competitive advantage to us yet again as we gain share in this important new market.
We also continued to advance our effort with new care models. We now have ACOs in more than half of our markets and have plans to develop several additional ACOs this year to further accelerate our movement from volume to value.
Our outpatient business is thriving, continues to be a great success story for Tenet. Visits to our outpatient centers increased significantly during the quarter and almost all of the growth was organic. We had a growing network of 210 facilities at the end of the year, up from 183 at the end of 2013. We also acquired 2 new surgery centers and opened 2 MedPost Urgent Care centers just in the first 2 months of this year.
Our outpatient centers continue to attract consumers who want quality care at a lower cost as well as potential partners looking to leverage our development and operational capabilities. As health care delivery evolves and consumers shop for more affordable solutions, Tenet is strategically positioned to capture the benefits of this fundamental shift. We see many opportunities to continue this growth, both within and apart from our acute care hospital markets.
Conifer also reported an outstanding quarter with a 24% increase in revenues. Its annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $1.3 billion. Conifer generated $64 million in EBITDA during the quarter, which is a 78% increase over the fourth quarter of last year and reflects consolidation of the Vanguard business and the continuing increase in margin on our business with Catholic Health Initiatives. On an annualized basis, Conifer is delivering roughly $0.25 billion in EBITDA.
In January, Catholic Health Initiatives and Conifer announced an extension and expansion of their partnership to 2032. Conifer will provide patient access, revenue integrity and patient financial services to more than 90 CHI hospitals. This is a significant milestone in the Conifer-CHI relationship, which underscores Conifer's industry-leading capabilities and the meaningful value it brings to innovative systems like CHI. CHI has more than delivered upon its initial commitment to our Conifer partnership and now owns 24% of Conifer, as was anticipated when we formed the relationship in 2012.
Conifer also continues to gain recognition as a leader in the industry. In December, the Black Book 2014 user survey ranked Conifer #1 in both revenue cycle and value-based care services.
Slide 3 summarizes some of the actions we are taking to optimize our hospital portfolio. As we've shared with you in the past, we are committed to building leadership positions in the markets in which we compete. Our objective is to be either #1 or #2, and we currently hold these positions in 21 of our 31 markets.
Increasingly, we see partnerships with an attractive vehicle to improve our position where we already have a presence or expand our footprint to new geographies. Partnerships can have all the strategic benefits of an acquisition but with a much lower capital commitment.
In December, we signed a letter of intent to create a new joint venture with Baptist Health System in Birmingham, Alabama. The partnership will build upon the strength of both Baptist and our Brookwood Medical Center. It will enhance our collective ability to provide higher-quality, lower-cost, more convenient care to a larger geographic area.
The combined network will be a competitive market-leading system with 5 hospitals, 77 primary and specialty care locations and 1,500 affiliated physicians. It will also give us the capability to pursue new care and payment models. We see this as a win for all parties with a wide array of benefits for the community, our patients, our new partner, our employees and our shareholders.
We announced plans to expand our presence in Arizona through a joint venture with Dignity Health and Ascension, which are both highly respected nonprofit health systems. Under the terms of the JV, Tenet will become the majority partner with management responsibility for all operations of the 3-hospital Carondelet Health Network in Tucson.
This transaction will connect Carondelet to a much larger state-wide health care system, including the growing accountable care organization that we currently have with Dignity. From our perspective, this is a unique opportunity to extend our presence beyond Phoenix into the attractive Tucson market, and it's consistent with our strategy to create new innovative models for patient care.
Also in the last few weeks, you may have seen media reports indicating Tenet's exploration of strategic options for our hospitals in Atlanta and North Carolina. We are actively looking at various attractive alternatives and are pleased with the level of interest.
Finally, we terminated our discussions to acquire 5 hospitals in Connecticut in partnership with Yale New Haven Health System. While this was a disappointing outcome after more than 2 years of hard work, conditions proposed by state regulators would have impeded our ability to restore the hospital's long-term operational and financial stability. Moreover, we were unable to achieve any level of certainty regarding either the timing or outcome of the regulatory process if we had continued to pursue the acquisition.
In summary, we're making great progress on a number of fronts. We remain focused on the core strategies that are driving performance, implementing value-based health care solutions, building leading  positions in our markets, investing in faster-growing, higher-margin businesses and innovating with new care models.
Our results in the fourth quarter and for all of 2014 provide tangible evidence of our progress. We are entering 2015 on a solid foundation with projected top line and bottom line improvements and are optimistic about the opportunities ahead.
With that overview, let me turn it to Dan Cancelmi for more color on the quarter and our outlook for the year. Dan?"

Let's turn to Slide 4 to take a closer look at the underlying drivers of our earnings growth.We generated $646 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which was at the top of our outlook and compa",1722,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4 to take a closer look at the underlying drivers of our earnings growth.
We generated $646 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which was at the top of our outlook and compares favorably to $444 million last year. Slide 4 shows that even after adjusting for a few large items that had a net positive impact on the quarter, we drove normalized EBITDA growth of $86 million or 19%.
To compute our core EBITDA growth for the quarter, we also backed out the benefits that we generated from Vanguard synergies and the Affordable Care Act. These items are very real, and the lift we captured from them is expected to be sustained. However, if we exclude them as well as the related Medicare cuts, we still drove an impressive core EBITDA growth of 9%.
The quarter capped off a strong year for us. We grew EBITDA by $176 million in 2014 on a pro forma basis or an increase of 10%.
Slide 5 shows that if we make the same type of adjustments, we increased normalized EBITDA by 14% and generated core EBITDA growth of 6% in 2014.
Slide 6 summarizes some of the highlights of the quarter. We generated strong volume growth, achieving a 4% increase in same-hospital admissions and a 4.5% increase in adjusted admissions. About 70% of the increase in our same-hospital adjusted admissions was core growth and unrelated to the growth we're generating from the ACA. Our volume trends were broad based, as we drove increases in adjusted admissions in 12 of the 14 states in which we operate hospitals.
We also drove strong volume growth in our commercial business, which is our most profitable. Our commercial admissions trends in 2014 were the strongest we've generated in more than a decade.
Growth in outpatient visits remained very strong, increasing 9.6%. 92% of this outpatient growth was organic. Completing the volume picture, we grew surgeries by 7.5% and increased emergency department visits by 7.2%. In summary, we're very pleased with the strength of the volume growth we delivered.
The combination of strong volumes, the improved commercial pricing and the California Provider Fees resulted in strong revenue growth in the quarter. We generated a $583 million increase in net operating revenues after bad debts, which is an increase of 15%.
Excluding the revenue contribution from the California Provider Fees related to prior quarters, we increased patient revenue, net of bad debts, per adjusted admission by 4.9%. We also delivered very favorable growth in commercial managed care revenue, with revenue per commercial admission increasing 6.7%. The commercial pricing on the outpatient side was more modest, increasing by 0.9% per visit. This reflects the impact of the growth we are driving in new outpatient access points, including Urgent Care Centers. 
Bad debt expense declined as a percentage of revenue by 80 basis points to 7.4% in the quarter. The improved bad debt performance is primarily due to a $27 million decline in same-hospital uninsured and charity revenues as a result of the expansion of insurance coverage under the ACA. For the full year 2014, bad debt expense declined 150 basis points on a pro forma basis to 7.3% of revenue, down from 8.8% of revenue in 2013.
In 2015, the midpoint of our guidance for bad debt expense anticipates an additional 30 basis points decline, with a range of 6.75% to 7.25% as a result of the benefits we anticipate capturing from the ACA.
Selected operating expenses per adjusted admission increased by 3.8% in the quarter on a same-hospital basis. The increase was 2.6% excluding physician employment growth. On a full year pro forma basis, our cost only increased 1.4%. In 2015, we expect to do a little better, with growth in selected operating expenses per adjusted admission of 0% to 1%.
Turning to cash flows. Adjusted cash flows from operations in the quarter was $279 million. Net of capital expenditures of $199 million, adjusted free cash flow was $80 million. As we noted in our earnings release, our cash flows have been impacted by the fact that California and Texas owed us about $300 million in aggregate as of December 31 related to the California Provider Fee program, Texas DSH and Texas uncompensated care 1115 Waiver revenues.
Cash flows were also negatively impacted by a temporary buildup in receivables at certain hospitals acquired from Vanguard due to our implementation of a new billing system at these hospitals. While this slowed down cash flows in the second half of the year by about $80 million, the system change will enhance the future performance of these hospitals. The temporary buildup in the receivables caused by the system conversion has already started to come down this year. Likewise, we anticipate the $300 million of receivables from the California and Texas Medicaid programs to begin declining in 2015.
Turning to our services business. Conifer had another great quarter, driving a 78% increase in EBITDA to $64 million. Conifer's revenues increased by 24% to $327 million or an annualized run rate of about $1.3 billion. Keep in mind that the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally strong for Conifer. We anticipate Conifer's EBITDA to be about $240 million in 2015.
In early January, we provided our 2015 outlook for adjusted EBITDA. Slide 7 summarizes the key assumptions included in our outlook. I'll simply note in terms of volumes that the 2015 growth rates are assumed to moderate compared to our 2014 growth. Our outlook assumes admissions growth of 1.5% to 2.5% and adjusted admissions growth of 2.5% to 3.5%.
We expect to grow our exchange volumes 60% to 80% over our 2014 volumes. Given the way we grew exchange volumes throughout 2014, the growth we anticipate this year annualizes the exchange volumes we generated in the fourth quarter plus an additional growth from uninsured individuals who signed up during the recent open enrollment period.
In terms of pricing, we are projecting an increase in total net revenues per adjusted admission of 1% to 2%. We anticipate mid-single-digit percentage growth from improved terms in our commercial managed care contracts, which will be partially offset by anticipated growth in government volumes and our urgent care business, both of which have lower reimbursement levels.
We expect our bad debt ratio to be in a range of 6.75% to 7.25% compared to 7.3% in 2014. Here, we are anticipating the uninsured and underinsured book of business will continue to gain incremental coverage under the ACA.
On the cost side, we continue to expect growth in controllable operating expenses per adjusted admission on a same-hospital basis to be in the 0% to 1% range this year. On a total company basis, including cost growth that is not directly tied to volume growth, such as the growth of volume -- such as the growth at Conifer, which is related to new business, we expect expenses per adjusted admission to increase 1.5% to 2.5%.
We expect to achieve EBITDA growth in 2015 of approximately 8% as shown on Slide 8. This includes absorbing about $50 million associated with the decline in HIT incentives, net of costs. This outlook includes normalized EBITDA growth of 10% and core growth of about 6%, which excludes the contributions from incremental Vanguard synergies and the ACA.
Finally, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $475 million to $525 million in the first quarter of this year.
I want to mention a few things to consider as you think about our quarterly progression of EBITDA in 2015.
Volumes and bad debt expense continue to be influenced by a shift to higher deductible health plans, which may push more volumes into the fourth quarter and could cause bad debt expense to move higher in the first quarter due to the reset of deductibles. In addition, it may take some time for the newly insured to seek inpatient and outpatient services, so the volume benefit from increased exchange enrollment will likely be weighted toward the second half of the year.
As for the California Provider Fee program, for the first time in a while, revenue should be fairly predictable each quarter this year at a little more than $40 million and closer to $170 million for the full year.
The synergies that we are achieving from Vanguard as well as other cost initiatives should continue to ramp throughout the year. And HIT incentives will only be about $5 million in the first quarter compared to $65 million for the full year.
Turning to Slide 9. In summary, we are driving strong growth across all of our major business lines. We are well advanced in our transformation from a regional operator of hospitals to a diversified health care services company with broad geographic reach.
We achieved strong results in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and we've implemented business strategies that are building solid momentum and driving year-over-year growth. These growth drivers are expected to be supplemented by incremental contributions we will realize from Vanguard synergies and the ACA, all of which can be expected to generate attractive growth going forward.
Finally, before we open the call for questions, I want to share with you that Tom Rice has decided to retire and spend more time with his family. Tom has led Tenet's investor relations effort for nearly 12 years, during which time he has worked tirelessly to be responsive to the needs of the investment community. We're very grateful to Tom for his hard work and dedication and for providing continuity over a period of significant change for both our company and the industry.
As part of this news, we are also pleased to announce the promotion of Brendan Strong into the role of Vice President of Investor Relations. Brendan joined Tenet in September in our Northeast region where he's been working on strategic and operational initiatives. Many of you might remember him from his time working in the equity research departments of Lehman Brothers and Barclays where he focused on the health care sector. Tom plans to retire at the end of March, and he and Brendan will be working closely over the next month to ensure a seamless transition.

So the -- something like the Birmingham example that I gave you, those hospitals were not available for purchase. This was -- a joint venture was the only structure that they would have contemplated. So Keith, why don't you just talk just a little more generally about this? Because I think it's an emerging theme.

I think we're well positioned for the future. So when you think about that kind of concept, sometimes who you'd want to partner with could be a high-quality system that you can't acquire. So the other option for us is to do joint ventures with those systems. These are things that are not in banker books, they're not on the market. And these are discussions that are much more strategic about putting together a broader system to have more geographic reach in a market. And so it gives us sort of the optionality when you're in market and you're in a smaller position is: you do a joint venture to get into a larger position, or you have to either be the best or you can acquire. The issue is if someone doesn't want to be acquired and they want to stay in the business, then you do the joint venture. And most of the joint ventures with the not-for-profit systems, over time, we've allowed them, if they prefer, to move into a non-sort-of-active role and more into a foundation role in the market, they can.

And so the Connecticut deal really was about our partnership with Yale New Haven and about putting together a state-wide network in Connecticut, some of which may have lapped over borders, but it would have been more, for example, Western Massachusetts where we're not currently a provider. So when you think about -- that really stood alone in terms of the strategy with Yale New Haven for a state-wide value-based network. So really no impact on Massachusetts. We obviously, as Trevor said earlier, are disappointed that we couldn't get the regulatory process there to work out. But in terms of money, we're very focused strategically on our portfolio, so it's not a question of you go on and find something else to buy. We are more focused on both moving our strategic positions into a better position or, in some cases, some divestiture, as Trevor mentioned before. So it's -- for us, we're going to continue along our strategic path, with no change regardless of, really, what the outcome in Connecticut was."

That's really where our emphasis has been in those 3 types of models. And going forward into 2015, we will continue to emphasize those same models. Probably in order of number of facilities, it would be the urgent care first; surgery centers second, although the surgery centers are much bigger, each site, than urgent care; and the satellite EDs, third. It's been a very successful initiative for us. These -- we find that the synergies that we bring to the acquisitions of ASCs are significant.

In terms of the sequential growth throughout the year, obviously, the first quarter was a slow start due to the enrollment issues. But we built the exchange business as we moved throughout the year.

We do -- I think you're right, we'll have a little bit of a lift from the fact that Detroit will have a full year from Medicaid expansion in Michigan. But what we're seeing so far in '15 is Medicaid business continues to grow, and we anticipate Medicaid volumes to build in 2015 even in our -- the 5 expansion states.

There's still some speculation whether or not that will happen or not. It's -- the physicians organizations and the lobby groups are pushing pretty hard against it. From their standpoint, it's a rather large increase in costs for their organizations. But we are still planning on that moving forward. A lot of our clients, with the pushback of the year, have really jumped on board and moving forward with all their plans on that, implementing in 2015. That's improved our operations on the side of our HIM activities around readiness assessments for ICD-10 as well as the coding resources. As you probably know, there's supposed to be a slowdown in a number of accounts that are actually coded on an hourly basis by these encoders. So we are -- so some of it is really around kind of anticipated additional resources that are going to be required in late '15 into '16 that we are gearing up for from the standpoint of being able to meet those demands. So we think that will be an uptick in our model. But like I said, we're not kind of getting those in the sidelines to alternate resources because we don't want to incur those costs until we get more visibility and actually go forward 100%."

During the first quarter, we made great progress advancing our long-term strategy and strengthening our position in the evolving health care landscape. The transformative agreement we announced with Welsh C",1043,"Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we made great progress advancing our long-term strategy and strengthening our position in the evolving health care landscape. The transformative agreement we announced with Welsh Carson in March creates a joint venture between Tenet and United Surgical Partners International that will establish us as the leader in the ambulatory surgery market.
This further aligns Tenet with the major trends impacting the delivery of health care and shifts the balance of our business toward faster growing, more profitable and less capital-intensive businesses.
Also in March, we announced a joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health. This transaction is the latest example of how we're able to partner with leading non-for-profit health care providers to enhance our market presence without the risk and capital required for full-fledged acquisitions. I'll discuss these in a few minutes, but I'll first give you some highlights of our financial results for the quarter.
We achieved adjusted EBITDA of $529 million during the quarter, which was slightly above the high end of our guidance and represented an increase of 37% over the same period last year. Our strong volume performance in the second half of last year continued into 2015, and that growth extended across most of our markets.
There were a number of factors that contributed to this lift, including growth in admissions, outpatient visits, surgeries and emergency department visits. While we continued to benefit from additional volume from newly insured patients, we estimate that roughly 2/3 of our growth was related to targeted investments in service line development and quality improvements.
Beyond our hospitals and outpatient centers, Conifer had an exceptional quarter, with revenue and EBITDA growth that exceeded our expectations. This performance underscores the strength of Conifer's core business, and we remain very excited about its near- and long-term prospects.
We continue to focus on building leading positions for our hospital operations, including broadening our networks in existing markets and expanding to new geographies where we see a clear path to establish a meaningful and relevant presence.
The success of our Acute Care Hospitals rests on having scale within a market to deploy integrated care strategies, assume risk, improve outcomes and offer differentiated services. I'll walk you through just a few of the important actions that we've taken in recent months to improve our portfolio.
As I've noted before, we believe that building such a position through partnering with not-for-profit health systems can be a much better alternative than traditional acquisitions. Our Vice Chairman, Keith Pitts, has done an incredible job leading this effort in helping us form relationships with prominent organizations that share our commitment to care delivery that is patient-centric, high quality and cost-effective. 
In March, we announced plans to form the joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health, which is the largest not-for-profit system in Texas. We have great respect for Baylor and its leadership and believe the partnership is a strategic opportunity for both organizations to advance population health and coordinate top quality care. The joint venture will include Tenet's 4 hospitals in North Texas as well as one Baylor Hospital in suburb of Dallas.
As we've noted in the past, there are markets where we don't see a path either by acquisition or partnership to develop the scale we believe will be necessary as health care delivery continues to evolve. In those markets, we believe our hospitals will be better positioned under another operator. 
For example, we continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our hospitals in Georgia and North Carolina and expect this process will likely result in sales of those facilities. We also reached a definitive agreement on a long-term lease under which Tenet will operate High Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree, California. This transaction builds on our strong presence and years of experience in the neighboring Coachella Valley where we have successfully operated Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs for 2 decades. We believe this transaction will be completed by the end of the third quarter.
We delivered strong results in our outpatient business during the quarter, increasing visits by 7.6%. Approximately 90% of this growth was organic. Our outpatient team has done an outstanding job building this business, creating tremendous value and putting us in a position to pursue additional growth prospects to realize its potential.
The innovative USPI joint venture will significantly accelerate our outpatient strategy and create the market leader in short-stay surgeries, with the largest footprint and scale in the ambulatory surgery industry. It also provides the foundation for a new services platform where we can offer strategic ambulatory solutions for health systems. As you can see, we're positioning Tenet through Conifer, USPI and our JV strategy to be the partner and service provider of choice for leading not-for-profit health care systems.
USPI has now spoken with each of their 50 health system partners about our relationship, and the overall feedback has been positive. Our expectation is that each of these partnerships will remain in place and that the JV will continue to form new relationships. 
In terms of next steps, the regulatory reviews are in process, and we believe that we're still on track to close by the third quarter and possibly sooner. Leveraging the strong culture of integration we established when we acquired Vanguard, I'm confident that we will have a seamless transition following the close.
Our acquisition of Aspen Healthcare creates an entry into the attractive U.K. private health care market. Aspen has 9 high-quality well-capitalized private facilities, and we expect strong growth from this portfolio. Aspen will be managed under USPI.
In summary, we made great progress on the execution of our strategy, delivered results that exceeded our outlook for the quarter and remain on track to deliver our goals in 2015. We believe that we have the right strategies in place to become even stronger and more competitive. We are making tangible progress, strengthening our business, positioning Tenet to capture benefits from the powerful trends that are shaping health care and enhancing our ability to deliver value creation for our shareholders over the long term. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Dan Cancelmi for more specifics on our performance in the quarter. Dan?"
107911,290469518,803497,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. As Trevor noted, we are pleased with our results for the quarter.

As Trevor noted, we are pleased with our results for the quarter. Our inpatient volumes continued to grow due to our service line development initiatives, targeted capital investments and increasing numbers of patients with insurance coverage. EBITDA was $529 million in the quarter, above the high end of our outlook.
We generated EBITDA growth of $142 million or 37% compared to last year's first quarter. This performance was driven by continued strong volume trends, favorable commercial pricing and the recognition of $46 million of revenues under the California Provider Fee program. As a reminder, we recognized all the California Provider Fee revenue for 2014 in the fourth quarter since the term program was not approved until December. If we assume an apples-to-apples comparison and exclude the $46 million from the first quarter of 2015, we generated EBITDA growth of $96 million or 25%.
We had some other puts and takes in the quarter, including a $25 million increase in malpractice expense related to recent settlements, but this was substantially offset by $23 million of incremental prior period Texas Medicaid DSH revenue based on the recently finalized 2014 funding determination.
Slide 4 summarizes some of the highlights of the quarter. We generated strong volume growth, achieving a 4.9% increase in same-hospital admissions and a 5.9% increase in adjusted admissions. This continues the strong growth we drove over the prior 3 quarters. Our volume trends were broad-based as we generated adjusted admissions growth in 13 of the 14 states in which we operate hospitals. About 2/3 of our volume growth was core growth, and roughly 1/3 related to newly insured patients. Our surgical growth remains strong, increasing 7.1% on a same-hospital basis.
Inpatient surgeries increased 2.4% and outpatient surgeries increased 9.3%. We grew ER visits 7.2%, reflecting our focus on building our emergency room volumes. The combination of strong volumes, favorable commercial rate increases and the California Provider Fee revenue resulted in robust revenue growth. We generated a $502 million increase in total net operating revenues after bad debts, an increase of 13%.
Our revenue growth was driven by a 5.9% increase in same-hospital adjusted admissions, a 2.7% increase in same-hospital revenue per adjusted admission and a $37 million increase in Conifer's revenue from nontenant hospitals, representing a growth rate of 26%.
Bad debt expense was 7.6% of revenue, down 120 basis points from last year's first quarter as a result of benefits we're realizing from growth in newly insured patients and Conifer's billing and collection efforts. The bad debt expense that we reported on the income statement was a little higher than we expected this quarter, although our total uncompensated care trends were in line with our expectations.
Slide 5 contains new disclosures that we are providing to help you better understand our uncompensated care trends. When we add charity care write-offs to bad debt expense, our aggregate uncompensated care was 10.8% of revenue in the first quarter, down from 13.3% in last year's first quarter and 11.3% in Q4. As you can see on the slide, some dollars shifted from charity into bad debt expense this quarter, which impacts the reported bad debt expense on the income statement but has minimal impact on EBITDA.
Turning back to Slide 4. Total company selected operating expenses increased just 1.5% on a per adjusted admission basis. Our full year guidance for this metric is growth of 1.5% to 2.5% so our cost management remains on target.
Turning to cash flows. We remain on track to achieve our adjusted free cash flow guidance for the full year of $150 million to $350 million. Our adjusted free cash flow improved $52 million compared to last year's first quarter. It should be noted that we reduced our capital expenditures by $97 million compared to last year. This was partially offset by certain working capital items, including the timing of cash receipts related to California and Texas supplemental Medicaid funding.
Also I'd like to remind you that we typically use more cash in the first quarter due to the timing of our annual employee 401(k) matching contributions, annual incentive compensation payments and the resetting of payroll taxes.
Moving to our services business. Conifer had another great quarter, producing EBITDA of $82 million, up from $48 million in the first quarter of last year and $64 million in the fourth quarter. Roughly $10 million of Conifer's EBITDA this quarter was driven by performance incentives that we do not expect to repeat every quarter. At this point, we expect Conifer to deliver at least $260 million of EBITDA for the full year, up from our earlier outlook of $240 million.
Slide 6 contains the key components of our outlook for 2015, which remain unchanged from the outlook that we'd provided in February. Assuming we close on our joint venture with USPI before the end of July, we plan on incorporating the impact of the transaction into our outlook when we report our second quarter results in August. Also, we are getting closer to announcing definitive agreements to sell several of our hospitals, and we expect at least 1 announcement, if not more, between now and our next earnings call. We expect these divestitures, if completed, to generate substantial cash proceeds that we can redeploy elsewhere in the business.
Moving to our view on the second quarter. We expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA in the range of $500 million to $550 million. This includes $35 million of HITECH incentives that we expect to recognize in Q2, which is consistent with our outlook at the start of the year. As a reminder, we anticipate recognizing about $65 million of HITECH incentives this year.
In summary, we are pleased with our solid start to the year. We continue to take steps to position the company to generate faster growth, higher margins and greater amounts of free cash flow and are looking forward to completing our USPI joint venture and working with both current and future health system partners.

Yes, so when you -- when we think about our volume trends in the quarter, we look across our inpatient book of business that we were able to generate. When we look at in terms of the drivers from our core initiatives, whether that's targeted service line development or targeted capital investments, we have very good visibility by service line in terms of the incremental volume that we're driving. We spend a lot of time analyzing what we believe the incremental volume is related to the newly insured. It's not 100% accurate, but we think it's pretty close to what the aggregate trends are from the additional uninsured or the additional insured individuals. We look at Medicaid book of business very closely compared to historical trends. And then the exchange business, where we have visibility in terms of their previous insurance status, we're estimating roughly 1/3 were previously uninsured. And so we take those factors into consideration when we're estimating, when we're coming up with this 2/3 that we believe relates to our core growth.

Let's look at the experience we had with Vanguard. And I'd say compared to mergers I've seen, experienced and that are taking place in other industries, we've done exceptionally well in having a very rapid and pretty seamless integration. I mean, if you were to visit hospitals that were formerly part of the Vanguard portfolio or the Tenet portfolio today, you would see evidence of techniques and strategies from both predecessor companies at work. And those companies and people talking about this as 1 company today. So we have that. But part of that strategy was also to retain great people in the target organization. In fact, to do a merger in that case with an organization that had outstanding people to begin with and then to attempt to retain them. So we were successful in retaining and one of the regional leads in Vanguard. And in the case of USPI, we're retaining the entire management team. You start with the company that has outstanding management, and they're staying and that makes the integration job that much easier. So I think, Sheryl, let's make a distinction. We're not acquiring assets that are really troubled with bad management and require total turnaround. Quite the opposite. Outstanding companies, great management, not requiring a turnaround. And so what we're working on is really integration, retention and putting cultures together as opposed to any sort of other type of activity.

So there, you got to remember that the industry that's 5x as big as the companies that everybody pay so much attention to. That'd be my first point. Second point is the answer as to where the volume growth is coming from and what we really mean we're talking about service lines and so forth, it's market-specific. And I'll contrast 2 different markets. Detroit, for example. Detroit has been a fast-growing market. We talked about it all last year. It's a very capital-driven strategy. It goes back to Vanguard's original acquisition of Detroit and the capital investments they made. But those capital investments that were made over a period of years that we are now in the process of continuing and completing are generating volume growth in that market. It's been very successful. A different example is Florida. Our historic Florida market, which is generating volume growth through service line development, and specifically Britt alluded to this, but they decided to focus on 4 particular service lines: surgical, oncology, cardiovascular disease, including surgery and interventional neurology and neurosurgery, by recruiting and building service lines around specific physicians who had very distinguished backgrounds and programs and did then in turn services within the hospital network. Not so capital-intensive, much more people-focused. Obviously, assisted by the intense investment we've made in advance clinical systems. But that's really the example of what we're talking about. We're talking about organic growth unrelated to the ACA, involving service lines and hope those examples help illustrate [indiscernible]"

And so virtually, everything is open and the last large project is the children's -- the major children's downtown renovation. As you may recall, we also have a Children's freestanding ED and a large ambulatory center opening in Oakland County in Troy at the end of this calendar year. So the only thing that won't be left open at the end of '15 is the inpatient high acuity expansion of the Children's Hospital downtown. However, you should note that the innovations of the old space as well as the ambulatory space has been open for a while. So Children's has had a lot of some improvements, but it'll be a couple of more years before that project is completed. So -- and we've been very pleased with the response and the reaction. The projects have generated volumes in excess, as they've opened, in excess of what we originally expected. So we've seen nice gains in market share in the Detroit market over the last few years. It's one of the few markets where we have, as you know, when you have organic growth, some of it can be market share, some of it can be the environment, i.e., what's in the market overall are already up for other reasons, whether it's a flu outbreak or whether it's some other reason that the market might be up. And we have good visibility in Detroit early on based on data reporting in that state.

During the first quarter, we made great progress advancing our long-term strategy and strengthening our position in the evolving health care landscape. The transformative agreement we announced with Welsh C",1040,"Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we made great progress advancing our long-term strategy and strengthening our position in the evolving health care landscape. The transformative agreement we announced with Welsh Carson in March creates a joint venture between Tenet and United Surgical Partners International that will establish us as the leader in the ambulatory surgery market. This further aligns Tenet with the major trends impacting the delivery of health care and shifts the balance of our business toward faster-growing, more profitable and less capital-intensive businesses.
Also, in March, we announced a joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health. This transaction is the latest example of how we're able to partner with leading not-for-profit health care providers to enhance our market presence without the risk and capital required for full-fledged acquisitions. I'll discuss these in a few minutes, but I'll first give you some highlights of our financial results for the quarter.
We achieved adjusted EBITDA of $529 million during the quarter, which was slightly above the high end of our guidance and represented an increase of 37% over the same period last year. Our strong volume performance in the second half of last year continued into 2015, and that growth extended across most of our markets.
There were a number of factors that contributed to this lift, including growth in admissions, outpatient visits, surgeries and emergency department visits. While we continued to benefit from additional volume from newly insured patients, we estimate that roughly 2/3 of our growth was related to targeted investments in service line development and quality improvements.
Beyond our hospitals and outpatient centers, Conifer had an exceptional quarter, with revenue and EBITDA growth that exceeded our expectations. This performance underscores the strength of Conifer's core business, and we remain very excited about its near- and long-term prospects.
We continue to focus on building leading positions for our hospital operations, including broadening our networks in existing markets and expanding to new geographies where we see a clear path to establish a meaningful and relevant presence.
The success of our acute care hospitals rests on having scale within a market to deploy integrated care strategies, assume risk, improve outcomes and offer differentiated services. I'll walk you through just a few of the important actions that we've taken in recent months to improve our portfolio.
As I've noted before, we believe that building such a position through partnering with not-for-profit health systems can be a much better alternative than traditional acquisitions. Our Vice Chairman, Keith Pitts, has done an incredible job leading this effort in helping us form relationships with prominent organizations that share our commitment to care delivery that is patient-centric, high-quality and cost-effective.
In March, we announced plans to form the joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health, which is the largest not-for-profit system in Texas. We have great respect for Baylor and its leadership and believe the partnership is a strategic opportunity for both organizations to advance population health and coordinate top-quality care. The joint venture will include Tenet's 4 hospitals in North Texas as well as one Baylor hospital in a suburb of Dallas.
As we've noted in the past, there are markets where we don't see a path, either by acquisition or partnership, to develop the scale we believe will be necessary as health care delivery continues to evolve. In those markets, we believe our hospitals will be better positioned under another operator.
For example, we continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our hospitals in Georgia and North Carolina and expect this process will likely result in sales of those facilities. We also reached a definitive agreement on a long-term lease, under which Tenet will operate Hi-Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree, California. This transaction builds on our strong presence and years of experience in the neighboring Coachella Valley where we have successfully operated Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs for 2 decades. We believe this transaction will be completed by the end of the third quarter.
We delivered strong results in our outpatient business during the quarter, increasing visits by 7.6%. Approximately 90% of this growth was organic. Our outpatient team has done an outstanding job building this business, creating tremendous value and putting us in a position to pursue additional growth prospects to realize its potential.
The innovative USPI joint venture will significantly accelerate our outpatient strategy and create the market leader in short-stay surgeries, with the largest footprint and scale in the ambulatory surgery industry. It also provides the foundation for a new services platform where we can offer strategic ambulatory solutions for health systems. As you can see, we're positioning Tenet through Conifer, USPI and our JV strategy to be the partner and service provider of choice for leading not-for-profit health care systems.
USPI has now spoken with each of their 50 health system partners about our relationship, and the overall feedback has been positive. Our expectation is that each of these partnerships will remain in place and that the JV will continue to form new relationships.
In terms of next steps, the regulatory reviews are in process, and we believe that we're still on track to close by the third quarter and possibly sooner. Leveraging the strong culture of integration we established when we acquired Vanguard, I'm confident that we'll have a seamless transition following the close.
Our acquisition of Aspen Healthcare creates an entry into the attractive U.K. private health care market. Aspen has 9 high-quality, well-capitalized private facilities, and we expect strong growth from this portfolio. Aspen will be managed under USPI.
In summary, we made great progress on the execution of our strategy, delivered results that exceeded our outlook for the quarter and remain on track to deliver our goals in 2015. We believe that we have the right strategies in place to become even stronger and more competitive. We are making tangible progress, strengthening our business, positioning Tenet to capture benefits from the powerful trends that are shaping health care and enhancing our ability to deliver value creation for our shareholders over the long term.
And with that, let me turn it over to Dan Cancelmi for more specifics on our performance in the first quarter. Dan?"

As Trevor noted, we are pleased with our results for the quarter.

As Trevor noted, we are pleased with our results for the quarter. Our inpatient volumes continue to grow due to our service line development initiatives, targeted capital investments and increasing numbers of patients with insurance coverage. 
EBITDA was $529 million in the quarter, above the high end of our outlook. We generated EBITDA growth of $142 million or 37% compared to last year's first quarter. This performance was driven by a continued strong volume trend, favorable commercial pricing and the recognition of $46 million of revenues under the California Provider Fee program. As a reminder, we recognized all the California Provider Fee revenue for 2014 in the fourth quarter since the current program was not approved until December. If we assume an apples-to-apples comparison and exclude the $46 million from the first quarter of 2015, we generated EBITDA growth of $96 million or 25%.
We had some other puts and takes in the quarter, including a $25 million increase in malpractice expense related to recent settlements, but this was substantially offset by $23 million of incremental prior period Texas Medicaid DSH revenue based on the recently finalized 2014 funding determination.
Slide 4 summarizes some of the highlights of the quarter. We generated strong volume growth, achieving a 4.9% increase in same-hospital admissions and a 5.9% increase in adjusted admissions. This continues the strong growth we drove over the prior 3 quarters.
Our volume trends were broad-based as we generated adjusted admissions growth in 13 of the 14 states in which we operate hospitals. About 2/3 of our volume growth was core growth, and roughly 1/3 related to newly insured patients. Our surgical growth remained strong, increasing 7.1% on a same-hospital basis.
Inpatient surgeries increased 2.4%, and outpatient surgeries increased 9.3%. We grew ER visits 7.2%, reflecting our focus on building our emergency room volumes. The combination of strong volumes, favorable commercial rate increases and the California Provider Fee revenue resulted in robust revenue growth. We generated a $502 million increase in total net operating revenues after bad debts, an increase of 13%.
Our revenue growth was driven by a 5.9% increase in same-hospital adjusted admissions; a 2.7% increase in same-hospital revenue per adjusted admission; and a $37 million increase in Conifer's revenue from non-Tenet hospitals, representing a growth rate of 26%.
Bad debt expense was 7.6% of revenue, down 120 basis points from last year's first quarter, as a result of the benefits we're realizing from growth in newly insured patients and Conifer's billing and collection efforts. The bad debt expense that we reported on the income statement was a little higher than we expected this quarter, although our total uncompensated care trends were in line with our expectations.
Slide 5 contains new disclosures that we are providing to help you better understand our uncompensated care trends. When we add charity care write-offs to bad debt expense, our aggregate uncompensated care was 10.8% of revenue in the first quarter, down from 13.3% in last year's first quarter and 11.3% in Q4. As you can see on the slide, some dollars shifted from charity into bad debt expense this quarter, which impacts the reported bad debt expense on the income statement but has minimal impact on EBITDA.
Turning back to Slide 4. Total company selected operating expenses increased just 1.5% on a per adjusted admission basis. Our full year guidance for this metric is growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, so our cost management remains on target.
Turning to cash flows. We remain on track to achieve our adjusted free cash flow guidance for the full year of $150 million to $350 million. Our adjusted free cash flow improved $52 million compared to last year's first quarter. It should be noted that we reduced our capital expenditures by $97 million compared to last year. This was partially offset by certain working capital items, including the timing of cash receipts related to California and Texas supplemental Medicaid funding.
Also, I'd like to remind you that we typically use more cash in the first quarter due to the timing of our annual employee 401(k) matching contributions, annual incentive compensation payments and the resetting of payroll taxes.
Moving to our services business. Conifer had another great quarter, producing EBITDA of $82 million, up from $48 million in the first quarter of last year and $64 million in the fourth quarter. Roughly $10 million of Conifer's EBITDA this quarter was driven by performance incentives that we do not expect to repeat every quarter. At this point, we expect Conifer to deliver at least $260 million of EBITDA for the full year, up from our earlier outlook of $240 million.
Slide 6 contains the key components of our outlook for 2015, which remain unchanged from the outlook that we'd provided in February. Assuming we close on our joint venture with USPI before the end of July, we plan on incorporating the impact of the transaction into our outlook when we report our second quarter results in August. Also, we are getting closer to announcing definitive agreements to sell several of our hospitals, and we expect at least 1 announcement, if not more, between now and our next earnings call. We expect these divestitures, if completed, to generate substantial cash proceeds that we can redeploy elsewhere in the business.
Moving to our view on the second quarter. We expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA in the range of $500 million to $550 million. This includes $35 million of HITECH incentives that we expect to recognize in Q2, which is consistent with our outlook at the start of the year. As a reminder, we anticipate recognizing about $65 million of HITECH incentives this year.
In summary, we are pleased with our solid start to the year. We continue to take steps to position the company to generate faster growth, higher margins and greater amounts of free cash flow and are looking forward to completing our USPI joint venture and working with both current and future health system partners.

So when you -- when we think about our volume trends in the quarter, we look across our inpatient book of business that we were able to generate. When we look at in terms of the drivers from our core initiatives, whether that's targeted service line development or targeted capital investments, we have very good visibility by service line in terms of the incremental volume that we're driving. We spend a lot of time analyzing what we believe the incremental volume is related to the newly insured. It's not 100% accurate, but we think it's pretty close to what the aggregate trends are from the additional uninsured -- or the additional insured individuals. We look at Medicaid book of business very closely compared to historical trends. And then the exchange business where we have visibility in terms of their previous insurance status, we're estimating roughly 1/3 were previously uninsured. And so we take those factors into consideration when we're estimating, when we were coming up with this 2/3 that we believe relates to our core growth. We don't have visibility into all the exchange patients because we may not have seen all of them in the past, but our experience seems to be consistent with some other studies on that as well. So we feel pretty good about our split between organic, so to speak, and the growth due to the newly insured."

Let's look at the experience we had with Vanguard. And I'd say compared to mergers I have seen, experienced and that are taking place in other industries, we've done exceptionally well in having a very rapid and pretty seamless integration. I mean, if you were to visit hospitals that were formerly part of the Vanguard portfolio or the Tenet portfolio today, you would see evidence of techniques and strategies from both predecessor companies at work. And those companies and people talking about this as 1 company today. Do we have that? But part of that strategy was also to retain great people in the target organization. In fact, to do a merger in that case with an organization that had outstanding people to begin with and then to attempt to retain them. So we were successful in retaining and one of the regional leads in Vanguard. And in the case of USPI, we're retaining the entire management team, and you start with the company that has outstanding management, and they're staying, and that makes the integration job that much easier. So I think, Sheryl, let's make a distinction. We're not acquiring assets that are really troubled with bad management and require a total turnaround. It's quite the opposite: outstanding companies, great management, not requiring a turnaround. And so what we're working on is really integration, retention and putting cultures together as opposed to any sort of other type of activity. And that's so much easier to do, so much more successful and can be done so much faster"

And my issue with that, even though I recognize that even compared to the other hospital company results, yours are a notch better.

So first of all, I would suggest the experience so far in the industrial sector is not all the same. It's very differentiated between the 2 companies, and it's also quite likely that the companies that are performing very well in building volumes are doing some of the same things in order to drive it. We also -- within the industrial sector are outperforming the public sector than the not-for-profits in terms of volume growth. So there, you got to remember that's an industry's that's 5x as big as the companies that everybody paid so much attention to. That would be my first point. Second point is the answer as to where the volume growth is coming from and what we really mean we're talking about service lines and so forth, it's market-specific. And I'll contrast 2 different markets, Detroit, for example. Detroit has been a fast-growing market. We talked about it all last year. It's a very capital-driven strategy. It goes back to Vanguard's original acquisition of Detroit and the capital investments they made, but those capital investments that were made over a period of years that we are now in the process of continuing and completing are generating volume growth in that market. It's been very successful. A different example is Florida. Our historic Florida market, which is generating volume growth through service line development -- and specifically, Britt alluded to this -- but they decided to focus on 4 particular service lines: surgical oncology; cardiovascular disease, including surgery; interventional neurology; and neurosurgery, by recruiting and building service lines around specific physicians who had very distinguished backgrounds and programs and did then in turn services within the hospital network. Not so capital-intensive, much more people-focused, obviously assisted by the intense investment we've made in advance clinical systems, but that's really the example of what we're talking about. We're talking about organic growth unrelated to the ACA, involving service lines, et cetera. And hope those examples help illustrate the points I made."

During the first quarter, we made great progress advancing our long-term strategy and strengthening our position in the evolving health care landscape. The transformative agreement we announced with Welsh C",1040,"Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we made great progress advancing our long-term strategy and strengthening our position in the evolving health care landscape. The transformative agreement we announced with Welsh Carson in March creates a joint venture between Tenet and United Surgical Partners International that will establish us as the leader in the ambulatory surgery market. This further aligns Tenet with the major trends impacting the delivery of health care and shifts the balance of our business toward faster-growing, more profitable and less capital-intensive businesses.
Also, in March, we announced a joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health. This transaction is the latest example of how we're able to partner with leading not-for-profit health care providers to enhance our market presence without the risk and capital required for full-fledged acquisitions. I'll discuss these in a few minutes, but I'll first give you some highlights of our financial results for the quarter.
We achieved adjusted EBITDA of $529 million during the quarter, which was slightly above the high end of our guidance and represented an increase of 37% over the same period last year. Our strong volume performance in the second half of last year continued into 2015, and that growth extended across most of our markets.
There were a number of factors that contributed to this lift, including growth in admissions, outpatient visits, surgeries and emergency department visits. While we continued to benefit from additional volume from newly insured patients, we estimate that roughly 2/3 of our growth was related to targeted investments in service line development and quality improvements.
Beyond our hospitals and outpatient centers, Conifer had an exceptional quarter, with revenue and EBITDA growth that exceeded our expectations. This performance underscores the strength of Conifer's core business, and we remain very excited about its near- and long-term prospects.
We continue to focus on building leading positions for our hospital operations, including broadening our networks in existing markets and expanding to new geographies where we see a clear path to establish a meaningful and relevant presence.
The success of our acute care hospitals rests on having scale within a market to deploy integrated care strategies, assume risk, improve outcomes and offer differentiated services. I'll walk you through just a few of the important actions that we've taken in recent months to improve our portfolio.
As I've noted before, we believe that building such a position through partnering with not-for-profit health systems can be a much better alternative than traditional acquisitions. Our Vice Chairman, Keith Pitts, has done an incredible job leading this effort in helping us form relationships with prominent organizations that share our commitment to care delivery that is patient-centric, high-quality and cost-effective.
In March, we announced plans to form the joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health, which is the largest not-for-profit system in Texas. We have great respect for Baylor and its leadership and believe the partnership is a strategic opportunity for both organizations to advance population health and coordinate top-quality care. The joint venture will include Tenet's 4 hospitals in North Texas as well as one Baylor hospital in a suburb of Dallas.
As we've noted in the past, there are markets where we don't see a path, either by acquisition or partnership, to develop the scale we believe will be necessary as health care delivery continues to evolve. In those markets, we believe our hospitals would be better positioned under another operator.
For example, we continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our hospitals in Georgia and North Carolina and expect this process will likely result in sales of those facilities. We also reached a definitive agreement on a long-term lease, under which Tenet will operate Hi-Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree, California. This transaction builds on our strong presence and years of experience in the neighboring Coachella Valley where we have successfully operated Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs for 2 decades. We believe this transaction will be completed by the end of the third quarter.
We delivered strong results in our outpatient business during the quarter, increasing visits by 7.6%. Approximately 90% of this growth was organic. Our outpatient team has done an outstanding job building this business, creating tremendous value and putting us in a position to pursue additional growth prospects to realize its potential.
The innovative USPI joint venture will significantly accelerate our outpatient strategy and create the market leader in short-stay surgeries, with the largest footprint and scale in the ambulatory surgery industry. It also provides the foundation for a new services platform where we can offer strategic ambulatory solutions for health systems. As you can see, we're positioning Tenet through Conifer, USPI and our JV strategy to be the partner and service provider of choice for leading not-for-profit health care systems.
USPI has now spoken with each of their 50 health system partners about our relationship, and the overall feedback has been positive. Our expectation is that each of these partnerships will remain in place and that the JV will continue to form new relationships.
In terms of next steps, the regulatory reviews are in process, and we believe that we're still on track to close by the third quarter and possibly sooner. Leveraging the strong culture of integration we established when we acquired Vanguard, I'm confident that we'll have a seamless transition following the close.
Our acquisition of Aspen Healthcare creates an entry into the attractive U.K. private health care market. Aspen has 9 high-quality, well-capitalized private facilities, and we expect strong growth from this portfolio. Aspen will be managed under USPI.
In summary, we made great progress on the execution of our strategy, delivered results that exceeded our outlook for the quarter and remain on track to deliver our goals in 2015. We believe that we have the right strategies in place to become even stronger and more competitive. We are making tangible progress strengthening our business, positioning Tenet to capture benefits from the powerful trends that are shaping health care and enhancing our ability to deliver value creation for our shareholders over the long term.
And with that, let me turn it over to Dan Cancelmi for more specifics on our performance in the first quarter. Dan?"

As Trevor noted, we are pleased with our results for the quarter. Our inpatient volumes continued to grow due to our service line development initiatives, targeted capital investments and increasing numbers of patients with insurance coverage. 
EBITDA was $529 million in the quarter, above the high end of our outlook. We generated EBITDA growth of $142 million or 37% compared to last year's first quarter. This performance was driven by continued strong volume trends, favorable commercial pricing and the recognition of $46 million of revenues under the California Provider Fee program. As a reminder, we recognized all the California Provider Fee revenue for 2014 in the fourth quarter since the current program was not approved until December. If we assume an apples-to-apples comparison and exclude the $46 million from the first quarter of 2015, we generated EBITDA growth of $96 million or 25%.
We had some other puts and takes in the quarter, including a $25 million increase in malpractice expense related to recent settlements, but this was substantially offset by $23 million of incremental prior period Texas Medicaid DSH revenue based on the recently finalized 2014 funding determination.
Slide 4 summarizes some of the highlights of the quarter. We generated strong volume growth, achieving a 4.9% increase in same-hospital admissions and a 5.9% increase in adjusted admissions. This continues the strong growth we drove over the prior 3 quarters.
Our volume trends were broad-based as we generated adjusted admissions growth in 13 of the 14 states in which we operate hospitals. About 2/3 of our volume growth was core growth, and roughly 1/3 related to newly insured patients. Our surgical growth remained strong, increasing 7.1% on a same-hospital basis.
Inpatient surgeries increased 2.4%, and outpatient surgeries increased 9.3%. We grew ER visits 7.2%, reflecting our focus on building our emergency room volumes. The combination of strong volumes, favorable commercial rate increases and the California Provider Fee revenue resulted in robust revenue growth. We generated a $502 million increase in total net operating revenues after bad debts, an increase of 13%.
Our revenue growth was driven by a 5.9% increase in same-hospital adjusted admissions; a 2.7% increase in same-hospital revenue per adjusted admission; and a $37 million increase in Conifer's revenue from non-Tenet hospitals, representing a growth rate of 26%.
Bad debt expense was 7.6% of revenue, down 120 basis points from last year's first quarter, as a result of the benefits we're realizing from growth in newly insured patients and Conifer's billing and collection efforts. The bad debt expense that we reported on the income statement was a little higher than we expected this quarter, although our total uncompensated care trends were in line with our expectations.
Slide 5 contains new disclosures that we are providing to help you better understand our uncompensated care trends. When we add charity care write-offs to bad debt expense, our aggregate uncompensated care was 10.8% of revenue in the first quarter, down from 13.3% in last year's first quarter and 11.3% in Q4. As you can see on the slide, some dollars shifted from charity into bad debt expense this quarter, which impacts the reported bad debt expense on the income statement but has minimal impact on EBITDA.
Turning back to Slide 4. Total company selected operating expenses increased just 1.5% on a per adjusted admission basis. Our full year guidance for this metric is growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, so our cost management remains on target.
Turning to cash flows. We remain on track to achieve our adjusted free cash flow guidance for the full year of $150 million to $350 million. Our adjusted free cash flow improved $52 million compared to last year's first quarter. It should be noted that we reduced our capital expenditures by $97 million compared to last year. This was partially offset by certain working capital items, including the timing of cash receipts related to California and Texas supplemental Medicaid funding.
Also, I'd like to remind you that we typically use more cash in the first quarter due to the timing of our annual employee 401(k) matching contributions, annual incentive compensation payments and the resetting of payroll taxes.
Moving to our services business. Conifer had another great quarter, producing EBITDA of $82 million, up from $48 million in the first quarter of last year and $64 million in the fourth quarter. Roughly $10 million of Conifer's EBITDA this quarter was driven by performance incentives that we do not expect to repeat every quarter. At this point, we expect Conifer to deliver at least $260 million of EBITDA for the full year, up from our earlier outlook of $240 million.
Slide 6 contains the key components of our outlook for 2015, which remain unchanged from the outlook that we'd provided in February. Assuming we close on our joint venture with USPI before the end of July, we plan on incorporating the impact of the transaction into our outlook when we report our second quarter results in August. Also, we are getting closer to announcing definitive agreements to sell several of our hospitals, and we expect at least 1 announcement, if not more, between now and our next earnings call. We expect these divestitures, if completed, to generate substantial cash proceeds that we can redeploy elsewhere in the business.
Moving to our view on the second quarter. We expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA in a range of $500 million to $550 million. This includes $35 million of HITECH incentives that we expect to recognize in Q2, which is consistent with our outlook at the start of the year. As a reminder, we anticipate recognizing about $65 million of HITECH incentives this year.
In summary, we are pleased with our solid start to the year. We continue to take steps to position the company to generate faster growth, higher margins and greater amounts of free cash flow and are looking forward to completing our USPI joint venture and working with both current and future health system partners.

And people talking about this as 1 company today. We have that, but part of that strategy was also to retain great people in the target organization. In fact, to do a merger in that case with an organization that had outstanding people to begin with and then to attempt to retain them. So as you know, we were successful in retaining and one of the regional leads in Vanguard. And in the case of USPI, we're retaining the entire management team, and you start with a company that has outstanding management, and they're staying, and that makes the integration job that much easier. So I think, Sheryl, let's make a distinction. We're not acquiring assets that are really troubled with bad management and require total turnarounds. It's quite the opposite: outstanding companies, great management, not requiring a turnaround.

And just to a little better understand when you talk about organic growth and 2/3 of your volume growth related to investments and service line development and targeted capital investment -- I mean, I guess -- so correct me if I'm wrong here, I sort of hear you guys saying that the volume -- 2/3 of the volume growth is related to things that you have done as opposed to the environment. And my issue with that, even though I recognize that even compared to the other hospital company results, yours are a notch better. They're still in the same directional ballpark as what we're seeing from the others. So it just seems hard to understand that everybody's volumes are going up that much because of things that they are doing company-specific."

So first of all, I would suggest the experience so far in the investor-owned sector is not all the same. It's very differentiated between the 2 companies, and it's also quite likely that the companies that are performing very well in building volumes are doing some of the same things in order to drive it. We also, within the investor-owned sector, are outperforming the public sector than the not-for-profits in terms of volume growth. So there, you've got to remember that it's an industry that's 5x as big as the companies that everybody paid so much attention to. That would be my first point. Second point is the answer as to where the volume growth is coming from and what we really mean, we're talking about service lines and so forth, it's market-specific. And I'll contrast 2 different markets, Detroit, for example. Detroit has been a fast-growing market. We talked about it all last year. It's a very capital-driven strategy. It goes back to Vanguard's original acquisition in Detroit and the capital investments they made. But those capital investments that were made over a period of years that we are now in the process of continuing and completing are generating volume growth in that market. It's been very successful. A different example is Florida. Our historic Florida market, which is generating volume growth through service line development and specifically, Britt alluded to this, but they decided to focus on 4 particular service lines: surgical oncology; cardiovascular disease including surgery; interventional neurology and neurosurgery, by recruiting and building service lines around specific physicians who had very distinguished backgrounds and programs in this, who then, in turn, built those services within the hospital network. Not so capital-intensive, much more people-focused, obviously assisted by the intense investment we've made in advance clinical systems, but that's really the example of what we're talking about when we're talking about organic growth unrelated to the ACA, involving service lines, et cetera. And hope those examples help illustrate the points I made."

As you may recall, we also have a Children's freestanding ED and a large ambulatory center opening in Oakland County in Troy at the end of this calendar year. So the only thing that won't be left open at the end of '15 is the inpatient, high-acuity expansion of the Children's Hospital downtown. However, you should note that the renovations of the old space as well as the ambulatory space has been open for a while. So Children's has had a lot of some improvements, but it'll be a couple of more years before that project is completed. So -- and we've been very pleased with the response and the reaction. The projects have generated volumes in excess, as they've opened, in excess of what we originally expected. So we've seen nice gains in market share in the Detroit market over the last few years. It's one of the few markets where we have -- as you know, when you have organic growth, some of it can be market share, some of it can be the environment, i.e., what's -- is the market overall already up for other reasons, whether it's a flu outbreak or whether it's some other reasons that the market might be up.

During the first quarter, we made great progress advancing our long-term strategy and strengthening our position in the evolving health care landscape. The transformative agreement we announced with Welsh C",1040,"Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we made great progress advancing our long-term strategy and strengthening our position in the evolving health care landscape. The transformative agreement we announced with Welsh Carson in March creates a joint venture between Tenet and United Surgical Partners International that will establish us as the leader in the ambulatory surgery market. This further aligns Tenet with the major trends impacting the delivery of health care and shifts the balance of our business toward faster-growing, more profitable and less capital-intensive businesses.
Also, in March, we announced a joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health. This transaction is the latest example of how we're able to partner with leading not-for-profit health care providers to enhance our market presence without the risk and capital required for full-fledged acquisitions. I'll discuss these in a few minutes, but I'll first give you some highlights of our financial results for the quarter.
We achieved adjusted EBITDA of $529 million during the quarter, which was slightly above the high end of our guidance and represented an increase of 37% over the same period last year. Our strong volume performance in the second half of last year continued into 2015, and that growth extended across most of our markets.
There were a number of factors that contributed to this lift, including growth in admissions, outpatient visits, surgeries and emergency department visits. While we continued to benefit from additional volume from newly insured patients, we estimate that roughly 2/3 of our growth was related to targeted investments in service line development and quality improvements.
Beyond our hospitals and outpatient centers, Conifer had an exceptional quarter, with revenue and EBITDA growth that exceeded our expectations. This performance underscores the strength of Conifer's core business, and we remain very excited about its near- and long-term prospects.
We continue to focus on building leading positions for our hospital operations, including broadening our networks in existing markets and expanding to new geographies where we see a clear path to establish a meaningful and relevant presence.
The success of our acute care hospitals rests on having scale within a market to deploy integrated care strategies, assume risk, improve outcomes and offer differentiated services. I'll walk you through just a few of the important actions that we've taken in recent months to improve our portfolio.
As I've noted before, we believe that building such a position through partnering with not-for-profit health systems can be a much better alternative than traditional acquisitions. Our Vice Chairman, Keith Pitts, has done an incredible job leading this effort in helping us form relationships with prominent organizations that share our commitment to care delivery that is patient-centric, high-quality and cost-effective.
In March, we announced plans to form the joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health, which is the largest not-for-profit system in Texas. We have great respect for Baylor and its leadership and believe the partnership is a strategic opportunity for both organizations to advance population health and coordinate top-quality care. The joint venture will include Tenet's 4 hospitals in North Texas as well as one Baylor hospital in a suburb of Dallas.
As we've noted in the past, there are markets where we don't see a path, either by acquisition or partnership, to develop the scale we believe will be necessary as health care delivery continues to evolve. In those markets, we believe our hospitals would be better positioned under another operator.
For example, we continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our hospitals in Georgia and North Carolina and expect this process will likely result in sales of those facilities. We also reached a definitive agreement on a long-term lease, under which Tenet will operate Hi-Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree, California. This transaction builds on our strong presence and years of experience in the neighboring Coachella Valley where we have successfully operated Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs for 2 decades. We believe this transaction will be completed by the end of the third quarter.
We delivered strong results in our outpatient business during the quarter, increasing visits by 7.6%. Approximately 90% of this growth was organic. Our outpatient team has done an outstanding job building this business, creating tremendous value and putting us in a position to pursue additional growth prospects to realize its potential.
The innovative USPI joint venture will significantly accelerate our outpatient strategy and create the market leader in short-stay surgeries, with the largest footprint and scale in the ambulatory surgery industry. It also provides the foundation for a new services platform where we can offer strategic ambulatory solutions for health systems. As you can see, we're positioning Tenet through Conifer, USPI and our JV strategy to be the partner and service provider of choice for leading not-for-profit health care systems.
USPI has now spoken with each of their 50 health system partners about our relationship, and the overall feedback has been positive. Our expectation is that each of these partnerships will remain in place and that the JV will continue to form new relationships.
In terms of next steps, the regulatory reviews are in process, and we believe that we're still on track to close by the third quarter and possibly sooner. Leveraging the strong culture of integration we established when we acquired Vanguard, I'm confident that we'll have a seamless transition following the close.
Our acquisition of Aspen Healthcare creates an entry into the attractive U.K. private health care market. Aspen has 9 high-quality, well-capitalized private facilities, and we expect strong growth from this portfolio. Aspen will be managed under USPI.
In summary, we made great progress on the execution of our strategy, delivered results that exceeded our outlook for the quarter and remain on track to deliver our goals in 2015. We believe that we have the right strategies in place to become even stronger and more competitive. We are making tangible progress strengthening our business, positioning Tenet to capture benefits from the powerful trends that are shaping health care and enhancing our ability to deliver value creation for our shareholders over the long term.
And with that, let me turn it over to Dan Cancelmi for more specifics on our performance in the first quarter. Dan?"

As Trevor noted, we are pleased with our results for the quarter. Our inpatient volumes continued to grow due to our service line development initiatives, targeted capital investments and increasing numbers of patients with insurance coverage. 
EBITDA was $529 million in the quarter, above the high end of our outlook. We generated EBITDA growth of $142 million or 37% compared to last year's first quarter. This performance was driven by continued strong volume trends, favorable commercial pricing and the recognition of $46 million of revenues under the California Provider Fee program. As a reminder, we recognized all the California Provider Fee revenue for 2014 in the fourth quarter since the current program was not approved until December. If we assume an apples-to-apples comparison and exclude the $46 million from the first quarter of 2015, we generated EBITDA growth of $96 million or 25%.
We had some other puts and takes in the quarter, including a $25 million increase in malpractice expense related to recent settlements, but this was substantially offset by $23 million of incremental prior period Texas Medicaid DSH revenue based on the recently finalized 2014 funding determination.
Slide 4 summarizes some of the highlights of the quarter. We generated strong volume growth, achieving a 4.9% increase in same-hospital admissions and a 5.9% increase in adjusted admissions. This continues the strong growth we drove over the prior 3 quarters.
Our volume trends were broad-based as we generated adjusted admissions growth in 13 of the 14 states in which we operate hospitals. About 2/3 of our volume growth was core growth, and roughly 1/3 related to newly insured patients. Our surgical growth remained strong, increasing 7.1% on a same-hospital basis.
Inpatient surgeries increased 2.4%, and outpatient surgeries increased 9.3%. We grew ER visits 7.2%, reflecting our focus on building our emergency room volumes. The combination of strong volumes, favorable commercial rate increases and the California Provider Fee revenue resulted in robust revenue growth. We generated a $502 million increase in total net operating revenues after bad debts, an increase of 13%.
Our revenue growth was driven by a 5.9% increase in same-hospital adjusted admissions; a 2.7% increase in same-hospital revenue per adjusted admission; and a $37 million increase in Conifer's revenue from non-Tenet hospitals, representing a growth rate of 26%.
Bad debt expense was 7.6% of revenue, down 120 basis points from last year's first quarter, as a result of the benefits we're realizing from growth in newly insured patients and Conifer's billing and collection efforts. The bad debt expense that we reported on the income statement was a little higher than we expected this quarter, although our total uncompensated care trends were in line with our expectations.
Slide 5 contains new disclosures that we are providing to help you better understand our uncompensated care trends. When we add charity care write-offs to bad debt expense, our aggregate uncompensated care was 10.8% of revenue in the first quarter, down from 13.3% in last year's first quarter and 11.3% in Q4. As you can see on the slide, some dollars shifted from charity into bad debt expense this quarter, which impacts the reported bad debt expense on the income statement but has minimal impact on EBITDA.
Turning back to Slide 4. Total company selected operating expenses increased just 1.5% on a per adjusted admission basis. Our full year guidance for this metric is growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, so our cost management remains on target.
Turning to cash flows. We remain on track to achieve our adjusted free cash flow guidance for the full year of $150 million to $350 million. Our adjusted free cash flow improved $52 million compared to last year's first quarter. It should be noted that we reduced our capital expenditures by $97 million compared to last year. This was partially offset by certain working capital items, including the timing of cash receipts related to California and Texas supplemental Medicaid funding.
Also, I'd like to remind you that we typically use more cash in the first quarter due to the timing of our annual employee 401(k) matching contributions, annual incentive compensation payments and the resetting of payroll taxes.
Moving to our services business. Conifer had another great quarter, producing EBITDA of $82 million, up from $48 million in the first quarter of last year and $64 million in the fourth quarter. Roughly $10 million of Conifer's EBITDA this quarter was driven by performance incentives that we do not expect to repeat every quarter. At this point, we expect Conifer to deliver at least $260 million of EBITDA for the full year, up from our earlier outlook of $240 million.
Slide 6 contains the key components of our outlook for 2015, which remain unchanged from the outlook that we'd provided in February. Assuming we close on our joint venture with USPI before the end of July, we plan on incorporating the impact of the transaction into our outlook when we report our second quarter results in August. Also, we are getting closer to announcing definitive agreements to sell several of our hospitals, and we expect at least 1 announcement, if not more, between now and our next earnings call. We expect these divestitures, if completed, to generate substantial cash proceeds that we can redeploy elsewhere in the business.
Moving to our view on the second quarter. We expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA in a range of $500 million to $550 million. This includes $35 million of HITECH incentives that we expect to recognize in Q2, which is consistent with our outlook at the start of the year. As a reminder, we anticipate recognizing about $65 million of HITECH incentives this year.
In summary, we are pleased with our solid start to the year. We continue to take steps to position the company to generate faster growth, higher margins and greater amounts of free cash flow and are looking forward to completing our USPI joint venture and working with both current and future health system partners.

So when you -- when we think about our volume trends in the quarter, we look across our inpatient book of business that we were able to generate. When we look at it in terms of the drivers from our core initiatives, whether that's targeted service line development or targeted capital investments, we have very good visibility by service line in terms of the incremental volume that we're driving. We spend a lot of time analyzing what we believe the incremental volume is related to the newly insured. It's not 100% accurate, but we think it's pretty close to what the aggregate trends are from the additional uninsured -- or the additional insured individuals. We look at the Medicaid book of business very closely compared to historical trends. And then the exchange business where we have visibility in terms of their previous insurance status, we're estimating roughly 1/3 were previously uninsured. And so we take those factors into consideration when we're estimating, when we were coming up with this 2/3 that we believe relates to our core growth. We don't have visibility into all the exchange patients because we may not have seen all of them in the past, but our experience seems to be consistent with some other studies on that as well.

Let's look at the experience we had with Vanguard. And I'd say compared to mergers that I've seen, experienced and that are taking place in other industries, we've done exceptionally well in having a very rapid and pretty seamless integration. I mean, if you were to visit hospitals that were formerly part of the Vanguard portfolio or the Tenet portfolio today, you would see evidence of techniques and strategies from both predecessor companies at work in those companies. And people talking about this as 1 company today. We have that, but part of that strategy was also to retain great people in the target organization. In fact, to do a merger in that case with an organization that had outstanding people to begin with and then to attempt to retain them. So as you know, we were successful in retaining and one of the regional leads in Vanguard. And in the case of USPI, we're retaining the entire management team, and you start with a company that has outstanding management, and they're staying, and that makes the integration job that much easier. So I think, Sheryl, let's make a distinction. We're not acquiring assets that are really troubled with bad management and require total turnarounds. It's quite the opposite: outstanding companies, great management, not requiring a turnaround. And so what we're working on is really integration, retention and putting cultures together as opposed to any sort of other type of activity. And that's so much easier to do, so much more successful and can be done so much faster"

And my issue with that, even though I recognize that even compared to the other hospital company results, yours are a notch better.

So first of all, I would suggest the experience so far in the investor-owned sector is not all the same. It's very differentiated between the 2 companies, and it's also quite likely that the companies that are performing very well in building volumes are doing some of the same things in order to drive it. We also, within the investor-owned sector, are outperforming the public sector than the not-for-profits in terms of volume growth. So there, you've got to remember that it's an industry that's 5x as big as the companies that everybody paid so much attention to. That would be my first point. Second point is the answer as to where the volume growth is coming from and what we really mean, we're talking about service lines and so forth, it's market-specific. And I'll contrast 2 different markets, Detroit, for example. Detroit has been a fast-growing market. We talked about it all last year. It's a very capital-driven strategy. It goes back to Vanguard's original acquisition in Detroit and the capital investments they made. But those capital investments that were made over a period of years that we are now in the process of continuing and completing are generating volume growth in that market. It's been very successful. A different example is Florida. Our historic Florida market, which is generating volume growth through service line development and specifically, Britt alluded to this, but they decided to focus on 4 particular service lines: surgical oncology; cardiovascular disease including surgery; interventional neurology and neurosurgery, by recruiting and building service lines around specific physicians who had very distinguished backgrounds and programs in this, who then, in turn, built those services within the hospital network. Not so capital-intensive, much more people-focused, obviously assisted by the intense investment we've made in advance clinical systems, but that's really the example of what we're talking about when we're talking about organic growth unrelated to the ACA, involving service lines, et cetera. And hope those examples help illustrate the points I made."

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release we issued yesterday, we delivered another strong quarter with improvements in our top and bottom line results. Slide 2 in our presentation provides an overview of the",1336,"Great. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release we issued yesterday, we delivered another strong quarter with improvements in our top and bottom line results. Slide 2 in our presentation provides an overview of the financial highlights. We achieved adjusted EBITDA of $568 million, which is a 23% increase over the prior year. We also completed our transactions with United Surgical Partners International and Aspen Healthcare in mid-June, which added $16 million of EBITDA in the quarter. Even after excluding that additional benefit, adjusted EBITDA was slightly above the top end of our guidance.
Inpatient volumes were relatively strong on a historical basis with growth of 1.7% over the second quarter of last year, making it one of our top 10 volume quarters over the past decade. I'll note this is the first time we faced a tougher comparison since we started reporting very strong volume growth in the second quarter of last year.
Before I share details on the strategic accomplishments for the quarter, I'd like to comment briefly on the new financial profile of Tenet and how you should think about our company going forward. With USPI and Aspen now part of our operations, we added a new ambulatory care segment, which you will see in our financial reporting. We're also providing some additional disclosures in our guidance to account for the various portfolio activities we announced this year.
While we still have more work to do on our portfolio, we hope this gives you a better understanding of what the new Tenet looks like. As you know, we've been taking steps to improve our acute care portfolio for some time. This includes forming strategic partnerships with other regional health care providers. Our goals here are to achieve market leadership positions and build the scale needed to be successful as the delivery system shifts toward more value-based care delivery and reimbursement.
As you'll see on Slides 4 and 5, we announced several transactions in the last few months that reflect this strategy. In June, we signed a definitive agreement to form a joint venture with Baptist Health System in Birmingham, Alabama. The new joint venture will combine our Brookwood Medical Center with Baptist's hospitals. Brookwood is a great facility on its own, and we believe it will be even better positioned as part of a larger regional system.
In July, we signed a definitive agreement to form a joint venture with Dignity Health and Ascension Health to operate the Carondelet Health Network in Tucson, Arizona. Tucson will be a new market for us, although we already have a meaningful presence in the state with big [ph] hospitals, 2 short-stay surgical hospitals and 12 surgery centers in the Phoenix area. 
Carondelet is also an extension of our partnership with Dignity Health, in which we have co-managed an accountable care organization in Arizona since early 2014. In both the Baptist and Carondelet joint ventures, Tenet will be the majority partner with management responsibility for the facilities, physicians and other related businesses that will be part of each network. 
In mid-July, we completed an agreement to lease and operate the Hi-Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree, California. Hi-Desert is a small community hospital, which has historically referred some of its more complex cases to 1 of our 2 hospitals in the nearby Coachella Valley. We already operate Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs and JFK Memorial in which are only about 20 miles from Hi-Desert. With Hi-Desert in our portfolio, we will now run 3 of the 4 hospitals in the greater Palm Springs area, solidifying our #1 position in that market.
We're also seeking to divest hospitals or exit markets where we don't believe we can achieve the scale needed to be the most efficient local health care provider. Slide 6 includes a summary of these activities. In June, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Saint Louis University Hospital. We're also pleased with the level of interest we received from bidders for our hospitals in Atlanta and North Carolina. We're far along in the process, and we remain on track to complete these divestitures by the end of the year or early next year.
Turning to our new ambulatory care segment. Pro forma same-facility system-wide cases increased 6.8%, including the results of USPI and Aspen in both periods. While Tenet's earnings benefited from only 2 weeks of contributions from USPI, we're pleased to report that USPI delivered solid results for the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
We remain very bullish about the strategy of combining with USPI and continue to believe that we are well positioned to benefit from consumers migrating to lower-cost, more convenient care centers. As a reminder, USPI gives us an immediate #1 position with scale in the fast-growing ambulatory surgery sector as high-quality assets and an exceptional team that enhances our long-term earnings potential.
Growing by partnering with and serving the vast not-for-profit sector is a key component of Tenet's strategy. We are pleased that all of USPI's 50 not-for-profit health system partners continue to be our partners today. We look forward to expanding these relationships through acquisitions and development opportunities, and we also believe USPI remains very well positioned to add new health system partners. 
For example, Dignity and Ascension are both very important partners of USPI, and we're pleased to deepen our relationship with these 2 outstanding organizations through the Carondelet transaction I mentioned earlier. 
Likewise in March, we announced a new joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health that brings together 5 hospitals in the Dallas area. Baylor Scott & White is one of USPI's most significant and long-standing partners. USPI's relationship with Baylor continues to grow through new opportunities, including its recent joint purchase in June of a new surgical hospital in an area north of Dallas. USPI also recently expanded its partnerships with key partners Dignity Health and Memorial
Conifer continues to perform well with an active pipeline of new business. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health in northern New England recently selected Conifer to manage to revenue cycle business for its hospitals and affiliated physicians. Dartmouth-Hitchcock is a large and prestigious client that serves a patient population of 1.2 million and provides access to more than 1,000 primary care doctors and specialists in almost every area of medicine. 
The organization was especially interested in Conifer because of its expertise in physician billing services, which we gained through our acquisition of SPI Healthcare last year. Having both hospital and physician billing capabilities in-house further differentiates Conifer as health systems increasingly look for one partner to manage these services.
Conifer's growth is also being driven by its proven capabilities and years of experience in value-based care. Health systems are continually engaging Conifer to craft risk stratification programs and manage population health. A notable recent example is the Yale New Haven Health System in Connecticut. We're currently handling value-based care arrangements for more than 5.4 million lives, which represents growth of 15% over last year.
For the second year in a row, Conifer received recognition as the comprehensive provider of financial and consulting services to accountable care organizations in a leading industry survey conducted by Black Book. This is another strong endorsement of Conifer's expertise in establishing and managing risk-based payment models. As health care continues to shift from volume to value, having these capabilities within Tenet is especially beneficial.
In summary, we had another solid quarter that beat our expectations. We took a number of important steps to continue building a stronger and more diversified portfolio, become a more capital-efficient operation that's more closely aligned with health care today and leverage our interconnected businesses to enhance Tenet's value proposition over the long term. 
We remain focused on aggressive implementation of our strategy to create sustainable value for our shareholders and improve the care delivery system for our patients and customers. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan Cancelmi for more specifics on our performance and our outlook. Dan?"

Our volume growth was strong in the quarter and in line with our expectations. EBITDA exceeded the high end of our guidance, even after we exclude the earnings of USPI and Aspen. 
Our new segment disclosures offer greater visibility into the performance of each of our businesses. We are updating guidance for 2015 and providing you for modeling purposes with the baseline pro forma view of 2015 to give you a sense of our portfolio on a going-forward basis once all of our announced M&A activities are completed. And finally, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion in net cash proceeds from our previously disclosed portfolio activities.
Adjusted EBITDA was $568 million in the quarter, which included $16 million from USPI and Aspen for the last 2 weeks in June. Excluding these earnings, we delivered EBITDA of $552 million, which exceeded our guidance of $500 million to $550 million. 
We generated EBITDA growth of $108 million or 23% compared to last year. This performance was driven by a combination of same-hospital volume growth and pricing, the recognition of $45 million in California Provider Fee revenues and 36% EBITDA growth by Conifer. These growth drivers were partially offset by a $25 million decline in Health IT incentives.
Moving to Slide 7. We made a number of changes to our financial disclosures to provide you with an enhanced view of our financial performance. The biggest change is that we now have a third segment that we refer to as our ambulatory care segment, which contains the results of our new USPI joint venture and Aspen. 
Our hospital segment now excludes the financial results and associated case volumes performed at the legacy Tenet surgery and imaging centers that we contributed to the USPI joint venture. For example, in previous quarters, the outpatient surgeries performed within our freestanding centers were reported in our adjusted admissions and outpatient surgery metrics of our hospital segment. These are now reported as cases in our ambulatory segment. There were no changes in how we report Conifer's results, and we will continue to report the business as a separate segment.
Slide 8 provides a helpful summary of the main drivers of our equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Historically, we had a small amount of equity earnings, which we reported in the revenue line. Since equity earnings are now more material, we are presenting them separately on our income statement just below the revenue line.
As you can see on Slide 9, our hospital volume trends remained very healthy in the quarter. We grew same-hospital admissions 1.7% and adjusted admissions increased 2.3%. Both were in line with our expectations. As you think about our volume this quarter, it is important to keep in mind that we started reporting much stronger growth rates in the second quarter of last year.
We generated same-hospital patient revenue growth of 6.9% and a 4.5% increase in patient revenue per adjusted admission. These results were driven by our volume growth in the quarter, improved commercial rates and the additional California Provider Fee revenue. 
From a cost perspective, our teams have done a great job generating the $100 million to $200 million of annual Vanguard synergies that we outlined when we announced the acquisition 2 years ago. We expect to exit the year on a $200 million annual run rate.
Slide 10 contains additional details on our uncompensated care expense as a percentage of adjusted revenue, which was 10.9% in the quarter, down from 12.2% last year. This was primarily due to the decline in our uninsured volumes as a result of benefits we are realizing from newly insured patients. Conifer has played a role in driving our uncompensated care expense lower by helping uninsured patients qualify for Medicaid. In the quarter, we qualified 96% of the people that we identified as being eligible for coverage, which is an exceptional result. This is up from 94% in the second quarter of last year.
Turning to Slide 11. Our ambulatory segment's pro forma case growth was very strong. Revenue per case in the quarter was softer than historical trends, primarily due to Aspen's recent investments to grow same-day cases. These cases have lower acuity and generate lower revenue per case. For anyone not familiar with USPI's historical financial reporting, the system-wide growth shown on the slide includes the case of performed consolidated and unconsolidated centers. This provides a better overview of volume performance across the entire portfolio.
On Slide 12, you'll see that our ambulatory segment generated $115 million of EBITDA on a pro forma basis, representing a year-over-year increase of 4.5%. 
Conifer delivered another quarter of outstanding year-over-year growth, with EBITDA increasing 36% to $60 million. This continues a trend of impressive growth in recent years. Slide 13 provides the historical details.
Conifer's on track to meet or slightly exceed $260 million of EBITDA in 2015, with the back half of the year averaging about $60 million per quarter with slightly more EBITDA in the fourth quarter than the third. We expect Conifer to see some earnings pressure in the third quarter from ICD-10 rollout activities and new client integrations but also has upside potential in the fourth quarter from client incentive opportunities. 
As Trevor mentioned, in June, we announced that Conifer won a contract to serve Dartmouth-Hitchcock. We often breakeven and sometimes have startup losses during the first 12 to 18 months of a new contract, so you will start to see the revenue from this contract in the third quarter, but you should not expect to see any significant benefit on the EBITDA line this year.
Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter, and we are raising our 2015 adjusted free cash flow guidance by $75 million to $225 million to $425 million. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $467 million in the quarter, up from $318 million in the second quarter of last year. After subtracting capital expenditures, we generated $292 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. 
We are also announcing today our decision to consolidate our 3 current group purchasing organizations down to 1. As part of our Performance Excellence Program, we are continuously pursuing opportunities to be more efficient. Over the past year, we conducted an exhaustive evaluation of our GPL contracts and are excited to announce that we have decided to work exclusively with HealthTrust Purchasing Group starting in the first quarter of 2016. As part of this change, we are moving our purchasing functions completely in-house. This will improve alignment and enhanced oversight over our spend. We look forward to partnering with HPG to drive increased savings within our supply chain.
Turning to guidance. Slide 14 provides our updated outlook for 2015, as well as the pro forma view of 2015 as if all of our previously disclosed M&A activity had been completed by January 1 of this year. In the third quarter, we expect to generate adjusted EBITDA of $550 million to $600 million. Our new Carondelet joint venture in Tucson and the sale of Saint Louis University Hospital are targeted for completion late in the third quarter. However, given the anticipated timing, I would not expect either of these transactions to significantly impact our third quarter results. The larger impact of our M&A activities will start to be seen in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year of 2015, we raised our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $175 million and increased our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $75 million. Our outlook includes assumptions regarding estimated completion dates for the transactions we listed in our press release. 
When thinking about our guidance for the year, we started with our original EBITDA guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion, which we continue to believe is a fair way to think about our outlook for the year prior to the impact from M&A. Next, we add about $225 million to $235 million of EBITDA from acquisition, primarily USPI and Aspen. Then we subtract roughly $50 million to $60 million in divestitures, which mostly impacts the fourth quarter. The net impact is $175 million increase in our guidance.
While we are not commenting today on 2016, we are presenting a pro forma view of 2015 to give you a sense for what Tenet looks like going forward once all of the previously disclosed M&A transactions are completed. On this pro forma basis, we would have expected to generate adjusted EBITDA of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion in 2015. At the midpoint of the range, our pro forma EBITDA margins for 2015 would have been 13.1%, up 110 basis points from the guidance we provided earlier this year.
When thinking about this pro forma guidance, we also started with our original EBITDA guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion. We then added $400 million to $450 million from acquisitions. Again, this is primarily driven by USPI and Aspen, although Hi-Desert, Birmingham and Carondelet and the larger impact on a full year basis. We then subtracted roughly $200 million to $250 million of EBITDA related to the divestitures. 
With all the acquisitions and divestitures that we have been discussing, another question that we frequently receive is what are the estimated net cash proceeds from all of these transactions? Slide 15 provides a high-level summary of which transactions will be sources and uses of cash. We expect to generate net cash proceeds of about $1 billion from all of these transactions. This does exclude what we paid to acquire interest in USPI and Aspen.
In summary, we strong results in the quarter. We drove volume growth, achieved favorable pricing increases and exceeded our EBITDA expectations for the quarter. We significantly advanced our strategies and are positioning Tenet to be a higher-margin, more capital-efficient, stronger free cash flow generating company, which you are starting to see in our higher pro forma margins and with our increase in free cash flow guidance for the year.

We've raised our guidance $175 million for 2015. We -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we added -- in terms of when you think about the second half, we added about $225 million to $235 million of earnings. USPI is the biggest component of that, along with Aspen. Then we have divestitures that will be occurring in the second half of the year but they're predominantly occurring in the fourth quarter. And so when you take the $225 million to $235 million and you back out the divestitures and the timing, it varies each transaction by month. But we're going to -- we backed up about $50 million to $60 million of earnings in the quarter. And that's how you get this net increase of $175 million. So we feel really good about the guidance for the back half of the year. Real quick, let me explain the guidance for the full year on a pro forma basis. You take our $2.1 billion midpoint when we started the year out, and then you add in acquisitions of $400 million to $450 million. Again, USPI and Aspen biggest components there, okay? Now let me say one thing there. That is 2015. That does not include all the growth that we're going to generate from the pipeline that Bill was just mentioning in the future. It also does not include the improvements that we're going to make in our Tucson facilities and the Birmingham facilities. So we're not providing guidance for 2016. What we're doing here is trying to provide a baseline for 2015 before -- assuming these transactions had occurred at the beginning of the year.

You said basically the right way that you think the think about this is to take the unchanged original guide and then apply various changes to that. So can you speak to a minute basically the unchanged baseline of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion with the midpoint of $2.1 billion of EBITDA as a fair way to look at the business? You obviously did somewhat better than your high end of guidance in this quarter on EBITDA. And it looks like -- and the sense I'm getting is that you're very pleased with the operations and prospects for the underlying business separate and apart from whether or not assets are coming out of that business. So can you speak to that part of the guidance for a little bit? Give us a sense of -- I know you took down the top end of adjusted admissions growth in the updated outlook.

When we look out to the second half of the year, we do still think the original range is still a fair way to think about it. But based on our results so far this year, certainly comfortable with the midpoint. If you had to think about it, the upper half of that range is likely where we would be. And so we feel good.

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release we issued yesterday, we delivered another strong quarter with improvements in our top and bottom line results. Slide 2 in our presentation provides an overview of the",1342,"Great. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release we issued yesterday, we delivered another strong quarter with improvements in our top and bottom line results. Slide 2 in our presentation provides an overview of the financial highlights. We achieved adjusted EBITDA of $568 million, which is a 23% increase over the prior year. We also completed our transactions with United Surgical Partners International and Aspen Healthcare in mid-June, which added $16 million of EBITDA in the quarter. Even after excluding that additional benefit, adjusted EBITDA was slightly above the top end of our guidance.
Inpatient volumes were relatively strong on a historical basis with growth of 1.7% over the second quarter of last year, making it one of our top 10 volume quarters over the past decade. I'll note this is the first time we faced a tougher comparison since we started reporting very strong volume growth in the second quarter of last year.
Before I share details on the strategic accomplishments for the quarter, I'd like to comment briefly on the new financial profile of Tenet and how you should think about our company going forward. With USPI and Aspen now part of our operations, we added a new ambulatory care segment, which you will see in our financial reporting. We're also providing some additional disclosures in our guidance to account for the various portfolio activities we announced this year.
While we still have more work to do on our portfolio, we hope this gives you a better understanding of what the new Tenet looks like. As you know, we've been taking steps to improve our acute care portfolio for some time. This includes forming strategic partnerships with other regional health care providers. Our goals here are to achieve market leadership positions and build the scale needed to be successful as the delivery system shifts toward more value-based care delivery and reimbursement.
As you'll see on Slides 4 and 5, we announced several transactions in the last few months that reflect this strategy. In June, we signed a definitive agreement to form a joint venture with Baptist Health System in Birmingham, Alabama. The new joint venture will combine our Brookwood Medical Center with Baptist's hospitals. Brookwood is a great facility on its own, and we believe it will be even better positioned as part of a larger regional system.
In July, we signed a definitive agreement to form a joint venture with Dignity Health and Ascension Health to operate the Carondelet Health Network in Tucson, Arizona. Tucson will be a new market for us, although we already have a meaningful presence in the state with 6 [ph] hospitals, 2 short-stay surgical hospitals and 12 surgery centers in the Phoenix area. 
Carondelet is also an extension of our partnership with Dignity Health, in which we have co-managed an accountable care organization in Arizona since early 2014. In both the Baptist and Carondelet joint ventures, Tenet will be the majority partner with management responsibility for the facilities, physicians and other related businesses that will be part of each network. 
In mid-July, we completed an agreement to lease and operate the Hi-Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree, California. Hi-Desert is a small community hospital, which has historically referred some of its more complex cases to 1 of our 2 hospitals in the nearby Coachella Valley. We already operate Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs and JFK Memorial in Indio, which are only about 20 miles from Hi-Desert. With Hi-Desert in our portfolio, we will now run 3 of the 4 hospitals in the greater Palm Springs area, solidifying our #1 position in that market.
We're also seeking to divest hospitals or exit markets,  where we don't believe we can achieve the scale needed to be the most efficient local health care provider. Slide 6 includes a summary of these activities. In June, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Saint Louis University Hospital. We are also pleased with the level of interest we received from bidders for our hospitals in Atlanta and North Carolina. We're far along in the process, and we remain on track to complete these divestitures by the end of the year or early next year.
Turning to our new ambulatory care segment. Pro forma same-facility system-wide cases increased 6.8%, including the results of USPI and Aspen in both periods. While Tenet's earnings benefited from only 2 weeks of contributions from USPI, we're pleased to report that USPI delivered solid results for the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
We remain very bullish about the strategy of combining with USPI and continue to believe that we are well positioned to benefit from consumers migrating to lower-cost, more convenient care centers. As a reminder, USPI gives us an immediate #1 position with scale in the fast-growing ambulatory surgery sector at high-quality assets and an exceptional team, and enhances our long-term earnings potential.
Growing by partnering with and serving the vast not-for-profit sector is a key component of Tenet's strategy. We are pleased that all of USPI's 50 not-for-profit health system partners continue to be our partners today. We look forward to expanding these relationships through acquisitions and development opportunities, and we also believe USPI remains very well positioned to add new health system partners. 
For example, Dignity and Ascension are both very important partners of USPI, and we're pleased to deepen our relationship with these 2 outstanding organizations through the Carondelet transaction I mentioned earlier. 
Likewise in March, we announced a new joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health that brings together 5 hospitals in the Dallas area. Baylor Scott & White is one of USPI's most significant and long-standing partners. USPI's relationship with Baylor continues to grow through new opportunities, including its recent joint purchase in June of a new surgical hospital in an area north of Dallas. USPI also recently expanded its partnerships with key partners, Dignity Health and Memorial Hermann. 
Conifer continues to perform well with an active pipeline of new business. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health in northern New England recently selected Conifer to manage the revenue cycle business for its hospitals and affiliated physicians. Dartmouth-Hitchcock is a large and prestigious client that serves a patient population of 1.2 million and provides access to more than 1,000 primary care doctors and specialists in almost area -- every area of medicine. 
The organization was especially interested in Conifer because of its expertise in physician billing services, which we gained through our acquisition of SPi Healthcare last year. Having both hospital and physician billing capabilities in-house further differentiates Conifer as health systems increasingly look for one partner to manage these services.
Conifer's growth is also being driven by its proven capabilities and years of experience in value-based care. Health systems are continually engaging Conifer to craft risk stratification programs and manage population health. A notable recent example is the Yale New Haven Health System in Connecticut. We're currently handling value-based care arrangements for more than 5.4 million lives, which represents growth of 15% over last year.
For the second year in a row, Conifer received recognition as the top ranked provider of financial and consulting services to accountable care organizations in a leading industry survey conducted by Black Book. This is another strong endorsement of Conifer's expertise in establishing and managing risk-based payment models. As health care continues to shift from volume to value, having these capabilities within Tenet is especially beneficial.
In summary, we had another solid quarter that beat our expectations. We took a number of important steps to continue building a stronger and more diversified portfolio, become a more capital-efficient operation that's more closely aligned with health care today and leverage our interconnected businesses to enhance Tenet's value proposition over the long term. 
We remain focused on aggressive implementation of our strategy to create sustainable value for our shareholders and improve the care delivery system for our patients and customers. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan Cancelmi for more specifics on our performance and our outlook. Dan?"

Our volume growth was strong in the quarter and in line with our expectations. EBITDA exceeded the high end of our guidance, even after we exclude the earnings of USPI and Aspen. 
Our new segment disclosures offer greater visibility into the performance of each of our businesses. We are updating guidance for 2015 and providing you for modeling purposes with a baseline pro forma view of 2015 to give you a sense of our portfolio on a going-forward basis once all of our announced M&A activities are completed. And finally, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion in net cash proceeds from our previously disclosed portfolio activities.
Adjusted EBITDA was $568 million in the quarter, which included $16 million from USPI and Aspen for the last 2 weeks in June. Excluding these earnings, we delivered EBITDA of $552 million, which exceeded our guidance of $500 million to $550 million. 
We generated EBITDA growth of $108 million or 23% compared to last year. This performance was driven by a combination of same-hospital volume growth and pricing, the recognition of $45 million in California Provider Fee revenues and 36% EBITDA growth by Conifer. These growth drivers were partially offset by a $25 million decline in Health IT incentives.
Moving to Slide 7. We made a number of changes to our financial disclosures to provide you with an enhanced view of our financial performance. The biggest change is that we now have a third segment that we refer to as our ambulatory care segment, which contains the results of our new USPI joint venture and Aspen. 
Our hospital segment now excludes the financial results and associated case volumes performed at the legacy Tenet surgery and imaging centers that we contributed to the USPI joint venture. For example, in previous quarters, the outpatient surgeries performed within our freestanding centers were reported in our adjusted admissions and outpatient surgery metrics of our hospital segment. These are now reported as cases in our ambulatory segment. There were no changes in how we report Conifer's results, and we will continue to report the business as a separate segment.
Slide 8 provides a helpful summary of the main drivers of our equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Historically, we had a small amount of equity earnings, which we reported in the revenue line. Since equity earnings are now more material, we are presenting them separately on our income statement just below the revenue line.
As you can see on Slide 9, our hospital volume trends remained very healthy in the quarter. We grew same-hospital admissions 1.7% and adjusted admissions increased 2.3%. Both were in line with our expectations. As you think about our volume this quarter, it is important to keep in mind that we started reporting much stronger growth rates in the second quarter of last year.
We generated same-hospital patient revenue growth of 6.9% and a 4.5% increase in patient revenue per adjusted admission. These results were driven by our volume growth in the quarter, improved commercial rates and the additional California Provider Fee revenue. 
From a cost perspective, our teams have done a great job generating the $100 million to $200 million of the annual Vanguard synergies that we outlined when we announced the acquisition 2 years ago. We expect to exit the year on a $200 million annual run rate.
Slide 10 contains additional details on our uncompensated care expense as a percentage of adjusted revenue, which was 10.9% in the quarter, down from 12.2% last year. This was primarily due to the decline in our uninsured volumes as a result of benefits we are realizing from newly insured patients. Conifer has played a role in driving our uncompensated care expense lower by helping uninsured patients qualify for Medicaid. In the quarter, we qualified 96% of the people that we identified as being eligible for coverage, which is an exceptional result. This is up from 94% in the second quarter of last year.
Turning to Slide 11. Our ambulatory segment's pro forma case growth was very strong. Revenue per case in the quarter was softer than historical trends, primarily due to Aspen's recent investments to grow same-day cases. These cases have lower acuity and generate lower revenue per case. For anyone not familiar with USPI's historical financial reporting, the system-wide growth shown on the slide includes the case of performed at consolidated and unconsolidated centers. This provides a better overview of volume performance across the entire portfolio.
On Slide 12, you'll see that our ambulatory segment generated $115 million of EBITDA on a pro forma basis, representing a year-over-year increase of 4.5%. 
Conifer delivered another quarter of outstanding year-over-year growth, with EBITDA increasing 36% to $60 million. This continues a trend of impressive growth in recent years. Slide 13 provides the historical details.
Conifer is on track to meet or slightly exceed $260 million of EBITDA in 2015, with the back half of the year averaging about $60 million per quarter with slightly more EBITDA in the fourth quarter than the third. We expect Conifer to see some earnings pressure in the third quarter from ICD-10 rollout activities and new client integrations, but it also has upside potential in the fourth quarter from client incentive opportunities. 
As Trevor mentioned, in June, we announced that Conifer won a contract to serve Dartmouth-Hitchcock. We often breakeven and sometimes have startup losses during the first 12 to 18 months of a new contract, so you will start to see the revenue from this contract in the third quarter, but you should not expect to see any significant benefit on the EBITDA line this year.
Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter, and we are raising our 2015 adjusted free cash flow guidance by $75 million to $225 million to $425 million. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $467 million in the quarter, up from $318 million in the second quarter of last year. After subtracting capital expenditures, we generated $292 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. 
We are also announcing today our decision to consolidate our 3 current group purchasing organizations down to 1. As part of our Performance Excellence Program, we are continuously pursuing opportunities to be more efficient. Over the past year, we conducted an exhaustive evaluation of our GPO contracts and are excited to announce that we have decided to work exclusively with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, starting in the first quarter of 2016. As part of this change, we are moving our purchasing functions completely in-house. This will improve alignment and enhanced oversight over our spend. We look forward to partnering with HPG to drive increased savings within our supply chain.
Turning to guidance. Slide 14 provides our updated outlook for 2015 as well as a pro forma view of 2015 as if all of our previously disclosed M&A activity had been completed by January 1 of this year. In the third quarter, we expect to generate adjusted EBITDA of $550 million to $600 million. Our new Carondelet joint venture in Tucson and the sale of Saint Louis University Hospital are targeted for completion late in the third quarter. However, given the anticipated timing, I would not expect either of these transactions to significantly impact our third quarter results. The larger impact of our M&A activities will start to be seen in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year of 2015, we raised our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $175 million and increased our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $75 million. Our outlook includes assumptions regarding estimated completion dates for the transactions we listed in our press release. 
When thinking about our guidance for the year, we started with our original EBITDA guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion, which we continue to believe is a fair way to think about our outlook for the year prior to the impact from M&A. Next, we add about $225 million to $235 million of EBITDA from acquisitions, primarily USPI and Aspen. Then we subtract roughly $50 million to $60 million in divestitures, which mostly impacts the fourth quarter. The net impact is $175 million increase in our guidance.
While we are not commenting today on 2016, we are presenting a pro forma view of 2015 to give you a sense for what Tenet looks like going forward once all of the previously disclosed M&A  transactions are completed. On this pro forma basis, we would have expected to generate adjusted EBITDA of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion in 2015. At the midpoint of the range, our pro forma EBITDA margins for 2015 would have been 13.1%, up 110 basis points from the guidance we provided earlier this year.
When thinking about this pro forma guidance, we also started with our original EBITDA guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion. We then added $400 million to $450 million from acquisitions. Again, this is primarily driven by USPI and Aspen, although Hi-Desert, Birmingham and Carondelet has a the larger impact on a full year basis. We then subtracted roughly $200 million to $250 million of EBITDA related to the divestitures. 
With all the acquisitions and divestitures that we have been discussing, another question that we frequently receive is what are the estimated net cash proceeds from all of these transactions? Slide 15 provides a high-level summary of which transactions will be sources and uses of cash. We expect to generate net cash proceeds of about $1 billion from all of these transactions. This does exclude what we paid to acquire our interest in USPI and Aspen.
In summary, we produced strong results in the quarter. We drove volume growth, achieved favorable pricing increases and exceeded our EBITDA expectations for the quarter. We significantly advanced our strategies and are positioning Tenet to be a higher-margin, more capital-efficient, stronger free cash flow-generating company, which you are starting to see in our higher pro forma margins and with our increase in free cash flow guidance for the year.

As I mentioned in my remarks, Conifer has done a great job qualifying individuals for a Medicaid coverage and providing outreach efforts to individuals also looking at exchange offerings. So we couldn't be more pleased with our success there. We did continue to grow our exchange volumes sequentially, which is nice to see. And as we've mentioned quite a number of times on previous calls, we're very well positioned from a contracting perspective. Almost all of our hospitals have contracts with the most affordable plans.

But seems to me that the USPI and Aspen numbers or the acquired numbers seem a little bit light, especially relevant to the size of the outsource, I just mean by that, right, if you annualize 1H or annualize the $16 million you got for 2 weeks that will get you to about $415 million at the low end and then obviously all the deals are coming in, which should be all consolidated. So you'd assume that would all flow through the EBITDA line. So is there potential upside to some of those numbers? Then on the flip side, the sales there for Baylor Scott & White JV, some of that earnings comes back through the income and unconsolidated line, I assume. So I mean, how should we think about all those moving parts on a total EBITDA line? It sounds like those were very profitable hospitals in reality.

Their results in the quarter were in line with where we expected them to be, and I believe that's the same case with Bill and Jason and their team. So USPI had a very good quarter, and the results this year are tracking in line with where we thought the business would be. Let me try to give a broad overview of the guidance. We've raised our guidance $175 million for 2015. We -- as I mentioned in my remarks, where we added -- in terms of when you think about the second half, we added about $225 million to $235 million of earnings. USPI is the biggest component of that, along with Aspen. Then we have divestitures that will be occurring in the second half of the year but they're predominantly occurring in the fourth quarter. And so when you take the $225 million to $235 million and you back out the divestitures and the timing, it varies with each transaction by month. But we're going to -- we backed out about $50 million to $60 million of earnings in the quarter. And that's how you get this net increase of $175 million. So we feel really good about the guidance for the back half of the year. Real quick, let me explain the guidance for the full year on a pro forma basis. You take our $2.1 billion midpoint when we started the year out, and then you add in acquisitions of $400 million to $450 million. Again, the USPI and Aspen, biggest components there. Okay? Now let me say one thing there. That is 2015. It does not include all the growth that we're going to generate from the pipeline that Bill was just mentioning in the future. It also does not include the improvements that we're going to make in our Tucson facilities and the Birmingham facilities. So we're not providing guidance for 2016. What we're doing here is trying to provide a baseline for 2015 before -- assuming these transactions had occurred at the beginning of the year. And it does not include the future growth prospects that we're going to generate."

Also with Aspen, we had a very strong outpatient surgical case growth over in the U.K. So it was a welcome robust quarter for us all the way around."

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release we issued yesterday, we delivered another strong quarter with improvements in our top and bottom line results. Slide 2 in our presentation provides an overview of the",1342,"Great. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release we issued yesterday, we delivered another strong quarter with improvements in our top and bottom line results. Slide 2 in our presentation provides an overview of the financial highlights. We achieved adjusted EBITDA of $568 million, which is a 23% increase over the prior year. We also completed our transactions with United Surgical Partners International and Aspen Healthcare in mid-June, which added $16 million of EBITDA in the quarter. Even after excluding that additional benefit, adjusted EBITDA was slightly above the top end of our guidance.
Inpatient volumes were relatively strong on a historical basis with growth of 1.7% over the second quarter of last year, making it one of our top 10 volume quarters over the past decade. I'll note this is the first time we faced a tougher comparison since we started reporting very strong volume growth in the second quarter of last year.
Before I share details on the strategic accomplishments for the quarter, I'd like to comment briefly on the new financial profile of Tenet and how you should think about our company going forward. With USPI and Aspen now part of our operations, we added a new ambulatory care segment, which you will see in our financial reporting. We're also providing some additional disclosures in our guidance to account for the various portfolio activities we announced this year.
While we still have more work to do on our portfolio, we hope this gives you a better understanding of what the new Tenet looks like. As you know, we've been taking steps to improve our acute care portfolio for some time. This includes forming strategic partnerships with other regional health care providers. Our goals here are to achieve market leadership positions and build the scale needed to be successful as the delivery system shifts toward more value-based care delivery and reimbursement.
As you'll see on Slides 4 and 5, we announced several transactions in the last few months that reflect this strategy. In June, we signed a definitive agreement to form a joint venture with Baptist Health System in Birmingham, Alabama. The new joint venture will combine our Brookwood Medical Center with Baptist's hospitals. Brookwood is a great facility on its own, and we believe it will be even better positioned as part of a larger regional system.
In July, we signed a definitive agreement to form a joint venture with Dignity Health and Ascension Health to operate the Carondelet Health Network in Tucson, Arizona. Tucson will be a new market for us, although we already have a meaningful presence in the state with 6 [ph] hospitals, 2 short-stay surgical hospitals and 12 surgery centers in the Phoenix area. 
Carondelet is also an extension of our partnership with Dignity Health, in which we have co-managed an accountable care organization in Arizona since early 2014. In both the Baptist and Carondelet joint ventures, Tenet will be the majority partner with management responsibility for the facilities, physicians and other related businesses that will be part of each network. 
In mid-July, we completed an agreement to lease and operate the Hi-Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree, California. Hi-Desert is a small community hospital, which has historically referred some of its more complex cases to 1 of our 2 hospitals in the nearby Coachella Valley. We already operate Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs and JFK Memorial in Indio, which are only about 20 miles from Hi-Desert. With Hi-Desert in our portfolio, we will now run 3 of the 4 hospitals in the greater Palm Springs area, solidifying our #1 position in that market.
We're also seeking to divest hospitals or exit markets,  where we don't believe we can achieve the scale needed to be the most efficient local health care provider. Slide 6 includes a summary of these activities. In June, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Saint Louis University Hospital. We are also pleased with the level of interest we received from bidders for our hospitals in Atlanta and North Carolina. We're far along in the process, and we remain on track to complete these divestitures by the end of the year or early next year.
Turning to our new ambulatory care segment. Pro forma same-facility system-wide cases increased 6.8%, including the results of USPI and Aspen in both periods. While Tenet's earnings benefited from only 2 weeks of contributions from USPI, we're pleased to report that USPI delivered solid results for the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
We remain very bullish about the strategy of combining with USPI and continue to believe that we are well positioned to benefit from consumers migrating to lower-cost, more convenient care centers. As a reminder, USPI gives us an immediate #1 position with scale in the fast-growing ambulatory surgery sector, adds high-quality assets and an exceptional team, and enhances our long-term earnings potential.
Growing by partnering with and serving the vast not-for-profit sector is a key component of Tenet's strategy. We are pleased that all of USPI's 50 not-for-profit health system partners continue to be our partners today. We look forward to expanding these relationships through acquisitions and development opportunities, and we also believe USPI remains very well positioned to add new health system partners. 
For example, Dignity and Ascension are both very important partners of USPI, and we're pleased to deepen our relationship with these 2 outstanding organizations through the Carondelet transaction I mentioned earlier. 
Likewise in March, we announced a new joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health that brings together 5 hospitals in the Dallas area. Baylor Scott & White is one of USPI's most significant and long-standing partners. USPI's relationship with Baylor continues to grow through new opportunities, including its recent joint purchase in June of a new surgical hospital in an area north of Dallas. USPI also recently expanded its partnerships with key partners, Dignity Health and Memorial Hermann. 
Conifer continues to perform well with an active pipeline of new business. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health in northern New England recently selected Conifer to manage the revenue cycle business for its hospitals and affiliated physicians. Dartmouth-Hitchcock is a large and prestigious client that serves a patient population of 1.2 million and provides access to more than 1,000 primary care doctors and specialists in almost area -- every area of medicine. 
The organization was especially interested in Conifer because of its expertise in physician billing services, which we gained through our acquisition of SPi Healthcare last year. Having both hospital and physician billing capabilities in-house further differentiates Conifer as health systems increasingly look for one partner to manage these services.
Conifer's growth is also being driven by its proven capabilities and years of experience in value-based care. Health systems are continually engaging Conifer to craft risk stratification programs and manage population health. A notable recent example is the Yale New Haven Health System in Connecticut. We're currently handling value-based care arrangements for more than 5.4 million lives, which represents growth of 15% over last year.
For the second year in a row, Conifer received recognition as the top ranked provider of financial and consulting services to accountable care organizations in a leading industry survey conducted by Black Book. This is another strong endorsement of Conifer's expertise in establishing and managing risk-based payment models. As health care continues to shift from volume to value, having these capabilities within Tenet is especially beneficial.
In summary, we had another solid quarter that beat our expectations. We took a number of important steps to continue building a stronger and more diversified portfolio, become a more capital-efficient operation that's more closely aligned with health care today and leverage our interconnected businesses to enhance Tenet's value proposition over the long term. 
We remain focused on aggressive implementation of our strategy to create sustainable value for our shareholders and improve the care delivery system for our patients and customers. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan Cancelmi for more specifics on our performance and our outlook. Dan?"
107911,304166673,848373,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. There are several points that I would like to make today. Our volume growth was strong in the quarter and in line with our expectations.

Our volume growth was strong in the quarter and in line with our expectations. EBITDA exceeded the high end of our guidance, even after we exclude the earnings of USPI and Aspen. 
Our new segment disclosures offer greater visibility into the performance of each of our businesses. We are updating guidance for 2015 and providing you for modeling purposes with a baseline pro forma view of 2015 to give you a sense of our portfolio on a going-forward basis once all of our announced M&A activities are completed. And finally, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion in net cash proceeds from our previously disclosed portfolio activities.
Adjusted EBITDA was $568 million in the quarter, which included $16 million from USPI and Aspen for the last 2 weeks in June. Excluding these earnings, we delivered EBITDA of $552 million, which exceeded our guidance of $500 million to $550 million. 
We generated EBITDA growth of $108 million or 23% compared to last year. This performance was driven by a combination of same-hospital volume growth and pricing, the recognition of $45 million in California Provider Fee revenues and 36% EBITDA growth by Conifer. These growth drivers were partially offset by a $25 million decline in Health IT incentives.
Moving to Slide 7. We made a number of changes to our financial disclosures to provide you with an enhanced view of our financial performance. The biggest change is that we now have a third segment that we refer to as our ambulatory care segment, which contains the results of our new USPI joint venture and Aspen. 
Our hospital segment now excludes the financial results and associated case volumes performed at the legacy Tenet surgery and imaging centers that we contributed to the USPI joint venture. For example, in previous quarters, the outpatient surgeries performed within our freestanding centers were reported in our adjusted admissions and outpatient surgery metrics of our hospital segment. These are now reported as cases in our ambulatory segment. There were no changes in how we report Conifer's results, and we will continue to report the business as a separate segment.
Slide 8 provides a helpful summary of the main drivers of our equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Historically, we had a small amount of equity earnings, which we reported in the revenue line. Since equity earnings are now more material, we are presenting them separately on our income statement just below the revenue line.
As you can see on Slide 9, our hospital volume trends remained very healthy in the quarter. We grew same-hospital admissions 1.7% and adjusted admissions increased 2.3%. Both were in line with our expectations. As you think about our volume this quarter, it is important to keep in mind that we started reporting much stronger growth rates in the second quarter of last year.
We generated same-hospital patient revenue growth of 6.9% and a 4.5% increase in patient revenue per adjusted admission. These results were driven by our volume growth in the quarter, improved commercial rates and the additional California Provider Fee revenue. 
From a cost perspective, our teams have done a great job generating the $100 million to $200 million of the annual Vanguard synergies that we outlined when we announced the acquisition 2 years ago. We expect to exit the year on a $200 million annual run rate.
Slide 10 contains additional details on our uncompensated care expense as a percentage of adjusted revenue, which was 10.9% in the quarter, down from 12.2% last year. This was primarily due to the decline in our uninsured volumes as a result of benefits we are realizing from newly insured patients. Conifer has played a role in driving our uncompensated care expense lower by helping uninsured patients qualify for Medicaid. In the quarter, we qualified 96% of the people that we identified as being eligible for coverage, which is an exceptional result. This is up from 94% in the second quarter of last year.
Turning to Slide 11. Our ambulatory segment's pro forma case growth was very strong. Revenue per case in the quarter was softer than historical trends, primarily due to Aspen's recent investments to grow same-day cases. These cases have lower acuity and generate lower revenue per case. For anyone not familiar with USPI's historical financial reporting, the system-wide growth shown on the slide includes the case of performed at consolidated and unconsolidated centers. This provides a better overview of volume performance across the entire portfolio.
On Slide 12, you'll see that our ambulatory segment generated $115 million of EBITDA on a pro forma basis, representing a year-over-year increase of 4.5%. 
Conifer delivered another quarter of outstanding year-over-year growth, with EBITDA increasing 36% to $60 million. This continues a trend of impressive growth in recent years. Slide 13 provides the historical details.
Conifer is on track to meet or slightly exceed $260 million of EBITDA in 2015, with the back half of the year averaging about $60 million per quarter with slightly more EBITDA in the fourth quarter than the third. We expect Conifer to see some earnings pressure in the third quarter from ICD-10 rollout activities and new client integrations, but it also has upside potential in the fourth quarter from client incentive opportunities. 
As Trevor mentioned, in June, we announced that Conifer won a contract to serve Dartmouth-Hitchcock. We often breakeven and sometimes have startup losses during the first 12 to 18 months of a new contract, so you will start to see the revenue from this contract in the third quarter, but you should not expect to see any significant benefit on the EBITDA line this year.
Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter, and we are raising our 2015 adjusted free cash flow guidance by $75 million to $225 million to $425 million. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $467 million in the quarter, up from $318 million in the second quarter of last year. After subtracting capital expenditures, we generated $292 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. 
We are also announcing today our decision to consolidate our 3 current group purchasing organizations down to 1. As part of our Performance Excellence Program, we are continuously pursuing opportunities to be more efficient. Over the past year, we conducted an exhaustive evaluation of our GPO contracts and are excited to announce that we have decided to work exclusively with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, starting in the first quarter of 2016. As part of this change, we are moving our purchasing functions completely in-house. This will improve alignment and enhance oversight over our spend. We look forward to partnering with HPG to drive increased savings within our supply chain.
Turning to guidance. Slide 14 provides our updated outlook for 2015 as well as a pro forma view of 2015 as if all of our previously disclosed M&A activity had been completed by January 1 of this year. In the third quarter, we expect to generate adjusted EBITDA of $550 million to $600 million. Our new Carondelet joint venture in Tucson and the sale of Saint Louis University Hospital are targeted for completion late in the third quarter. However, given the anticipated timing, I would not expect either of these transactions to significantly impact our third quarter results. The larger impact of our M&A activities will start to be seen in the fourth quarter. 
For the full year of 2015, we raised our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $175 million and increased our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $75 million. Our outlook includes assumptions regarding estimated completion dates for the transactions we listed in our press release. 
When thinking about our guidance for the year, we started with our original EBITDA guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion, which we continue to believe is a fair way to think about our outlook for the year prior to the impact from M&A. Next, we add about $225 million to $235 million of EBITDA from acquisitions, primarily USPI and Aspen. Then we subtract roughly $50 million to $60 million in divestitures, which mostly impacts the fourth quarter. The net impact is $175 million increase in our guidance.
While we are not commenting today on 2016, we are presenting a pro forma view of 2015 to give you a sense for what Tenet looks like going forward once all of the previously disclosed M&A transactions are completed. On this pro forma basis, we would have expected to generate adjusted EBITDA of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion in 2015. At the midpoint of the range, our pro forma EBITDA margins for 2015 would have been 13.1%, up 110 basis points from the guidance we provided earlier this year.
When thinking about this pro forma guidance, we also started with our original EBITDA guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion. We then added $400 million to $450 million from acquisitions. Again, this is primarily driven by USPI and Aspen, although Hi-Desert, Birmingham and Carondelet have a the larger impact on a full year basis. We then subtracted roughly $200 million to $250 million of EBITDA related to the divestitures. 
With all the acquisitions and divestitures that we have been discussing, another question that we frequently receive is what are the estimated net cash proceeds from all of these transactions? Slide 15 provides a high-level summary of which transactions will be sources and uses of cash. We expect to generate net cash proceeds of about $1 billion from all of these transactions. This does exclude what we paid to acquire our interest in USPI and Aspen.
In summary, we produced strong results in the quarter. We drove volume growth, achieved favorable pricing increases and exceeded our EBITDA expectations for the quarter. We significantly advanced our strategies and are positioning Tenet to be a higher-margin, more capital-efficient, stronger free cash flow-generating company, which you are starting to see in our higher pro forma margins and with our increase in free cash flow guidance for the year.

But seems to me that the USPI and Aspen numbers or the acquired numbers seem a little bit light, especially relevant to the size of the outsource, I just mean by that, right, if you annualize 1H or annualize the $16 million you got for 2 weeks that will get you to about $415 million at the low end and then obviously all the deals are coming in, which should be all consolidated. So you'd assume that would all flow through the EBITDA line. So is there potential upside to some of those numbers? Then on the flip side, the sales there for Baylor Scott & White JV, some of that earnings comes back through the income and unconsolidated line, I assume.

We've raised our guidance $175 million for 2015. We -- as I mentioned in my remarks, where we added -- in terms of when you think about the second half, we added about $225 million to $235 million of earnings. USPI is the biggest component of that, along with Aspen. Then we have divestitures that will be occurring in the second half of the year but they're predominantly occurring in the fourth quarter. And so when you take the $225 million to $235 million and you back out the divestitures and the timing, it varies with each transaction by month. But we're going to -- we backed out about $50 million to $60 million of earnings in the quarter. And that's how you get this net increase of $175 million. So we feel really good about the guidance for the back half of the year. Real quick, let me explain the guidance for the full year on a pro forma basis. You take our $2.1 billion midpoint when we started the year out, and then you add in acquisitions of $400 million to $450 million. Again, the USPI and Aspen, biggest components there. Okay? Now let me say one thing there. That is 2015. It does not include all the growth that we're going to generate from the pipeline that Bill was just mentioning in the future. It also does not include the improvements that we're going to make in our Tucson facilities and the Birmingham facilities. So we're not providing guidance for 2016.

And that's part of why we're making the portfolio moves that we are and engaging in partnership strategies that we are and changing the overall nature of our business in the way we are. These -- with respect to managed care industry, these are very large companies to begin with. We have important relationships with all of them. It's also important, just like we always like to remind people, that 80% of the hospital industry is not-for-profit, local hospitals. The biggest payers that we typically deal with are not the big companies that you know but the state-based Blue Cross plans, most of which are not-for-profit. And while consolidation among buyers always tends to put pressure on suppliers is kind of Strategy 101, we feel like we're very well positioned. First of all, we have very important relationships with all these companies. We have very senior-level relationships with them. We have a highly automated, very efficient revenue cycle with them that we are generally a better value for them than other providers that they deal with in our markets. And we believe that we'll be just fine as we go through this. The -- it is interesting to watch and the consolidation in that sector seems to be happening very quickly, but I think I'm very comfortable with how we're positioned. We're a low-cost, high-value provider that has very strong relationships with them. And that should put us in a very favorable position to deal with whatever effects of this consolidation there may be."

I'd like to start with the financial highlights of the quarter, which are summarized on Slide 2.

I'd like to start with the financial highlights of the quarter, which are summarized on Slide 2. We delivered third quarter EBITDA consistent with our guidance range, USPI's results were in line with our expectation, and Conifer achieved strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and EBITDA. 
Our adjusted free cash flow was also very strong in the third quarter and exceeded our expectations. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, in the third quarter of 2015, we drove an increase of 23% in EBITDA and improved our EBITDA margin by 110 basis points. I'm pleased with the way we grew our case mix and high acuity services as well as our performance in pricing growth and cost control. These are all very strong indicators that our strategies to grow the drivers of value are working.
On our second quarter earnings call in August, we discussed our expectations that hospital volume growth would soften in the third and fourth quarters relative to the first half of the year. Our record volume growth in the third quarter of 2014 provided us with a very tough comparison. And while our adjusted admissions growth was in line with the guidance we provided, hospital admissions were slightly weaker than we anticipated. 
Much of the pressure on inpatient admissions was due to a handful of anomalies or local market-specific issues that we've been resolving over the past few months. We're pleased to have achieved increases in higher acuity procedures, largely driven by investments that we've made in key specialty areas. For example, joint replacements are up over 5%, infectious disease surgical cases increased over 15% and neurosurgical cases grew by about 9%. This helped us to generate a 6.5% increase in same-hospital revenue growth during the quarter in spite of the softer volumes.
We achieved solid volume growth in our outpatient facilities. Our ambulatory segment drove a 6.3% increase in volumes and remains on track to deliver strong performance in the fourth quarter. Based on our performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reconfirming the midpoint of our adjusted 2015 EBITDA outlook and narrowing the range. We also are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $100 million to a new range of $350 million to $500 million.
We remain enthusiastic about Tenet's opportunities under the Affordable Care Act. The third season of open enrollment kicked off on Sunday, and we're pleased that 90% of Tenet's hospitals are included in in-network with the lowest-cost Silver plans on the exchanges. That is the highest percentage we've achieved in the last 3 enrollment periods. 
In addition, HHS is focusing enrollment efforts on 5 cities, including Dallas, Houston, Miami and Chicago where we generate roughly 20% of our hospital admissions. We are optimistic about 2016 and focused on connecting eligible individuals within families with coverage options.
Turning to Slide 3. In recent months, we've announced several transactions to improve our hospital portfolio, and I'd like to give you a quick update. We completed our joint ventures in Tucson in Birmingham and our acquisition of the Hi-Desert Medical Center near Palm Springs, California. In total, we invested roughly $300 million in these transactions. 
We also completed the sale of St. Louis University Hospital at the end of August and expect to finalize the sale of a majority interest in our 4 Dallas hospitals into a joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health in the fourth quarter. This morning, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our North Carolina hospitals to Duke LifePoint Healthcare. We also expect to sell our Atlanta hospitals as early as the first quarter of 2016.
We expect the divestitures in Dallas, Atlanta and North Carolina to generate roughly $1 billion in cash proceeds. We expect the cash will be realized at various times over the next 6 months as individual transactions are completed and receivables from the divested operations are collected. The proceeds may come at times when we have borrowings on our revolving credit line due to the timing of interest payments and seasonal cash outflows. So as a practical matter, the first use of the income in cash is to reduce those outstanding borrowings. 
I'd like now to turn to Slide 4 and spend a few minutes discussing how we intend to use the remaining proceeds and how we're thinking about capital deployment over the next few years. I feel confident about our business strategy and the opportunities for us to create value through organic growth augmented by strategic acquisitions in our business. But when it comes to total deployment, we need to be flexible and adjust priorities based on the circumstances. 
For example, on last quarter's conference call, with our stock in the high $50s, I suggested that one option would be to use the divestiture proceeds to pay down debt, specifically our 8% notes due in 2020, which are callable at 104 [ph] today for a total of $780 million. The volatility in both the debt and equity markets since then has caused us to reevaluate and postpone calling those notes, and instead we're adding the ability to repurchase shares to the alternative that we have available.
We view share repurchases as an important tool to have in our toolkit. We have a strong track record of buying back shares at low prices, including $1.2 billion in stock buybacks since 2011 at an average price that is well below today's price. We announced yesterday that our board has approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $500 million of our stock through December 2016.
Taking a big picture perspective on our sources and uses of cash over the next 5 years, we expect to generate enough free cash flow, together with currently available liquidity, to fully fund the obligations to our minority partners, including the purchase of the rest of USPI. We expect our first installment payment, which is the only payment in 2016, will be between $125 million and $135 million. 
We also expect to have sufficient cash to fund the robust program of surgery center acquisitions at USPI while continuing to delever through EBITDA growth. We feel confident in our ability to invest successfully in the growth of our business, increase the of our company and when appropriate, repurchase shares. 
We've already demonstrated our ability to do so. In 2008, we launched Conifer and created a business that is a market leader today, worth far more than the investment we made to build this business. 2 years later, we began to invest in outpatient centers that were key to the creation of our joint venture with USPI. We grew a $300 million investment into $900 million in value, which we were able to utilize to create the joint venture. 
We also gained national and regional scale through the Vanguard acquisition and increased the [indiscernible] markets in which we're #1 or #2 in market share. Our teams have also done a great job identifying and capturing synergies, and we've built a structural capability to create value in acquired businesses. We're on track to generate over $200 million in synergies from the Vanguard hospitals, exceeding the high end of our original goal of $100 million to $200 million. And with USPI, we've only owned the company for 4 months but we believe we can extend -- sorry, exceed our target of $50 million [ph] of synergies over the next 3 years. 
Moreover, we're only now beginning to realize the potential of business opportunities that exist between our 3 business units in solving some of the most pressing problems facing potential health system customers and partners today. We refer to this as an integrated enterprise solution for revenue cycle, value-based care and ambulatory development with joint ownership of acute-care assets in selected cases. It's a powerful offering directed at the 80% of U.S. hospitals in the not-for-profit sector. 
We're only in the early stages of conversations with potential partners about this, but I think there's a real potential to create synergies for Tenet by owning all 3 of our business segments and coordinating these enterprise solutions offerings.
Notwithstanding our capabilities and success in acquisitions, while our equity is at these levels, we will narrow our focus. Our first priority will be to acquire surgery centers within USPI. USPI has been able to purchase centers at an average EBITDA less MCI multiple of roughly 7x to 8x and reduce the effective multiple to 4x to 5x 2 years postacquisition. 
At Tenet, we were able to achieve similar economics on outpatient acquisitions. Now with the synergies between USPI and Tenet, we can create additional near- and long-term value for our shareholders by continuing to deploy capital in this way. 
As we invest capital in building our ambulatory platform, we will continue to expand our relationships with the not-for-profit health system partners that have been so important to USPI's success. We have a healthy development pipeline, and I'm pleased that our partners remain enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities to leverage our capabilities. For example, since completing the joint venture, USPI has expanded its relationships with Baylor Scott & White Health, Memorial Hermann, Dignity Health and Meridian Health, among others.
We'll also continue to invest in Conifer to augment its revenue cycle and value-based care business lines. One of the many benefits of the Tenet-Conifer relationship is the ability for Conifer to develop new services and technologies within Tenet's hospitals and refine them before they get rolled out to the broader market. This has enabled us to build incremental revenue both within Tenet's hospitals and for our physicians. 
Also, Tenet's portfolio actions not only create new revenue opportunities for Conifer, they also help diversify Conifer's customer base. For the time being, we plan to pass on acquisitions of turnaround hospitals requiring large capital investments and defer large investments in projects like newly-constructed hospitals and new patient towers.
Turning to our leverage. As recently as 2 years ago, our ratio of total long-term debt to the latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 4.7x. We added leverage to acquire Vanguard, bringing the net leverage ratio up to 6x at the end of 2013. Today, our net leverage ratio is a little lower. Even with a $500 million share repurchase, which adds 0.2 turns of leverage, we expect our leverage to be in the high 5s at the end of 2016, and we're committed to reducing our leverage by driving improvements in operating results and growing free cash flow.
By the end of 2018, we believe our net leverage should be around 5x EBITDA, and absent other capital requirements, we expect it to trend lower after that. The markets may change between now and then but assuming that rates remain near current levels, we don't see much benefit in having net leverage below a range of 4x to 5x and would pursue attractive acquisitions or share repurchases in order to be within that targeted range.
In summary, we delivered on our strategic goal during the quarter and achieved financial results in line with our outlook. I'm confident that we have made and will continue to make smart investments in our future. We're well positioned with a strong integrated business model and building leading positions through our hospitals, USPI and Conifer. I'm very excited about the opportunities to drive growth across these 3 business lines in coming years and to improve margins and free cash flows and drive sustainable value for our shareholders over the long term. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Dan Cancelmi."

Here are several points that I would like to start with today about our results for the quarter.We generated EBITDA that was within our guidance range. EBITDA was $566 million in the quarter, representing a",1479,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. Here are several points that I would like to start with today about our results for the quarter.
We generated EBITDA that was within our guidance range. EBITDA was $566 million in the quarter, representing an increase of 23% and a 110 basis point improvement in our margin. We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted free cash flow outlook by $100 million as a result of another strong quarter of cash flow performance. This is the second time this year we've raised our cash flow outlook. Last quarter, we increased it by $75 million. 
We drove admissions growth in our higher acuity higher-margin service lines. However, our total admissions were impacted by declines in certain lower acuity business. Over a longer time horizon, we continue to believe that our strategies will produce admissions and adjusted admissions growth.
Charity and uninsured admissions increased 3.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher numbers of uninsured patients in Florida and Texas. Our Conifer services business delivered another strong quarter, with EBITDA up 30%. Our outpatient businesses continued to drive strong results. Our ambulatory care cases increased by an impressive 6.3%, and our hospitals achieved a healthy 3% increase in outpatient visits. Finally, our cost management efforts remain effective, including a year-over-year reduction in contract labor.
Now let's spend more time discussing our results. As you can see on Slide 5, our hospitals reported a 0.6% decline in same-hospital admissions, which was around 100 basis points below our expectations. Our initiatives and investments to expand key high acuity service lines continue to drive growth. However, certain of our lower acuity business, namely behavioral health and respiratory volume, was softer than we anticipated in the quarter. Also we generated hospital surgery growth of 0.8% and grew our emergency department volumes 1.5%.
We generated same-hospital patient revenue growth of 6.5%, which was primarily driven by a 5.8% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. We continue to drive growth in higher acuity service lines and our case mix increased 1.4% in the quarter. And the California Provider Fee program increased our same-hospital revenue by $41 million, which drove our revenue per adjusted admission up by 110 basis points in the quarter.
Keep in mind for modeling purposes that we recorded $150 million of same-hospital California Provider Fee revenue in Q4 last year since CMS did not approve the program until then. In this year's fourth quarter, we anticipate recognizing $41 million of revenue.
Our operators continue to manage expenses well. On a total hospital basis, our cost per adjusted admission increased 3% in the quarter and 1.9% year-to-date. Our previous full year 2015 cost guidance was a range of 2% to 3%. As a result of our performance this year, we are now reducing our full year cost outlook to a range of 2% to 2.5%. We continue to identify and realize cost efficiencies and acquisition synergies across our various business units.
In particular, our teams have been very successful in realizing synergies related to the Vanguard acquisition. We expect to exit 2015 on a $200 million annual run rate, which was the high end of our initial estimate, and we anticipate capturing additional synergies in the future.
I want to point out that our contract labor declined 15% in the third quarter on a same-hospital per adjusted admission basis. While we did experience pressure from contract labor last year, our teams have been very focused on reducing these costs and improving the balance between employee care providers and contract labor. We're clearly realizing benefits from these efforts as our contract labor costs declined for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Pharmaceutical costs have been a source of pressure over the last few years, with drug manufacturers pushing through large increases. This quarter, our pharmacy expense increased by approximately 13%. This alone accounts for roughly half of the 4.3% same-hospital growth we reported for supply expense per adjusted admission in the quarter. 
We have various initiatives in place to mitigate some of these increases, including product substitution, formulary optimization, SKU reductions, strategic buying and reducing waste. Also, we anticipate generating additional efficiencies in pharmacy and other supply spend when we in-source our group purchasing functions and transition to our recently announced group purchasing arrangement with HPG in early 2016.
Bad debt expense was 7.3% of revenue in the quarter, which was consistent with our performance in the first half of the year. Slide 6 summarizes our uncompensated care trends over the past several years. We've added to this slide the discounts that we offer to uninsured patients through our compact with uninsured patients. I think you'll find the additional information helpful because our uncompensated care can move back and forth among these 3 lines depending on how a patient is ultimately classified. 
This quarter, our uncompensated care as a percentage of adjusted revenue was 21.7%, which is up 80 basis points year-over-year. The increase is due in large part to a $28 million positive adjustment last year related to estimated future recoveries of patient balances after insurance payment. However, [indiscernible] ratio has been fairly stable over the past 4 quarters.
Turning to Slide 7. Our ambulatory segment's case growth was very strong, increasing 6.3%. Revenue per case also increased 3.5%, resulting in 10.1% growth in same-facility system-wide revenue. For anyone not familiar with USPI's historical financial reporting, the system-wide growth shown on the slide includes the case of and consolidated and unconsolidated centers. This provides a better overview of volume performance across the entire portfolio.
On Slide 8, you'll see that our ambulatory segment generated 17% year-over-year EBITDA growth. The results at USPI and Aspen have been consistent with our expectations. Given the attractive economics of this business, combined with their consumer-friendly nature, we will continue growing these care settings both organically and through acquisitions.
I want to remind everyone that USPI operates surgery centers that build Medicare program and as freestanding surgery centers, not as hospital outpatient departments. And it was never our intention to convert any of the centers into hospital-based outpatient departments. As a result, we do not foresee any exposure for USPI to the provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act related to the perspective site-neutral payment methodology. As patients, employers and insurers continue to focus on lowering their spend, USPI is well positioned as a patient-friendly, cost-effective, high-quality provider.
Conifer delivered another great quarter of year-over-year growth, with EBITDA increasing 30% to $61 million. This continues a trend of impressive growth in recent years, which is summarized on Slide 9. As we discussed last quarter, Conifer remains on track to meet or slightly exceed $260 million of EBITDA this year.
Our free cash flow was very strong in the third quarter. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $563 million, up from $256 million in the same period last year. Key drivers of this growth include accounts receivable performance improvement by our Conifer team, our strong cash flow generating USPI business and additional supplemental Medicaid funds from various states, including the California Provider Fee program.
After subtracting capital expenditures, we generated $356 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. As a result of our cash flow results the past 2 quarters, we are raising the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted free cash flow guidance by $100 million to a new range of $350 million to $500 million. As I mentioned earlier, this is the second time this year that we are raising our outlook for adjusted free cash flow. Last quarter, we raised our expectations by $75 million.
Slide 10 provides additional details on our updated outlook for 2015. In short, we are maintaining the midpoint of our range of adjusted EBITDA and tightening the range. As summarized on Slide 11, we are reiterating the same pro forma view of 2015 that we provided in August and added a few more details that we thought you would find helpful for modeling purposes. The goal of this pro forma information is to give you a starting point for modeling purposes of our numbers once all the previously announced acquisitions and divestitures are completed.
In summary, we effectively managed through a softer-than-expected inpatient volume environment and delivered EBITDA that was within our outlook range. Expense management continue to be a key area of focus and was an important contributor to our results in the quarter. And our Conifer and ambulatory care businesses continued to deliver strong growth. 
As a result of our performance this year, we are maintaining the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook and raising our outlook for adjusted free cash flow by $100 million. And we've announced the authorization to deploy up to $500 million of capital on share repurchases through the end of next year.

So with the business disruption at our Desert regional facility in Palm Springs, certainly one of our largest facilities. A lot of the various patient care units were essentially closed for an extended period of time. The hospital was on diversion so the volume was being redirected surge units, in trauma unit. So it had a noteworthy impact on the quarter. We're still working through the insurance claim but we think that's behind us [indiscernible] fully operational. So we're past that. In terms of the interest rate impact that we put on the slide, the 7-year rate went down 32 basis points, so that impacts our estimate of our discount and malpractice liabilities. There were some discussions, I saw some of the reports that was additional malpractice reserves. It really just -- we discount the liability so interest rates move, it has an impact. In this quarter, we had recorded $7 million of additional expense."

I think let's -- just breaking it down a little bit. So I think on the -- let's start with the exchanges. We, 2 years ago, anticipated -- we know that the exchanges provide a great opportunity for us. And I'm sure you'll remember all of that drama about what the pricing going to be. Is it going to be Medicaid? Is it going to be commercial, whatever? Sitting here today, our exchange pricing is within 1% of commercial, which is what we expect. So it's been a great product for us. We continue to drive substantial gains in volumes in this quarter with 53% in the exchange volumes, and I think those are well established now as a marketplace for individuals by insurance. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of our strategies has been to have very attractive offerings on those exchanges that include our hospitals. And we hit a record high of 90% of our hospitals being in the lower -- lowest-cost Silver plan networks. So we are well positioned on exchanges to continue benefiting from whatever growth there. You can debate it, you can look at different data sources for what the exchange enrollment is going to be. But whatever it is, we're well positioned to benefit from it. On Medicaid, that's disappointing. I'm disappointed that we're sitting here in 2015, and we still don't have Texas and Florida. And we don't have really sort of any progress, from a political point of view, in moving those states toward expansion.  Of course, from time to time, we'll hear positive things. We'll see it. We'll influence it coming out of state legislatures, most recently in Alabama. But the big ones for us are Florida and Texas and we'll continue to wait. We do have plenty of constituents in those states who understand that Medicaid expansion would be good for business and good for the people in the states. And we just think have to be patient about that provides upside if you want to look at the glass as half full. And otherwise, we've gotten all the cuts that we bargained for. And that basis probably exactly what we expected. But I would prefer to look at what we see as well-positioned nature of our hospitals on the exchanges and potential upside from expansion and future states as continuing opportunities for us."

So congratulations to everyone. My question is going to try to link your guidance on CapEx, your commentary on leverage, the share repurchase and the conversation about expected returns because I really want to understand the thought process. My sense is that there's a high level of discomfort with the announced buyback. And I'm not sure that I understood the explanation other than to say it's good to be flexible, and I think there's something more thoughtful behind it. So I'm going to ask it this way if I can. So as I understand it, you had made this decision, yes, you want flexibility but also because there's an expected return to holders from that buyback. And presumably, you've judged that the return to the holders from that buyback is at least equal to the alternative uses of capital, including the repayment of debt and running at a fairly high 6-plus [ph] leverage at the moment. So I'm trying to understand what you think the expected return of the buyback is. I'm concerned about reducing CapEx at a time when you've just acquired through joint ventures some pretty significant assets that may impact require investment. I understand that you've got some pretty significant capital requirements not just to buy back -- to buy the rest of USPI over time but to facilitate the strategic plan of continued development and acquisition there. So I'm trying to understand how all of these competing uses of capital rank in the order of return on that not only to the company, to the shareholder because when you got 8% coupon debt out there, it just -- it concerns me that we're not seeing more deleveraging as part of this otherwise well-balanced strategy. And I'd love your view on this."

Why don't we -- let me start with CapEx because I want to take off the table a notion that we are somehow cutting back on CapEx. At virtually every point in time for the last 12 years, we have had at least 1 or more new hospitals under construction.",554,"Okay. Why don't we -- let me start with CapEx because I want to take off the table a notion that we are somehow cutting back on CapEx. At virtually every point in time for the last 12 years, we have had at least 1 or more new hospitals under construction. We have, at this time, 1 new hospital under construction, and it will near completion next year. So a part of our anticipated ability to reduce capital spending is on very large-ticket projects. I mentioned in my script that for the time being, we would be passing on the opportunity to build new hospitals or really substantial new patient towers. And I think in an industry that changes as rapidly as this one does, from the time you start a big capital project like a new hospital to the time you generate your first dollar, it's typically about 5 years. That's a long time to be out there with a very significant project where the needs change along the way. So think in this volatile environment, Sheryl, as long as we're in a situation where our stock has been hit so badly and enterprise values have -- hospital companies have been hit as much as they have, that it's just prudent to back off on some of those very long-term, long dated, very expensive capital projects. Same would go for turnaround acquisitions that involve substantial capital commitment. No greater example than that -- of that than Detroit, where we are nearing completion of the capital commitment that we engaged in. By the way, those have yielded good results. I think once again, I think 3 of our fastest-growing hospitals in the quarter were in Detroit from an admissions point of view. So we're nearing a natural completion of some of this heavy capital spending that should enable us to remain competitive, invest appropriately in the facilities we have. And I just want to take this CapEx cut notion off. As far as the return questioning if we were having this conversation at our last quarterly call, as I mentioned, we'd be looking at an opportunity to invest nearly $800 million in calling those 8% notes that aren't due until 2020. That would have a certain return as of that call price of 6%. And our stock has returned nearly 20% just in the last 1.5 weeks. So we just are comparing those alternatives. It just seems like right now is not a great time to be investing in the repayment of debt. The change to our leverage ratio is pretty immaterial, 0.2 turns. And we think that having the flexibility to do this. Particularly, we are very aware of the very material change in our stock price just in the last couple of months really no fundamentals at all, but more on feat and where we evaluation of hospital companies, which by the way, on an enterprise value, we've been hit a little less than our peers but because of leverage, we've been hit more. The leverage works the same way on the way up, and that's where we expect to see. We're expressing confidence in our future and think that, among other things, great investment. And we're not doing it at the exclusion of other investments that we'll make in our businesses."

I'd like to start with the financial highlights of the quarter, which are summarized on Slide 2.

I'd like to start with the financial highlights of the quarter, which are summarized on Slide 2. We delivered third quarter EBITDA consistent with our guidance range, USPI's results were in line with our expectations, and Conifer achieved strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and EBITDA. 
Our adjusted free cash flow was also very strong in the third quarter and exceeded our expectations. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, in the third quarter of 2015, we drove an increase of 23% in EBITDA and improved our EBITDA margin by 110 basis points. I'm pleased with the way we grew our case mix and high acuity services as well as our performance in pricing growth and cost control. These are all very strong indicators that our strategies to grow the drivers of value are working.
On our second quarter earnings call in August, we discussed our expectations that hospital volume growth would soften in the third and fourth quarters relative to the first half of the year. Our record volume growth in the third quarter of 2014 provided us with a very tough comparison. And while our adjusted admissions growth was in line with the guidance we provided, hospital admissions were slightly weaker than we anticipated. 
Much of the pressure on inpatient admissions was due to a handful of anomalies or local market-specific issues that we've been resolving over the past few months. We're pleased to have achieved increases in higher acuity procedures, largely driven by investments that we've made in key specialty areas. For example, joint replacements are up over 5%, infectious disease surgical cases increased over 15% and neurosurgical cases grew by about 9%. This helped us to generate a 6.5% increase in same-hospital revenue growth during the quarter in spite of the softer volumes.
We achieved solid volume growth in our outpatient facilities. Our ambulatory segment drove a 6.3% increase in volumes and remains on track to deliver strong performance in the fourth quarter. Based on our performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reconfirming the midpoint of our adjusted 2015 EBITDA outlook and narrowing the range. We also are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $100 million to a new range of $350 million to $500 million.
We remain enthusiastic about Tenet's opportunities under the Affordable Care Act. The third season of open enrollment kicked off on Sunday, and we're pleased that 90% of Tenet's hospitals are included in in-network with the lowest-cost Silver plans on the exchanges. That is the highest percentage we've achieved in the last 3 enrollment periods. 
In addition, HHS is focusing enrollment efforts on 5 cities, including Dallas, Houston, Miami and Chicago where we generate roughly 20% of our hospital admissions. We are optimistic about 2016 and focused on connecting eligible individuals within families with coverage options.
Turning to Slide 3. In recent months, we've announced several transactions to improve our hospital portfolio, and I'd like to give you a quick update. We completed our joint ventures in Tucson in Birmingham and our acquisition of the Hi-Desert Medical Center near Palm Springs, California. In total, we invested roughly $300 million in these transactions. 
We also completed the sale of St. Louis University Hospital at the end of August and expect to finalize the sale of a majority interest in our 4 Dallas hospitals into a joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health in the fourth quarter. This morning, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our North Carolina hospitals to Duke LifePoint Healthcare. We also expect to sell our Atlanta hospitals as early as the first quarter of 2016.
We expect the divestitures in Dallas, Atlanta and North Carolina to generate roughly $1 billion in cash proceeds. We expect the cash will be realized at various times over the next 6 months as individual transactions are completed and receivables from the divested operations are collected. The proceeds may come at times when we have borrowings on our revolving credit line due to the timing of interest payments and seasonal cash outflows. So as a practical matter, the first use of the incoming cash is to reduce those outstanding borrowings.
I'd like now to turn to Slide 4 and spend a few minutes discussing how we intend to use the remaining proceeds and how we're thinking about capital deployment over the next few years. I feel confident about our business strategy and the opportunities for us to create value through organic growth augmented by strategic acquisitions in our business. But when it comes to capital deployment, we need to be flexible and adjust priorities based on the circumstances. 
For example, on last quarter's conference call, with our stock in the high 50s, I suggested that one option would be to use the divestiture proceeds to pay down debt, specifically our 8% notes due in 2020, which are callable at 104 today for a total of $780 million. The volatility in both the debt and equity markets since then has caused us to reevaluate and postpone calling those notes, and instead we're adding the ability to repurchase shares to the alternative that we have available.
We view share repurchases as an important tool to have in our toolkit. We have a strong track record of buying back shares at low prices, including $1.2 billion in stock buybacks since 2011 at an average price that is well below today's price. We announced yesterday that our board has approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $500 million of our stock through December 2016.
Taking a big picture perspective on our sources and uses of cash over the next 5 years, we expect to generate enough free cash flow, together with currently available liquidity, to fully fund the obligations to our minority partners, including the purchase of the rest of USPI. We expect our first installment payment, which is the only payment in 2016, will be between $125 million and $135 million. 
We also expect to have sufficient cash to fund a robust program of surgery center acquisitions at USPI, while continuing to delever through EBITDA growth. We feel confident in our ability to invest successfully in the growth of our business, increase the view of our company, and when appropriate, repurchase shares. 
We've already demonstrated our ability to do so. In 2008, we launched Conifer and created a business that is a market leader today, worth far more than the investment we made to build this business. 2 years later, we began to invest in outpatient centers that were key to the creation of our joint venture with USPI. We grew a $300 million investment into $900 million in value, which we were able to utilize to create the joint venture. 
We also gained national and regional scale through the Vanguard acquisition and increased the [indiscernible] of our markets in which we're #1 or #2 in market share. Our teams have also done a great job identifying and capturing synergies, and we've built a structural capability to create value in acquired businesses. We're on track to generate over $200 million in synergies from the Vanguard hospitals, exceeding the high end of our original goal of $100 million to $200 million. And with USPI, we've only owned the company for 4 months, but we believe we can extend -- sorry, exceed our target of $50 million of synergies over the next 3 years. 
Moreover, we're only now beginning to realize the potential of business opportunities that exist between our 3 business units in solving some of the most pressing problems facing potential health system customers and partners today. We refer to this as an integrated enterprise solution for revenue cycle, value-based care and ambulatory development with joint ownership of acute-care assets in selected cases. It's a powerful offering directed at the 80% of U.S. hospitals in the not-for-profit sector. 
We're only in the early stages of conversations with potential partners about this, but I think there's a real potential to create synergies for Tenet by owning all 3 of our business segments and coordinating these enterprise solutions offerings.
Notwithstanding our capabilities and success in acquisitions, while our equity is at these levels, we will narrow our focus. Our first priority will be to acquire surgery centers within USPI. USPI has been able to purchase centers at an average EBITDA less MCI multiple of roughly 7x to 8x and reduce the effective multiple to 4x to 5x 2 years post-acquisition. 
At Tenet, we were able to achieve similar economics on outpatient acquisitions. Now with the synergies between USPI and Tenet, we can create additional near- and long-term value for our shareholders by continuing to deploy capital in this way.
As we invest capital in building our ambulatory platform, we will continue to expand our relationships with the not-for-profit health system partners that have been so important to USPI's success. We have a healthy development pipeline, and I'm pleased that our partners remain enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities to leverage our capabilities. For example, since completing the joint venture, USPI has expanded its relationships with Baylor Scott & White, Memorial Hermann, Dignity Health and Meridian Health, among others.
We will also continue to invest in Conifer to augment its revenue cycle and value-based care business lines. One of the many benefits of the Tenet-Conifer relationship is the ability for Conifer to develop new services and technologies within Tenet's hospitals and refine them before they get rolled out to the broader market. This has enabled us to build incremental revenue both within Tenet's hospitals and for our physicians. 
Also, Tenet's portfolio actions not only create new revenue opportunities for Conifer, they also help diversify Conifer's customer base. For the time being, we plan to pass on acquisitions of turnaround hospitals requiring large capital investments and defer large investments in projects like newly-constructed hospitals and new patient towers.
Turning to our leverage. As recently as 2 years ago, our ratio of total long-term debt to the latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 4.7x. We added leverage to acquire Vanguard, bringing the net leverage ratio up to 6x at the end of 2013. Today, our net leverage ratio is a little lower. Even with a $500 million share repurchase, which adds 0.2 turns of leverage, we expect our leverage to be in the high 5s at the end of 2016, and we're committed to reducing our leverage by driving improvements in operating results and growing free cash flow.
By the end of 2018, we believe our net leverage should be around 5x EBITDA, and absent other capital requirements, we expect it to trend lower after that. The markets may change between now and then but assuming that rates remain near current levels, we don't see much benefit in having net leverage below a range of 4x to 5x and would pursue attractive acquisitions or share repurchases in order to be within that targeted range.
In summary, we delivered on our strategic goals during the quarter and achieved financial results in line with our outlook. I'm confident that we have made and will continue to make smart investments in our future. We're well positioned with a strong integrated business model and building leading positions through our hospitals, USPI and Conifer. I'm very excited about the opportunities to drive growth across these 3 business lines in coming years and to improve margins and free cash flows and drive sustainable value for our shareholders over the long term. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Dan Cancelmi."

There are several points that I would like to start with today about our results for the quarter.
We generated EBITDA that was within our guidance range. EBITDA was $566 million in the quarter, representing an increase of 23% and a 110 basis point improvement in our margin. We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted free cash flow outlook by $100 million as a result of another strong quarter of cash flow performance. This is the second time this year we've raised our cash flow outlook. Last quarter, we increased it by $75 million. 
We drove admissions growth in our higher acuity higher-margin service lines. However, our total admissions were impacted by declines in certain lower acuity business. Over a longer time horizon, we continue to believe that our strategies will produce admissions and adjusted admissions growth.
Charity and uninsured admissions increased 3.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher numbers of uninsured patients in Florida and Texas. Our Conifer services business delivered another strong quarter, with EBITDA up 30%. Our outpatient businesses continued to drive strong results. Our ambulatory care cases increased by an impressive 6.3%, and our hospitals achieved a healthy 3% increase in outpatient visits. Finally, our cost management efforts remain effective, including a year-over-year reduction in contract labor.
Now let's spend more time discussing our results. As you can see on Slide 5, our hospitals reported a 0.6% decline in same-hospital admissions, which was around 100 basis points below our expectations. Our initiatives and investments to expand key high acuity service lines continue to drive growth. However, certain of our lower acuity business, namely behavioral health and respiratory volume, was softer than we anticipated in the quarter. Also, we generated hospital surgery growth of 0.8% and grew our emergency department volumes 1.5%.
We generated same-hospital patient revenue growth of 6.5%, which was primarily driven by a 5.8% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. We continue to drive growth in higher acuity service lines and our case mix increased 1.4% in the quarter. And the California Provider Fee program increased our same-hospital revenue by $41 million, which drove our revenue per adjusted admission up by 110 basis points in the quarter.
Keep in mind for modeling purposes that we recorded $150 million of same-hospital California Provider Fee revenue in Q4 last year since CMS did not approve the program until then. In this year's fourth quarter, we anticipate recognizing $41 million of revenue.
Our operators continue to manage expenses well. On a total hospital basis, our cost per adjusted admission increased 3% in the quarter and 1.9% year-to-date. Our previous full year 2015 cost guidance was a range of 2% to 3%. As a result of our performance this year, we are now reducing our full year cost outlook to a range of 2% to 2.5%. We continued to identify and realize cost efficiencies and acquisition synergies across our various business units.
In particular, our teams have been very successful in realizing synergies related to the Vanguard acquisition. We expect to exit 2015 on a $200 million annual run rate, which was the high end of our initial estimate, and we anticipate capturing additional synergies in the future.
I want to point out that our contract labor declined 15% in the third quarter on a same-hospital per adjusted admission basis. While we did experience pressure from contract labor last year, our teams have been very focused on reducing these costs and improving the balance between employee care providers and contract labor. We're clearly realizing benefits from these efforts as our contract labor costs declined for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Pharmaceutical costs have been a source of pressure over the last few years, with drug manufacturers pushing through large increases. This quarter, our pharmacy expense increased by approximately 13%. This alone accounts for roughly half of the 4.3% same-hospital growth we reported for supply expense per adjusted admission in the quarter. 
We have various initiatives in place to mitigate some of these increases, including product substitution, formulary optimization, SKU reductions, strategic buying and reducing waste. Also, we anticipate generating additional efficiencies in pharmacy and other supply spend when we in-source our group purchasing functions and transition to our recently announced group purchasing arrangement with HPG in early 2016.
Bad debt expense was 7.3% of revenue in the quarter, which was consistent with our performance in the first half of the year. Slide 6 summarizes our uncompensated care trends over the past several years. We've added to this slide the discounts that we offer to uninsured patients through our compact with uninsured patients. I think you will find the additional information helpful because our uncompensated care can move back and forth among these 3 lines depending on how a patient is ultimately classified.
This quarter, our uncompensated care as a percentage of adjusted revenue was 21.7%, which is up 80 basis points year-over-year. The increase is due in large part to a $28 million positive adjustment last year related to estimated future recoveries of patient balances after insurance payment. However, I'll note that this ratio has been fairly stable over the past 4 quarters.
Turning to Slide 7. Our ambulatory segment's case growth was very strong, increasing 6.3%. Revenue per case also increased 3.5%, resulting in 10.1% growth in same-facility system-wide revenue. For anyone not familiar with USPI's historical financial reporting, the system-wide growth shown on the slide includes the case of and consolidated and unconsolidated centers. This provides a better overview of volume performance across the entire portfolio.
On Slide 8, you'll see that our ambulatory segment generated 17% year-over-year EBITDA growth. The results at USPI and Aspen have been consistent with our expectations. Given the attractive economics of this business, combined with their consumer-friendly nature, we will continue growing these care settings both organically and through acquisitions.
I want to remind everyone that USPI operates surgery centers that build a Medicare program and has freestanding surgery centers, not as hospital outpatient departments. And it was never our intention to convert any of the centers into hospital-based outpatient departments. As a result, we do not foresee any exposure for USPI to the provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act related to the perspective site-neutral payment methodology. As patients, employers and insurers continue to focus on lowering their spend, USPI is well positioned as a patient-friendly, cost-effective, high-quality provider.
Conifer delivered another great quarter of year-over-year growth, with EBITDA increasing 30% to $61 million. This continues a trend of impressive growth in recent years, which is summarized on Slide 9. As we discussed last quarter, Conifer remains on track to meet or slightly exceed $260 million of EBITDA this year.
Our free cash flow was very strong in the third quarter. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $563 million, up from $256 million in the same period last year. Key drivers of this growth include accounts receivable performance improvement by our Conifer team, our strong cash flow generating USPI business and additional rates supplemental Medicaid funds from various states, including the California Provider Fee program.
After subtracting capital expenditures, we generated $356 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. As a result of our cash flow results the past 2 quarters, we are raising the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted free cash flow guidance by $100 million to a new range of $350 million to $500 million. As I mentioned earlier, this is the second time this year that we are raising our outlook for adjusted free cash flow. Last quarter, we raised our expectations by $75 million.
Slide 10 provides additional details on our updated outlook for 2015. In short, we are maintaining the midpoint of our range of adjusted EBITDA and tightening the range. As summarized on Slide 11, we are reiterating the same pro forma view of 2015 that we provided in August and added a few more details that we thought you would find helpful for modeling purposes. The goal of this pro forma information is to give you a starting point for modeling purposes of our numbers once all the previously announced acquisitions and divestitures are completed.
In summary, we effectively managed through a softer-than-expected inpatient volume environment and delivered EBITDA that was within our outlook range. Expense management continue to be a key area of focus and was an important contributor to our results in the quarter. And our Conifer and ambulatory care businesses continued to deliver strong growth. 
As a result of our performance this year, we are maintaining the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook and raising our outlook for adjusted free cash flow by $100 million. And we've announced the authorization to deploy up to $500 million of capital on share repurchases through the end of next year.

And I think we'll see that again this year. Roughly 1/3 of our earnings come in the fourth quarter and we expect that again. Some of the reasons that we think we're enjoying such a good success are right now, are there's both the combination of market drivers and USPI-specific drivers. And the market drivers that are giving us nice tailwinds or a continued recognition of the benefits of ambulatory-based surgical programs both from a clinical and a payer perspective. And we're saying the continued demise of the out-of-network business, and that's, I think, driving business to the -- in network providers. And then on the USPI side, I think we're doing a better job of keeping our doctors and earning the support of new doctors as well as some turnarounds and then some big wins on -- at a few facilities that are moving the needle.

We're still working through the insurance claim, but we think that's behind us. The hospital's fully operational. So we're past that. In terms of the interest rate impact that we put on the slide, the 7-year rate went down 32 basis points, so that impacts our estimate of our discount and malpractice liabilities. There were some discussions, I saw in some of the reports that it was additional malpractice reserves. It really just -- we discount the liability so when interest rates move, it has an impact.

We, 2 years ago, anticipated -- we know the exchanges would provide a great opportunity for us. And I'm sure you remember all of that drama about what's the pricing going to be. Is it going to be Medicaid? Is it going to be commercial, whatever? Sitting here today, our exchange pricing is within 1% of commercial, which is what we expect. So it's been a great product for us. We continue to drive substantial gains in volumes in this quarter. It was 53% in the exchange volumes, and I think those are well established now as a marketplace for individuals by insurance. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of our strategies has been to have very attractive offerings on those exchanges that include our hospitals. And we hit a record high of 90% of our hospitals being in the lower -- lowest-cost Silver plan networks. So we are well positioned on exchanges to continue benefiting from whatever growth areas. You can debate it. You can look at different data sources for what the exchange enrollment is going to be. But whatever it is, we're well positioned to benefit from it. On Medicaid, that's disappointing. I'm disappointed that we're sitting here in 2015, and we still don't have Texas and Florida. And we don't have really sort of any progress, from a political point of view, in moving those states toward expansion. Of course, from time to time, we'll hear positive things. We'll see it. We'll influence it coming out of state legislatures, most recently in Alabama. But the big ones for us are Florida and Texas and we'll continue to wait. We do have plenty of constituents in those states who understand that Medicaid expansion would be good for business and good for the people in the states. And we just think they'd have to be patient but that provides upside if you want to look at the glass as half full. And otherwise, we've gotten all the cuts that we bargained for. And on that basis probably exactly what we expected. But I would prefer to look at what we see as the well-positioned nature of our hospitals on the exchanges and the potential upside from expansion and future states as continuing opportunities for us."

So congratulations to everyone. My question is going to try to link your guidance on CapEx, your commentary on leverage, the share repurchase and the conversation about expected returns because I really want to understand the thought process. My sense is that there's a high level of discomfort with the announced buyback. And I'm not sure that I understood the explanation other than to say it's good to be flexible, and I think there's something more thoughtful behind it. So I'm going to ask it this way if I can. So as I understand it, you would make this decision, yes, you want flexibility, but also because there's an expected return to holders from that buyback. And presumably, you've judged that the return to the holders from that buyback is at least equal to the alternative uses of capital, including the repayment of debt and running at a fairly high 6-plus leverage at the moment. So I'm trying to understand what you think the expected return of the buyback is. I'm concerned about reducing CapEx at a time when you've just acquired through joint ventures some pretty significant assets that may in fact require investment. I understand that you've got some pretty significant capital requirements not just to buy back -- to buy the rest of USPI over time but to facilitate the strategic plan of continued development and acquisition there. So I'm trying to understand how all of these competing uses of capitals rank in the order of return on that, not only to the company, to the shareholder, because when you've got 8% coupon debt out there, it just -- it concerns me that we're not seeing more deleveraging as part of this otherwise well-balanced strategy. And I'd love your view on this."

Why don't we -- let me start with CapEx because I want to take off the table a notion that we are somehow cutting back on CapEx. At virtually every point in time for the last 12 years, we have had at least 1 or more new hospitals under construction.",555,"Okay. Why don't we -- let me start with CapEx because I want to take off the table a notion that we are somehow cutting back on CapEx. At virtually every point in time for the last 12 years, we have had at least 1 or more new hospitals under construction. We have, at this time, 1 new hospital under construction, and it will near completion next year. So a part of our anticipated ability to reduce capital spending is on very large-ticket projects. I mentioned in my script that for the time being, we would be passing on the opportunity to build new hospitals or really substantial new patient towers. And I think in an industry that changes as rapidly as this one does, from the time you start a big capital project like a new hospital to the time you generate your first dollar, it's typically about 5 years. That's a long time to be out there with a very significant project where the needs change along the way. So think in this volatile environment, Sheryl, as long as we're in a situation where our stock has been hit so badly and enterprise values have -- hospital companies have been hit as much as they have, that it's just prudent to back off on some of those very long-term, long dated, very expensive capital projects. Same would go for turnaround acquisitions that involve substantial capital commitment. No greater example than that -- of that than Detroit, where we are nearing completion of the capital commitments that we had engaged in. By the way, those have yielded good results. I think once again, 3 of our fastest-growing hospitals in the quarter were in Detroit from an admissions point of view. So we're nearing a natural completion of some of this heavy capital spending that should enable us to remain competitive, invest appropriately in the facilities we have. And I just want to take this CapEx cut notion off. As far as the return question, if we were having this conversation at our last quarterly call, as I mentioned, we'd be looking at an opportunity to invest nearly $800 million in calling those 8% notes that aren't due until 2020. That would have a certain return as of that call price of 6%. And our stock has returned nearly 20% just in the last 1.5 weeks. So we just are comparing those alternatives. It just seems like right now is not a great time to be investing in the repayment of debt. The change to our leverage ratio is pretty immaterial, 0.2 turns. And we think that having the flexibility to do this. Particularly, we are very aware of the very material change in our stock price just in the last couple of months really on no fundamentals at all, but more on fear and on revaluation of hospital companies, which by the way, on an enterprise value, we've been hit a little less than our peers, but because of leverage, we've been hit more. The leverage works the same way on the way up, and that's where we expect to be. We're expressing confidence in our future and think that, among other things, is a great investment. And we're not doing it at the exclusion of other investments that we'll make in our businesses."

What I'm really proud of our operators on is as we've stepped through the first half of this year, we continued to have robust volume. And then, as we've alluded and commented on, we had a drop on the inpatient side in the third quarter. I'm talking about much about the reasons today, but what I'm really proud is that we have matched the staffing with the volume throughout the high periods and in the lower periods. And more specifically, as you look at the hospital business, I'm really pleased with the contract labor being down. As Dan mentioned, 15% per adjusted admission taking the volume into account year-over-year. It slowed down sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. So this is something that we put in place a long time ago to make sure that we could be nimble in periods of up and down. And then the last comment I would make to that and it gets a little more granular, but I think you guys deserve to know that. As you look at how we provide care, oftentimes, we use our own internal folks on a premium labor basis, be it overtime or other aspects. Our overtime number in this quarter is down 6.5% per adjusted admission. And our salaries and wages, specifically the salaries and wages on the hospital segment, is down just right at 1% or a little less. So you look at all those productivity measures and matching staffing to volume, I'm really pleased with our operators."

So those are all places where we've deployed capital, time, attention and efforts to grow that business. And we've seen that and we continue to see that. As you look at our volume in this quarter and Dan alluded to this earlier, we had low acuity drop-offs in behavioral and pulmonary disease. And the pulmonary disease was very understandable compared to the earlier onset of flu and respiratory last year, pretty atypical in the third quarter in the industry.

I'd like to start with the financial highlights of the quarter, which are summarized on Slide 2.

I'd like to start with the financial highlights of the quarter, which are summarized on Slide 2. We delivered third quarter EBITDA consistent with our guidance range, USPI's results were in line with our expectations, and Conifer achieved strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and EBITDA. 
Our adjusted free cash flow was also very strong in the third quarter and exceeded our expectations. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, in the third quarter of 2015, we drove an increase of 23% in EBITDA and improved our EBITDA margin by 110 basis points. I'm pleased with the way we grew our case mix and high acuity services as well as our performance in pricing growth and cost control. These are all very strong indicators that our strategies to grow the drivers of value are working.
On our second quarter earnings call in August, we discussed our expectations that hospital volume growth would soften in the third and fourth quarters relative to the first half of the year. Our record volume growth in the third quarter of 2014 provided us with a very tough comparison. And while our adjusted admissions growth was in line with the guidance we provided, hospital admissions were slightly weaker than we anticipated. 
Much of the pressure on inpatient admissions was due to a handful of anomalies or local market-specific issues that we've been resolving over the past few months. We're pleased to have achieved increases in higher acuity procedures, largely driven by investments that we've made in key specialty areas. For example, joint replacements are up over 5%, infectious disease surgical cases increased over 15% and neurosurgical cases grew by about 9%. This helped us to generate a 6.5% increase in same-hospital revenue growth during the quarter in spite of the softer volumes.
We achieved solid volume growth in our outpatient facilities. Our ambulatory segment drove a 6.3% increase in volumes and remains on track to deliver strong performance in the fourth quarter. Based on our performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reconfirming the midpoint of our adjusted 2015 EBITDA outlook and narrowing the range. We also are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $100 million to a new range of $350 million to $500 million.
We remain enthusiastic about Tenet's opportunities under the Affordable Care Act. The third season of open enrollment kicked off on Sunday, and we're pleased that 90% of Tenet's hospitals are included in in-network with the lowest-cost Silver plans on the exchanges. That is the highest percentage we've achieved in the last 3 enrollment periods. 
In addition, HHS is focusing enrollment efforts on 5 cities, including Dallas, Houston, Miami and Chicago where we generate roughly 20% of our hospital admissions. We are optimistic about 2016 and focused on connecting eligible individuals within families with coverage options.
Turning to Slide 3. In recent months, we've announced several transactions to improve our hospital portfolio, and I'd like to give you a quick update. We completed our joint ventures in Tucson in Birmingham and our acquisition of the Hi-Desert Medical Center near Palm Springs, California. In total, we invested roughly $300 million in these transactions. 
We also completed the sale of St. Louis University Hospital at the end of August and expect to finalize the sale of a majority interest in our 4 Dallas hospitals into a joint venture with Baylor Scott & White Health in the fourth quarter. This morning, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our North Carolina hospitals to Duke LifePoint Healthcare. We also expect to sell our Atlanta hospitals as early as the first quarter of 2016.
We expect the divestitures in Dallas, Atlanta and North Carolina to generate roughly $1 billion in cash proceeds. We expect the cash will be realized at various times over the next 6 months as individual transactions are completed and receivables from the divested operations are collected. The proceeds may come at times when we have borrowings on our revolving credit line due to the timing of interest payments and seasonal cash outflows. So as a practical matter, the first use of the incoming cash is to reduce those outstanding borrowings.
I'd like now to turn to Slide 4 and spend a few minutes discussing how we intend to use the remaining proceeds and how we're thinking about capital deployment over the next few years. I feel confident about our business strategy and the opportunities for us to create value through organic growth augmented by strategic acquisitions in our business. But when it comes to capital deployment, we need to be flexible and adjust priorities based on the circumstances. 
For example, on last quarter's conference call, with our stock in the high 50s, I suggested that one option would be to use the divestiture proceeds to pay down debt, specifically our 8% notes due in 2020, which are callable at 104 today for a total of $780 million. The volatility in both the debt and equity markets since then has caused us to reevaluate and postpone calling those notes, and instead we're adding the ability to repurchase shares to the alternative that we have available.
We view share repurchases as an important tool to have in our toolkit. We have a strong track record of buying back shares at low prices, including $1.2 billion in stock buybacks since 2011 at an average price that is well below today's price. We announced yesterday that our board has approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $500 million of our stock through December 2016.
Taking a big picture perspective on our sources and uses of cash over the next 5 years, we expect to generate enough free cash flow, together with currently available liquidity, to fully fund the obligations to our minority partners, including the purchase of the rest of USPI. We expect our first installment payment, which is the only payment in 2016, will be between $125 million and $135 million. 
We also expect to have sufficient cash to fund a robust program of surgery center acquisitions at USPI, while continuing to delever through EBITDA growth. We feel confident in our ability to invest successfully in the growth of our business, increase the view of our company, and when appropriate, repurchase shares. 
We've already demonstrated our ability to do so. In 2008, we launched Conifer and created a business that is a market leader today, worth far more than the investment we made to build this business. 2 years later, we began to invest in outpatient centers that were key to the creation of our joint venture with USPI. We grew a $300 million investment into $900 million in value, which we were able to utilize to create the joint venture. 
We also gained national and regional scale through the Vanguard acquisition and increased the [indiscernible] of our markets in which we're #1 or #2 in market share. Our teams have also done a great job identifying and capturing synergies, and we've built a structural capability to create value in acquired businesses. We're on track to generate over $200 million in synergies from the Vanguard hospitals, exceeding the high end of our original goal of $100 million to $200 million. And with USPI, we've only owned the company for 4 months, but we believe we can extend -- sorry, exceed our target of $50 million of synergies over the next 3 years. 
Moreover, we're only now beginning to realize the potential of business opportunities that exist between our 3 business units in solving some of the most pressing problems facing potential health system customers and partners today. We refer to this as an integrated enterprise solution for revenue cycle, value-based care and ambulatory development with joint ownership of acute-care assets in selected cases. It's a powerful offering directed at the 80% of U.S. hospitals in the not-for-profit sector. 
We're only in the early stages of conversations with potential partners about this, but I think there's a real potential to create synergies for Tenet by owning all 3 of our business segments and coordinating these enterprise solutions offerings.
Notwithstanding our capabilities and success in acquisitions, while our equity is at these levels, we will narrow our focus. Our first priority will be to acquire surgery centers within USPI. USPI has been able to purchase centers at an average EBITDA less MCI multiple of roughly 7x to 8x and reduce the effective multiple to 4x to 5x 2 years post-acquisition. 
At Tenet, we were able to achieve similar economics on outpatient acquisitions. Now with the synergies between USPI and Tenet, we can create additional near- and long-term value for our shareholders by continuing to deploy capital in this way.
As we invest capital in building our ambulatory platform, we will continue to expand our relationships with the not-for-profit health system partners that have been so important to USPI's success. We have a healthy development pipeline, and I'm pleased that our partners remain enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities to leverage our capabilities. For example, since completing the joint venture, USPI has expanded its relationships with Baylor Scott & White, Memorial Hermann, Dignity Health and Meridian Health, among others.
We will also continue to invest in Conifer to augment its revenue cycle and value-based care business lines. One of the many benefits of the Tenet-Conifer relationship is the ability for Conifer to develop new services and technologies within Tenet's hospitals and refine them before they get rolled out to the broader market. This has enabled us to build incremental revenue both within Tenet's hospitals and for our physicians. 
Also, Tenet's portfolio actions not only create new revenue opportunities for Conifer, they also help diversify Conifer's customer base. For the time being, we plan to pass on acquisitions of turnaround hospitals requiring large capital investments and defer large investments in projects like newly-constructed hospitals and new patient towers.
Turning to our leverage. As recently as 2 years ago, our ratio of total long-term debt to the latest 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 4.7x. We added leverage to acquire Vanguard, bringing the net leverage ratio up to 6x at the end of 2013. Today, our net leverage ratio is a little lower. Even with a $500 million share repurchase, which adds 0.2 turns of leverage, we expect our leverage to be in the high 5s at the end of 2016, and we're committed to reducing our leverage by driving improvements in operating results and growing free cash flow.
By the end of 2018, we believe our net leverage should be around 5x EBITDA, and absent other capital requirements, we expect it to trend lower after that. The markets may change between now and then but assuming that rates remain near current levels, we don't see much benefit in having net leverage below a range of 4x to 5x and would pursue attractive acquisitions or share repurchases in order to be within that targeted range.
In summary, we delivered on our strategic goals during the quarter and achieved financial results in line with our outlook. I'm confident that we have made and will continue to make smart investments in our future. We're well positioned with a strong integrated business model and building leading positions through our hospitals, USPI and Conifer. I'm very excited about the opportunities to drive growth across these 3 business lines in coming years and to improve margins and free cash flows and drive sustainable value for our shareholders over the long term. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Dan Cancelmi."

There are several points that I would like to start with today about our results for the quarter.
We generated EBITDA that was within our guidance range. EBITDA was $566 million in the quarter, representing an increase of 23% and a 110 basis point improvement in our margin. We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted free cash flow outlook by $100 million as a result of another strong quarter of cash flow performance. This is the second time this year we've raised our cash flow outlook. Last quarter, we increased it by $75 million. 
We drove admissions growth in our higher acuity higher-margin service lines. However, our total admissions were impacted by declines in certain lower acuity business. Over a longer time horizon, we continue to believe that our strategies will produce admissions and adjusted admissions growth.
Charity and uninsured admissions increased 3.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher numbers of uninsured patients in Florida and Texas. Our Conifer services business delivered another strong quarter, with EBITDA up 30%. Our outpatient businesses continued to drive strong results. Our ambulatory care cases increased by an impressive 6.3%, and our hospitals achieved a healthy 3% increase in outpatient visits. Finally, our cost management efforts remain effective, including a year-over-year reduction in contract labor.
Now let's spend more time discussing our results. As you can see on Slide 5, our hospitals reported a 0.6% decline in same-hospital admissions, which was around 100 basis points below our expectations. Our initiatives and investments to expand key high acuity service lines continue to drive growth. However, certain of our lower acuity business, namely behavioral health and respiratory volume, was softer than we anticipated in the quarter. Also, we generated hospital surgery growth of 0.8% and grew our emergency department volumes 1.5%.
We generated same-hospital patient revenue growth of 6.5%, which was primarily driven by a 5.8% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. We continue to drive growth in higher acuity service lines and our case mix increased 1.4% in the quarter. And the California Provider Fee program increased our same-hospital revenue by $41 million, which drove our revenue per adjusted admission up by 110 basis points in the quarter.
Keep in mind for modeling purposes that we recorded $150 million of same-hospital California Provider Fee revenue in Q4 last year since CMS did not approve the program until then. In this year's fourth quarter, we anticipate recognizing $41 million of revenue.
Our operators continue to manage expenses well. On a total hospital basis, our cost per adjusted admission increased 3% in the quarter and 1.9% year-to-date. Our previous full year 2015 cost guidance was a range of 2% to 3%. As a result of our performance this year, we are now reducing our full year cost outlook to a range of 2% to 2.5%. We continued to identify and realize cost efficiencies and acquisition synergies across our various business units.
In particular, our teams have been very successful in realizing synergies related to the Vanguard acquisition. We expect to exit 2015 on a $200 million annual run rate, which was the high end of our initial estimate, and we anticipate capturing additional synergies in the future.
I want to point out that our contract labor declined 15% in the third quarter on a same-hospital per adjusted admission basis. While we did experience pressure from contract labor last year, our teams have been very focused on reducing these costs and improving the balance between employee care providers and contract labor. We're clearly realizing benefits from these efforts as our contract labor costs declined for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Pharmaceutical costs have been a source of pressure over the last few years, with drug manufacturers pushing through large increases. This quarter, our pharmacy expense increased by approximately 13%. This alone accounts for roughly half of the 4.3% same-hospital growth we reported for supply expense per adjusted admission in the quarter. 
We have various initiatives in place to mitigate some of these increases, including product substitution, formulary optimization, SKU reductions, strategic buying and reducing waste. Also, we anticipate generating additional efficiencies in pharmacy and other supply spend when we in-source our group purchasing functions and transition to our recently announced group purchasing arrangement with HPG in early 2016.
Bad debt expense was 7.3% of revenue in the quarter, which was consistent with our performance in the first half of the year. Slide 6 summarizes our uncompensated care trends over the past several years. We've added to this slide the discounts that we offer to uninsured patients through our compact with uninsured patients. I think you will find the additional information helpful because our uncompensated care can move back and forth among these 3 lines depending on how a patient is ultimately classified.
This quarter, our uncompensated care as a percentage of adjusted revenue was 21.7%, which is up 80 basis points year-over-year. The increase is due in large part to a $28 million positive adjustment last year related to estimated future recoveries of patient balances after insurance payment. However, I'll note that this ratio has been fairly stable over the past 4 quarters.
Turning to Slide 7. Our ambulatory segment's case growth was very strong, increasing 6.3%. Revenue per case also increased 3.5%, resulting in 10.1% growth in same-facility system-wide revenue. For anyone not familiar with USPI's historical financial reporting, the system-wide growth shown on the slide includes the case of and consolidated and unconsolidated centers. This provides a better overview of volume performance across the entire portfolio.
On Slide 8, you'll see that our ambulatory segment generated 17% year-over-year EBITDA growth. The results at USPI and Aspen have been consistent with our expectations. Given the attractive economics of this business, combined with their consumer-friendly nature, we will continue growing these care settings both organically and through acquisitions.
I want to remind everyone that USPI operates surgery centers that bill the Medicare program and has freestanding surgery centers, not as hospital outpatient departments. And it was never our intention to convert any of the centers into hospital-based outpatient departments. As a result, we do not foresee any exposure for USPI to the provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act related to the perspective site-neutral payment methodology. As patients, employers and insurers continue to focus on lowering their spend, USPI is well positioned as a patient-friendly, cost-effective, high-quality provider.
Conifer delivered another great quarter of year-over-year growth, with EBITDA increasing 30% to $61 million. This continues a trend of impressive growth in recent years, which is summarized on Slide 9. As we discussed last quarter, Conifer remains on track to meet or slightly exceed $260 million of EBITDA this year.
Our free cash flow was very strong in the third quarter. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $563 million, up from $256 million in the same period last year. Key drivers of this growth include accounts receivable performance improvement by our Conifer team, our strong cash flow generating USPI business and additional rates supplemental Medicaid funds from various states, including the California Provider Fee program.
After subtracting capital expenditures, we generated $356 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. As a result of our cash flow results the past 2 quarters, we are raising the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted free cash flow guidance by $100 million to a new range of $350 million to $500 million. As I mentioned earlier, this is the second time this year that we are raising our outlook for adjusted free cash flow. Last quarter, we raised our expectations by $75 million.
Slide 10 provides additional details on our updated outlook for 2015. In short, we are maintaining the midpoint of our range of adjusted EBITDA and tightening the range. As summarized on Slide 11, we are reiterating the same pro forma view of 2015 that we provided in August and added a few more details that we thought you would find helpful for modeling purposes. The goal of this pro forma information is to give you a starting point for modeling purposes of our numbers once all the previously announced acquisitions and divestitures are completed.
In summary, we effectively managed through a softer-than-expected inpatient volume environment and delivered EBITDA that was within our outlook range. Expense management continue to be a key area of focus and was an important contributor to our results in the quarter. And our Conifer and ambulatory care businesses continued to deliver strong growth. 
As a result of our performance this year, we are maintaining the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook and raising our outlook for adjusted free cash flow by $100 million. And we've announced the authorization to deploy up to $500 million of capital on share repurchases through the end of next year.

The other element to consider in that pro forma view is that does not reflect the improvement in the operations and synergies that we'll capture related to the Tucson and Baptist Birmingham assets that we acquired. We've continued to drive additional cost efficiencies. We'll be able to capture more next year as well as the fact that when we transition to our new group purchasing agreement with HPG next year and early part of the first quarter, that's also going to drive additional efficiencies for it -- for us.

Some of the reasons that we think we're enjoying such good success are right now, are there's both the combination of market drivers and USPI-specific drivers. And the market drivers that are giving us nice tailwinds or a continued recognition of the benefits of ambulatory-based surgical programs both from a clinical and a payer perspective. And we're saying the continued demise of the out-of-network business, and that's, I think, driving business to the -- in network providers.

We, 2 years ago, anticipated -- we thought the exchanges would provide a great opportunity for us. And I'm sure you remember all of that drama about what's the pricing going to be. Is it going to be Medicaid? Is it going to be commercial, whatever? Sitting here today, our exchange pricing is within 1% of commercial, which is what we'd expect. So it's been a great product for us. We continue to drive substantial gains in volumes in this quarter. It was 53% in the exchange volumes, and I think those are well established now as a marketplace for individuals by insurance. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of our strategies has been to have very attractive offerings on those exchanges that include our hospitals. And we hit a record high of 90% of our hospitals being in the lower -- lowest-cost Silver plan networks. So we are well positioned on exchanges to continue benefiting from whatever growth areas. You can debate it. You can look at different data sources for what the exchange enrollment is going to be. But whatever it is, we're well positioned to benefit from it. On Medicaid, that's disappointing. I'm disappointed that we're sitting here in 2015, and we still don't have Texas and Florida. And we don't have really sort of any progress, from a political point of view, in moving those states toward expansion. Of course, from time to time, we'll hear positive things. We'll see it. We'll influence it coming out of state legislatures, most recently in Alabama. But the big ones for us are Florida and Texas and we'll continue to wait. We do have plenty of constituents in those states who understand that Medicaid expansion would be good for business and good for the people in the states. And we just think they'd have to be patient but that provides upside if you want to look at the glass as half full. And otherwise, we've gotten all the cuts that we bargained for. And on that basis probably exactly what we expected. But I would prefer to look at what we see as the well-positioned nature of our hospitals on the exchanges and the potential upside from expansion and future states as continuing opportunities for us."

So congratulations to everyone. My question is going to try to link your guidance on CapEx, your commentary on leverage, the share repurchase and the conversation about expected returns because I really want to understand the thought process. My sense is that there's a high level of discomfort with the announced buyback. And I'm not sure that I understood the explanation other than to say it's good to be flexible, and I think there's something more thoughtful behind it. So I'm going to ask it this way if I can. So as I understand it, you would make this decision, yes, you want flexibility, but also because there's an expected return to holders from that buyback. And presumably, you've judged that the return to the holders from that buyback is at least equal to the alternative uses of capital, including the repayment of debt and running at a fairly high 6-plus leverage at the moment. So I'm trying to understand what you think the expected return of the buyback is. I'm concerned about reducing CapEx at a time when you've just acquired through joint ventures some pretty significant assets that may in fact require investment. I understand that you've got some pretty significant capital requirements not just the buy back -- to buy the rest of USPI over time but to facilitate the strategic plan of continued development and acquisition there. So I'm trying to understand how all of these competing uses of capitals rank in the order of return on that, not only to the company, to the shareholder, because when you've got 8% coupon debt out there, it just -- it concerns me that we're not seeing more deleveraging as part of this otherwise well-balanced strategy. And I'd love your view on this."

Why don't we -- let me start with CapEx because I want to take off the table a notion that we are somehow cutting back on CapEx. At virtually every point in time for the last 12 years, we have had at least 1 or more new hospitals under construction.",555,"Okay. Why don't we -- let me start with CapEx because I want to take off the table a notion that we are somehow cutting back on CapEx. At virtually every point in time for the last 12 years, we have had at least 1 or more new hospitals under construction. We have, at this time, 1 new hospital under construction, and it will near completion next year. So a part of our anticipated ability to reduce capital spending is on very large-ticket projects. I mentioned in my script that for the time being, we would be passing on the opportunity to build new hospitals or really substantial new patient towers. And I think in an industry that changes as rapidly as this one does, from the time you start a big capital project like a new hospital to the time you generate your first dollar, it's typically about 5 years. That's a long time to be out there with a very significant project where the needs change along the way. So think in this volatile environment, Sheryl, as long as we're in a situation where our stock has been hit so badly and enterprise values have -- hospital companies have been hit as much as they have, that it's just prudent to back off on some of those very long-term, long dated, very expensive capital projects. Same would go for turnaround acquisitions that involve substantial capital commitment. No greater example than that -- of that than Detroit, where we are nearing completion of the capital commitments that we had engaged in. By the way, those have yielded good results. I think once again, 3 of our fastest-growing hospitals in the quarter were in Detroit from an admissions point of view. So we're nearing a natural completion of some of this heavy capital spending that should enable us to remain competitive, invest appropriately in the facilities we have. And I just want to take this CapEx cut notion off. As far as the return question, if we were having this conversation at our last quarterly call, as I mentioned, we'd be looking at an opportunity to invest nearly $800 million in calling those 8% notes that aren't due until 2020. That would have a certain return as of that call price of 6%. And our stock has returned nearly 20% just in the last 1.5 weeks. So we just are comparing those alternatives. It just seems like right now is not a great time to be investing in the repayment of debt. The change to our leverage ratio is pretty immaterial, 0.2 turns. And we think that having the flexibility to do this. Particularly, we are very aware of the very material change in our stock price just in the last couple of months really on no fundamentals at all, but more on fear and on revaluation of hospital companies, which by the way, on an enterprise value, we've been hit a little less than our peers, but because of leverage, we've been hit more. The leverage works the same way on the way up, and that's where we expect to be. We're expressing confidence in our future and think that, among other things, is a great investment. And we're not doing it at the exclusion of other investments that we'll make in our businesses."

So we've been making some investments to ensure that has been successful, and so far it has been. And so we'll continue to have a little bit of spend in the fourth quarter on that as well.

We do have several new platforms coming -- that have come on board in Birmingham and Tucson. And so we'll obviously take that into consideration. And so looking beyond the growth in the USPI business, that's going to continue to generate strong free cash flow. On the hospital business, Conifer is doing a really good job in terms of AR management. So we think we're going to be able to continue to grow free cash flow next year. In terms of your point or question about was there anything unusual, I wouldn't say it's unusual. We're finally getting a little bit of money in from these large state supplemental Medicaid funding programs. So we've got a little bit more money this year compared to last year, but those numbers can -- they can move around a little bit. But we're obviously pleased with what we've been able to drive and so far this year."

As Trevor alluded, we saw record volume in 2014 and at times were challenged to match the labor with that and use a lot of expensive overtime premium. What I'm really proud of our operators on is as we've stepped through the first half of this year, we continued to have robust volume. And then, as we've alluded and commented on, we had a drop on the inpatient side in the third quarter. We haven't talked much about the reasons today, but what I'm really proud is that we have matched the staffing with the volume throughout the high periods and in the lower periods. And more specifically, as you look at the hospital business, I'm really pleased with the contract labor being down. As Dan mentioned, 15% per adjusted admission taking the volume into account year-over-year. It slowed down sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. So this is something that we put in place a long time ago to make sure that we could be nimble in periods of up and down. And then the last comment I would make to that and it gets a little more granular, but I think you guys deserve to know that. As you look at how we provide care, oftentimes, we use our own internal folks on a premium labor basis, be it overtime or other aspects. Our overtime number in this quarter is down 6.5% per adjusted admission. And our salaries and wages, specifically the salaries and wages on the hospital segment, is down just right at 1% or a little less. So you look at all those productivity measures and matching staffing to volume, I'm really pleased with our operators."

We -- if you've heard us on many conference calls going back several quarters and actually years, where we've invested in the high acuity, inpatient, surgical-oriented programs, and that's technology, that's physicians, that's training of our staff, and that's a breadth of the service offerings. Those are particularly in neurosurgery, very much so in orthopedics and all the aspects of orthopedics, including spines, joint work and complex ortho procedures. Surgical on the infectious disease, which was a high utilization particularly in this quarter. And then also on the nonsurgical side, where it's very important in certain marketplaces on the neonatal intensive care units, we've seen growth. So those are all places where we've deployed capital, time, attention and efforts to grow that business. And we've seen that and we continue to see that. As you look at our volume in this quarter and Dan alluded to this earlier, we had low acuity drop-offs in behavioral and pulmonary disease. And the pulmonary disease was very understandable compared to the earlier onset of flu and respiratory last year, pretty atypical in the third quarter in the industry. So what we've seen is higher growth in acuity. And we attribute that to effort, focus, moving market share, recruiting high-profile physicians where necessary and really just focusing and doubling down of our operators."
