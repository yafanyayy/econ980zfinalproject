Profitability remains stronger in the quarter, but sales were lower than anticipated, declining 2% during the December quarter. The primary weakness was driven by broadcast and wireless communications end markets. 28-nanometer sales represented 1 of the bright spots of the quarter with sales increasing nearly 20%, sequentially. All members of this product family grew with Zynq, Virtex and Artix all posting double-digit growth rates.
From an end market perspective, sales to communications customers declined 3% sequentially, with flat wired sales and a decline in wireless sales. Wireless sales were impacted by weaker sales from non-China regions, while our China wireless business increased in line with expectation.
Industrial and aerospace and defense sales increased as expected with strong defense sales offsetting declines in industrial, scientific and medical. Broadcast consumer and automotive sales declined due to weaker broadcast sales which were driven by weak purchasing activity from a couple of large customers. Automotive sales were better than expected as several new Advanced Driver Assistance programs began to ramp.
In terms of linearity, the month of October and November were in line with our expectations, and the month of December progressively weakened. Turns were 44% for the quarter. Gross margin of 69.7% was better than expected as a result of customer and product mix. Total operating expenses were $224 million, including $2 million of amortization-related expenses. This was $6 million lower than our guided resulting in operating income of 32%.
Other income and expense with a net expense of $4 million, better than forecasted, mainly due to higher interest income from our investment portfolio.
Net income for the quarter was $168 million or $0.62 per share, including a $0.02 per diluted share benefit primarily related to the restatement of the R&D tax credit.
Operating cash flow for the September quarter -- excuse me, the December quarter was $291 million before $6 million in CapEx. Strong cash flow during the quarter was positively impacted by a net improvement in working capital led by the timing impact of Accounts Receivable.
Diluted shares for the quarter were 274 million shares. This was a bit higher than forecasted as a result of the higher stock price. There was a 7.8 million share dilutive effect from our convertible note.
We are committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we continued to aggressively buyback stock repurchasing 4 million shares for $175 million. We also paid $76 million in quarterly dividends.
For the fiscal year, thus far, we have returned over $700 million to shareholders in the form of repurchase and dividend, $80 million more than we generated in operating cash flow.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $28 million to approximately $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion.
Inventory dollars decreased by $16 million during the quarter. We plan to continue to reduce inventory dollars in the March quarter.
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter fiscal year '15. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Although we're forecasting another strong quarter for our 28-nanometer products, we will be facing headwinds from aerospace and defense due to normal seasonality and a program-related timing. We expect both wired and wireless communications to be flat sequentially. Wireless sales will be impacted by the timing of the FDD, LTE deployments. We expect industrial and aerospace and defense segment to decrease for the reasons I mentioned earlier, offsetting flat sales to -- and measurement.
Broadcast, automotive and consumer is expected to be up driven by a rebound in broadcast and continue to advance to driver systems strength in automotive. As a result, we're expecting total sales for the March quarter to be down 2% to 6% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a churn rate of approximately 61%. Gross margin is expected to be 68% to 69%.
Operating expenses in the March quarter is expected to be approximately $227 million, including $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
Other income and expense for the March quarter is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million, and the share count is expected to be approximately 270 million shares.
The tax rate for the March quarter is expected to be approximately 13%. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Moshe."

I'm clearly disappointed with our top line performance both during the December quarter and the guidance for the March quarter. Looking forward into fiscal year 2016, we are planning for a flat to low growth environment. The renewed revenue was from our 28-nanometer portfolio will be somewhat offset by uncertainty in the global communication spending and expect decline in key aerospace and defense programs.
And the positive side, Xilinx posted strong profitability in the December quarter, both gross margin and operating margin at 69.7% and 32%, respectively, or better than our expectations, contributing to earnings per share of $0.62.
Our cash flow continues to be healthy and were on a part to return more cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and buybacks than we will generate in fiscal year '15.
The most significant highlight for the quarter is our new 28-nanometer revenue growth, which exceeded $150 million sequential increase of nearly 20%. We're anticipating 28-nanometer sales to continue to grow and exceed $160 million in the March quarter.
We also achieved several important milestones for our 20-nanometer portfolio. Our Kintex UltraScale devices became the industry's first 20-nanometer FPGA to move into volume production. Based on customer feedback, we continue to believe that we have an estimated 1-year lead over the competition. This technology leadersip is complemented by our Kintex UltraScale family, which is the industry's ASIC class 20-nanometer high-end product offering. The very high end of this family, we began shipping the industry's largest FPGA, which delivers over 4x the capacity of any competitive devices.
Finally, in the area of design software, we launched the SDX development environment. This is the second in the family of software defined -- environment, which we call SDX. This will greatly expand our user base to include broad community of systems and software engineers in both existing in new markets. This environment combines open C+ languages with an initial focus on the growing data center acceleration market.
Despite the top line challenges, I remain confident in Xilinx's strong technology leadership and market position. We're still in early phases of 28-nanometer revenue growth have already delivered the first production ASIC class 20-nanometer products, market expanding new SDX software defined program environment, and soon our 16-nanometer products that include multiprocessing association.
On Investor Day on March 10, we look forward to providing you more details on that our plans. I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for Q&A."

And I think specifically in China, that's probably 2 changes. So what we have been thinking in saying about it. One is the Phase 3 rollout, while it is, we still believe that it's beginning in the springtime, and that's progressing. The pace of that rollout seems to be a little slower than the previous 2 paces were in the past. We've seen a pretty high concentration over 1 quarter, 1.5 quarter of deployment, and that deployment seems to be at least the best that we can tell, maybe less than a little longer to that does base stations out, so a little longer time period. And the second thing, which is also on our mind among the FD is. I think we have articulated that the FD base stations would start to ship and this March quarter and then throughout the remainder of calendar '15. Right now the license is still not broadly -- Our modeling was essentially a 1-year lag from when what TD base station started shipping in volume, which was similar to the 3G deployment, and that really isn't happening right now.

So I guess, how comfortable are you guys in digging the 20-nanometer is going to be able to drive this top performance in fiscal '16 given your commentary about your comps in aero and defense -- north half of your revenue next year -- I think you're 28-nanometer declines?"

The different component, different family that are targeted at specific different applications. It addresses all of the markets we're in. Absolutely all of them and is an expansion play into additional areas. It would be correct to say that in the last year of production was driven by wireless comps, but it's not that's the only market that it has addressed. And if you look at the early shipments, they won't necessarily into comps at all, and they were in ASIC simulation. They were actually into some consumer market and all of this continue. What is happening is as the family of products has rolled out and has been extremely successful, more and more are moving into significant production and growth that you see now back to over 150 was actually driven by growth on the Virtex front, growth on the Zynq front and growth of the Artix front, and those addressed numerous markets not only comps. So it's broad, it's growing significantly, it's the fastest-growing product we've ever seen, and we're very confident that if you look at the numbers, then improved from $100 million to $380 million. If you look at our projection of over $160 million, it will come in at about $580 million for the year. We expect significant growth beyond that. So that is growing rapidly, and it's going to be the most successful and broadest portfolios we have. Having said that, when you look at 4G and 45, we continue to see strength. And on the 45, which is the low end product offering, the spot product offering, whereas we believe that 40-nanometer is no more or less peaking for us this point in time. In terms of market share on the 40, 45, it doesn't necessarily shrunk. It's sort of gone up and down over the past year, I would say. And that's our evaluation."

And so if you think about the momentum that in those end markets have been clear over the last year or so, and the momentum we believe is going to continue, it is transitioning from other products into these new or higher ASPs, where we are getting a tremendous amount of benefit. And then also even in the wireless space, there's transition going on away from other products, Virtex 5s and 6s into the 7 Series and to big product products going into the wireless function, so we're going to see more growth in the 28-nanometer area, even in the comp thing.

We do see in quite few cases more ASICS going away and customers transitioning into FPGAs and to a lesser degree, but nonetheless, happening, too.

Profitability remained strong during the quarter, but sales were lower than anticipated, declining 2% during the December quarter. The primary weakness was driven by broadcast and wireless communications end markets. 28-nanometer sales represented 1 of the bright spots of the quarter with sales increasing nearly 20%, sequentially. All members of this product family grew with Zynq, Virtex and Artix all posting double-digit growth rates.
From an end market perspective, sales to communications customers declined 3% sequentially with flat wired sales and a decline in wireless sales. Wireless sales were impacted by weaker sales from non-China regions, while our China wireless business increased in line with expectations.
Industrial and aerospace and defense sales increased as expected with strong defense sales offsetting declines in industrial, scientific and medical. Broadcast, consumer and automotive sales declined due to weaker broadcast sales, which were driven by weak purchasing activity from a couple of large customers. Automotive sales were better than expected as several new Advanced Driver Assistance programs began to ramp.
In terms of linearity, the month of October and November were in line with our expectations, and the month of December progressively weakened. Turns were 44% for the quarter. Gross margin of 69.7% was better than expected as a result of customer and product mix. Total operating expenses were $224 million, including $2 million of amortization-related expenses. This was $6 million lower than our guided -- than guided, resulting in operating income of 32%. Other income and expense was a net expense of $4 million, better than forecasted, mainly due to higher interest income from our investment portfolio.
Net income for the quarter was $168 million or $0.62 per share, including a $0.02 per diluted share benefit primarily related to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Operating cash flow for the September quarter -- excuse me, the December quarter was $291 million before $6 million in CapEx. Strong cash flow during the quarter was positively impacted by a net improvement in working capital led by the timing impact of accounts receivable.
Diluted shares for the quarter were 274 million shares. This was a bit higher than forecasted as result of the higher stock price. There was a 7.8 million share dilutive effect from our convertible note.
We are committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we continued to aggressively buy back stock, repurchasing 4 million shares for $175 million. We also paid $76 million in quarterly dividends. For the fiscal year, thus far, we have returned over $700 million to shareholders in the form of repurchase and dividend, $80 million more than we generated in operating cash flow.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $28 million to approximately $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion.  Inventory dollars decreased by $16 million during the quarter. We plan to continue to reduce inventory dollars in the March quarter.
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter fiscal year '15. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Although we are forecasting another strong quarter for our 28-nanometer products, we will be facing headwinds from aerospace and defense due to normal seasonality and a program-related timing. We expect both wired and wireless communications to be flat sequentially. Wireless sales will be impacted by the timing of the FDD LTE deployments. We expect industrial and aerospace and defense segment to decrease for the reasons I mentioned earlier, offsetting flat sales to ISM and test, measurement.
Broadcast, automotive and consumer is expected to be up driven by a rebound in broadcast and continued Advanced Driver Assistance strength in automotive. As a result, we're expecting total sales for the March quarter to be down 2% to 6% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 51%. Gross margin is expected to be 68% to 69%. Operating expenses in the March quarter is expected to be approximately $227 million, including $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the March quarter is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million, and the share count is expected to be approximately 270 million shares. The tax rate for the March quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Moshe."

I'm clearly disappointed with our top line performance both during the December quarter and the guidance for the March quarter. Looking forward into fiscal year 2016, we are planning for a flat to low growth",417,"Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. I'm clearly disappointed with our top line performance both during the December quarter and the guidance for the March quarter. Looking forward into fiscal year 2016, we are planning for a flat to low growth environment. The renewed revenue growth from our 28-nanometer portfolio will be somewhat offset by uncertainty in global communication spending and expected declines in key aerospace and defense programs.
On the positive side, Xilinx posted strong profitability in the December quarter. Both gross margin and operating margin at 69.7% and 32%, respectively, were better than our expectations, contributing to earnings per share of $0.62. Our cash flow continues to be healthy, and we're on a path to return more cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and buybacks than we will generate in fiscal year '15.
The most significant highlight for the quarter is our new 28-nanometer revenue growth, which exceeded $150 million sequential increase of nearly 20%. We're anticipating 28-nanometer sales to continue to grow and exceed $160 million in the March quarter.
We also achieved several important milestones for our 20-nanometer portfolio. Our Kintex UltraScale devices became the industry's first 20-nanometer FPGAs to move into volume production. Based on customer feedback, we continue to believe that we have an estimated 1-year lead over the competition. This technology leadership is complemented by our Virtex UltraScale family, which is the industry's ASIC-class 20-nanometer high-end product offering. At the very high end of this family, we began shipping the industry's largest FPGA, which delivers over 4x the capacity of any competitive devices.
Finally, in the area of design software, we launched the SDAccel development environment. This is the second in a family of software defined development environment, which we call SDx. This will greatly expand our user base to include a broad community of systems and software engineers in both existing and new markets. This environment combines OpenCL, C and C++ languages with an initial focus on the growing data center acceleration market.
Despite the top line challenges, I remain confident in Xilinx's strong technology leadership and market position. We're still in early phases of 28-nanometer revenue growth, have already delivered the first production ASIC-class 20-nanometer products, our market-expanding new SDx software defined programming environment and soon, our 16-nanometer products that include multi-processing associates. At our Investor Day on March 10, we look forward to providing you more details outlining our plans.

So that has had some impact, but I would say it's been relatively small impact. But it's certainly anything helps, right, in this kind of environment, so we've had some impact from that.

And while -- when we've asked those questions, we haven't gotten any answer that says, ""Yes, it's really impacting our business.""

That's for sure. And I think what's specifically going on in China, there's probably 2 changes to what we have been thinking and saying about it. One is the Phase 3 rollout. While it is -- we still believe that it's beginning in the springtime and that's progressing, the pace of that rollout seems to be a little slower than the previous 2 phases were in the past. We've seen a pretty high concentration over 1 quarter, 1.5 quarters of deployment, and that deployment seems to be, at least the best as we can tell, maybe lasting a little longer to get those base stations out, so a little bit longer time period. And the second thing, which is also looming on our minds, is around the FD licenses. I think we had articulated that the FD base stations would start to ship in this March quarter and then throughout the remainder of calendar '15. Right now the licenses still are not broadly let, and our modeling was essentially a 1-year lag from when the TD base station started shipping in volume, which was similar to the 3G deployment.

And what we see on the wireless side is weakness in the short term in deployments going in North America that has caused us some short-term shipment issues, meaning this quarter and this past quarter and next quarter, specifically capital being diverted away from AT&T and Verizon and other places. But probably more prominent, Sprint is having more issues with rollouts, and so the OEMs that we ship to that supply the Sprint LTE rollout have been cutting back orders because they've not been getting orders from Sprint as best as we can understand. And so that softness in North America is -- some part of that, I would say, early in the year. And then to your kind of a follow-through to the question related to Europe and India, our -- in our mental model right now we have not modeled either one of those geographies taking significant product at this point in time and probably into next year as well.

So 28-nanometer is a very broad and deep product offering, and there is lots of elements to it. And there are different components, different families that are targeted at specific different applications. It addresses all of the markets we're in, absolutely all of them and is an expansion play into additional areas. It would be correct to say that in the last year of production was driven by wireless comms, but it's not that, that's the only market that it has addressed. And if you look at the early shipments, they weren't necessarily into comms at all. They were in ASIC emulation. They were actually into some consumer markets, and all of these continue. What is happening is as the family of products has rolled out and has been extremely successful, more and more are moving into significant production and growth that you see now back to over $150 million, was actually driven by growth on the Virtex front, growth on the Zynq front and growth on the Artix front. And those addressed numerous markets, not only comms. So it's broad. It's growing significantly. It's the fastest growing product we've ever seen, and we're very confident that if you look at the numbers when it grew from $100 million to $380 million, if you look at our projection of over $160 million, it'll come in at about $580 million for the year. We expect significant growth beyond that. So that is growing rapidly, and it's going to be the most successful and broadest portfolio we have. Having said that, when you look at 40 and 45, we continue to see strength. And on the 45, which is the low-end product offering, the Spartan product offering, whereas we believe that 40-nanometer is more or less peaking for us at this point in time. In terms of market share on 40, 45, it hasn't necessarily shrunk. It's sort of gone up and down over the past year, I would say, and that's our valuation."

And so if you think about the momentum that in those end markets have been clear over the last year or so and those -- that momentum, we believe, is going to continue, it is transitioning from older products into these newer higher-valued products at higher ASPs, where we are getting a tremendous amount of benefit. And then also, even within the wireless space, there's a transitioning going on away from older products, Virtex-5s and 6s into the 7 Series and to big Zynq products going into the wireless function.

But we are -- we did also, I believe, signal we were a lot more bullish on wireless growth in China because of Phase 3 rollout in March.

It's just that it's not increasing to the point that we had said.

So that's a great philosophical question, which is -- we could spend hours debating, but let me give you my 2-minute response here. You're right in pointing out, if you look back, that the growth has not been sustained. So for Xilinx, it was -- grew to $1.8 billion, was at $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion for several years, then took a jump to the $2.4-ish billion level and has been at that point for more years than we believed it would stay there. And that clearly is disappointing. Having said that, we do believe that this is a business -- as the semiconductor industry is maturing, being at the leading edge enables us to capture a larger SAM. And in order to do that, we're investing, in order to exploit that and provide those solutions. Now the first node where this was possible in a big way, we believe, is 28-nanometer, and we do see and we will -- we understand that it's incumbent upon us to show the proof. We do see in quite a few cases more ASICs going away and customers transitioning into FPGAs and to a lesser degree, but nonetheless, this is happening, too. Some of the traditional ASSP provider can no longer keep up, and that provides an opportunity for us. In order to do that, we need to have both different product and a big investment in the software enablement to enable us to capture those markets. We're making those investments now and we believe that the return is still ahead of us. And an example would be the Zynq product line, which enables us to participate in a bigger way in automotive, a market where we only had a very fringed participation in the past. So I can't argue with your numbers, right? The numbers are what the numbers are. But I fervently believe that the opportunity is still ahead of us to capture these markets, and we'll give you more insights into that in the March time frame. But excellent question and thank you for asking it."

Profitability remained strong during the quarter, but sales were lower than anticipated, declining 2% during the December quarter. The primary weakness was driven by broadcast and wireless communications end markets. 28-nanometer sales represented 1 of the bright spots of the quarter with sales increasing nearly 20%, sequentially. All members of this product family grew with Zynq, Virtex and Artix all posting double-digit growth rates.
From an end market perspective, sales to communications customers declined 3% sequentially with flat wired sales and a decline in wireless sales. Wireless sales were impacted by weaker sales from non-China regions, while our China wireless business increased in line with expectations.
Industrial and aerospace and defense sales increased as expected with strong defense sales offsetting declines in industrial, scientific and medical. Broadcast, consumer and automotive sales declined due to weaker broadcast sales, which were driven by weak purchasing activity from a couple of large customers. Automotive sales were better than expected as several new Advanced Driver Assistance programs began to ramp.
In terms of linearity, the month of October and November were in line with our expectations, and the month of December progressively weakened. Turns were 44% for the quarter. Gross margin of 69.7% was better than expected as a result of customer and product mix. Total operating expenses were $224 million, including $2 million of amortization-related expenses. This was $6 million lower than our guided -- than guided, resulting in operating income of 32%. Other income and expense was a net expense of $4 million better than forecasted, mainly due to higher interest income from our investment portfolio.
Net income for the quarter was $168 million or $0.62 per share, including a $0.02 per diluted share benefit primarily related to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Operating cash flow for the September quarter -- excuse me, the December quarter was $291 million before $6 million in CapEx. Strong cash flow during the quarter was positively impacted by a net improvement in working capital led by the timing impact of accounts receivable.
Diluted shares for the quarter were 274 million shares. This was a bit higher than forecasted as a result of the higher stock price. There was a 7.8 million share dilutive effect from our convertible note.
We are committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we continued to aggressively buy back stock, repurchasing 4 million shares for $175 million. We also paid $76 million in quarterly dividends. For the fiscal year, thus far, we have returned over $700 million to shareholders in the form of repurchase and dividend, $80 million more than we generated in operating cash flow.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $28 million to approximately $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars decreased by $16 million during the quarter. We plan to continue to reduce inventory dollars in the March quarter.
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter of fiscal year '15. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Although we are forecasting another strong quarter for our 28-nanometer products, we will be facing headwinds from aerospace and defense due to normal seasonality and a program-related timing. We expect both wired and wireless communications to be flat sequentially. Wireless sales will be impacted by the timing of the FDD LTE deployments. We expect industrial and aerospace and defense segment to decrease for the reasons I mentioned earlier, offsetting flat sales to ISM and test to measurement.
Broadcast, automotive and consumer is expected to be up driven by a rebound in broadcast and continued Advanced Driver Assistance strength in automotive. As a result, we're expecting total sales for the March quarter to be down 2% to 6% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 51%. Gross margin is expected to be 68% to 69%. Operating expenses in the March quarter is expected to be approximately $227 million, including $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the March quarter is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million, and the share count is expected to be approximately 270 million shares. The tax rate for the March quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Moshe."

Both gross margin and operating margin at 69.7% and 32%, respectively, were better than our expectations, contributing to earnings per share of $0.62. Our cash flow continues to be healthy, and we're on a path to return more cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and buybacks than we will generate in fiscal year '15.
The most significant highlight for the quarter is our new 28-nanometer revenue growth, which exceeded $150 million sequential increase of nearly 20%. We're anticipating 28-nanometer sales to continue to grow and exceed $160 million in the March quarter.
We also achieved several important milestones for our 20-nanometer portfolio. Our Kintex UltraScale devices became the industry's first 20-nanometer FPGAs to move into volume production. Based on customer feedback, we continue to believe that we have an estimated 1-year lead over the competition. This technology leadership is complemented by our Virtex UltraScale family, which is the industry's ASIC-class, 20-nanometer, high-end product offering. At the very high end of this family, we began shipping the industry's largest FPGA, which delivers over 4x the capacity of any competitive devices.
Finally, in the area of design software, we launched the SDAccel development environment. This is the second in a family of software defined development environment, which we call SDx. This will greatly expand our user base to include a broad community of systems and software engineers in both existing and new markets. This environment combines OpenCL, C and C++ languages with an initial focus on the growing data center acceleration market.
Despite the top line challenges, I remain confident in Xilinx's strong technology leadership and market position. We're still in early phases of 28-nanometer revenue growth, have already delivered the first production ASIC-class 20-nanometer products, our market-expanding new SDx software defined programming environments and soon, our 16-nanometer products that include multi-processing associates. [ph] At our Investor Day on March 10, we look forward to providing you more details outlining our plans.

That's for sure. And I think what's specifically going on in China, there's probably 2 changes to what we have been thinking and saying about it. One is the Phase 3 rollout. While it is -- we still believe that it's beginning in the springtime and that's progressing, the pace of that rollout seems to be a little slower than the previous 2 phases were in the past. We've seen a pretty high concentration over 1 quarter, 1.5 quarters of deployment, and that deployment seems to be, at least the best as we can tell, maybe lasting a little longer to get those base stations out, so a little bit longer time period. And the second thing, which is also looming on our minds, is around the FD licenses. I think we had articulated that the FD base stations would start to ship in this March quarter and then throughout the remainder of calendar '15. Right now the licenses still are not broadly let, and our modeling was essentially a 1-year lag from when the TD base station started shipping in volume, which was similar to the 3G deployment. And that really isn't happening right now. So we're kind of on pins and needles here waiting for those licenses to be let, so we can kind of model when that might start."

And what we see on the wireless side is weakness in the short term in deployments going on in North America that has caused us some short-term shipment issues, meaning this quarter and this past quarter and next quarter, specifically capital being diverted away from AT&T and Verizon and other places. But probably more prominent, Sprint is having more issues with rollouts, and so the OEMs that we ship to that supply the Sprint LTE rollout have been cutting back orders because they've not been getting orders from Sprint as best as we can understand. And so that softness in North America is -- some part of that, I would say, early in the year. And then to your kind of a follow-through to the question related to Europe and India, our -- in our mental model right now we have not modeled either one of those geographies taking significant product at this point in time and probably into next year as well.

So 28-nanometer is a very broad and deep product offering, and there is lots of elements to it. And there are different components, different families that are targeted at specific different applications. It addresses all of the markets we're in, absolutely all of them and is an expansion play into additional areas. It would be correct to say that in the last year of production was driven by wireless comms, but it's not that, that's the only market that it has addressed. And if you look at the early shipments, they weren't necessarily into comms at all. They were in ASIC emulation. They were actually into some consumer markets, and all of these continue. What is happening is as the family of products has rolled out and has been extremely successful, more and more are moving into significant production and growth that you see now back to over $150 million, was actually driven by growth on the Virtex front, growth on the Zynq front and growth on the Artix front. And those addressed numerous markets, not only comms. So it's broad. It's growing significantly. It's the fastest growing product we've ever seen, and we're very confident that if you look at the numbers when it grew from $100 million to $380 million, if you look at our projection of over $160 million, it'll come in at about $580 million for the year. We expect significant growth beyond that. So that is growing rapidly, and it's going to be the most successful and broadest portfolio we have. Having said that, when you look at 40 and 45, we continue to see strength. And on the 45, which is the low-end product offering, the Spartan product offering, whereas we believe that 40-nanometer is more or less peaking for us at this point in time. In terms of market share on 40, 45, it hasn't necessarily shrunk. It's sort of gone up and down over the past year, I would say, and that's our valuation."

And then also, even within the wireless space, there's a transition going on away from older products, Virtex-5s and 6s into the 7 Series and to big Zynq products going into the wireless function.

The design, whenever you encounter a new generation of product, tends to unearth problems that you did not anticipate, and as a result, the closing of all of these issues was taking a little longer, plus the challenges related to design for FinFET transistors are more significant. So it's not a TSMC challenge or issue at all. It's just our ability to finish the design with their support. After -- if you look at our business, typically, what sort of happens is tape it out. You get it back after a few months. You go through a lengthy evaluation cycle, and then you move it into production, which point in time, it takes 2 to 3 years until it reaches high-volume production. So it sort of depends.

But we've been able to manage it through a variety of different techniques and decisions that we made, so I'm not too worried about any sort of a bigger ramp in spending coming on.

All I can do is tell you what we believe our customers are saying. And since we have the lion's share of the share among PLD companies in support of the Sprint rollout, that has been something that has disappointed relative to our expectations for this quarter, and we believe that bleeds into the forecast for Q4, as well. The China aspect, we actually had China grow as we anticipated, so that wasn't necessarily the short-term issue. But we are -- we did also, I believe, signal we were a lot more bullish on wireless growth in China because of Phase 3 rollout in March. And while we're not seeing declines there, we aren't seeing the same relative acceleration of growth in China that we had originally said. So it's not like our wireless business is going away. It's just that it's not increasing to the point that we had said. With respect to FY '16, I think Moshe was trying to characterize the cloud overall in communications, meaning a global rough spot for global spending, not specifically targeting some geography in wireless.

You're right in pointing out, if you look back, that the growth has not been sustained. So for Xilinx, it was -- grew to $1.8 billion, was at $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion for several years, then took a jump to the $2.4-ish billion level and has been at that point for more years than we believed it would stay there. And that clearly is disappointing. Having said that, we do believe that this is a business -- as the semiconductor industry is maturing, being at the leading edge enables us to capture a larger SAM. And in order to do that, we're investing, in order to exploit that and provide those solutions. Now the first node where this was possible in a big way, we believe, is 28-nanometer, and we do see and we will -- we understand that it's incumbent upon us to show the proof. We do see in quite a few cases more ASICs going away and customers transitioning into FPGAs and to a lesser degree, but nonetheless, this is happening, too, some of the traditional ASSP providers can no longer keep up, and that provides an opportunity for us. In order to do that, we need to have both different products and a big investment in the software enablement to enable us to capture those markets. We're making those investments now and we believe that the return is still ahead of us. And an example would be the Zynq product line, which enables us to participate in a bigger way in automotive, a market where we only had a very fringed participation in the past. So I can't argue with your numbers, right? The numbers are what the numbers are.

We had weakness in other customers as well. We've had geographic weakness from a European perspective as well. So we are -- it's often -- it's not what the entire company is doing.

Fiscal 2015 was another strong year of profitability for the company with operating income up 31.8%, the highest in 4 years.

Fiscal 2015 was another strong year of profitability for the company with operating income up 31.8%, the highest in 4 years. Industrial and aerospace and defense category increased 7% for the year, representing a record 39% of total sales. The communication segment declined 5% impacted by lower than expected CapEx spend in many of sub-applications. The broadcast consumer and automotive category decreased 2%, however the automotive subsegment grew significantly, increasing 30% during the year. For the company as a whole, fiscal year sales were $2.4 billion, flat with the prior year. Gross margin was a record 70% for the fiscal year, benefiting from end market mix, as well as continued cost reduction in margin expansion initiatives across our product platform portfolio. In fiscal year 2015, we returned over 120% of our operating cash flow to shareholders, which represents about 40% of our revenues. This consisted of a record $306 million in dividend payout and a stock repurchase of 15.3 million shares for $650 million. The March quarter of fiscal 2015 marked the 10th consecutive year of dividend increases for the company, putting Xilinx in a very elite group of technology companies. 
Cash flow per share has increased at a compound annual rate of 14% in the past 10 years, driven by a combination of gross margin expansion, disciplined expense control, working capital management and share repurchase. 
Turning now to a discussion of the March quarter. Xilinx sales were $567 million, down 4% sequentially and within our guidance. 28-nanometer sales exceeded $160 million as forecasted. Sales from communications and data center declined 7% sequentially and were weaker than anticipated. Wired communication was approximately flat as expected while wireless sales decreased double digits. The weakness in the wireless segment was primarily due to continued softness in North America and a weakening in China LTE business. Industrial and aerospace and defense business also decreased although not as much as anticipated during the quarter. Expected declines from defense were partially offset by better-than-expected business from both industrial scientific medical, as well as test and measurements. 
Lastly, broadcast consumer and automotive was better-than-expected with automotive achieving a record quarter while broadcast was flat and consumer was down. Gross margin was 69.9% for the quarter, better-than-anticipated, primarily as a result of product and customer mix, although we continue to be focused on driving improvements and profitability. Combined R&D and SG&A expense were $211 million, significantly lower than forecasted, primarily as a result of lower stock-based compensation expense in addition to continued cost efforts. 
Operating income was $159 million, including amortization of $2.4 million and a $24 million restructuring charge or $0.08 per diluted share. The restructuring charge reflect the impact of streamlining certain internal organizations, as well as the impact of a transition from sales reps to a direct sales model for certain customers. Other income was $1 million, higher than guided primarily due to an $8 million gain or $0.03 per diluted share from the sale of land. Net income for the quarter was $135 million or $0.50 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $166 million before $6 million in CapEx, during the quarter. Diluted shares for the quarter were $270 million, slightly less than forecasted and down 25 million shares from the same quarter a year ago. There was a  $5.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $175 million during the quarter and paid $70 million in dividends. 
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat sequentially at $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $16[ph] million sequentially but days increased to 136. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year '16. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. Both wired and wireless communications as expected to decline. Wired communication remains sluggish although data center will likely increase. Wireless will be impacted by slowing China LTE build in the near-term. We expect industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be down, driven primarily by continued expected decreases from A&D. Lastly, we expect broadcast consumer and automotive to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to down 4% sequentially. And the midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 47%. The lower turns rate is primarily due to a couple of large customers being more fully booked to expectation and a regional distributor transition. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% to 70%. Operating expenses for the June quarter is expected to be approximately $210 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The Q1 fiscal '16 operating expense level will be at its lowest level for the year due to lower tape-out activity and timing of expenses to ramp up headcount post-restructuring. The headcount additions will largely be driven by hiring in the sales force into a lesser degree in R&D. 
For the full year, we are lowering our spending forecast as follows: R&D is expected to be between $530 million and $540 million; SG&A will be between $340 million and $360 million; amortization of intangibles will be approximately $8 million; other income and expense for the June quarter will be a net expense of $12 million, due to lower interest income and anticipated hedging losses. For the full year, other interest and expense will be a net expense of approximately $33 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 266 million shares. The tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 13%. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

We are very pleased with the strength of our 28-nanometer products, which exceeded $160 million. As expected, we continue to expand the breadth of 28-nanometer sales contribution. The strength of our Virtex7",500,"Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. We are very pleased with the strength of our 28-nanometer products, which exceeded $160 million. As expected, we continue to expand the breadth of 28-nanometer sales contribution. The strength of our Virtex7 high end family and Zynq all programmable SoC was a particular highlight, driving 28-nanometer sales growth in wired comm, industrial and automotive applications. To fiscal year 2015, 28-nanometer revenue reached $580 million, driven by broad-based growth from all end markets and each of the 4 28-nanometer product families. 28-nanometer product generation continues to be the most successful node in history and we believe will have longest life of any node. As we discussed in our Investor Day last month, we are targeting [indiscernible] sales to grow approximately 30% in fiscal year 2016. 
Gross margin performance was another significant highlight for both the fourth quarter and the year. Gross margin increased 69.9% in the quarter, significantly better than forecasted and a record 70.2% for fiscal year 2015. Proven formula for successful execution established the 28-nanometer continues to yield excellent results for 20-nanometer with the UltraScale family. Leveraging our world-class partnership with TSMC, the undisputed leader in the foundry industry, are now delivering the industry's first and only 20-nanometer FPGAs volume production. Based on key customer feedback, we are more than 1 year ahead of the competition in terms of product advancement and quality. Additionally, we're shipping the industry only high-performance ASIC class 20-nanometer high-end product offering with Virtex UltraScale. Finally, with our second generation of 3D IC technology, we're shipping the industry's largest device, delivering more than 4x density of competitive devices. We're currently shipping 20-nanometer parts to approximately 100 discrete customers, demonstrating the broad-based acceptance of this family. This past quarter, sales from our 20-nanometer node were $5 million and we expect these sales to double the June quarter. 
The 60-nanometer node, we launched the UltraScale Plus family of FPGAs, 3D ICs and Zynq MP SoCs, combining embedded memory, 3D on 3D and multiprocessing SoC technology. Consistent level, the UltraScale Plus family provides 2x to 5x greater system-level performance per watt, significantly more systems integration and intelligence and the highest level of security and safety. We continue to anticipate the first tape out of our 16-nanometer FinFET  Plus process to be this quarter. During the March quarter, we also strengthened our family of SDx software defined development environment and the launch of the SDx SoC product. This environment enables a much larger software and systems development community to program SoCs and MP SoCs. Target high-growth opportunities, areas such as data center acceleration, software-defined networking, embedded vision and the industrial Internet of Things. Despite the near-term revenue growth challenges, I continue to be confident in our strategy to resume top line growth. Additionally, we're driving increased efficiencies in our operating model to improve productivity and appropriately align spending levels with the fiscal year '16 sales outlook we've previously provided. I now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A."

So that part, while it maybe starting off a little weaker than we anticipated, it isn't really radically scary as much at this point in time.

So given our market position which means 2 players and the potential for growth with both of them, I think, as they merge, it will provide a growth path for us going forward, assuming the combined player will emerge stronger as indeed they should. There does tend to be a little bit of confusion when it starts because these are 2 very large, very diverse companies with geographic footprints in different spaces and I do believe at least as they're doing the merger, there will be a little bit of a hiatus, but then it will-- as the merger is completed they will probably have renewed growth going forward."

There is an incessant need for an investment in the infrastructure and I think it has been shortchanged for too long. So you are right in pointing out that we've been disappointed and that this has taken longer. Actually, we have predicted this before but at this point, what we're seeing is a lot of the designs that we reap at the high end of the 28-nanometer are now moving to production and those got delayed roughly by a year vis-a-vis, our initial expectations. So between the market demands and the design wins we have at 28-nanometer, where you do have visibility in them now moving and hence, we made the comment on the growth of our Virtex7 product offering, those products are now starting to move into production and we expect that to be a portion of this snap back.

So the whole origin of the restructuring in the first place was around driving efficiency and getting more focused in areas, particularly in the sales area to accelerate our wins at customers. And that was really the genesis for doing it. And we sat there in the March timeframe and Investor Day obviously we knew we were doing restructuring but we never comment in advance on that for a variety of reasons. And the guide that we gave in March, there were certainly some things that weren't decided yet until our restructuring efforts even out early in March. As we've got through to really dissecting the sales organization and changing the focus away from reps to direct selling, this is where we've garner the biggest part of the dollar drop in the change in our guide since March. So it's really reflective of us figuring out how to put the right resources in the right places and sometimes that means you actually spend less when you have the right resources and that's the primary driver of what the reduction -- the net reduction that we have going on. Now your question around the exit rate, as I said in my remarks, the first quarter is particularly low and that's because we have a ramp headcount backup. I do think that the second quarter, we have a lot of more tape outs going on and that bounces around throughout the rest of the year and our exit rate at of Q4 will suggest some tick up and would suggest that some tick up in FY '17 but -- by the way, we're not there, so I'm not signaling that we're going to have a tick up in FY '17. So it will look like the Q1's low and then Q2, Q3, Q4 will be more flattish throughout the year but we certainly aren't making a statement yet about FY '17 spending."

That's the only really transition that we have --  excuse me, distributor in China, not rep, distributor in China. 1 distributor moving into our other distributors in terms of the business but nothing other than those 2 things. So reps in the U.S. and Europe. Generally, we're transitioning to direct sales.

I'm just wondering are you in fact involved, I know you are heavily exposed to the data center but are you involved in using the FPGA architecture to accelerate workload? Is this tens of million, hundreds of millions of opportunity for you? And then if you think about what's obviously happening with co-packaged FPGA and CPUs, how far in the future does it make sense in the workload acceleration sense to think about convergence wherein the processing and the FPGA are a single die?"

So now, I think we're well positioned and the key to our leadership is now in the software which enables achieving or getting at that acceleration in the most efficient way.

The nature of these applications is they're very, very fragmented and everyone of them tends to have a different payload and actually, that payload is dynamic so if you're using it to accelerate some sort of algorithm, the algorithm that you're accelerating changes all the time. And so if you do too much integration and you tend to have a very inflexible solution, you might end up losing, right? So when we talk to the customers and these tend to be a different class of companies. And their approach as they want to retain as much control over there acceleration path and they rather not give that to anyone else. And if you look at the way their approach has been typically, they do not buy from the traditional server companies. They actually build their own and they try to come up with a very specific solution, which is the most valuable for them. So there is a case to be made for integration but what you lose when you do the integration is a lot of the flexibility, which is inherently important for this market. And so I would say it's gray. In some cases it might go towards integration and others, actually having a separate solution and being able to maintain the flexibility there is a huge benefit."

Fiscal 2015 was another strong year of profitability for the company with operating income up 31.8%, the highest in 4 years. Industrial and aerospace and defense category increased 7% for the year, representing a record 39% of total sales. The communication segment declined 5% impacted by lower-than-expected CapEx spend in many of our sub-applications. The broadcast, consumer and automotive category decreased 2%. However, the automotive subsegment grew significantly, increasing 30% during the year. For the company as a whole, fiscal year sales were $2.4 billion, flat with the prior year. Gross margin was a record 70% for the fiscal year, benefiting from end market mix, as well as continued cost reduction and margin expansion initiatives across our product platform portfolio. In fiscal year 2015, we returned over 120% of our operating cash flow to shareholders, which represents about 40% of our revenues. This consisted of a record $306 million in dividend payout and a stock repurchase of 15.3 million shares for $650 million. The March quarter of fiscal 2015 marked the 10th consecutive year of dividend increases for the company, putting Xilinx in a very elite group of technology companies.
Cash flow per share has increased at a compound annual rate of 14% in the past 10 years, driven by a combination of gross margin expansion, disciplined expense controls, working capital management and share repurchase.
Turning now to a discussion of the March quarter. Xilinx sales were $567 million, down 4% sequentially and within our guidance. 28-nanometer sales exceeded $160 million as forecasted. Sales from communications and data center declined 7% sequentially and were weaker than anticipated. Wired communication was approximately flat as expected while wireless sales decreased double digits. The weakness in the wireless segment was primarily due to continued softness in North America and a weakening in China LTE business. Industrial and aerospace and defense business also decreased, although not as much as anticipated during the quarter. Expected declines from defense were partially offset by better-than-expected business from both industrial, scientific and medical, as well as test and measurement.
Lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive was better than expected with automotive achieving a record quarter, while broadcast was flat and consumer was down. Gross margin was 69.9% for the quarter, better than anticipated primarily as a result of product and customer mix, although we continue to be focused on driving improvements in profitability. Combined R&D and SG&A expense were $211 million, significantly lower than forecasted primarily as a result of lower stock-based compensation expense in addition to continued cost efforts.
Operating income was $159 million, including amortization of $2.4 million and a $24 million restructuring charge or $0.08 per diluted share. The restructuring charge reflects the impact of streamlining certain internal organizations, as well as the impact of a transition from sales reps to a direct sales model for certain customers. Other income was $1 million, higher than guided primarily due to an $8 million gain or $0.03 per diluted share from the sale of land.
Net income for the quarter was $135 million or $0.50 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $166 million before $6 million in CapEx during the quarter. Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million, slightly less than forecasted and down 25 million shares from the same quarter a year ago. There was a 5.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $175 million during the quarter and paid $70 million in dividends.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat sequentially at $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $15 million sequentially, but days increased to 136.
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year '16. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. Both wired and wireless communications are expected to decline. Wired communication remains sluggish, although data center will likely increase. Wireless will be impacted by slowing China LTE build in the near term. We expect the industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be down, driven primarily by continued expected decreases from A&D. Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to down 4% sequentially. And the midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 47%. The lower turns rate is primarily due to a couple of large customers being more fully booked to expectations and a regional distributor transition.
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% to 70%. Operating expenses for the June quarter are expected to be approximately $210 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The Q1 fiscal '16 operating expense level will be at its lowest level for the year due to lower tape-out activity and timing of expenses to ramp up headcount post-restructuring. The headcount additions will be largely driven by hiring in the sales force and to a lesser degree in R&D.
For the full year, we are lowering our spending forecast as follows: R&D is expected to be between $530 million and $540 million; SG&A will be between $340 million and $360 million; amortization of intangibles will be approximately $8 million; other income and expense for the June quarter will be a net expense of $12 million, due to lower interest income and anticipated hedging losses. For the full year, other interest and expense will be a net expense of approximately $33 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 266 million shares. The tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

As expected, we continue to expand the breadth of 28-nanometer sales contribution. The strength of our Virtex-7 high-end family and Zynq all programmable SoC was a particular highlight, driving 28-nanometer sales growth in wired comms, industrial and automotive applications. For the fiscal year 2015, 28-nanometer revenue reached $580 million, driven by broad-based growth from all end markets and each of the 4 28-nanometer product families. 28-nanometer product generation continues to be the most successful node in history, and we believe will have the longest life of any node. As we discussed at our Investor Day last month, we are targeting [indiscernible] sales to grow approximately 30% in fiscal year 2016.
Gross margin performance was another significant highlight for both fourth quarter and the year. Gross margin increased to 69.9% in the quarter, significantly better than forecasted and a record 70.2% for fiscal year 2015. Proven formula for successful execution established at 28-nanometer continues to yield excellent results for 20-nanometer with the UltraScale family. Leveraging our world-class partnership with TSMC, the undisputed leader in the foundry industry, we're now delivering the industry's first and only 20-nanometer FPGA volume production. Based on key customer feedback, we are more than 1 year ahead of the competition in terms of product robustness and quality. Additionally, we're shipping the industry's only high-performance ASIC class 20-nanometer high-end product offering with Virtex UltraScale. Finally, with our second generation of 3D IC technology, we're shipping the industry's largest device, delivering more than 4x the density of competitive devices. We're currently shipping 20-nanometer parts to approximately 100 discrete customers, demonstrating the broad-based acceptance of this family. This past quarter, sales from our 20-nanometer node were $5 million, and we expect these sales to double in the June quarter.
The 16-nanometer node, we launched the UltraScale+ family of FPGAs, 3D ICs and Zynq MPSoCs, combining embedded memory, 3D-on-3D and multiprocessing SoC technologies. Optimized at the system level, the UltraScale+ family provides 2 to 5x greater system level performance per watt, significantly more systems integration and intelligence, and the highest level of security and safety. We continue to anticipate the first tape-out of our 16-nanometer FinFET+ process to be this quarter.
During the March quarter, we also strengthened our family of SDx software-defined development environment with the launch of the SDSoC product. This environment enables a much larger software and systems development community to program our Zynq SoCs and MPSoCs, target high-growth opportunities, areas such as data center acceleration, software-defined networking, embedded vision and the industrial Internet of Things. Despite the near-term revenue growth challenges, I continue to be confident in our strategy to resume top line growth. Additionally, we are driving increased efficiencies in our operating model to improve productivity and appropriately align spending levels with the fiscal year '16 sales outlook we've previously provided.

We did think all along that our communications business, wireless specifically, would build throughout the year. So that part, while it may be starting off a little weaker than we anticipated, it isn't really radically scaring us much at this point in time.

So whether it happens or not, we don't know. But our position is very strong, and we are very confident in where we are.

One of the bigger expansions that have been going on over the last year or so has been the Sprint deployment, and they slowed down substantially. There seems to be some CapEx spend financing things going on here and there, and that's been slower for us on a relative basis to how strong we are to the ultimate OEMs who won those contracts. We don't -- best as what we can tell, we don't think this is some sort of a permanent thing. Some of those things are getting worked out as we talk to our customers in that particular area. I mean, largely, the AT&T and Verizon businesses is add-ons and capacity extensions, nothing significant going on there quite frankly in terms of the CapEx spend. It's really around Sprint and T-Mobile. And we're well positioned there. But it has definitely decelerated over the last couple of quarters, but we don't expect that to continue for the full year. Europe, while there has been some sales into Europe, it's still a little early, and we don't have, I would say, a clear view nor are we counting on a big percentage of that business to come in until maybe very late in the fiscal year."

So given our market position with these 2 players and the potential for growth with both of them, I think, as they merge, it will provide a growth path for us going forward, assuming the combined player will emerge stronger, as indeed they should. There does tend to be a little bit of confusion when it starts because these are 2 very large, very diverse companies with geographic footprints in different spaces. And I do believe that at least as they're doing the merger, there will be a little bit of a hiatus, but then it will -- as the merger is completed, they'll probably have renewed growth going forward."

And actually, we have predicted this before, but at this point, what we're seeing is a lot of the designs that we reaped at the high end of the 28-nanometer are now moving to production. And those got delayed roughly by a year vis–à–vis our initial expectations. So between the market demand and the design wins we have at 28-nanometer, where we do have visibility in them now moving and hence, we made the comment on the growth of our Virtex-7 product offering. Those products are now starting to move into production, and we expect that to be a portion of this snapback. And then of course, on the wireless side, there is elements which we expect.

So the whole origin of the restructuring in the first place was around driving efficiency and getting more focus in areas, particularly in the sales area to accelerate our wins at customers. And that was really the genesis for doing it. And we sat there in the March time frame in Investor Day, obviously, we knew we were doing restructuring, but we never comment in advance on that for a variety of reasons. And in the guide that we gave in March, there were certainly some things that weren't decided yet to our restructuring efforts even that early in March. As we got through to really dissecting the sales organization and changing the focus away from reps to direct selling, this is where we've garnered the biggest part of the dollar drop in the change in our guide since March. So it's really reflective of us figuring out how to put the right resources in the right places and sometimes that means you actually spend less when you have the right resources. And that's the primary driver of what the reduction -- the net reduction that we have going on. Now your question around the exit rate, as I said in my remarks, the first quarter is particularly low, and that's because we haven't ramped headcount back up. I do think that in the second quarter, we have a lot of more tape-outs going on, and that bounces around throughout the rest of the year. And our exit rate in -- out of Q4 will suggest some tick up in -- would suggest some tick up in FY '17, but -- oh, by the way, we're not there yet, so I'm not signaling that we are going to have a tick up in FY '17. So it will look like that the Q1's low and then Q2, Q3, Q4 will be more flattish throughout the year, but we certainly aren't making a statement yet about FY '17 spending."

Ryan, the China -- the FD on the China LTE is -- we've already seen builds going on by the OEMs. And we get more of our information through the OEMs than anywhere else. And so there already have been some builds and some shipments on the FD. So this is more of a timing issue as best as we can tell in what our customers are telling us versus they are changing their longer-term forecast for us. They don't. There are certainly no orders booked for the second half of the year at this point in time because our lead times are generally pretty short. So there's not a whole lot of impetus on the part of the OEMs to commit through a PO early even though they do provide us some guidance on forecast. And we don't see an overall lower number than we had anticipated maybe even in early March. So it really is more of a temporary slowness as best as we can tell, if anything else. On the tower sharing, no, we really haven't seen any impact whatsoever of the tower sharing. Doesn't even come up in our conversations. The issue there is really more about new towers, not old towers. So that's really not a factor."

It was generally the last part of the rollout. And as such, there was a large number of design wins. Now those design wins which were targeted at somewhat slower-moving markets like industrial and automotive, those design wins are moving to production. So it's a unique product. The number of design wins is phenomenal. We are learning because of its nature that in some cases it takes longer. It's also a more sophisticated product, hence, it takes a little longer to do the design. It requires both software and hardware. It has a high-performance embedded processor system. The number of design wins is just huge and the overall magnitude of the design win value on Zynq is very encouraging. It's very significant. And now, it is finally starting to grow a very healthy clip. So until last year, it was relatively negligible in terms of the portion of revenue, but now it's growing at a fast rate. And as these applications in automotive, wireless and Mil/Aero and industrial control are starting to hit production."

The nature of these applications is they're very, very fragmented. And every one of them tends to have a different payload. And actually, that payload is dynamic. So if you are using it to accelerate some sort of algorithm, the algorithm that you're accelerating changes all the time. And so if you do too much integration and you tend to have a very inflexible solution, you might end up losing, right? So when we talk to the customers and these tend to be a different class of companies. And their approach is they want to retain as much control over their acceleration path and they would rather not give that to anyone else. And if you look at the way their approach has been, typically, they do not buy from the traditional server companies. They actually build their own, and they try to come up with a very specific solution, which is the most valuable for them. So there is a case to be made for integration, but what you lose when you do the integration is a lot of the flexibility, which is inherently important for this market. And so I would say, it's gray. In some cases, it might go towards integration. In others, actually having a separate solution and being able to maintain the flexibility there is a huge benefit."

Fiscal 2015 was another strong year of profitability for the company with operating income up 31.8%, the highest in 4 years. Industrial and aerospace and defense category increased 7% for the year, representing a record 39% of total sales",998,"Thank you, Rick. Fiscal 2015 was another strong year of profitability for the company with operating income up 31.8%, the highest in 4 years. Industrial and aerospace and defense category increased 7% for the year, representing a record 39% of total sales. The communication segment declined 5%,  impacted by lower-than-expected CapEx spend in many of our sub-applications. The broadcast, consumer and automotive category decreased 2%. However, the automotive subsegment grew significantly, increasing 30% during the year. For the company as a whole, fiscal year sales were $2.4 billion, flat with the prior year. Gross margin was a record 70% for the fiscal year, benefiting from end market mix, as well as continued cost reduction and margin expansion initiatives across our product platform portfolio. In fiscal year 2015, we returned over 120% of our operating cash flow to shareholders, which represents about 40% of our revenues. This consisted of a record $306 million in dividend payout and a stock repurchase of 15.3 million shares for $650 million. The March quarter of fiscal 2015 marked the 10th consecutive year of dividend increases for the company, putting Xilinx in a very elite group of technology companies.
Cash flow per share has increased at a compound annual rate of 14% in the past 10 years, driven by a combination of gross margin expansion, disciplined expense controls, working capital management and share repurchase.
Turning now to a discussion of the March quarter. Xilinx sales were $567 million, down 4% sequentially and within our guidance. 28-nanometer sales exceeded $160 million as forecasted. Sales from communications and data center declined 7% sequentially and were weaker than anticipated. Wired communication was approximately flat as expected while wireless sales decreased double digits. The weakness in the wireless segment was primarily due to continued softness in North America and a weakening in China LTE business. Industrial and aerospace and defense business also decreased, although not as much as anticipated during the quarter. Expected declines from defense were partially offset by better-than-expected business from both industrial, scientific and medical, as well as test and measurement.
Lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive was better than expected with automotive achieving a record quarter, while broadcast was flat and consumer was down. Gross margin was 69.9% for the quarter, better than anticipated primarily as a result of product and customer mix, although we continue to be focused on driving improvements in profitability. Combined R&D and SG&A expense were $211 million, significantly lower than forecasted primarily as a result of lower stock-based compensation expense in addition to continued cost [audio gap] efforts.
Operating income was $159 million, including amortization of $2.4 million and a $24 million restructuring charge or $0.08 per diluted share. The restructuring charge reflects the impact of streamlining certain internal organizations, as well as the impact of a transition from sales reps to a direct sales model for certain customers. Other income was $1 million, higher than guided primarily due to an $8 million gain or $0.03 per diluted share from the sale of land.
Net income for the quarter was $135 million or $0.50 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $166 million before $6 million in CapEx during the quarter. Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million, slightly less than forecasted and down 25 million shares from the same quarter a year ago. There was a 5.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $175 million during the quarter and paid $70 million in dividends.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat sequentially at $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $15 million sequentially, but days increased to 136.
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year '16. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. Both wired and wireless communications are expected to decline. Wired communication remains sluggish, although data center will likely increase. Wireless will be impacted by slowing China LTE build in the near term. We expect the industrial and aerospace and defense segments to be down, driven primarily by continued expected decreases from A&D. Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to down 4% sequentially. And the midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 47%. The lower turns rate is primarily due to a couple of large customers being more fully booked to expectations and a regional distributor transition.
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% to 70%. Operating expenses for the June quarter are expected to be approximately $210 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The Q1 fiscal '16 operating expense level will be at its lowest level for the year due to lower tape-out activity and timing of expenses to ramp up headcount post-restructuring. The headcount additions will be largely driven by hiring in the sales force and to a lesser degree in R&D.
For the full year, we are lowering our spending forecast as follows: R&D is expected to be between $530 million and $540 million; SG&A will be between $340 million and $360 million; amortization of intangibles will be approximately $8 million; other income and expense for the June quarter will be a net expense of $12 million, due to lower interest income and anticipated hedging losses. For the full year, other interest and expense will be a net expense of approximately $33 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 266 million shares. The tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

We are very pleased with the strength of our 28-nanometer products which exceeded $160 million. As expected, we continue to expand the breadth of 28-nanometer sales contribution. The strength of our Virtex-7",502,"Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. We are very pleased with the strength of our 28-nanometer products which exceeded $160 million. As expected, we continue to expand the breadth of 28-nanometer sales contribution. The strength of our Virtex-7 high-end family and Zynq all programmable SoC was a particular highlight, driving 28-nanometer sales growth in wired comms, industrial and automotive applications. For the fiscal year 2015, 28-nanometer revenue reached $580 million, driven by broad-based growth from all end markets and each of the 4 28-nanometer product families. 28-nanometer product generation continues to be the most successful node in history, and we believe will have the longest life of any node. As we discussed at our Investor Day last month, we are targeting [indiscernible] sales to grow approximately 30% in fiscal year 2016.
Gross margin performance was another significant highlight for both fourth quarter and the year. Gross margin increased to 69.9% in the quarter, significantly better than forecasted and a record 70.2% for fiscal year 2015. The proven formula for successful execution established at 28-nanometer continues to yield excellent results for 20-nanometer with the UltraScale family. Leveraging our world-class partnership with TSMC, the undisputed leader in the foundry industry, we're now delivering the industry's first and only 20-nanometer FPGA volume production. Based on key customer feedback, we are more than 1 year ahead of the competition in terms of product robustness and quality. Additionally, we're shipping the industry's only high-performance ASIC class 20-nanometer high-end product offering with Virtex UltraScale. Finally, with our second generation of 3D IC technology, we're shipping the industry's largest device, delivering more than 4x the density of competitive devices. We're currently shipping 20-nanometer parts to approximately 100 discrete customers, demonstrating the broad-based acceptance of this family. This past quarter, sales from our 20-nanometer node were $5 million, and we expect these sales to double in the June quarter.
In the 16-nanometer node, we launched the UltraScale+ family of FPGAs, 3D ICs and Zynq MPSoCs, combining embedded memory, 3D-on-3D and multiprocessing SoC technologies. Optimized at the system level, the UltraScale+ family provides 2 to 5x greater system level performance per watt, significantly more systems integration and intelligence, and the highest level of security and safety. We continue to anticipate the first tape-out of our 16-nanometer FinFET+ process to be this quarter.
During the March quarter, we also strengthened our family of SDx software-defined development environment with the launch of the SDSoC product. This environment enables a much larger software and systems development community to program our Zynq SoCs and MPSoCs, targets high-growth opportunities, areas such as data center acceleration, software-defined networking, embedded vision and the industrial Internet of Things. Despite the near-term revenue growth challenges, I continue to be confident in our strategy to resume top line growth. Additionally, we are driving increased efficiencies in our operating model to improve productivity and appropriately align spending levels with the fiscal year '16 sales outlook we've previously provided.
We now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A."

So that part, while it may be starting off a little weaker than we anticipated, it isn't really radically scaring us much at this point in time.

We don't -- best as what we can tell, we don't think this is some sort of a permanent thing. Some of those things are getting worked out as we talk to our customers in that particular area. I mean, largely, the AT&T and Verizon businesses is add-ons and capacity extensions, nothing significant going on there quite frankly in terms of the CapEx spend. It's really around Sprint and T-Mobile. And we're well positioned there. But it has definitely decelerated over the last couple of quarters, but we don't expect that to continue for the full year.

From your description of what's going on in lowering the full year by about 3%, it sounds like there's an aspect of tightening the belt overall and then also some timing issues on OpEx. Are you expecting us to exit this year at the same sort of OpEx level that we would have before and therefore, fiscal '17 would kind of be the same as we would have thought before or is this truly a cut in OpEx levels longer term?"

So the whole origin of the restructuring in the first place was around driving efficiency and getting more focus in areas, particularly in the sales area to accelerate our wins at customers. And that was really the genesis for doing it. And we sat there in the March time frame in Investor Day, obviously, we knew we were doing restructuring, but we never comment in advance on that for a variety of reasons. And in the guide that we gave in March, there were certainly some things that weren't decided yet as to our restructuring efforts even that early in March. As we got through to really dissecting the sales organization and changing the focus away from reps to direct selling, this is where we've garnered the biggest part of the dollar drop in the change in our guide since March. So it's really reflective of us figuring out how to put the right resources in the right places and sometimes that means you actually spend less when you have the right resources. And that's the primary driver of what the reduction -- the net reduction that we have going on. Now your question around the exit rate, as I said in my remarks, the first quarter is particularly low, and that's because we haven't ramped headcount back up. I do think that in the second quarter, we have a lot of more tape-outs going on, and that bounces around throughout the rest of the year. And our exit rate in -- out of Q4 will suggest some tick up in -- would suggest some tick up in FY '17, but -- oh, by the way, we're not there yet, so I'm not signaling that we are going to have a tick up in FY '17. So it will look like that the Q1's low and then Q2, Q3, Q4 will be more flattish throughout the year, but we certainly aren't making a statement yet about FY '17 spending."

These tools tend to be somewhat application-specific or it's not one-size-fits-all. They tend to have different targets. But once you use these tools, you can enable usage by a broader set of customers and in particular, engineers with more of a software background. And there are a lot more software engineers than there are hardware engineers. And the reason we are doing it is in order to expand the SAM. And the intention here is to provide a alternative -- an attractive alternative to ASSP standard product. So that's what this is. This is SAM expansion.

The nature of these applications is they're very, very fragmented. And every one of them tends to have a different payload. And actually, that payload is dynamic. So if you are using it to accelerate some sort of algorithm, the algorithm that you're accelerating changes all the time. And so if you do too much integration and you tend to have a very inflexible solution, you might end up losing, right? So when we talk to the customers and these tend to be a different class of companies. And their approach is they want to retain as much control over their acceleration path and they would rather not give that to anyone else. And if you look at the way their approach has been, typically, they do not buy from the traditional server companies. They actually build their own, and they try to come up with a very specific solution, which is the most valuable for them. So there is a case to be made for integration, but what you lose when you do the integration is a lot of the flexibility, which is inherently important for this market. And so I would say, it's gray. In some cases, it might go towards integration. In others, actually having a separate solution and being able to maintain the flexibility there is a huge benefit."

The volume sales were $529 million, down 3% sequentially and within our guidance. Profitability remains strong during quarter with a better-than-expected gross margins continued to OpEx control and healthy cash flow generation. New product sales decreased 10% in the quarter, almost entirely driven by 28-nanometer products, which were impacted by week sales awareness customers. Sales from 20-nanometer products exceeded $10 million during the quarter, doubling from the prior quarter. 
From an end market perspective, sales from communications and data center remained weak, decreasing 11% sequentially. The greater-than-forecasted decline was driven by wireless communications, which was weaker-than-anticipated due to continued declines from our broad base of customers, predominately serving the China and U.S. market. Wireless sales were as expected for the quarter, while shipments into the cable assess business were particularly strong, overall CapEx spending remains weak. Wireless communications was the largest end market contributor to 28-nanometer revenues in fiscal Q1. 
The industrial and aerospace and defense segment was better-than-forecasted driven by ISM and AMD. ISM sales were a record during the quarter. Sales from test declined as expected. 
Lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive was essentially flat as expected. Although flat sequentially, sales from automotive are up nearly 50% from the same quarter a year ago and remain at a record 7% of total sales. Gross margin was 70.9% for the quarter, better than anticipated primarily as a result of product and customer mix, although we continue to be focused on driving improvements in profitability. Operating expenses, including $2 million in amortization were $211 million in line with expectations. Other income was a net expense of $11 million, slightly better-than-forecasted due to a long-term investment gains. Net income for the quarter was $148 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $183 million before $8 million in CapEx. Diluted shares for the quarter were $271 million. There was a $9 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. 
We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million during the quarter, and made a record $80 million payment in quarterly dividends. We returned nearly 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders during the quarter. 
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat at $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars in Xilinx decreased $9 million sequentially. Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter of fiscal year '16. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Communications is forecasted to be flat. The wireless market continues to be challenging and is negatively impacting our previously-stated full year revenue estimates. While we do expect improvement in the second half of fiscal '16 from increased spending in China, North America and India, the rate of improvement remains difficult to forecast. Wired communications continues to be impacted by a weak CapEx environments, although we expected to continue to benefit throughout the year from revenue growth in new programs where we have displayed ASSPs, in addition to gaining share and traditional BGA sockets. The strength of these programs are in the areas of cable, infrastructure, access and OTN. We expect the industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be down substantially due to a decrease in A&D driven by the expected conclusion of a large program. Xilinx's 28-nanometer parts were recently designed in the subsystems to the next generation program that is expected to begin production in fiscal year '17. Although the aerospace and defense market has been characterized by quarterly volatility, this segment remains an important business for Xilinx. Our 28-nanometer revenues are growing at a rate much faster than previous new product introductions as we expand our presence in areas such as situational awareness, public safety and embedded vision systems. ISM is expected to be approximately flat during the quarter, and test is expected to decline. Lastly, we expect all comp on is broadcast, consumer and automotive category to be flat. We Expect strong growth in automotive and fiscal '16 as Zynq enters volume production at many large OEMs. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be down 2% to 6%, so down 2% to down 6% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on terms where approximately 51%. Gross margin expected approximately 59% to 70%. 
Operating expenses for the September quarter are expected to be approximately $217 million, including $2 million of amortization by acquisition-related intangibles. As I mentioned last quarter, Q1 OpEx would be the low point for the year. The increase in Q2 OpEx will be driven primarily by hiring in the sales force and increased tapeout expense related primarily to the 16-nanometer technology regeneration. Other income and expense for the September quarter will be a net expense of $10 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 268 million shares. The tax rate for September quarter is expected to be approximately 12%. The reset of our tax rate guidance to 12% is due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

Though the June quarter was challenging from top-line perspective, we continued to be pleased with our focus on delivering sustained type profitability. Gross margin was 70.9%, better than expectations, driving an operating margin of 32.5%. 28-nanometer decline as we anticipated driven by weakness in wireless communication. However, sales from our Zynq product family to industry first programmable SoCs increased more than 40%. The primary driver for this growth came from applications. Important industry growth driver ideally suited to benefit from the Zynq product families, innovative differentiated capabilities. We expect 28-nanometers sales to return to growth in the September quarter, driven by continued sales increase from the Zynq products, as well as an increase in wired communication. Additionally, we're focused in 28-nanometer revenue to grow for the balance of fiscal year 2016 driven by demand stabilization in communications, the continued strong adoption in automotive, ISM, test and aerospace and defense. We're also executing very well with our 20-nanometer UltraScale portfolio. Technology leadership at this node is very rapidly translation to sales leadership. We have now shipped 20-nanometer parts to more than 140 discrete customers in all of our major end-markets. 20-nanometer revenue in the June quarter is doubled sequentially, more than $10 million significant growth coming from Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only ASIC Class 20-nanometer high-end product offering. 
In the September quarter, we are forecasting 20-nanometer sales to exceed $50 million so experiencing a sales ramp that is more accelerated than our initial expectation. We estimate our share at this node to be approaching 82% [ph]. Confident our share of 20-nanometer will continue to exceed 65% market share, we have delivered at 28-nanometer. The 16-nanometer node, we take out the industry's first, all-programmable multi-processor SoC using TSMC, 16 SSS, FF+ process. This product family targets applications in embedded vision, including industrial Internet of Things and 5 and systems. During the June quarter, we also extended our world-class partnership with TSMC, the undisputed leader in the foundry industry with the announcement that we will leveraging TSMC's 7-nanometer process technology, 3D IC technologies for a next generation of all programmable FPGAs, 3D ICs, and MPSoCs. Technology represents the fourth consecutive generation where the 2 companies are partnered, plans process forward back into technology and will become TSMC's fourth generatean of FinFET technology. We anticipate the first, tapeout of 7-nanometer in calendar 2017. 
Finally, with regard to design software, earlier this week, we announced the public assets release of our SDSoCs development  environment to expand the user base of Zynq SoCs and MPSoCs to a broad community of systems and software engineers both existing and new markets. Despite weak global communication spending environment, I remain very confident in Xilinx's strong technology leadership and market expansion initiatives driven by Zynq, our new software-defined development  environment. We will continue to focus on maintaining high levels of profitability in any business environment with the overall goal of maximizing shareholder return.

So fundamentally, if you look at the markets we serve is there, i.e., diversified markets that look for their advanced technology and a significant level of support with a very long life cycle. And this is a market we have serviced really well. We continue to service it well. We have delivered market share expansion of 28-nanometer. We're seeing that expand in a better position of 20. We believe we're ahead of the game now being this first, tapeout at the node to beyond that 16. And we are already working with SMC on the 7-nanometer, and we expect the tapeout in the 2017 timeframe. So on the silicon side, the customers are very sure that they will continue to have the same level of excellence in terms of technology leadership and timeliness and that's an opportunity for us. Now when you supplement that with the leadership we have in the softer and expansion within the new products, the SD Xcel and the SDSoC, which we now are broadly are making available to customers. And not only is it the best silicon, but it's the best software in the industry and the best support infrastructure in the industry. So we actually believe that this is an opportunity for us and we'd say that customers are reassured by that, and we know that we are the biggest and have been for the longest period of time, the leader in the bell weather player in this market. So we remain committed to it and together with our unique relationship with TSMC and, they will continue to get the best product around to serve their requirements. So as the market will evolve, and we don't know what will happen on the other side, I think generally speaking, this bodes well for us, and that's why we're in this -- continue to invest heavily to make sure we can exploit this opportunity."

So there's upside for us there. And we think we can do it with the ARM product roadmap and with the TSMC process and we've already demonstrated that. There's a lot of bluster about the leadership that Intel would deliver to Altera. In fact is we already had with regards to that note. So we believe that we're in good shape, both strategically and tactically and definitely the ARM roadmap will suffice. Now, if you're asking a very specific question, could there be markets where a fully optimized X86 which should provide some advantage. The answer to that is, yes.

So 20 is not as big as 28, but neither did we expect to be and 20 is now benefiting from the fact that we have a high-end and midrange there, and that's what is generating this level of revenue. But there's no low end then there's no Zynq equivalent on the 20-nanometer. And hence overall, it's not as a vibrant as the 28 was, but on the other hand, it's doing better than we had expected.

It really isn't the same trends. China, in general, has been stalled out, both because the SD standard deployment, which is one of the bigger things that we were counting on for this year to actually begin and be more robust as we move through the year. That was sold out originally by China Unicom and China Telecoms. The audits that they had relative to ethics and those kind of things that went on. There's been an overall slowdown of capital spend in China on infrastructure, which is more of a macro thing going on relative to the China issue. So I think that's been the biggest driver there. And there absolutely has been a buildup of basestation inventory and our product in the Chinese suppliers that is being led off as China Mobile continue to deploy in a much lower rate than the previous year but China Telecom and not as much. So if you -- people have told me that if you're in China, and you're using one of those the handset from the China Mobile Network, it's still a lot of coverage issues and a lot lots of things to bid on there's I'm not sure, sure it's driven by the subscriber pull. I think there's some the bigger issue is going on there. Relative to North America, it's kind of bifurcated into Sprint who is also having some financial issues in terms of funding other network so they slowed down the deployment of their network and they've gone through a rebidding process and the process is being completed as best as we can tell, and so again, we think that because of those milestones, we think things are going to start to turn around and grow for us in the second half of this year and into calendar 2016. AT&T and Verizon has a slowed down their cap spending in the first part of the year. There were Spectrum acquisitions. They also are starting to spend a little more money and there's going to be additional capacity of that network. So it's really is different by different carriers and geographies. The thought process about what's going to turn this around for us is just exactly the fact that subscriber and coverage is not uniformly sufficient and good in those geographies. And as much as we said earlier, it's a matter of when, it's not a matter of if for us. And again, we've seen positive the press coming out of carriers relative to some improvement in that. We've seen orders with respect to India, some growth there, we, so we have specific orders ahead of us on that. So we are starting to see some positive signs that would lead us to believe that the second half of fiscal year will be better."

So the various elements to the data center and there's element of focus on storage, elements of focus on networking and elements of focus on compute.

So the various elements to the data center and there's element of focus on storage, elements of focus on networking and elements of focus on compute. So the storage and networking are largely impacted by this acquisition. The compute space, it's very clear that FPGAs provide a viable, very attractive lower power solution, which significantly provides an improvement in the performance per watt what we are seeing is somewhere between 22 to 30X on -- in several applications vis-à-vis standalone, high-performance processor. And that's because these applications in the cloud tend to be massively parallel and these processors are inherently not parallel engines. They're very sequential, that's the way a CPU operates. And even if you have multiple CPU calls, you can only achieve a certain level of parallelism that they. So FPGA is actually kind of provide tremendous acceleration at the same platform or level of power consumption, just to make sure, or they can provide at a much lower level of power consumption, they cna deliver equivalent performance. Now we believe that when Intel consummates its acquisition, when that happens, then there will be some integration opportunities. The challenge there is that you're taking a very high power solution, which is an X86, and you're adding to it another high-power solution, which is a larger FPGA and to some extent if you try to integrate both of those in the silicon, you're limited with regards to what you can do. So we believe that, that market, the Intel as 86 will have an element, which will have an integrated solution and there will have an element which has these distributed solutions where the FPGA will be separate. We see a lot of the traditional data center customers having a strong interest in actually retaining autonomy and independence in that second mode. So they can decide how they designed their system and obviously would be a wonderful solution for them. So even in the Intel x86 a space we believe we have to play. Not to mention that everywhere where it's not Intel, and this is a market, which is emerging, so there's a lot of competing solutions, it will come to the market over the next few years. We will be the natural shoe in for that. So those solutions. So I would say there's upside for us definitely vis-a-vis beyond where we are today and we're committed to that market, and we expect to see business growth in that market. And we believe that, that market is in its very early stages of evolution and over time, we will have the stronger position in it than we definitely have now. So hopefully that answered your question. I apologize if it was more [indiscernible]. Next question."

I think we're at a point here of certainly a multi-year historical low for us in terms of our revenue and in this segment and it is challenging. But I think we'll continue to try to push through and figure this out. Now, relative to the terms percentage number that I provided while it was quite a bit higher on a percentage basis, then our actual turns from the previous quarter, I think we've been relatively conservative on the wireless forecast that supports that. We had quite a bit of business booked early in the quarter, the previous quarter, and then moving into this current quarter that we just started, we're back to a more normal booking pattern and the actual dollars we need in terms on a weekly basis is not that much greater than the actual dollars per week we had in the previous quarter.

We do have a slightly stronger industrial, aerospace and defense profile than we thought at that point in time, and we had a substantially weaker communications business. And that mix would tend to push our gross margins to this very high elevated point that we are right now. So I think both product and customer mix is accounted for quite a bit. As is, I think in the absence a more normal -- normalized end market mix that we would've envisioned at the Investor Day, we'll be running in the 68% to 70%, probably pretty close to the center of that.

So it's combination of both 3 -- just to sort of comment on that, what we're seeing and I said this in response to an early question, we're seeing customers look at a canned, non-differentiated ASSPs option versus a highly differentiated solution using our devices. And for the high-end, it's a no-brainer that they want the differentiated solution. And then as you look at the midrange, it's less clear and definitely the low end times, they just prepared to have their meat and potato solution as opposed to something which is more specialized. But interestingly, because this has become a platform play, then we're starting to see design wins where the customers are committing their entire product offering to our platform and as a result, they're pushing us hard to provide them with a lower end, and we typically would have provided or solution for that. And so that's a growth opportunity for us, and it's driven by this broad platform approach where the companies are set of saying we can't afford to have different solutions and because we want to have differentiation, they go with us across the board.

The volume sales were $549 million, down 3% sequentially and within our guidance. Profitability remained strong during the quarter with a better-than-expected gross margin, continued OpEx control and healthy cash flow generation.  New product sales decreased 10% in the quarter, almost entirely driven by 28-nanometer products which were impacted by weak sales to wireless customers. Sales from 20-nanometer products exceeded $10 million during the quarter, doubling from the prior quarter. 
From an end market perspective, sales from communication and data center remained weak, decreasing 11% sequentially. The greater-than-forecasted decline was driven by wireless communications, which was weaker than anticipated due to continued decline from our broad base of customers predominantly serving the China and U.S. markets. Wired sales were as expected for the quarter. While shipments into the cable access business were particularly strong, overall CapEx spending remains weak. Wired communications was the largest end market contributor to 28-nanometer revenues in fiscal Q1. The industrial and aerospace and defense segment was better than forecasted, driven by ISM and A&D. ISM sales were a record during the quarter. Sales from test declined as expected. 
Lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive was essentially flat as expected. Although flat sequentially, sales from automotive are up nearly 50% from the same quarter a year ago and remain at a record 7% of total sales. Gross margin was 70.9% for the quarter, better than anticipated, primarily as a result of product and customer mix, although we continued to be focused on driving improvements in profitability. 
Operating expenses, including $2 million in amortization, were $211 million, in line with expectations. 
Other income was a net expense of $11 million, slightly better than forecasted due to a long-term investment gains. 
Net income for the quarter was $148 million or $0.55 per diluted share. 
Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $183 million before $8 million in CapEx. 
Diluted shares for the quarter were $271 million. There was a $9 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. 
We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and made a record $80 million payment in quarterly dividends. We returned nearly 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders during the quarter. 
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat at $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased $9 million sequentially. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter of fiscal year '16. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Communications is forecasted to be flat. The wireless market continues to be challenging and is negatively impacting our previously stated full year revenue estimates. While we do expect improvement in the second half of fiscal '16 from increased spending in China, North America and India, the rate of improvement remains difficult to forecast. Wired communications continues to be impacted by a weak CapEx environment, although we expect to continue to benefit throughout the year from revenue growth in new programs where we have displayed the ASSPs in addition to gaining share in traditional and BGA sockets. The strength of these programs are in the areas of cable infrastructure, access and OTN. We expect the industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be down substantially due to a decrease in A&D, driven by the expected conclusion of a large program. 
Xilinx's 28-nanometer parts were recently designed into subsystems of the next-generation program that is expected to begin production in fiscal year '17. Although the aerospace and defense market has been characterized by quarterly volatility, this segment remains an important business for Xilinx. Our 28-nanometer revenues are growing at a rate much faster than previous new product introductions as we expand our presence in areas, such as situational awareness, public safety and embedded vision systems. ISM is expected to be approximately flat during the quarter, and test is expected to decline. 
Lastly, we expect all components of the broadcast, consumer and automotive category to be approximately flat. We expect strong growth in automotive in fiscal '16 as Zynq enters volume production at many large OEMs. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be down 2% to 6% -- so down 2% to down 6% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 51%. 
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% to 70%. Operating expenses for the September quarter are expected to be approximately $217 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. 
As I mentioned last quarter, Q1 OpEx would be the low point for the year. The increase in Q2 OpEx will be driven primarily by hiring in the sales force and increased tapeout expense related primarily to the 16-nanometer technology generation. 
Other income and expense for the September quarter will be a net expense of $10 million. 
The share count is expected to be approximately 268 million shares. 
The tax rate for September quarter is expected to be approximately 12%. The reset of our tax rate guidance to 12% is due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.

Though the June quarter was challenging from top line perspective, I continued to be pleased with our focus on delivering sustained type profitability. Gross margin was 70.9%, better than expectations, driving an operating margin of 32.5%. 28-nanometer decline, as we anticipated, driven by weakness in wireless communications. However, sales from our Zynq product family, the industries first all-programmable SoCs, increased more than 40%. The primary driver for this growth came from ADAS applications, important industry growth driver ideally suited to benefit from the Zynq product families, innovative and differentiated capabilities. We expect 28-nanometer sales to return to growth in the September quarter, driven by continued sales increase from the Zynq products, as well as an increase in wired communications. Additionally, we're forecasting 28-nanometer revenue to grow for the balance of fiscal year 2016, driven by demand stabilization in communications and continued strong adoption in automotive, ISM, test and aerospace and defense. We're also executing very well with our 20-nanometer UltraScale portfolio. Technology leadership at this node is very rapidly translating to sales leadership. We have now shipped 20-nanometer parts to more than 140 discrete customers in all of our major end markets. 20-nanometer revenue in the June quarter doubled sequentially to more than $10 million with significant growth coming from Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only ASIC class, 20-nanometer high-end product offering. 
In the September quarter, we are forecasting 20-nanometer sales to exceed $50 million, so experiencing a sales ramp that is more accelerated than our initial expectation. We estimate our share of this node to be approaching 82%, confident our share of 20-nanometer will continue to exceed 65% market share we have delivered at 28-nanometer. 
The 16-nanometer node, we taped out the industry's first All Programmable Multi-Processor SoC using TSMC's 16FF+ process. This product family targets applications in embedded vision, including ADAS, Industrial Internet of Things and 5G wireless systems. 
During the June quarter, we also extended our world-class partnership with TSMC, the undisputed leader in the foundry industry with the announcement that we will be leveraging TSMC's 7-nanometer process technology, 3D IC technology for our next generation of All Programmable FPGAs, 3D ICs and MPSoCs. The technology represents the fourth consecutive generation where the 2 companies are partnered, advanced process and CoWoS stacking technology and will become TSMC's fourth generation of FinFET technology. We anticipate the first tapeout of 7-nanometer in calendar 2017. 
Finally, with regard to design software, earlier this week, we announced the public access release of our SDSoC development  environment to expand the user base of Zynq SoCs and MPSoCs to a broad community of systems and software engineers, both existing in new markets. 
Despite weak global communication spending environment, I remain very confident in Xilinx's strong technology leadership and market expansion initiatives driven by Zynq, our new SDx software-designed development environment. We will continue to focus on maintaining high levels of profitability in any business environment with the overall goal of maximizing shareholder return [ph].

We believe we're ahead of the game now, being the first to tapeout at the node beyond that 16. And we are already working with TSMC on the 7-nanometer, and we expect to tapeout in the 2017 time frame. So on the silicon side, the customers are very assured that they will continue to have the same level of excellence in terms of technology, leadership and timeliness, and that's an opportunity for us. Now when you supplement that with the leadership we have in the software and the expansion with the new products, the FD Xcell and the SDSoC, which we now are broadly making available to customers. And not only is it the best silicon, but it's the best software in the industry and the best support infrastructure in the industry. So we actually believe that this is an opportunity for us, and we'd say that customers are reassured by that, and we know that we are the biggest and have been for the longest period of time the leader and the bellwether player in this market. So we remain committed to it. And together with our unique relationship with TSMC and ARM now, they will continue to get the best product around to serve their requirements. So as the market will evolve and we don't know what will happen on the other side, I think generally speaking, this bodes well for us.

And what we decided to do is to shoot for the best technology, which will be available in that sort of time frame.

To that question, it really isn't the same trends or stuff. China, in general, has been stalled out, both the FD standard deployment, which is one of the bigger things that was -- we were counting on for this year to actually begin and be more robust as we move through the year. That was stalled out originally by China Unicom and China Telecoms, the audits that they had relative to ethics and those kinds of things that went on. There's been an overall slowdown of capital spend in China on infrastructure which is more of a macro thing going on relative to the China issue. So I think that's been the biggest driver there. And there absolutely has been a buildup of base station, inventory and our product in the Chinese suppliers that is being led off, as China Mobile continues to deploy at a much lower rate than the previous year. But China Unicom and China Telecom not as much. So if you -- people have told me that if you're in China and you're using one of those handsets from the China Mobile network, there's still a lot of coverage issues and a lot -- so there's lot of things are left to be done there. So I'm not so sure it's driven by the subscriber pool. I think there are some bigger issues going on there. Relative to North America, it's kind of bifurcated into Sprint who is also having some financial issues in terms of funding other networks. So they slowed down the deployment of their network. And they've gone through a rebidding process, and that process has been completed as best as we can tell. And so again, we think that because of those milestones, we think things are going to start to turn around and grow for us in the second half of this year and into calendar 2016. AT&T and Verizon has slowed down their cap spending in the first part of the year. There were Spectrum acquisitions. They also are starting to spend a little more money now, and there are going to be additional capacity utilization of that network. So it really is different by different carriers and geographies. The thought process about what's going to turn this around for us is just exactly the fact that subscriber and coverage is not uniformly sufficient and good in those geographies. And as Moshe said earlier, it's a matter of when, it's not a matter of if for us. And again, we've seen positive press coming out of carriers relative to some improvement in that. We've seen orders come with respect to India, some growth there. So we have some specific orders ahead of us on that. So we are starting to see some positive signs that would lead us to believe that the second half of the fiscal year will be better."

So the various elements to the data center and there is elements that focus on storage, elements that focus on networking and elements that focus on compute. So the storage and networking are largely unimpacted by this acquisition. And the compute space, it's very clear that FPGAs provide a viable, very attractive lower-power solution, which significantly provides an improvement in the performance per watt by -- what we are seeing is somewhere between 22 to 30X on -- in several applications, vis-à-vis stand-alone, high-performance processor. And that's because these applications in the cloud tend to be massively parallel, and these processors are inherently not parallel engines. They're very sequential. That's the way a CPU operates. And even if you have multiple CPU cords, you can achieve only a certain level of parallelism that way. So FPGAs actually can provide tremendous acceleration at the same power form or level of power consumption, just to make sure, or they can provide at a much lower level of power consumption. They can deliver equivalent performance. Now we believe that when Intel consummates its acquisition, when that happens, then there will be some integration opportunities. The challenge there is that you're taking a very high-power solution, which is an x86, and you're adding to it another high-power solution, which is a larger FPGA. And to some extent, if you try to integrate both of those on the same silicon, you're limited with regards to what you can do. So we believe that, that market, the Intel x86 will have an element which will have an integrated solution, and there will have an element which has these distributed solutions where the FPGA will be separate. We see a lot of the traditional data center customers having a strong interest in actually retaining autonomy and independence in that second mode. So they can decide how they design their system, and obviously would be a wonderful solution for them. So even in the Intel x86 space, we believe we have a play. Not to mention that everywhere where it's not Intel, and this is a market which is emerging, right? So there's a lot of competing solutions. It will come to the market over the next few years. We will be the natural shoo-in for that for those solutions. So I would say there is upside for us definitely vis-a-vis beyond where we are today. And we are committed to that market, and we expect to see business growth in that market. And we believe that, that market is in its very early stages of evolution. And over time, we will have a stronger position in it than we definitely have now. So hopefully that answered your question. I apologize if it was more than you wanted to hear or not."

But interestingly, because this has become a platform play, then we are starting to see design wins where the customers are committing their entire product offering to our platform. And as a result, they're pushing us hard to provide them with a lower end, and we typically would have provided a solution for that. And so that's a growth opportunity for us, and it's driven by this broad platform-oriented approach where the companies are sort of saying, ""We can't afford to have different solutions,"" and because we want to have differentiation, they go with us across the board. And that's another reason that I believe that our market share, which we're happy with the revenue at this point, but our market share is not high yet. We believe that there is an opportunity to grow it going forward."

Xilinx sales were $549 million, down 3% sequentially and within our guidance. Profitability remained strong during the quarter with a better-than-expected gross margin, continued OpEx control and healthy cash flow generation.  New product",897,"Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $549 million, down 3% sequentially and within our guidance. Profitability remained strong during the quarter with a better-than-expected gross margin, continued OpEx control and healthy cash flow generation.  New product sales decreased 10% in the quarter, almost entirely driven by 28-nanometer products which were impacted by weak sales to wireless customers. Sales from 20-nanometer products exceeded $10 million during the quarter, doubling from the prior quarter. 
From an end market perspective, sales from communication and data center remained weak, decreasing 11% sequentially. The greater-than-forecasted decline was driven by wireless communications, which was weaker than anticipated due to continued decline from our broad base of customers predominantly serving the China and U.S. markets. Wired sales were as expected for the quarter. While shipments into the cable access business were particularly strong, overall CapEx spending remains weak. Wired communications was the largest end market contributor to 28-nanometer revenues in fiscal Q1. The industrial and aerospace and defense segment was better than forecasted, driven by ISM and A&D. ISM sales were a record during the quarter. Sales from test declined as expected. 
Lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive was essentially flat as expected. Although flat sequentially, sales from automotive are up nearly 50% from the same quarter a year ago and remain at a record 7% of total sales. Gross margin was 70.9% for the quarter, better than anticipated, primarily as a result of product and customer mix, although we continued to be focused on driving improvements in profitability. 
Operating expenses, including $2 million in amortization, were $211 million, in line with expectations. 
Other income was a net expense of $11 million, slightly better than forecasted due to a long-term investment gains. 
Net income for the quarter was $148 million or $0.55 per diluted share. 
Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $183 million before $8 million in CapEx. 
Diluted shares for the quarter were $271 million. There was a $9 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. 
We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and made a record $80 million payment in quarterly dividends. We returned nearly 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders during the quarter. 
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat at $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased $9 million sequentially. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter of fiscal year '16. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Communications is forecasted to be flat. The wireless market continues to be challenging and is negatively impacting our previously stated full year revenue estimates. While we do expect improvement in the second half of fiscal '16 from increased spending in China, North America and India, the rate of improvement remains difficult to forecast. Wired communications continues to be impacted by a weak CapEx environment, although we expect to continue to benefit throughout the year from revenue growth in new programs where we have displayed the ASSPs in addition to gaining share in traditional and BGA sockets. The strength of these programs are in the areas of cable infrastructure, access and OTN. We expect the industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be down substantially due to a decrease in A&D, driven by the expected conclusion of a large program. 
Xilinx's 28-nanometer parts were recently designed into subsystems of the next-generation program that is expected to begin production in fiscal year '17. Although the aerospace and defense market has been characterized by quarterly volatility, this segment remains an important business for Xilinx. Our 28-nanometer revenues are growing at a rate much faster than previous new product introductions as we expand our presence in areas, such as situational awareness, public safety and embedded vision systems. ISM is expected to be approximately flat during the quarter, and test is expected to decline. 
Lastly, we expect all components of the broadcast, consumer and automotive category to be approximately flat. We expect strong growth in automotive in fiscal '16 as Zynq enters volume production at many large OEMs. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be down 2% to 6% -- so down 2% to down 6% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 51%. 
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% to 70%. Operating expenses for the September quarter are expected to be approximately $217 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. 
As I mentioned last quarter, Q1 OpEx would be the low point for the year. The increase in Q2 OpEx will be driven primarily by hiring in the sales force and increased tapeout expense related primarily to the 16-nanometer technology generation. 
Other income and expense for the September quarter will be a net expense of $10 million. 
The share count is expected to be approximately 268 million shares. 
The tax rate for September quarter is expected to be approximately 12%. The reset of our tax rate guidance to 12% is due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings. 
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

Though the June quarter was challenging from top line perspective, I continued to be pleased with our focus on delivering sustained type profitability. Gross margin was 70.9%, better than expectations, driving an operating margin of 32.5%. 28-nanometer revenue declined, as we anticipated, driven by weakness in wireless communications. However, sales from our Zynq product family, the industries first all-programmable SoCs, increased more than 40%. The primary driver for this growth came from ADAS applications, important industry growth driver ideally suited to benefit from the Zynq product families, innovative and differentiated capabilities. We expect 28-nanometer sales to return to growth in the September quarter, driven by continued sales increase from the Zynq products, as well as an increase in wired communications. Additionally, we're forecasting 28-nanometer revenue to grow for the balance of fiscal year 2016, driven by demand stabilization in communications and continued strong adoption in automotive, ISM, test and aerospace and defense. We're also executing very well with our 20-nanometer UltraScale portfolio. Technology leadership at this node is very rapidly translating to sales leadership. We have now shipped 20-nanometer parts to more than 140 discrete customers in all of our major end markets. 20-nanometer revenue in the June quarter doubled sequentially to more than $10 million with significant growth coming from Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only ASIC class, 20-nanometer high-end product offering. 
In the September quarter, we are forecasting 20-nanometer sales to exceed $50 million, so experiencing a sales ramp that is more accelerated than our initial expectation. We estimate our share of this node to be approaching 82%, confident our share of 20-nanometer will continue to exceed 65% market share we have delivered at 28-nanometer. 
The 16-nanometer node, we taped out the industry's first All Programmable Multi-Processor SoC using TSMC's 16FF+ process. This product family targets applications in embedded vision, including ADAS, Industrial Internet of Things and 5G wireless systems. 
During the June quarter, we also extended our world-class partnership with TSMC, the undisputed leader in the foundry industry with the announcement that we will be leveraging TSMC's 7-nanometer process technology, 3D IC technology for our next generation of All Programmable FPGAs, 3D ICs and MPSoCs. The technology represents the fourth consecutive generation where the 2 companies are partnered, advanced process and CoWoS stacking technology and will become TSMC's fourth generation of FinFET technology. We anticipate the first tapeout of 7-nanometer in calendar 2017. 
Finally, with regard to design software, earlier this week, we announced the public access release of our SDSoC development  environment to expand the user base of Zynq SoCs and MPSoCs to a broad community of systems and software engineers, both existing and new markets. 
Despite weak global communication spending environment, I remain very confident in Xilinx's strong technology leadership and market expansion initiatives driven by Zynq, our new SDx software-designed development environment. We will continue to focus on maintaining high levels of profitability in any business environment with the overall goal of maximizing shareholder return [ph].

So fundamentally, if you look at the markets we service they're highly diversified markets that look for very advanced technology and a significant level of support with a very long life cycle.

We believe we're ahead of the game now, being the first to tapeout at the node beyond that 16. And we are already working with TSMC on the 7-nanometer, and we expect to tapeout in the 2017 time frame. So on the silicon side, the customers are very assured that they will continue to have the same level of excellence in terms of technology, leadership and timeliness, and that's an opportunity for us. Now when you supplement that with the leadership we have in the software and the expansion with the new products, the FD Xcell and the SDSoC, which we now are broadly making available to customers. And not only is it the best silicon, but it's the best software in the industry and the best support infrastructure in the industry. So we actually believe that this is an opportunity for us, and we'd say that customers are reassured by that, and we know that we are the biggest and have been for the longest period of time the leader and the bellwether player in this market.

From our perspective, the 20 and 16 together, which are coming out relatively close, closer than typical should more or less be equivalent to 28. So 20 is not as big as 28, but neither did we expect it to be. And 20 is now benefiting from the fact that we have a high end and a midrange there. And that's what is generating this level of revenue. But there's no low end, then there's no Zynq equivalent on the 20-nanometer. And hence, overall, it's not as vibrant as the 28 was, but on the other hand, it's doing better than we had expected. So we're quite pleased with the results so far.

To that question, it really isn't the same trends or stuff. China, in general, has been stalled out, both the FD standard deployment, which is one of the bigger things that was -- we were counting on for this year to actually begin and be more robust as we move through the year. That was stalled out originally by China Unicom and China Telecoms, the audits that they had relative to ethics and those kinds of things that went on. There's been an overall slowdown of capital spend in China on infrastructure which is more of a macro thing going on relative to the China issue. So I think that's been the biggest driver there. And there absolutely has been a buildup of base station, inventory and our product in the Chinese suppliers that is being led off, as China Mobile continues to deploy at a much lower rate than the previous year. But China Unicom and China Telecom not as much. So if you -- people have told me that if you're in China and you're using one of those handsets from the China Mobile network, there's still a lot of coverage issues and a lot -- so there's lot of things are left to be done there. So I'm not so sure it's driven by the subscriber pool. I think there are some bigger issues going on there. Relative to North America, it's kind of bifurcated into Sprint who is also having some financial issues in terms of funding their networks. So they slowed down the deployment of their network. And they've gone through a rebidding process, and that process has been completed as best as we can tell. And so again, we think that because of those milestones, we think things are going to start to turn around and grow for us in the second half of this year and into calendar 2016. AT&T and Verizon has slowed down their cap spending in the first part of the year. There were Spectrum acquisitions. They also are starting to spend a little more money now, and there are going to be additional capacity utilization of that network. So it really is different by different carriers and geographies. The thought process about what's going to turn this around for us is just exactly the fact that subscriber and coverage is not uniformly sufficient and good in those geographies. And as Moshe said earlier, it's a matter of when, it's not a matter of if for us. And again, we've seen positive press coming out of carriers relative to some improvement in that. We've seen orders come with respect to India, some growth there. So we have some specific orders ahead of us on that. So we are starting to see some positive signs that would lead us to believe that the second half of the fiscal year will be better."

So the various elements to the data center and there is elements that focus on storage, elements that focus on networking and elements that focus on compute. So the storage and networking are largely unimpacted by this acquisition. And the compute space, it's very clear that FPGAs provide a viable, very attractive lower-power solution, which significantly provides an improvement in the performance per watt by -- what we are seeing is somewhere between 20 to 30x on -- in several applications, vis-à-vis stand-alone, high-performance processor. And that's because these applications in the cloud tend to be massively parallel, and these processors are inherently not parallel engines. They're very sequential. That's the way a CPU operates. And even if you have multiple CPU cords, you can achieve only a certain level of parallelism that way. So FPGAs actually can provide tremendous acceleration at the same power form or level of power consumption, just to make sure, or they can provide at a much lower level of power consumption. They can deliver equivalent performance. Now we believe that when Intel consummates its acquisition, when that happens, then there will be some integration opportunities. The challenge there is that you're taking a very high-power solution, which is an x86, and you're adding to it another high-power solution, which is a larger FPGA. And to some extent, if you try to integrate both of those on the same silicon, you're limited with regards to what you can do. So we believe that, that market, the Intel x86 will have an element which will have an integrated solution, and there will have an element which has these distributed solutions where the FPGA will be separate. We see a lot of the traditional data center customers having a strong interest in actually retaining autonomy and independence in that second mode. So they can decide how they design their system, and obviously would be a wonderful solution for them. So even in the Intel x86 space, we believe we have a play. Not to mention that everywhere where it's not Intel, and this is a market which is emerging, right? So there's a lot of competing solutions. It will come to the market over the next few years. We will be the natural shoo-in for that for those solutions. So I would say there is upside for us definitely vis-a-vis beyond where we are today. And we are committed to that market, and we expect to see business growth in that market. And we believe that, that market is in its very early stages of evolution.

So if you look at the midpoint, that would be 69%. And we've been running at 70% and 71%. So all the cost reductions that we have -- that we had in that forecast at Investor Day that drove the 68% to 70% are on track, and we're doing very well. So I would say if I compare it to our previous forecast, we are on track on all the cost reductions. There is a lot of mix issues going on. We do have a slightly stronger industrial, aerospace and defense profile than we thought at that point in time, and we had a substantially weaker communications business. And that would -- that mix would tend to push our gross margins to this very high elevated point that we are right now. So I think both product and customer mix is accounted for quite a bit. As is, I think in the absence of a more normal -- normalized end market mix that we would have envisioned at the Investor Day, we'll be running in the 68% to 70% range, probably pretty close to the center of that. So I guess the short answer to your question is a lot of it is product mix and end-market customer mix."

The -- just to sort of comment on that, what we're seeing -- and I said this in response to an early question, we're seeing customers look at a canned, non-differentiated ASSPs solution versus a highly differentiated solution using our devices. And for the high end, it's a no-brainer that they want a differentiated solution. And then as you look at the midrange, it's less clear and definitely at the low-end times. They just are prepared to have a meat-and-potato solution as opposed to something which is more specialized. But interestingly, because this has become a platform play, then we are starting to see design wins where the customers are committing their entire product offering to our platform. And as a result, they're pushing us hard to provide them with a lower end, and we typically would have provided a solution for that. And so that's a growth opportunity for us, and it's driven by this broad platform-oriented approach where the companies are sort of saying, ""We can't afford to have different solutions,"" and because we want to have differentiation, they go with us across the board. And that's another reason that I believe that our market share, which we're happy with the revenue at this point, but our market share is not high yet.

Xilinx's sales were $528 million, down 4% sequentially and within our guidance. We experienced strong new product growth and strong profitability during the quarter, as well as a modest recovery in communications. New product sales increased 11% in the quarter with increases from 7- series, Smart and product families and our 20-nanometer UltraScale family, which exceeded $15 million in quarterly sales. Zynq adoption continues to be strong across a broad base of end markets including automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications. From an end market perspective, sales from communications and data center increased 5% driven by a modest recovery in Asia and North America. Wired communications sales were driven by data center access and enterprise applications. For the second quarter in a row, wired communications represented the largest contributor of our 28-nanometer sales. The industrial and aerospace and defense segment declined 12% sequentially with expected decreases from defense. The combination of industrial scientific and medical test and measurement declined sequentially was somewhat weaker than anticipated ISM business towards of the end of the quarter. 
Lastly, the broadcast consumer and automotive category was down slightly driven primarily by decreases in broadcast. 
Gross margin was 70.1% for the quarter, at the high end of our guidance driven primarily by customer mix. Operating expenses, including $2 million of amortization expense, were $217 million, in line with expectations. Other income was a net expense of $9 million. Net income for the quarter was $127 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $137 million before $5 million in CapEx. Cash flow for the quarter was impacted by higher receivables primarily associated with the timing of end-of-the-quarter shipments to our primary distributor partner who had an extra fiscal week during the quarter. Diluted shares for the quarter were 266 million shares. There was a $6.5 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.Xilinx.com. We repurchased 2.4 million shares for $100 million during the quarter, and paid $80 million in dividends. As a result, we returned over 130% of operating cash flow to the shareholders during the quarter, putting us well on track to continue to return over 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders in fiscal year '16. 
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were $3.5 billion [ph] . We had $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt resulting in a cash -- net cash position of approximately $1.9 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $9 million sequentially. 
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year '16. The guidance I provide will be inclusive of the extra fiscal week in our quarter, which we disclosed in our 10-K filing, as well as in today's earnings release. Our backlog heading into the December quarter is up sequentially, both wired and wireless communications are forecasted to be up. We believe our key wireless customers have reduced levels of inventory and as a result, we expect continued improvement from China driven by FT LTE deployment activity. Wired communications continues to be impacted by weak CapEx environment, but we are expecting growth during the quarter from OTN and cable infrastructure businesses. We expect our industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be up sequentially driven by a return to growth in our space and defense. 
Lastly, we expect all components to the broadcast consumer and automotive category to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 3% to 7% sequentially. In the midpoint of this guidance is predicated on rate of approximately 48%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69%. Operating expenses for the December quarter are expected to be approximately $230 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the December quarter will be a net expense of $7 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 265 million shares. There will be an adjustment to our full year forecast on CapEx. We are raising our forecast to approximately $40 million for the year, up from previous guidance of $25 million as a result of building renovations on our San Jose campus. The tax rate for the December quarter is expected to be 12%. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

Gross margin was 70.1%, facilitating operating margin of [ph] 29%. This is a testament to the strength of our business model , the diversity of the markets we serve, the impact of several corporate initiatives focusing on productivity improvement. 
Revenue from our new product category, which delivered a robust 11% sequential increase is expected to further accelerate in the December quarter. This gives us growing confidence in the September quarter represents bottom of the current cycle for Xilinx. As forecasted, last quarter 28-nanometer revenue growth was driven largely by increases in wired communications, industrial applications and defense. A special mention is due to our Zynq product, the industry's first programmable SOC, which increased sequentially by nearly 40% repeating a similar increase in the June quarter. Our overall 28-nanometer revenue is expected to grow significantly in the December quarter, sale driven by the majority of our end markets. These include communication, industrial, automotive, defense and test and measurement. 20-nanometer revenue in the September quarter comfortably exceeded a $15 million forecast. Majority of the growth continue to be driven by Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only ASIC class, 20-nanometer high-end product offering. In the December quarter, we're expecting 20-nanometer sales to again post strong growth and exceed $20 million led by wired communication and test and measurement applications. The 16-nanometer node we shipped, the industry's first all-programmable MPSoC. This product is already -- has been already delivered to customers. This is a quarter ahead of schedule, highlighting the third consecutive generation of product leadership enabled by stellar execution by a foundry partner at TSMC in conjunction with our engineering and operations teams. This exciting new family targets applications in embedded vision, including ADAS, Industrial Internet of Things, 5G wireless systems and will facilitate Xilinx's expansion into the domain of ASSPs. 
Finally, last week, we announced the strategic partnership with QUALCOMM to deliver interests -- industry-leading, heterogeneous computing solutions. These solutions will deliver new levels of efficiency and performance through FPGA-enabled dynamic workload acceleration on QUALCOMM's on-based platforms. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, top line 3% to 7% sales growth expected in the December quarter is again being driven from our new product category. This is forecasted to deliver another healthy double-digit percentage increase comprised by both our 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer leadership portfolios.

And the tier drag that we had going for us through the earlier part of this our calendar year was our aerospace and defense business declining from the standpoint of the joint strike fighter program, final shipments being done so that is essentially aerospace and defense essentially hitting bottom for us in this past quarter. And then the fact that inventory to be led off in China, and particularly and we believe our customers have reduced inventory levels of FPGAs that they had in their stores,and we're starting to see some signs of ordering and some more incremental deployments as Moshe said but not a joint snapback.

So now if you're looking for the short term , we do expect for it to grow. It's unlikely in the short term to get to the previous peak. That peak was driven by surge in China. What we're seeing now is deployment in India but that is viewed as a much smaller market. And then other markets are deploying at the low rate. So I don't see as returning to that previous peak, which I believe was in the March 2014 quarter anytime soon. I do expect us to see recovery from the trough, but the previous peak is going to take time and it will probably require a combination of elements to return to that level."

So we will have a range of solutions, which could work on with QUALCOMM, start from cards, and then move to a higher level of integration. We haven't defined what those high levels of integration -- what those high levels of integration are, but we are working closely with them and this is a program that started 2 years ago and what we -- what was shown at the rollout was that the first server that they were providing to their software developers and to their customers as a development platform, and there was in parallel a board which had our device on it which connected with that and provided the 10 to 50x acceleration for certain sets of applications. And so that's exactly the situation there. We have a very tight relationship with QUALCOMM, it's not an exclusive relationship. One of the opportunities we have is we believe that the data center market is an emerging market. There are 3 elements to it , there's a networking part, there's a storage part and there's a acceleration part, which is the one which is getting the most press but isn't the only one. So the first 2 are, obviously, we're in a good position there. With regards to the third, what we're seeing is there's a lot of competitive architectures, X86 and others, which are pursuing that market at this point in time. Clearly, Intel has the highest market share, but it is expected to have more than one set of solutions that is driven by the customers who are very large independent companies and their desire to control their own destiny. So we do believe that, that will, over time, provide a interesting growth opportunity for us, and we have a strategy that enables us to participate at different levels of integration with the all of the players in that market."

So I would expect the rollout of the next devices to be as fast as we can. We do need to complete the evaluation of the first device that takes significant amount of time. Typically, this process takes about a 1 year to 1.5 years from the first device until you have most of the family rolled out. And given the success in the fast turnaround we got from TSMC and the functionality both on the manufacturing aside, from the engineering side, we should do better than we have in any previous generation, and it is a very broad and deep product offering. It has very high-performance processor subsystem with significant number of embedded, dedicated accelerators and combination of those will enable us to take it and compete over time against aces piece in more and more markets.

So with regards to data center and the acceleration, that subset of applications, as we're going through cloudification or whatever the appropriate word is and that's a major growth element. A significant portion of the CPUs that are being deployed are now being deployed in these large data centers and the typical usage is very different from what the general purpose server did. As they build up these big data centers, in particular, when you look at the massive payers in that market, they tend to have very specific applications, and those applications tend to be massively parallel. So if you think of things like search, et cetera, you can see how =you could benefit from massively parallel solutions. And what sort of happens is, for better or for worse, if you go to just making the CPU faster, the return there is not significant and if you just go to multi-core CPU, there's a limit to what you can achieve there again without blowing the power and water or out of the data center. And so what has happened is the biggest limiter is power and the performance per power configuration that you get from an FPGA or programmable solution is superior for both of these applications and the factor that we have seen consistently is anywhere from 10 to 50, and it depends on what application and exactly -- and it can change even between in the same company as they shift things around. So there is, if you believe -- if you look at that, then that implies that the traditional ability to address the customer's requirements through selling them faster CPUs or more parallel CPUs is limited. Hence, the desire to have a programmable solution and combination is very beneficial for what is becoming a very large part the -- what used to be a traditional server market. And that's best we can tell, that's what the customers are telling us, that's why they're excited about. We do believe that the Intel acquisition of Altera was driven by a desire to control that and to make sure that the rollout is driven and not, in any way, compromised by the CPU power requirements and hence, the rationale for doing it and these same consumers tend to have a very independence desire to that show their destiny, which probably opens up opportunities for other non-x86 architectures for other players if there is a competitive x86 solution at the right point in time together with FPGAs. Now that may be more than you asked, but that's a comprehensive answer."

India, culturally, it's sort of incredibly cost-focused and the challenge that exists today in India is even though there's over 1 billion people there, and it's definitely a large country , the problem is that there are a lot of carriers, probably far too many, and I think, very few, if any of them, are making any money. So the approach is to do the minimum, right? And as a result, the deployments are likely to be in aggregate, quite a bit smaller than what has been done in China, and that's -- it is what it is. Maybe over time it will improve. But you go there, it is a still a very poor country with a still small middle class. And if you go to China, you can see the infrastructure, there's phenomenal in the middle class there, it's much larger. And so I believe that, that's the major driver for to difference between those 2 deployments."

But my perspective, and this is no longer in dispute, is that the semiconductor world is going through a significant number of change, and it's going through economic and as a result, it's actually less and less players. I think, that, that is no longer a of contention. You just need to count and see how much smaller it is. It's definitely smaller. There's fewer and fewer to the point of almost none getting refreshed through the venture world. And the cost of moving forward from generation to generation is actually going up and there is fewer and fewer players who can do that. So if you step back and look at that trend, that clearly is an opportunity for companies who can move forward, and we are one of those companies, that's why we were first at 28 with TSMC, first with 20 with TSMC as a semiconductor player, and that's why we got the 16 out way ahead of the competition. The reason that we do that is not just for bragging rights, it's actually because once we have that leadership , we can expand markets that we address. If you look at what has happened to Xilinx over the past 10 years, the role of devices play and generally, the role FPGA devices play in the customers systems is changing and as a result, I will -- can see that the historic logic FPGA market is not growing. But what is happening, and you could argue that, that is reason not to invest, but what is growing is the TAM in terms of your markets we're addressing. If you sort of looked in our business you can see that even though this is not happening quite the rate we had hoped, we are displacing ASSPs. So if you look at the Zynq product offering that required new investment, big investment, but it's now starting to pay off. These past 2 quarters both grew by around 40% and this is just the beginning. And that enables us to play and -- in markets we have not played before. So that's the strategy we have. We believe that yes, the results are not there in terms of the overall numbers, but if you look at the change in the markets and the competition, then actually there is an opportunity and in order to do that, we are continuing to develop and be at the leading-edge. Having said that, we can still do it and deliver profitability, which was sort of in a higher echelon. So our strategy is to continue doing that because we believe that the opportunity is there, the markets are developing and unfolding, and it's just to take 1 example automotive was market, which is very, very low single-digit percent for us and now we expect for that to grow over the next few years. Industrial control, again, and others slow cadence market where we can displace a lot of solutions where in the past the consumers would go to Freescale and MTI, et cetera, into a large extent a lot of those historic players are no longer around. So that's the strategy we have and part of that strategy requires us to continue to provide leadership. Also -- it also requires us to invest heavily in tools so that our customers can exploit the opportunity that our silicon provides them, and that's an ongoing element and that's the strategy at this point in time. The challenge on the M&A side is that there's very few companies out there that we can buy that fit into our business model and actually augment our offering and hence, you're right in pointing out that we haven't done much there, but I do believe the investments we're making, while continuing to deliver best-in-class profitability will, over time, enable us to continue to grow."

Xilinx' sales were $528 million, down 4% sequentially and within our guidance. We experienced strong new product growth and strong profitability during the quarter as well as a modest recovery in communications. New product sales increased 11% in the quarter with increases from our 7 Series, Spartan-6 product families and our 20-nanometer UltraScale family, which exceeded $15 million in quarterly sales. Zynq adoption continues to be strong across a broad base of end markets including automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications.
From an end market perspective, sales from Communications & Data Center increased 5%, driven by a modest recovery in Asia and North America. Wired communications sales were driven by data center access and enterprise applications. For the second quarter in a row, wired communications represented the largest contributor of our 28-nanometer sales. The Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment declined 12% sequentially with expected decreases from defense. The combination of industrial, scientific and medical test and measurement decline sequentially with somewhat weaker-than-anticipated ISM business towards of the end of the quarter. Lastly, the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive category was down slightly, driven primarily by decreases in broadcast.
Gross margin was 70.1% for the quarter, at the high end of our guidance, driven primarily by customer mix. Operating expenses, including $2 million of amortization expense, were $217 million, in line with expectations. Other income was a net expense of $9 million. Net income for the quarter was $127 million or $0.48 per diluted share.
Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $137 million before $5 million in CapEx. Cash flow for the quarter was impacted by higher receivables primarily associated with the timing of end-of-the-quarter shipments to our primary distributor partner who had an extra fiscal week in the quarter.
Diluted shares for the quarter were 266 million shares. There was a 6.5 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.
We repurchased 2.4 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and paid $80 million in dividends. As a result, we returned over 130% of operating cash flow to the shareholders during the quarter, putting us well on track to continue to return over 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders in fiscal year '16.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were $3.5 billion. We had $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a cash -- net cash position of approximately $1.9 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $9 million sequentially.
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year '16. The guidance I provide will be inclusive of the extra fiscal week in our quarter, which we disclosed in our 10-K filing as well as in today's earnings release. Our backlog heading into the December quarter is up sequentially. Both wired and wireless communications are forecasted to be up. We believe our key wireless customers have reduced levels of inventory, and as a result, we expect continued improvement from China driven by FD-LTE deployment activity. Wired communications continues to be impacted by a weak CapEx environment, but we are expecting growth during the quarter from OTN and cable infrastructure businesses. We expect our Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment to be up sequentially driven by a return to growth in aerospace and defense.
Lastly, we expect all components of the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive category to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 3% to 7% sequentially. And the midpoint of this guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 48%. 
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69%. Operating expenses for the December quarter are expected to be approximately $230 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the December quarter will be a net expense of $7 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 265 million shares. There will be an adjustment to our full year forecast on CapEx. We are raising our forecast to approximately $40 million for the year, up from previous guidance of $25 million as a result of building renovations on our San Jose campus. The tax rate for the December quarter is expected to be 12%.

Gross margin was 70.1%, facilitating operating margin of 29%. This is a testament to the strength of our business model, the diversity of the markets we serve, the impact of several corporate initiatives focusing on productivity improvement.
Revenue from our new product category, which delivered a robust 11% sequential increase, is expected to further accelerate in the December quarter. This gives us growing confidence that the September quarter represents the bottom of the current cycle for Xilinx.
As forecasted, last quarter, 28-nanometer revenue growth was driven largely by increases in wired communications, industrial applications and defense. A special mention is due to our Zynq product family, the industry's first all-programmable SoC, which increased sequentially by nearly 40%, repeating a similar increase in the June quarter. Our overall 28-nanometer revenue is expected to grow significantly in the December quarter, with sales driven by a majority of our end markets. These include communications, industrial, automotive, defense and test and measurement. 20-nanometer revenue in the September quarter comfortably exceeded the $15 million forecast. Majority of the growth continued to be driven by Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only ASIC class, 20-nanometer high-end product offering. In the December quarter, we're expecting 20-nanometer sales to again post strong growth and exceed $20 million led by wired communication and test and measurement applications.
For 16-nanometer node, we shipped the industry's first all-programmable MPSoC. This product is already -- has been already delivered to customers. This is a quarter ahead of schedule, highlighting the third consecutive generation of product leadership enabled by stellar execution by a foundry partner at TSMC in conjunction with our engineering and operations teams. This exciting new family targets applications in embedded vision including ADAS, industrial Internet of Things, 5G wireless systems and will facilitate Xilinx' expansion into the domain of ASSPs. 
Finally, last week, we announced the strategic partnership with Qualcomm to deliver interest -- industry-leading, heterogeneous computing solutions. These solutions will deliver new levels of efficiency and performance through FPGA-enabled dynamic workload acceleration on Qualcomm's ARM-based server platforms.
As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, top line 3% to 7% sales growth expected in the December quarter is again being driven from our new product category. This is forecasted to deliver another healthy double-digit percentage increase comprised by both our 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer leadership portfolios.
We'll now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A."

When we look at our Zynq product family, it's starting to grow very significantly now, and that's a good sign. And the 2 drags that we had going for us through the earlier part of this our calendar year was our aerospace and defense business declining from the standpoint of the Joint Strike Fighter Program, final shipments being done, so that is essentially aerospace and defense essentially hitting bottom for us in this past quarter, and then the fact that inventory to be bled off in China particularly. And we believe our customers have reduced their inventory levels of FPGAs that they had in their stores, and we're starting to see some signs of more ordering and some more incremental deployments, as Moshe said, but not a giant snapback. So those are some of the factors that, I think, are -- contributed to our view in our confidence level that we're going to start moving back up now from the bottom."

So there was some buildup there, but that really isn't a sign of any sort of a long-term business situation. So I think in distribution, we're in pretty good shape. With respect specifically to wireless, it's always difficult to know the true story about what the status is because I think we've -- as you recall, we talked about this before, there are base stations that our customers have on loan to the carriers. There are base stations that were in inventory completed, and then there were situations where we know FPGAs were built up in their factories. And what we can see, the most, obviously, is the FPGA inventory, and that's where we feel we've worked that down at major customers. And there should be more of a demand pull of kind of a situation now on a go-forward basis. That's our view on that."

It's unlikely in the short term to get to the previous peak. That peak was driven by a surge in China. What we're seeing now is deployment in India, but that is viewed as a much smaller market. And then other markets are deploying at the low rate. So I don't see us returning to that previous peak, which I believe was in the March 2014 quarter, any time soon.

So we will have a range of solutions that could work on with Qualcomm, start from cards and then move to higher level of integration. We haven't defined what those high level of integration -- what those high levels of integration are, but we are working closely with them. And this is a program that started 2 years ago, and what we -- what was shown at the rollout was that the first server that they were providing to their software developers and to their customers as a development platform, and there was in parallel a board which had our device on it which connected with that and provided the 10 to 50x acceleration for certain sets of applications. And so that's the situation there. We have a very tight relationship with Qualcomm. It's not an exclusive relationship. One of the opportunities we have is we believe that the data center market is an emerging market. There are 3 elements to it. There's a networking part. There's a storage part. And there's a acceleration part, which is the one which is getting the most press but isn't the only one. So the first 2 are obviously -- we're in a good position there. With regards to the third, what we're seeing is there's a lot of competitive architectures, x86 and others, which are pursuing that market at this point in time. Clearly, Intel has the highest market share, but it is expected to have more than one set of solutions that is driven by the customers who are very large independent companies and their desire to control their own destiny. So we do believe that, that will, over time, provide a interesting growth opportunity for us, and we have a strategy that enables us to participate at different levels of integration with all of the players in that market."

And hence, we already shipped it to customers just to sort of demonstrate the level of functionality. So I would expect the rollout of the next devices to be as fast as we can. We do need to complete the evaluation of the first device. That takes significant amount of time. Typically, this process takes about a year to 1.5 years from the first device until you have most of the family rolled out. And given the success and the fast turnaround we got from TSMC and the functionality both on the manufacturing aside, from the engineering side, we should do better than we have in any previous generation. And it is a very broad and deep product offering.

And as soon as I hear that, we set a new bar, and surprisingly, we hit the new saturation point. So I think the opportunity for improvement, while not trivial, is very significant. And we continue to do that on numerous fronts, and it requires a lot of engineering effort, both in-house and together with our foundry partners. But I don't think you should sort of assume this is as good as it gets. Now with regards to moving to future nodes, the good news is that we are reaching the old historic so-called saturation densities with new nodes faster than we reach them with old nodes even though the new nodes are significantly more complex and have more manufacturing layers. So I think, in particular, if you look at TSMC, their ability to continue to improve and the volumes they run are very helpful to help us improve on those fronts. And we continue to push to achieve those regardless of the node, both on old node and new node, and it's something that we need to do. So the strategy is both to continue to improve in that regard but also to provide market growth, and the market growth comes through expanded product capability. And that's sort of -- I will admit that over the past few years, I have 2 years of not delivering that, but we are intent on delivering that going forward, for sure, much better than we have in the past 2 years."

So with regards to data center and the acceleration, that subset of applications, as we're going through cloudification or whatever the appropriate word is, and that's a major growth element. A significant portion of the CPUs that are being deployed",440,"Okay. So with regards to data center and the acceleration, that subset of applications, as we're going through cloudification or whatever the appropriate word is, and that's a major growth element. A significant portion of the CPUs that are being deployed are now being deployed in these large data centers, and the typical usage is very different from what the general purpose server did. As they build up these big data centers in particular, when you look at the massive players in that market, they tend to have very specific applications, and those applications tend to be massively parallel. All right. So if you think of things like search, et cetera, you can see how you could benefit from massively parallel solutions. And what sort of happens is for better or for worse, if you go to just making the CPU faster, the return there is not significant. And if you just go to multi-core CPU, there's a limit to what you can achieve there, again, without blowing the power envelope out of the water or out of the data center. And so what has happened is the biggest limiter is power, and the performance per power configuration that you get from an FPGA or a programmable solution is superior for most of these applications. And the factor that we have seen consistently is anywhere from 10 to 50, and it depends on what application and exactly -- and it can change even between -- in the same company as they shift things around. So there is, if you believe -- if you look at that, then that implies that the traditional ability to address the customer's requirements through selling them faster CPUs or more parallel CPUs is limited. Hence, the desire to have a programmable solution and combination is very beneficial for what is becoming a very large part of the -- what used to be a traditional server market. And that's -- best we can tell, that's what the customers are telling us, that's what they're excited about. We do believe that the Intel acquisition of Altera was driven by a desire to control that and to make sure that the rollout is driven and not, in any way, compromised by the CPU power requirements, and hence, the rationale for doing it. And these same consumers tend to have a very independent desire to control their destiny, which probably opens up opportunities for other non-x86 architectures for other players if there is a competitive x86 solution at the right point in time together with FPGAs. Now that may be more than you asked, but that's a comprehensive answer."

And they try to make sure, maybe not at the same level you see in the Western world, that there is good coverage. India, culturally, it's sort of incredibly cost-focused. And the challenge that exists today in India is even though there's over 1 billion people there, and it's definitely a large country, the problem is that there are a lot of carriers, probably far too many, and I think very few, if any, of them are making any money. So the approach is to do the minimum, right? And as a result, the deployments are likely to be, in aggregate, quite a bit smaller than what has been done in China. And that's -- it is what it is. Maybe over time it will improve. But you go there, it is still a very poor country with a still small middle class. And if you go to China, you can see the infrastructure there is phenomenal and the middle class there is much larger.

Where we compete with Mobileye -- and by the way, we do have other design wins that aren't Mobileye-oriented. They could be in radar, distance sensors, things like that, various different FPGAs in that. But relative to the direct competition with Mobileye, it's around forward-looking cameras. And so again, our business is broader than forward-looking cameras, but that's where we do the head-on with Mobileye. Our strength has been in the dual or stereo cameras where there's 2 cameras looking forward versus one mono camera. That's where we've got our original foothold.

And I'll try and respond to your very big question because otherwise, we won't get home for dinner tonight.

And I'll try and respond to your very big question because otherwise, we won't get home for dinner tonight. But my perspective, and this is no longer in dispute, is that the semiconductor world is going through a significant structural change. And it's being driven by economics, and as a result, there's actually less and less players. I think that, that is no longer a bone of contention. You just need to count and see how much smaller it is. It's significantly smaller. There's fewer and fewer to the point of almost none getting refreshed through the venture world. And the cost of moving forward from generation to generation is actually going up, and there is fewer and fewer players who can do that. So if you step back and look at that entire trend, that clearly is an opportunity for companies who can move forward, and we are one of those companies. That's why we were first at 28 with TSMC, first with 20 with TSMC as a semiconductor player, and that's why we got the 16 out way ahead of the competition. The reason that we do that is not just for bragging rights. It's actually because once we have that leadership, we can expand the markets that we address. If you look at what has happened to Xilinx over the past 10 years, the role devices play and generally the role FPGA devices play in our customers' systems is changing. And as a result, I will -- can see that the historic chronologic FPGA market is not growing. But what is happening, and you could argue that, that is a reason not to invest, but what is growing is the SAM in terms of new markets we're addressing. If you sort of look in our business, you can see that even though this is not happening quite at the rate we had hoped, we are displacing ASSPs. And if you look at the Zynq product offering, that required new investment, big investment, but it's now starting to pay off. These past 2 quarters both grew by around 40%, and this is just the beginning. And that enables us to play and -- in markets we have not played before. So that's the strategy we have. We believe that yes, the results are not there in terms of the overall numbers, but if you look at the change in the markets and the competition, then actually, there is an opportunity. And in order to do that, we are continuing to develop and be at the leading edge. Having said that, we can still do it and deliver profitability, which was sort of in the higher echelon. So our strategy is to continue doing that because we believe that the opportunity is there. The markets are developing and unfolding. And just to take one example, automotive was a market which was very, very low single-digit percent for us. And now we expect for that to grow over the next few years. Industrial control, again, another slow [indiscernible] market where we can displace a lot of solutions where in the past the customer would go to Freescale and TI, et cetera. And to a large extent, a lot of those historic players are no longer around. So that's the strategy we have, and part of that strategy requires us to continue to provide leadership. It also requires us to invest heavily in tools so that our customers can exploit the opportunity that our silicon provides them, and that's an ongoing element. And that's the strategy at this point in time. The challenge on the M&A side is that there's very few companies out there that we can buy that fit into our business model and actually augment our offering, and hence, you're right in pointing out that we haven't done much there. But I do believe the investments we're making while continuing to deliver best-in-class profitability will, over time, enable us to continue to grow."

They have -- xDSL, I believe, has thousands of users at this point in time. SDSoC is starting to be used broadly. It's a big enabler to grow the population of users beyond the hard-core -- hardware FPGA designer. So it is essential, and technology is doing well and the market deployment is doing well. The reason that the financial implications aren't yet visible in a big way is that the initial targets for those markets were industrial control and automotive, and those 2 markets move at a slower cadence. With the new generation, we're actually expanding the number of markets we're addressing, and we expect to see increased adoption of them. So yes, it is essential, and it is something we need to do in order to displace ASSPs and to address the bigger SAM. And so far in terms of technology and deployment, it's going according to plan."

Xilinx' sales were $528 million, down 4% sequentially and within our guidance. We experienced strong new product growth and strong profitability during the quarter as well as a modest recovery in communications. New product sales increased 11% in the quarter with increases from our 7 Series, Spartan-6 product families and our 20-nanometer UltraScale family, which exceeded $15 million in quarterly sales. Zynq adoption continues to be strong across a broad base of end markets including automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications.
From an end market perspective, sales from Communications & Data Center increased 5%, driven by a modest recovery in Asia and North America. Wired communications sales were driven by data center access and enterprise applications. For the second quarter in a row, wired communications represented the largest contributor of our 28-nanometer sales. The Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment declined 12% sequentially with expected decreases from defense. The combination of industrial, scientific and medical test and measurement decline sequentially with somewhat weaker-than-anticipated ISM business towards of the end of the quarter. Lastly, the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive category was down slightly, driven primarily by decreases in broadcast.
Gross margin was 70.1% for the quarter, at the high end of our guidance, driven primarily by customer mix. Operating expenses, including $2 million of amortization expense, were $217 million, in line with expectations. Other income was a net expense of $9 million. Net income for the quarter was $127 million or $0.48 per diluted share.
Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $137 million before $5 million in CapEx. Cash flow for the quarter was impacted by higher receivables primarily associated with the timing of end-of-the-quarter shipments to our primary distributor partner who had an extra fiscal week in the quarter.
Diluted shares for the quarter were 266 million shares. There was a 6.5 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.
We repurchased 2.4 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and paid $80 million in dividends. As a result, we returned over 130% of operating cash flow to the shareholders during the quarter, putting us well on track to continue to return over 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders in fiscal year '16.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were $3.5 billion. We had $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a cash -- net cash position of approximately $1.9 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $9 million sequentially.
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year '16. The guidance I provide will be inclusive of the extra fiscal week in our quarter, which we disclosed in our 10-K filing as well as in today's earnings release. Our backlog heading into the December quarter is up sequentially. Both wired and wireless communications are forecasted to be up. We believe our key wireless customers have reduced levels of inventory, and as a result, we expect continued improvement from China driven by FD-LTE deployment activity. Wired communications continues to be impacted by a weak CapEx environment, but we are expecting growth during the quarter from OTN and cable infrastructure businesses. We expect our Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment to be up sequentially driven by a return to growth in aerospace and defense.
Lastly, we expect all components of the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive category to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 3% to 7% sequentially. And the midpoint of this guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 48%. 
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69%. Operating expenses for the December quarter are expected to be approximately $230 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the December quarter will be a net expense of $7 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 265 million shares. There will be an adjustment to our full year forecast on CapEx. We are raising our forecast to approximately $40 million for the year, up from previous guidance of $25 million as a result of building renovations on our San Jose campus. The tax rate for the December quarter is expected to be 12%.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

Gross margin was 70.1%, facilitating operating margin of 29%. This is a testament to the strength of our business model, the diversity of the markets we serve, the impact of several corporate initiatives focusing on productivity improvement.
Revenue from our new product category, which delivered a robust 11% sequential increase, is expected to further accelerate in the December quarter. This gives us growing confidence that the September quarter represents the bottom of the current cycle for Xilinx.
As forecasted, last quarter, 28-nanometer revenue growth was driven largely by increases in wired communications, industrial applications and defense. A special mention is due to our Zynq product family, the industry's first all-programmable SoC, which increased sequentially by nearly 40%, repeating a similar increase in the June quarter. Our overall 28-nanometer revenue is expected to grow significantly in the December quarter, with sales driven by a majority of our end markets. These include communications, industrial, automotive, defense and test and measurement. 20-nanometer revenue in the September quarter comfortably exceeded the $15 million forecast. Majority of the growth continued to be driven by Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only ASIC class, 20-nanometer high-end product offering. In the December quarter, we're expecting 20-nanometer sales to again post strong growth and exceed $20 million led by wired communication and test and measurement applications.
For 16-nanometer node, we shipped the industry's first all-programmable MPSoC. This product is already -- has been already delivered to customers. This is a quarter ahead of schedule, highlighting the third consecutive generation of product leadership enabled by stellar execution by a foundry partner at TSMC in conjunction with our engineering and operations teams. This exciting new family targets applications in embedded vision including ADAS, industrial Internet of Things, 5G wireless systems and will facilitate Xilinx' expansion into the domain of ASSPs. 
Finally, last week, we announced the strategic partnership with Qualcomm to deliver interest -- industry-leading, heterogeneous computing solutions. These solutions will deliver new levels of efficiency and performance through FPGA-enabled dynamic workload acceleration on Qualcomm's ARM-based server platforms.
As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, top line 3% to 7% sales growth expected in the December quarter is again being driven from our new product category. This is forecasted to deliver another healthy double-digit percentage increase comprised by both our 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer leadership portfolios.
We'll now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A."

When we look at our Zynq product family, it's starting to grow very significantly now, and that's a good sign. And the 2 drags that we had going for us through the earlier part of this our calendar year was our aerospace and defense business declining from the standpoint of the Joint Strike Fighter Program, final shipments being done, so that is essentially aerospace and defense essentially hitting bottom for us in this past quarter, and then the fact that inventory to be bled off in China in particularly. And we believe our customers have reduced their inventory levels of FPGAs that they had in their stores, and we're starting to see some signs of more ordering and some more incremental deployments, as Moshe said, but not a giant snapback.

So there was some buildup there, but that really isn't a sign of any sort of a long-term business situation. So I think in distribution, we're in pretty good shape. With respect specifically to wireless, it's always difficult to know the true story about what the status is because I think we've -- as you recall, we talked about this before, there are base stations that our customers have on loan to the carriers. There are base stations that were in inventory completed, and then there were situations where we know FPGAs were built up in their factories. And what we can see, the most, obviously, is the FPGA inventory, and that's where we feel we've worked that down at major customers. And there should be more of a demand pull kind of a situation now on a go-forward basis. That's our view on that."

It's unlikely in the short term to get to the previous peak. That peak was driven by a surge in China. What we're seeing now is deployment in India, but that is viewed as a much smaller market. And then other markets are deploying at the low rate. So I don't see us returning to that previous peak, which I believe was in the March 2014 quarter, any time soon.

And this is a program that started 2 years ago, and what we -- what was shown at the rollout was that the first server that they were providing to their software developers and to their customers as a development platform, and there was in parallel a board which had our device on it which connected with that and provided the 10 to 50x acceleration for certain sets of applications. And so that's the situation there. We have a very tight relationship with Qualcomm. It's not an exclusive relationship. One of the opportunities we have is we believe that the data center market is an emerging market. There are 3 elements to it. There's a networking part. There's a storage part. And there's a acceleration part, which is the one which is getting the most press but isn't the only one. So the first 2 are obviously -- we're in a good position there. With regards to the third, what we're seeing is there's a lot of competitive architectures, x86 and others, which are pursuing that market at this point in time. Clearly, Intel has the highest market share, but it is expected to have more than one set of solutions that is driven by the customers who are very large independent companies and their desire to control their own destiny. So we do believe that, that will, over time, provide a interesting growth opportunity for us, and we have a strategy that enables us to participate at different levels of integration with all of the players in that market."

And as soon as we get to clear understanding of the level of functionality, we then do a rapid rollout of the follow-on devices. The functionality of this initial device has exceeded all expectations. We got it back faster, and it operates much, much better. And hence, we already shipped it to customers just to sort of demonstrate the level of functionality. So I would expect the rollout of the next devices to be as fast as we can. We do need to complete the evaluation of the first device. That takes significant amount of time. Typically, this process takes about a year to 1.5 years from the first device until you have most of the family rolled out. And given the success and the fast turnaround we got from TSMC and the functionality both on the manufacturing side, from the engineering side, we should do better than we have in any previous generation. And it is a very broad and deep product offering. It has a very high-performance processor subsystem with significant number of embedded, dedicated accelerators, and a combination of those will enable us to take it and compete over time against ASSPs in more and more markets. So it is -- we think this is a watershed moment for us in terms of the rollout."

And as soon as I hear that, we set a new bar, and surprisingly, we hit the new saturation point. So I think the opportunity for improvement, while not trivial, is very significant. And we continue to do that on numerous fronts, and it requires a lot of engineering effort, both in-house and together with our foundry partners. But I don't think you should sort of assume this is as good as it gets. Now with regards to moving to future nodes, the good news is that we are reaching the old historic so-called saturation densities with new nodes faster than we reach them with old nodes even though the new nodes are significantly more complex and have more manufacturing layers. So I think, in particular, if you look at TSMC, their ability to continue to improve and the volumes they run are very helpful to help us improve on those fronts. And we continue to push to achieve those regardless of the node, both on old node and new node, and it's something that we need to do. So the strategy is both to continue to improve in that regard but also to provide market growth, and the market growth comes through expanded product capability. And that's sort of -- I will admit that over the past few years, I have 2 years of not delivering that, but we are intent on delivering that going forward, for sure, much better than we have in the past 2 years."

So with regards to data center and the acceleration, that subset of applications, as we're going through cloudification or whatever the appropriate word is, and that's a major growth element. A significant portion of the CPUs that are being deployed",440,"Okay. So with regards to data center and the acceleration, that subset of applications, as we're going through cloudification or whatever the appropriate word is, and that's a major growth element. A significant portion of the CPUs that are being deployed are now being deployed in these large data centers, and the typical usage is very different from what the general purpose server did. As they build up these big data centers in particular, when you look at the massive players in that market, they tend to have very specific applications, and those applications tend to be massively parallel. All right. So if you think of things like search, et cetera, you can see how you could benefit from massively parallel solutions. And what sort of happens is for better or for worse, if you go to just making the CPU faster, the return there is not significant. And if you just go to multi-core CPU, there's a limit to what you can achieve there, again, without blowing the power envelope out of the water or out of the data center. And so what has happened is the biggest limiter is power, and the performance per power configuration that you get from an FPGA or a programmable solution is superior for most of these applications. And the factor that we have seen consistently is anywhere from 10 to 50, and it depends on what application and exactly -- and it can change even between -- in the same company as they shift things around. So there is, if you believe -- if you look at that, then that implies that the traditional ability to address the customer's requirements through selling them faster CPUs or more parallel CPUs is limited. Hence, the desire to have a programmable solution and combination is very beneficial for what is becoming a very large part of the -- what used to be a traditional server market. And that's -- best we can tell, that's what the customers are telling us, that's what they're excited about. We do believe that the Intel acquisition of Altera was driven by a desire to control that and to make sure that the rollout is driven and not, in any way, compromised by the CPU power requirements, and hence, the rationale for doing it. And these same consumers tend to have a very independent desire to control their destiny, which probably opens up opportunities for other non-x86 architectures for other players if there is a competitive x86 solution at the right point in time together with FPGAs. Now that may be more than you asked, but that's a comprehensive answer."

And the challenge that exists today in India is even though there's over 1 billion people there, and it's definitely a large country, the problem is that there are a lot of carriers, probably far too many, and I think very few, if any, of them are making any money. So the approach is to do the minimum, right? And as a result, the deployments are likely to be, in aggregate, quite a bit smaller than what has been done in China. And that's -- it is what it is. Maybe over time it will improve. But you go there, it is still a very poor country with a still small middle class.

So the question that I have is, is the business sized appropriately for a much slower growth for the next 2, 3 years? Or do you look at what's going on in the States and look at M&A and say, you know what, maybe we need to think outside the box to grow and do something unconventional, i.e., PLD companies. Instead of being predatory, you turn out and say maybe there are some synergies that we can go out and be acquisitive? So I just wanted your thoughts on that. And one real quick longer term. We haven't talked about autos. I know last year, we had a conversation about ADAS and how you compete with Mobileye. If you could expand on that, that will be great."

So full year FY -- fiscal year '16 versus full year fiscal '15, we're expecting 30% growth on our automotive business. And that's based on -- from a product perspective, it's based on our penetration of Zynq into a variety of applications led by the Advanced Driver Assistance capability. Where we compete with Mobileye -- and by the way, we do have other design wins that aren't Mobileye-oriented. They could be in radar, distance sensors, things like that, various different FPGAs in that. But relative to the direct competition with Mobileye, it's around forward-looking cameras. And so again, our business is broader than forward-looking cameras, but that's where we do the head-on with Mobileye. Our strength has been in the dual or stereo cameras where there's 2 cameras looking forward versus one mono camera. That's where we've got our original foothold. And we're very confident about our ability to compete with Mobileye across a broad set of platforms. Several of our customers actually believe they are competitors to Mobileye because they are doing the full solution in trying to win the designs at a variety of platforms at various automobile manufacturers. So as we sit here today, looking about this year's growth over last year and next year's growth and the year after, we can articulate to ourselves pretty much every platform that we've won in this regard and can see the kind of growth level that is potentially ahead of us, again, continuing this double-digit growth on a go-forward basis because we know we've won these designs and the designs are very sticky for a multiple car year model. So with that, I'll hand over the rest of it to Moshe."
36762,311619109,876824,"Xilinx Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2015",2015-10-14,"Earnings Calls","Xilinx, Inc.","Executives","Yes. And I'll try and respond to your very big question because otherwise, we won't get home for dinner tonight. But my perspective, and this is no longer in dispute, is that the semiconductor world is going through a significant structural change. And it",666,"Yes. And I'll try and respond to your very big question because otherwise, we won't get home for dinner tonight. But my perspective, and this is no longer in dispute, is that the semiconductor world is going through a significant structural change. And it's being driven by economics, and as a result, there's actually less and less players. I think that, that is no longer a bone of contention. You just need to count and see how much smaller it is. It's significantly smaller. There's fewer and fewer to the point of almost none getting refreshed through the venture world. And the cost of moving forward from generation to generation is actually going up, and there is fewer and fewer players who can do that. So if you step back and look at that entire trend, that clearly is an opportunity for companies who can move forward, and we are one of those companies. That's why we were first at 28 with TSMC, first with 20 with TSMC as a semiconductor player, and that's why we got the 16 out way ahead of the competition. The reason that we do that is not just for bragging rights. It's actually because once we have that leadership, we can expand the markets that we address. If you look at what has happened to Xilinx over the past 10 years, the role devices play and generally the role FPGA devices play in our customers' systems is changing. And as a result, I will -- can see that the historic chronologic FPGA market is not growing. But what is happening, and you could argue that, that is a reason not to invest, but what is growing is the SAM in terms of new markets we're addressing. If you sort of look in our business, you can see that even though this is not happening quite at the rate we had hoped, we are displacing ASSPs. And if you look at the Zynq product offering, that required new investment, big investment, but it's now starting to pay off. These past 2 quarters both grew by around 40%, and this is just the beginning. And that enables us to play and -- in markets we have not played before. So that's the strategy we have. We believe that yes, the results are not there in terms of the overall numbers, but if you look at the change in the markets and the competition, then actually, there is an opportunity. And in order to do that, we are continuing to develop and be at the leading edge. Having said that, we can still do it and deliver profitability, which was sort of in the higher echelon. So our strategy is to continue doing that because we believe that the opportunity is there. The markets are developing and unfolding. And just to take one example, automotive was a market which was very, very low single-digit percent for us. And now we expect for that to grow over the next few years. Industrial control, again, another slow [indiscernible] market where we can displace a lot of solutions where in the past the customer would go to Freescale and TI, et cetera. And to a large extent, a lot of those historic players are no longer around. So that's the strategy we have, and part of that strategy requires us to continue to provide leadership. It also requires us to invest heavily in tools so that our customers can exploit the opportunity that our silicon provides them, and that's an ongoing element. And that's the strategy at this point in time. The challenge on the M&A side is that there's very few companies out there that we can buy that fit into our business model and actually augment our offering, and hence, you're right in pointing out that we haven't done much there. But I do believe the investments we're making while continuing to deliver best-in-class profitability will, over time, enable us to continue to grow."

Xilinx' sales were $528 million, down 4% sequentially and within our guidance. We experienced strong new product growth and strong profitability during the quarter as well as a modest recovery in communications. New product sales increased 11% in the quarter with increases from our 7 Series, Spartan-6 product families and our 20-nanometer UltraScale family, which exceeded $15 million in quarterly sales. Zynq adoption continues to be strong across a broad base of end markets including automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications.
From an end market perspective, sales from Communications & Data Center increased 5%, driven by a modest recovery in Asia and North America. Wired communications sales were driven by data center access and enterprise applications. For the second quarter in a row, wired communications represented the largest contributor of our 28-nanometer sales. The Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment declined 12% sequentially with expected decreases from defense. The combination of industrial, scientific and medical test and measurement decline sequentially with somewhat weaker-than-anticipated ISM business towards of the end of the quarter. Lastly, the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive category was down slightly, driven primarily by decreases in broadcast.
Gross margin was 70.1% for the quarter, at the high end of our guidance, driven primarily by customer mix. Operating expenses, including $2 million of amortization expense, were $217 million, in line with expectations. Other income was a net expense of $9 million. Net income for the quarter was $127 million or $0.48 per diluted share.
Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $137 million before $5 million in CapEx. Cash flow for the quarter was impacted by higher receivables primarily associated with the timing of end-of-the-quarter shipments to our primary distributor partner who had an extra fiscal week in the quarter.
Diluted shares for the quarter were 266 million shares. There was a 6.5 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.
We repurchased 2.4 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and paid $80 million in dividends. As a result, we returned over 130% of operating cash flow to the shareholders during the quarter, putting us well on track to continue to return over 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders in fiscal year '16.
Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were $3.5 billion. We had $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a cash -- net cash position of approximately $1.9 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $9 million sequentially.
Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year '16. The guidance I provide will be inclusive of the extra fiscal week in our quarter, which we disclosed in our 10-K filing as well as in today's earnings release. Our backlog heading into the December quarter is up sequentially. Both wired and wireless communications are forecasted to be up. We believe our key wireless customers have reduced levels of inventory, and as a result, we expect continued improvement from China driven by FD-LTE deployment activity. Wired communications continues to be impacted by a weak CapEx environment, but we are expecting growth during the quarter from OTN and cable infrastructure businesses. We expect our Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment to be up sequentially driven by a return to growth in aerospace and defense.
Lastly, we expect all components of the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive category to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 3% to 7% sequentially. And the midpoint of this guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 48%. 
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69%. Operating expenses for the December quarter are expected to be approximately $230 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the December quarter will be a net expense of $7 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 265 million shares. There will be an adjustment to our full year forecast on CapEx. We are raising our forecast to approximately $40 million for the year, up from previous guidance of $25 million as a result of building renovations on our San Jose campus. The tax rate for the December quarter is expected to be 12%.
Let me now turn the call over to Moshe."

Gross margin was 70.1%, facilitating operating margin of 29%. This is a testament to the strength of our business model, the diversity of the markets we serve, the impact of several corporate initiatives focusing on productivity improvement.
Revenue from our new product category, which delivered a robust 11% sequential increase, is expected to further accelerate in the December quarter. This gives us growing confidence that the September quarter represents the bottom of the current cycle for Xilinx.
As forecasted, last quarter, 28-nanometer revenue growth was driven largely by increases in wired communications, industrial applications and defense. A special mention is due to our Zynq product family, the industry's first all-programmable SoC, which increased sequentially by nearly 40%, repeating a similar increase in the June quarter. Our overall 28-nanometer revenue is expected to grow significantly in the December quarter, with sales driven by a majority of our end markets. These include communications, industrial, automotive, defense and test and measurement. 20-nanometer revenue in the September quarter comfortably exceeded the $15 million forecast. Majority of the growth continued to be driven by Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only ASIC class, 20-nanometer high-end product offering. In the December quarter, we're expecting 20-nanometer sales to again post strong growth and exceed $20 million led by wired communication and test and measurement applications.
For 16-nanometer node, we shipped the industry's first all-programmable MPSoC. This product is already -- has been already delivered to customers. This is a quarter ahead of schedule, highlighting the third consecutive generation of product leadership enabled by stellar execution by a foundry partner at TSMC in conjunction with our engineering and operations teams. This exciting new family targets applications in embedded vision including ADAS, industrial Internet of Things, 5G wireless systems and will facilitate Xilinx' expansion into the domain of ASSPs. 
Finally, last week, we announced the strategic partnership with Qualcomm to deliver interest -- industry-leading, heterogeneous computing solutions. These solutions will deliver new levels of efficiency and performance through FPGA-enabled dynamic workload acceleration on Qualcomm's ARM-based server platforms.
As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, top line 3% to 7% sales growth expected in the December quarter is again being driven from our new product category. This is forecasted to deliver another healthy double-digit percentage increase comprised by both our 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer leadership portfolios.

But then again, that was timing from when Avnet's quarter ended because they had the 14 weeks last quarter, which was after our -- a week after our quarter-end. So there was some buildup there, but that really isn't a sign of any sort of a long-term business situation. So I think in distribution, we're in pretty good shape. With respect specifically to wireless, it's always difficult to know the true story about what the status is because I think we've -- as you recall, we talked about this before, there are base stations that our customers have on loan to the carriers. There are base stations that were in inventory completed, and then there were situations where we know FPGAs were built up in their factories. And what we can see, the most, obviously, is the FPGA inventory, and that's where we feel we've worked that down at major customers. And there should be more of a demand pull kind of a situation now on a go-forward basis. That's our view on that."

It's unlikely in the short term to get to the previous peak. That peak was driven by a surge in China. What we're seeing now is deployment in India, but that is viewed as a much smaller market. And then other markets are deploying at the low rate. So I don't see us returning to that previous peak, which I believe was in the March 2014 quarter, any time soon.

So we will have a range of solutions that could work on with Qualcomm, start from cards and then move to higher level of integration. We haven't defined what those high level of integration -- what those high levels of integration are, but we are working closely with them. And this is a program that started 2 years ago, and what we -- what was shown at the rollout was that the first server that they were providing to their software developers and to their customers as a development platform, and there was in parallel a board which had our device on it which connected with that and provided the 10 to 50x acceleration for certain sets of applications. And so that's the situation there. We have a very tight relationship with Qualcomm. It's not an exclusive relationship. One of the opportunities we have is we believe that the data center market is an emerging market. There are 3 elements to it. There's a networking part. There's a storage part. And there's an acceleration part, which is the one which is getting the most press but isn't the only one. So the first 2 are obviously -- we're in a good position there. With regards to the third, what we're seeing is there's a lot of competitive architectures, x86 and others, which are pursuing that market at this point in time. Clearly, Intel has the highest market share, but it is expected to have more than one set of solutions that is driven by the customers who are very large independent companies and their desire to control their own destiny. So we do believe that, that will, over time, provide an interesting growth opportunity for us, and we have a strategy that enables us to participate at different levels of integration with all of the players in that market."

And hence, we already shipped it to customers just to sort of demonstrate the level of functionality. So I would expect the rollout of the next devices to be as fast as we can. We do need to complete the evaluation of the first device. That takes significant amount of time. Typically, this process takes about a year to 1.5 years from the first device until you have most of the family rolled out. And given the success and the fast turnaround we got from TSMC and the functionality both on the manufacturing side, from the engineering side, we should do better than we have in any previous generation. And it is a very broad and deep product offering. It has a very high-performance processor subsystem with significant number of embedded, dedicated accelerators, and a combination of those will enable us to take it and compete over time against ASSPs in more and more markets.

And as soon as I hear that, we set a new bar, and surprisingly, we hit the new saturation point. So I think the opportunity for improvement, while not trivial, is very significant. And we continue to do that on numerous fronts, and it requires a lot of engineering effort, both in-house and together with our foundry partners. But I don't think you should sort of assume this is as good as it gets. Now with regards to moving to future nodes, the good news is that we are reaching the old historic so-called saturation densities with new nodes faster than we reach them with old nodes even though the new nodes are significantly more complex and have more manufacturing layers. So I think, in particular, if you look at TSMC, their ability to continue to improve and the volumes they run are very helpful to help us improve on those fronts. And we continue to push to achieve those regardless of the node, both on old node and new node, and it's something that we need to do. So the strategy is both to continue to improve in that regard but also to provide market growth, and the market growth comes through expanded product capability.

So with regards to data center and the acceleration, that subset of applications, as we're going through cloudification or whatever the appropriate word is, and that's a major growth element. A significant portion of the CPUs that are being deployed",440,"Okay. So with regards to data center and the acceleration, that subset of applications, as we're going through cloudification or whatever the appropriate word is, and that's a major growth element. A significant portion of the CPUs that are being deployed are now being deployed in these large data centers, and the typical usage is very different from what the general purpose server did. As they build up these big data centers in particular, when you look at the massive players in that market, they tend to have very specific applications, and those applications tend to be massively parallel. All right. So if you think of things like search, et cetera, you can see how you could benefit from massively parallel solutions. And what sort of happens is for better or for worse, if you go to just making the CPU faster, the return there is not significant. And if you just go to multi-core CPU, there's a limit to what you can achieve there, again, without blowing the power envelope out of the water or out of the data center. And so what has happened is the biggest limiter is power, and the performance per power configuration that you get from an FPGA or a programmable solution is superior for most of these applications. And the factor that we have seen consistently is anywhere from 10 to 50, and it depends on what application and exactly -- and it can change even between -- in the same company as they shift things around. So there is, if you believe -- if you look at that, then that implies that the traditional ability to address the customer's requirements through selling them faster CPUs or more parallel CPUs is limited. Hence, the desire to have a programmable solution and combination is very beneficial for what is becoming a very large part of the -- what used to be a traditional server market. And that's -- best we can tell, that's what the customers are telling us, that's what they're excited about. We do believe that the Intel acquisition of Altera was driven by a desire to control that and to make sure that the rollout is driven and not, in any way, compromised by the CPU power requirements, and hence, the rationale for doing it. And these same consumers tend to have a very independent desire to control their destiny, which probably opens up opportunities for other non-x86 architectures for other players if there is a competitive x86 solution at the right point in time together with FPGAs. Now that may be more than you asked, but that's a comprehensive answer."

Obviously, the Chinese manufacturers are involved in that as well and as well as other Asian manufacturers as well. So we've been participating in all that. So we've seen really good new products and new development product as well as some of the legacy LTE designs that we've won become stronger. I would say industrial was solid or okay for us in Asia as well but not knocking it out of the park. The North America phenomenon for us was really more about the aerospace and defense business declining than it was anything else. The decline was really driven mostly by the tail end of shipping in the Joint Strike Fighter. And the rest of our businesses there were good. In fact, the wired business was even up a little bit in North America as well. So I don't know if that helps you at all, Chris, but..."

And they try to make sure, maybe not at the same level you see in the Western world, that there is good coverage. India, culturally, it's sort of incredibly cost-focused. And the challenge that exists today in India is even though there's over 1 billion people there, and it's definitely a large country, the problem is that there are a lot of carriers, probably far too many, and I think very few, if any, of them are making any money. So the approach is to do the minimum, right? And as a result, the deployments are likely to be, in aggregate, quite a bit smaller than what has been done in China. And that's -- it is what it is. Maybe over time it will improve. But you go there, it is still a very poor country with a still small middle class. And if you go to China, you can see the infrastructure there is phenomenal and the middle class there is much larger. And so I believe that, that's the major driver for the difference between those 2 deployments."

So the question that I have is, is the business sized appropriately for a much slower growth for the next 2, 3 years? Or do you look at what's going on in the States and look at M&A and say, you know what, maybe we need to think outside the box to grow and do something unconventional, i.e., PLD companies. Instead of being predatory, you turn out and say maybe there are some synergies that we can go out and be acquisitive? So I just wanted your thoughts on that. And one real quick longer term.

So full year FY -- fiscal year '16 versus full year fiscal '15, we're expecting 30% growth on our automotive business. And that's based on -- from a product perspective, it's based on our penetration of Zynq into a variety of applications led by the Advanced Driver Assistance capability. Where we compete with Mobileye -- and by the way, we do have other design wins that aren't Mobileye-oriented. They could be in radar, distance sensors, things like that, various different FPGAs in that. But relative to the direct competition with Mobileye, it's around forward-looking cameras. And so again, our business is broader than forward-looking cameras, but that's where we do the head-on with Mobileye. Our strength has been in the dual or stereo cameras where there's 2 cameras looking forward versus one mono camera. That's where we've got our original foothold. And we're very confident about our ability to compete with Mobileye across a broad set of platforms. Several of our customers actually believe they are competitors to Mobileye because they are doing the full solution in trying to win the designs at a variety of platforms at various automobile manufacturers. So as we sit here today, looking about this year's growth over last year and next year's growth and the year after, we can articulate to ourselves pretty much every platform that we've won in this regard and can see the kind of growth level that is potentially ahead of us, again, continuing this double-digit growth on a go-forward basis because we know we've won these designs and the designs are very sticky for a multiple car year model.

And I'll try and respond to your very big question because otherwise, we won't get home for dinner tonight. But my perspective, and this is no longer in dispute, is that the semiconductor world is going through a significant structural change. And it",666,"Yes. And I'll try and respond to your very big question because otherwise, we won't get home for dinner tonight. But my perspective, and this is no longer in dispute, is that the semiconductor world is going through a significant structural change. And it's being driven by economics, and as a result, there's actually less and less players. I think that, that is no longer a bone of contention. You just need to count and see how much smaller it is. It's significantly smaller. There's fewer and fewer to the point of almost none getting refreshed through the venture world. And the cost of moving forward from generation to generation is actually going up, and there is fewer and fewer players who can do that. So if you step back and look at that entire trend, that clearly is an opportunity for companies who can move forward, and we are one of those companies. That's why we were first at 28 with TSMC, first with 20 with TSMC as a semiconductor player, and that's why we got the 16 out way ahead of the competition. The reason that we do that is not just for bragging rights. It's actually because once we have that leadership, we can expand the markets that we address. If you look at what has happened to Xilinx over the past 10 years, the role devices play and generally the role FPGA devices play in our customers' systems is changing. And as a result, I will -- can see that the historic chronologic FPGA market is not growing. But what is happening, and you could argue that, that is a reason not to invest, but what is growing is the SAM in terms of new markets we're addressing. If you sort of look in our business, you can see that even though this is not happening quite at the rate we had hoped, we are displacing ASSPs. And if you look at the Zynq product offering, that required new investment, big investment, but it's now starting to pay off. These past 2 quarters both grew by around 40%, and this is just the beginning. And that enables us to play and -- in markets we have not played before. So that's the strategy we have. We believe that yes, the results are not there in terms of the overall numbers, but if you look at the change in the markets and the competition, then actually, there is an opportunity. And in order to do that, we are continuing to develop and be at the leading edge. Having said that, we can still do it and deliver profitability, which was sort of in the higher echelon. So our strategy is to continue doing that because we believe that the opportunity is there. The markets are developing and unfolding. And just to take one example, automotive was a market which was very, very low single-digit percent for us. And now we expect for that to grow over the next few years. Industrial control, again, another slow [indiscernible] market where we can displace a lot of solutions where in the past the customer would go to Freescale and TI, et cetera. And to a large extent, a lot of those historic players are no longer around. So that's the strategy we have, and part of that strategy requires us to continue to provide leadership. It also requires us to invest heavily in tools so that our customers can exploit the opportunity that our silicon provides them, and that's an ongoing element. And that's the strategy at this point in time. The challenge on the M&A side is that there's very few companies out there that we can buy that fit into our business model and actually augment our offering, and hence, you're right in pointing out that we haven't done much there. But I do believe the investments we're making while continuing to deliver best-in-class profitability will, over time, enable us to continue to grow."
