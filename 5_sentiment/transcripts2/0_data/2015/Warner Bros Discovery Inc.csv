Last year, Discovery's investment in content, brands and new international platforms generated more impressions and scale than ever before. Better than double-digit growth in international audiences, expansion of our global flagships into new markets and establishing the leading sports provider in Europe is creating strong operating leverage across the company and long-term value for advertisers, audiences, distributors and shareholders. 
2015 marks Discovery's 30th anniversary, and we built our portfolio and brands through consistent strategy, a strategy of investing in our channels and programming to take market share in the U.S. and market share around the world.
Investing in local teams, infrastructure and boots on the ground to drive our own global business. And owning our rights in IP across platforms and regions, to strengthen our network portfolio and provide the foundation for our direct-to-consumer offerings.
The core of our strategy is to continue investing in content, which feeds in average of 10 channels in more than 220 countries and to grow our market share in markets around the world. This investment has paid off and our share of prime time viewers 25 to 54 in the U.S. has risen from 7% in 2008 to 12% today. 
Our international viewership continues to set records, gain share and grow dollars in key markets around the world. We ended 2014 with nearly 3 billion cumulative global subscribers, up from 2.5 billion at the end of 2013. And we grew our average international audience by 13%.
More people are spending more time with our content than ever before. Consumers all over the world are consuming more video and more programming than ever. Because we own the vast majority of our worldwide content and IP, we can take advantage of new ways to distribute and monetize our program. 
New distributor entrants, over-the-top platforms and and SVOD expand our optionality and our chance to bring in more dollars and reach more people.
Last quarter, we reached our first-ever long-form distribution agreement with Hulu in the U.S., providing another strong brand and linear TV friendly environment for our content. 
And in terms of new marketplace entrants, we closed the favorable deal for all of our U.S. channels with Sony for its new cloud-based service, PlayStation View. 
Discovery has a direct-to-consumer business that is profitable and growing, something very few media companies can say. And our opportunities within landscape are growing rapid rapidly. A look at our recent progress in Europe gives us good reason to be optimistic about our near and long-term growth in these area. 
In Europe, we've gained subscriptions, valuable insights and new marketing and sales platform with our OWN direct-to-consumer products. One is deeply in the Nordics and the other is the Eurosport Player, which we distribute across the continent. Those services have almost 0.25 million subscribers, bringing in average of $8 per month in U.S. 
Our European OTT offerings is giving us a growing revenue stream, a growing direct-to-consumer offering and valuable learnings that we can apply in the U.S. and other markets.
And we're just getting started. For 2015, our goals to launch a new integrated platform to scale the back-end for both services, deployed the play traditional markets across Europe and acquire specialty rights at a low cost to strengthen Eurosport Player and have its growth accelerate. And take all of our learnings and expertise to support the strategy we will be taking to distribution partners and consumers in the U.S, Latin America and around the world. 
You will hear much more about our products in this area in the months to come.
Further demonstrating the value we continued to earn from our distributors, we completed strong renewals with all of our U.S. distribution partners for deals expiring at the end of 2014, including Suddenlink, Cablevision, NTT and our latest distribution agreement, a strong renewal with MediaCom that we are announcing today.
In addition to favorable economic terms, each agreement offers subscribers authenticated access to Discovery content inside and outside the home. A good start to building a robust U.S. TV Everywhere offerings in earnest and another element of our strategy of capturing a growing share of the streaming audience.
These renewals are critical components in growing our U.S. affiliate revenue line, driving our over-the-top offerings like TV Everywhere and it demonstrates that the marketplace continues to plays a high value on quality content and brands.
Comcast announced last year that our deal with them is up at the end of June. As we all know, Comcast is the largest cable company, a key platform for any independent programmer, of which Discovery is the largest. With our deal coming up, we are hopeful that Comcast will negotiate in good faith like all of our other distributors have over the last several years.
We continue driving hard on development and new pipeline of content across our networks here in the U.S. Discovery Channel was a top 4 cable channel for man last year and had 5 of that top 10 cable shows for man, led by Gold Rush of #1; Deadliest Catch at #3; and Fast N' Loud at #4. So for this year, Discovery has bolted to the #1 nonsports cable network for man 25 to 54.
A very strong position in the market base and while Discovery Channel has some nice momentum, we believe it's best days are ahead. In January, Richard Ross officially started, a terrific creative leader, who in less than 2 short months, has reinvigorated our flagship channel. Rich secure the key strong leaders at Discovery and in addition, has hired seasoned executives onto his leadership team, including Jan Hoffman, a 17-year HBO veteran, to lead our big tentpole specials and event programming. And John Goldman, a long-time producer, who has developed many feature films and most recently Dexter, to oversee Discovery Channels scripted and miniseries strategy. 
Rich and his team are planning on being very aggressive in developing both of these categories, such as Raising with Extinction, which debuted at Sundance, and will be a global television event this fall as only Discovery can do with reach into over 500 million homes around the world.
Following rating softness last year, Animal Planet continues to build ratings momentum on the strength of series such as Treehouse Masters, Pit Bulls & Parolees and, of course, Pocketable, which was once again the #1 cable telecast on Super Bowl Sunday, drawing nearly 11 million total viewers, nearly 3 million streams and reaching more than 17 million fans on social media. 
TLC also experienced some softness last year, largely, driven by the cancellation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. We're moving forward by adding compelling new series like 90 Day Fiance, TLC's highest-rated freshman series of the year and My Big Fat Fabulous Life, which has been renewed for another season and performed extremely well. Joining our established series like 19 Kids and Counting, which helped made TLC the #1 cable network for women on Tuesday nights and last night, was another big Tuesday for us. 
Our other U.S. brands continue to post impressive gains. ID was again #1 in length of tune in all of TV, meaning ID viewers spent almost twice as much time watching ID on average than other cable networks. The network had its highest year ever for prime and total day and was the #5 cable network for women 25 to 54 for all of 2014. The channel continues to defy gravity with passionate super fans. And Velocity continues to attract new audiences and posted impressive double-digit ratings gains in prime and total day for the year. Velocity also added 5 million U.S. subscribers in the past year and now reaches 61 million homes.
We are focused on optimizing the programming and performance of the U.S., leveraging this content across our global footprint and unlocking the value of Discovery's distribution advantage around the world. Demonstrating our ability to light up our strong brands in the global basis, we launched our new brand, Discovery Life, in the U.S. and Poland on the same day in January. 
While we are not satisfied with our U.S. ratings performance in 2014, and with a softer U.S. ad sales in the second half of the year, it is important to note that we program for a global audience, River Monsters, Fast N' Loud, Dual Survival, Make the Freight, Gold Rush, Myth Busters, Say Yes to the Dress, all reached more than 200 million global viewers each year. 
Developing such globally appealing shows drives our ability to gain share and reach new audiences around the world. While our ratings are down for the year in the United States, we set a new international record at the highest average audience in our history, up more than double digits in market share. 
With new leadership at our flagship Discovery and momentum out of the gate in 2015, I am confident we have some real creative wind in our bags and a growing and dynamic development pipeline. 
The strengthening U.S. dollar had a big impact on our financial results last year across our entire global footprint, however, we are focused on the operating leverage we are creating. And concerns about currency headwinds aside, our international business remains the key differentiator among our U.S. peers and an engine that continues to have strong organic growth.
During 2014, we hit 2 major inflection points. More than 50% of Discovery's revenue comes from outside the U.S., so we generated more than $1 billion in international OIBDA. Discovery's strong organic growth around the world is being, driven by our distribution advantage, strong global brands, local managers and staff and smart, strategic acquisitions led by our new Eurosport brands across Europe and Asia. 
TLC launched in Germany last year and has grown audience across the Central and Eastern European region by 36%. We also supersized TLC in Australia, with an improved channel position and tripled our female viewers. 
ID and Turbo are our hottest new global brands, set the fuel the next generation of worldwide growth now reaching over 100 million global homes and since it's launch in Denmark in November, ID has had fantastic success and already ranks as the #4 of our 9 pay-TV channels in Denmark, regularly generating between 2% and 4% share despite not yet being fully distributed. 
Velocity's international brand, which we call Turbo, is also taking off, particularly in Latin America. We've invested in Turbo and doubled the channel subscribers across the region to over 20 million homes. In fact, Turbo has greater distribution in Brazil after 1 year that many other major brands have after 20 years in the market. We are on track to reach more than 125 million homes for turbo by the end of 2015.
Latin America continue to lead our organic growth with prime time ratings up 14% year-over-year and our flagship channels, Discovery Channel, Discovery Kids and Discovery Home & Health, ranked as top 10 channels across the region in the key market. 
Discovery Kids just earned its sixth straight year as the #1 pay-TV channel in all of Brazil. Brazil is also a great example of the power of our global content engine. Dual Survivor Brazil, a U.S. format with a locally produced version delivered the highest-rating ever for Discovery Channel in the country. This is our fastest-growing market in Latin America and sales rose more than 40% year-over-year and pay-TV penetration rates are still just 30%. So we're excited about our continued strong position in this important market.
In Europe, it has been nearly 9 months since we took majority control of Eurosport, and I am more excited than ever about this acquisition and the opportunities that lie ahead. Discovery is now the largest sports player in Eastern and Western Europe by a number of subscribers and feeds. 
Our integration efforts have been focused on going to market as 1 team, bringing greater scale and depth to distribution and ad sales, bolstering our strategic investments in sports rights to enhance Eurosport offering and strengthening the bundle of our combined portfolio of leading global brands. 
We're strengthening Eurosport's pan-regional strategy of being the home of sports that are popular across Europe such as tennis, cycling, winter sports, with all rights and additional exclusivity. We reached 130 million homes across Eastern and Western Europe. 
From May to year-end, we signed 24 incremental deals, including Spanish cycling, outlet sports across Europe, FIFA Women's World Cup Soccker, World Cup super, Glen Hawk in the Nordics and we can do to bolster our and soccer rights. But we're doing it in an efficient and effective and cost-effective way.
In addition, we're strengthening Eurosport's local relevancy by acquiring must-have rights to both Mark eSports and local sports, incredibly important to European fans, while maximizing the distribution of our portfolio of channels. 
In addition to the content and sports rights, we have leveraged our local infrastructure and expertise to merge our distribution teams and have already completed 30 combined distribution deals. And our ad sales teams have sold our joint offering at many of fronts across Europe, highlighted the power of our combined brands and content offering, more than 10 channels in every market, which we chose all the key advertiser demos.
To bolster our strategic leadership and capability in sports, we hired sports industry veteran, Peter Hutton, as CEO of Eurosport. Peter will use his more than 30 years in the business with our negotiations of key sports rights, launching new local feeds into larger advertising market and to grow the Eurosport player, which we're very excited about because it's our first real success in direct-to-consumer across Eastern and Western Europe.
And finally, in Asia, India's portfolio of our established Global Brands achieved best ever audience levels for prime time and all day, with now 8 networks in 5 languages, reaching 260 million  cumulative subscribers. And we're looking closely at what else we can do in India to capitalize on our local team, infrastructure and strong brand position. 
With organic growth opportunities across our global platform and more ways to display and sell our content than ever before, we remain confident that Discovery is well positioned to continue taking market share, deliver long-term growth and increase shareholder value in the years ahead. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."

And thank, everyone for joining us today. As David highlighted, despite industry challenges in the domestic ad market and increasing foreign currency headwinds, our expansive network portfolio drove audience and market share gains around the globe. 
On a reported basis, total company revenue for the year increased 13% and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. As expected, given that over half of our revenues are now outside the U.S., the strengthening dollar is a major headwind in 2014 as changes in currency rates had an approximately $100 million negative revenue impact and $70 million negative adjusted OIBDA impact versus 2013 and reduced our full year reported revenue growth by 2% and our adjusted OIBDA growth by 3%. 
It's important to note that with the additional negative FX impact since our November 4 earnings call, it would have been within or then guided full year OIBDA range. Total company organic revenues, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, SVOD licensing revenues, newly-acquired businesses and consolidation of Discovery Family, grew 7% and adjusted OIBDA grew 6% for the year. As we further demonstrated our ability to deliver consistent financial results even if we continued to invest in building, networks and operations worldwide. Total company margins on an organic basis were 42%, in line with 2013.
Full year net income available to Discovery Communications grew 6% to $1.1 billion in 2014, primarily due to improved operating performance, as well as $105 million decline in mark-to-market equity-based compensation, a $56 million decline in losses from hedging derivatives and a $49 million decline in tax expense, partially offset by $74 million increase from restructuring costs associated we Discovery family and Eurosport and $62 million less in gains related to Discovery Japan and Eurosport transactions. 
Our full year book tax rate came down 300 basis points to 35% as we remain laser focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates by fully utilizing the increasingly international mix of our business. We remain confident on our ability to bring our global effective tax rate to 30% or less last for fiscal 2017, which will drive net income growth, as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth.
Earnings per diluted share were $1.66 as adjusted earnings per diluted share, a much more relevant metric from the comparably perspective, it excludes the impact from noncash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, was $1.84, a 13% improvement year-over-year.
For the full year, free cash flow increased 2% to $1.2 billion, driven by solid operating performance, partially offset by higher content investments and cash tax payments. Content spend for the full year, excluding newly-acquired businesses, increased mid-single digits, and as David discussed, this increased program spend is delivering global audience market share growth and higher advertising revenue.
Free cash flow per share, a critical metric for us and the metric that most influences our strategic planning execution, was up even more as our share count continue to decline due to our buying back over $1.4 billion worth of our shares over the course of 2014.
Focusing now on the fourth quarter, results only. Foreign exchange had a 5% negative impact on revenue growth and a 6% negative impact on adjusted OIBDA growth. Excluding FX, licensing revenues, Eurosport and Discovery family organic revenues were up 4% and organic adjusted OIBDA declined by 2%.
Net income available to Discovery Communications decreased to $250 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the before mentioned restructuring charges and the lower equity earnings this quarter as positive earnings from OWN and other nonconsolidated investments were more than offset by losses from our 50% stake in media.
Media had positive nonconsolidated adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter but amortization and acquisition-related intangible assets and mark-to-market losses on both foreign currency and debt-related interest derivatives led to a net equity earnings loss as hedge accounting was not applied. 
Going forward, we expect media's OIBDA profits to continue, however, mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives, used to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risks are included in their earnings and may cause their net results to fluctuate.
Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share was $0.38 and adjusted EPS was $0.43 compared to $0.46 a year ago. Free cash flow increased an impressive 23% in the fourth quarter to $390 million as improved operating performance and lower tax payments were partially offset by higher content spend. 
Moving now to the individual operating units. U.S. Networks fourth quarter revenue grew 1% on a reported basis but declined 1%, excluding the consolidation of Discovery Family in the quarter and licensing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Reported advertising revenues decreased 3% in the quarter due to lower delivery and demand. Delivery did improve slightly from Q3 but was still down mid-single-digits versus the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Looking ahead to 2015, we expect U.S. ad sales to improve from the fourth quarter results, driven by scatter pricing holding up nicely versus the upfront and modest volume growth. Our current assumption that the overall advertising market will be relatively tepid this year, similar to 4Q '14. But our ultimate full year ad sales outcome will depend upon a variety of factors, with the most important being our network delivery performance.
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from Discovery Family and licensing agreements, were up 6%, consistent with this year's previously reported quarterly growth rates. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter 2015, Comcast deal, we expect our organic distribution growth rate to continue to accelerate as we benefit from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with and TPC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as from our now recognizing revenues come our new Hulu deal. 
Note that unlike our SVOD deals in prior years, we expect the revenue recognition from Hulu to be relatively smooth over the life of the contract.
For the full year, our domestic advertising revenues were up 2% as higher ad pricing and volume more than offset lower delivery. And our distribution revenues were up 6%, excluding the impact of licensing agreements and Discovery Family consolidation.
Turning to the cost side of our U.S. Networks. Fourth quarter organic domestic operating expenses were up 6% as cost of revenues were up 15%, primarily due to the event, while SG&A was down 8%, driven by aggressive base cost productivity and lower marketing costs. For the full year, domestic adjusted OIBDA was down 2% on a reported basis but increased 2%, excluding the impact of Discovery Family and licensing agreements. 
Turning to the International segment. Our International Networks delivered another quarter of strong results, tapping off another exceptional year. Our reported Q4 international revenues were up 17% and adjusted OIBDA was up 11%, while reported fully revenues were up 28% and adjusted OIBDA was up 18%. 
Foreign exchange reduced fourth quarter international revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 10% and 13%, respectively and full year revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates were reduced by 4% and 8%, respectively.
Reported results also include the results of Eurosport for May 2014 and SPS from April 2013. For comparability purposes, the international commentary that follows will refer to our organic results only exclude the Eurosport results for all periods and excludes SBS first quarter 2014 results. They also, exclude the impact to foreign exchange.
Fourth quarter international revenues were up 8%, led by 10% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Advertising, again, grew double digits in the fourth quarter, led by Western Europe, primarily from the continued success of our free-to-air initiatives and, to a lesser extent, the Latin America from higher volumes, especially in Brazil. The revenues another robust quarter of 8% growth, driven primarily by subscriber growth and higher pricing, especially in Latin America.
For the full year, organic advertising revenues were up 14% and organic distribution revenues were up 9%, both impressive growth rates that reflect the vitality of our international business.
Looking ahead to 2015, we expect organic international advertising to grow consistent with the double-digit increases we delivered in the fourth quarter 2014, even, including the ad sales gained in Russia. While organic and affiliate revenues should grow high single digits despite the overall slowing growth of the international pay-TV market and a negative impact from renegotiating several affiliate deals in Russia as a result of the heavy devaluation of the ruble and the collapse of their economy.
Turning to the cost side. Organic operating costs internationally were up 4% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher content amortization, partially offset by a decline in SG&A. Our focus and ability to grow revenues faster than costs led to international organic adjusted OIBDA growing 15% and organic margins expanding 300 basis points in the quarter to 41%. 
For the full year, international organic adjusted OIBDA was up 16% and organic margins were up fully 200 basis points to 40%.
Focusing now on Education and studio businesses. We reorganized all of our existing and newly-acquired global studio production assets into a stand-alone operating division and reclassified these results out of our U.S. and International Networks segments and combine them with Education segment. This redefined and growing segment posted 14% increase in revenues for the year, mostly driven by the acquisitions of studio side and espresso in the Education side, as well as strong acceptance of our recently launched Education digital textbooks.
Adjusted OIBDA was down year-over-year. 
Going forward, in 2015, we will again be minimal profits of this division as we continue to invest in growing both our Education textbooks business and our studio IP and OWN content.
Now, moving to our go forward capital allocation policies and commitments, it is very important to remind investors that our first priority remains in investing in our core business to drive sustained, long term organic growth. Our second priority is investing in strategic, bolt-on acquisition such as Eurosport, to strengthen our global platforms. And our third priority is returning capital to shareholders through execution of our share repurchase program.
In 2014, we repurchased over $1.4 billion worth of over shares. we have now spent over $5.7 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the and of 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by 27% as we find the return on repurchasing our own shares very attractive.
As we articulate our 2015 capital allocation expectations, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating, especially given current global economic uncertainties. Therefore, we currently expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of available capital for full year 2015 to fund both share repurchases, as well as to fund any additional strategic M&A investments, including the potential TF1 for the remaining 49% stake in Eurosport. 
As you may recall, TF1 is a put right for their 41% stake from this July to September, as well as for the same period in 2016. Separately, our calculated free cash flow per share IRR remains very compelling. So we expect to continue to allocate a sustained and a growing amount to share repurchases in future years.
Now let's focus on our 2015 guidance. We expect foreign currency headwinds to persist this year and then therefore changing the way we issued guidance to exclude the impact of currency movements in order to provide investors a clearer view of our local currency-based business. 
Given these, we expect full year 2015 revenues will grow in the high single to low double-digit range, adjusted OIBDA will go into low- to mid-single the range and adjusted EPS will grow in the high single to low double-digit range, driven by this solid operating performance and lower tax rate, partially offset by approximately $25 million of higher interest expense. It is important to highlight and appreciate that the difficult geopolitical situation in Russia is adversely impacting this revenue guidance range by approximately $50 million, driven by the cable ad sales as well on a subsidy to renegotiate several pre-existing affiliate contracts in the region.
Revenue growth in 2015 will outpace adjusted OIBDA growth, mostly due to increased content spend at Eurosport. After 9 months of controlling the asset, we have now determined that we must bolster our investment in sports rights in the near-term in order to fully maximize the growth potential of the asset in the medium and long term. Where we will be very diligent and selective in which sports rights we pursue to drive long-term cost effective market influence growth, we do intend to make 2015 a year of real investment in the business, with full year Eurosport margins down from high teens in 2014 to high single digits in 2015. 
As David highlighted, we see very compelling potential for Eurosport, even more outside than we thought when we bought the asset in the business 2 years ago. And we fully expect the increased sports rights investments to pay of both that Eurosport, as well as across our entire international portfolio. 
Let me to further clarify the foreign exchange impact on our 2015 results.
At current spot rates, FX is reducing our constant currency guided revenue by $350 million or roughly 6% and adjusted OIBDA by $150 million, also roughly 6% versus versus our 2014 reported results. 
Looking at our international networks mix of currency exposures. The revenue mix in 2015 is expected to be around 30% Euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks adjusted OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be about 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short of British pound as our international headquarters are in London. 
Lastly, we anticipate reported free cash flow growth of low single digits in 2015, with growth and cash flow from operating businesses, partially offset by higher cash taxes due to prior year timing benefits related to Section 181. We do expect cash taxes in 2016 to decline significantly as the cash tax deferral effect of 181 subsides. 
Thanks, again for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you might have."

So owning sportswear is particularly for affinity groups, we don't need to own the big sock or. And so we have been out acquiring a lot of specialty rights that we think can really bolster that business. And with 250,000 people and growing, we're talking to them, we're seeing what they like and so I think if anything, we've learned that the super fan group gives really valuable that people super love to watch TV, traditionally. But when you're going out of their home and their something that you really love and sports is the easiest run, the other area we think we have a real chance to monetize is down in Latin America, where we have kids, which is another sports and kids being probably the 2 areas that most lend themselves to a super fan and the direct-to-consumer. But we're also offering an over-the-top service in Northern Europe, in Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland with Dplay and we're finding some success with that. Here in the U.S., we're hoping that TV Everywhere continues to grow. We were very effective in getting our deals done at the end of the year with big step ups and double-digit increases. You see that -- you see our increased these trophies coming through. It was 6 last year, we expect that they will grow outside of Comcast, high single and drive to double-digit. So we're getting real value for our content. TV Everywhere will help. It will be additive. We did Hulu. We did Sony. The good news for us is we own all of our content. It's great super fans for Oprah. We have super fans for Science. Discovery is the #1 network for men again. We believe our content has a lot of value. We just have to figure out how to do it. The best we would be a broad deployment of TV Everywhere in the U.S. and maybe taking some of our super fan affinity groups and going after them the price now with offering courses for $60 or $70 to  go -- to do deep dives. I think the Ecosystem you're in the U.S. is going to stay basically as is for the next 3 years. And the question is 4 or 5 or 6 years from now, will there be peal off of this direct-to-consumer business? I think most in the U.S. of TV Everywhere doesn't develop the way that it should, which would the positive for all of us. And if it doesn't, it would be -- it will require all of us to go directly to consumer because the cable guys aren't getting it done."

First, it's terrific to have a strong creative leader with Rich there and he's brought on a few good people in areas where we thought that we could build on. And we also have a great team at Discovery. But when you look at Discovery last year, it was flat. Outside the U.S., we were up double digits. So we're up in 229 countries double-digit and then the U.S., we're flat. One thing to remember is we program our channels, Discovery, Animal Planet, Science, TLC, ID, we program these globally, Velocity. It gives us tremendous leverage. To the fact that in 229 countries, we countries, we were up double Japan in the U.S., we were flat, actually was a successful year for us. We're not satisfied because the U.S. it's a big market and we want to drive it. The good news is that Discovery has shown a tremendous amount of strength coming into this first -- into the first 6 weeks of the year. We're up more than 20% from where you were in the third and fourth quarter. Discovery is now the #1 nonsports network in America, every week of the last 6 weeks. On Friday nights, Discovery is the #1 network in America, including the broadcasters for man. And to your point, one of Rich's key initiatives is to bring more women back. If you look at Discovery outside the U.S., we have much more hope you in terms of younger demographic and we have much more women watching. And we've taken a big step on Friday nights where we have gold rush and Alaska, not only we're the #1 network beating the broadcasters, but Alaska and Bush is the #1 network -- we're the #1 network for women on Friday night from 10 to 11. So this drive of bringing back women in bringing back younger generation to co-view, which is something we so here in the U.S., we got away from a little bit in the last 2 or 3 years. Rich is target focused on that, but Discovery is a very strong. It's strong here in the U.S., it's strong around the world and I think Rich is going to take it to the next level. On the issue of pushing our programming a little bit there? Right now, we have going to get back to some of our traditional programming, a little bit more of our natural history, science and space. That stuff is working much better also the U.S. and we wanted the blue chip stock. So we'll drive that. And we'll also push on some scripted but it's going to be -- it won't be a lot, it will be just some because we think it needs to be part of the overall recipe. And when we do, we'll be doing it with content that works around the world. And we do make choices. if we want to Discovery to be up 5% or 6% last year, we could have done it. We opted not to do certain programming that we thought would do well within the U.S. but wouldn't play well outside the U.S. And so our sharing ratio is up to 85, which makes us more efficient and the scripted programming that we'll do and Rich has 1 scripted series that we think is going to be very strong around the world."

We wanted for investors to clarify and simplify kind of how we look at the business. Obviously, the studio business is very different from the networks business. So as we've invested in IP, as we've grown our presence in the studio business, we want to separate that and have it clarified so that the U.S. Networks International Networks virtually stand-alone. So within this new segment called Education and Studios, we do expect for 2015 Education to have a slightly lower OIBDA that it had in 2014 as we invest in a longer cycle textbook and also, we expect Studios to have a continued low profile is again we build that asset and own more and more global IP. So think in terms of that segment while understand the OIBDA was meaningfully down in the fourth quarter, driven by again investment in assets particularly long cycle textbook and Studio IP and we expect in '15 again that's be roughly breakeven OIBDA for that segments."

But the spectrum soccer, there are affinities first of they're very popular in some regions and not so popular in others so they've been able to pick up sports rights very good, very, very good progress. Now we're investing because we think having those rights will build over over-the-top service where we make almost $100 subscriber. We also see we that we don't -- when we look at Eurosport, we look at it as, how does it build a whole package? So we might have 3 sport channels, but then we have another 10 channels. We have Integrated on these true and on the ad sales side with very little incremental costs and because we already have local teams in place and we are fighting to the ability to go to the distributive about a few devoted customer get us more value. And so you might see Eurosport's margins dropping as is broken out individually but the overall package of international will be rising and we think will accelerate because having these must-have rights together with our 10 channels were in almost every market, Discovery's the #1 Discovery for men, we have women styles will give us more strength.

So for us, we think Russia is a long-term growth market. There's certainly a lot of turbulence there, but our cost of content is a very low. We have a huge amount of content in Russia, in Russian language that ready their interrelationships. So servicing that's investments internationally and that's we'll play from Russia, we're staying in Russia and we're continuing to push very hard on international, where we see not only great growth, but a lot of what they've talked about in terms of what's facing the U.S. market is the slowing behavioral changes in the way content is consumed.

We're getting back to great characters, heroic characters that are doing jobs, that are facing challenges, that all of us as we sit on the couch, we watch and admire. That's why people love Gold Rush, that's why they still after 11 seasons of deadliest catch. Last frontier and Bush or about families, leaving of the Greek.

So we don't want to buy anything that's going to -- that would slow us down. And so we have the advantage of having probably more synergy than anyone else. We have boots on the ground to make the assessment. But we're going to be disciplined I think we have a very good hand. We are we upfront internationally, we're growing and most of our competitors are investing and walking away. So we're getting a lot of growth just by doing what we're doing. So I think that that's what you'll see if we can get good synergy and we can buy and grow faster, we'll do it, otherwise, there's no reason to stretch."

And so when we buy the hockey rights, we now have a hockey channel -- a regional happy channel in -- that have launched in Sweden. And so it wasn't very expensive. And we've seen the value of the regional sports networks here in the U.S., with the Yes Network, the Yes Network been more valuable than the actors themselves. As we see the playbook, the cost of a lot of this content when we can pick up affinity sports is not that high. We already have the channels.

Last year, Discovery's investment in content, brands and new international platforms generated more impressions and scale than ever before. Better than double-digit growth in international audiences, expansion of our global flagships into new markets and establishing the leading sports provider in Europe is creating strong operating leverage across the company and long-term value for advertisers, audiences, distributors and shareholders. 
2015 marks Discovery's 30th anniversary. And we built our portfolio and brands through a consistent strategy, a strategy of investing in our channels and programming to take market share in the U.S. and market share around the world; investing in local teams, infrastructure and boots on the ground to drive our own global business; and owning our rights and IP across platforms and regions to strengthen our network portfolio and provide the foundation for our direct-to-consumer offerings.
The core of our strategy is to continue investing in content, which feeds in average of 10 channels in more than 220 countries; and to grow our market share in markets around the world. This investment has paid off and our share of prime time viewers 25 to 54 in the U.S. has risen from 7% in 2008 to 12% today. 
Our international viewership continues to set records, gain share and grow dollars in key markets around the world. We ended 2014 with nearly 3 billion cumulative global subscribers, up from 2.5 billion at the end of 2013. And we grew our average international audience by 13%.
More people are spending more time with our content than ever before. Consumers all over the world are consuming more video and more programming than ever. Because we own the vast majority of our worldwide content and IP, we can take advantage of new ways to distribute and monetize our program. New distributor entrants, over-the-top platforms and SVOD expand our optionality and our chance to bring in more dollars and reach more people.
Last quarter, we reached our first-ever long-form distribution agreement with Hulu in the U.S., providing another strong brand and linear TV friendly environment for our content. And in terms of new marketplace entrants, we closed a favorable deal for all of our U.S. channels with Sony for its new cloud-based service, PlayStation View. 
Discovery has a direct-to-consumer business that is profitable and growing, something very few media companies can say. And our opportunities within this landscape are growing rapid rapidly. A look at our recent progress in Europe gives us good reason to be optimistic about our near- and long-term growth in this area. 
In Europe, we've gained subscriptions, valuable insights and a new marketing and sales platform with our own direct-to-consumer products. One is Dplay in the Nordics and the other is the Eurosport Player, which we distribute across the continent. Those services have almost 0.25 million subscribers, bringing in an average of $8 per month in U.S. Our European OTT offerings is giving us a growing revenue stream, a growing direct-to-consumer offering and valuable learnings that we can apply in the U.S. and other markets.
And we're just getting started. For 2015, our goals are to launch a new integrated platform to scale the back end for both services; deploy Dplay to additional markets across Europe and acquire specialty rights at a low cost to strengthen Eurosport's Player and have its growth accelerate; and take all of our learnings and expertise to support the strategy we will be taking to distribution partners and consumers in the U.S., Latin America and around the world. You will hear much more about our products in this area in the months to come.
Further demonstrating the value we continue to earn from our distributors, we completed strong renewals with all of our U.S. distribution partners for deals expiring at the end of 2014, including Suddenlink, Cablevision, NTTC and our latest distribution agreement, a strong renewal with Mediacom that we are announcing today.
In addition to favorable economic terms, each agreement offers subscribers authenticated access to Discovery content inside and outside the home, a good start to building a robust U.S. TV Everywhere offering in earnest and another element of our strategy of capturing a growing share of the streaming audience. These renewals are critical components in growing our U.S. affiliate revenue line, driving our over-the-top offerings, like TV Everywhere, and it demonstrates that the marketplace continues to place a high value on quality content and brands.
Comcast announced last year that our deal with them is up at the end of June. As we all know, Comcast is the largest cable company, a key platform for any independent programmer, of which Discovery is the largest. With our deal coming up, we are hopeful that Comcast will negotiate in good faith, like all of our other distributors have over the last several years.
We continue driving hard on development and a new pipeline of content across our networks here in the U.S. Discovery Channel was the top 4 cable channel for men last year and had 5 of the top 10 cable shows for men, led by Gold Rush at #1; Deadliest Catch at #3; and Fast N' Loud at #4. So far this year, Discovery has vaulted to the #1 nonsports cable network for men 25 to 54, very strong position in the marketplace. And while Discovery Channel has some nice momentum, we believe its best days are ahead. 
In January, Rich Ross officially started, a terrific creative leader, who in less than 2 short months, has reinvigorated our flagship channel. Rich secured the key strong leaders at Discovery and in addition, has hired seasoned executives onto his leadership team, including John Hoffman, a 17-year HBO veteran, to lead our big tent pole specials and event programming; and John Goldwyn, a long-time producer, who has developed many feature films and most recently, Dexter, to oversee Discovery Channels' scripted and miniseries strategy. 
Rich and his team are planning on being very aggressive in developing both of these categories, such as Racing with Extinction (sic) [Racing Extinction], which debuted at Sundance and will be a global television event this fall, as only Discovery can do with reach into over 500 million homes around the world.
Following ratings softness last year, Animal Planet continues to build ratings momentum on the strength of series such as Treehouse Masters, Pit Bulls & Parolees and, of course, Puppy Bowl, which was once again the #1 cable telecast on Super Bowl Sunday, drawing nearly 11 million total viewers, nearly 3 million streams and reaching more than 17 million fans on social media. 
TLC also experienced some softness last year, largely, driven by the cancellation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. We're moving forward by adding compelling new series like 90 Day Fiance, TLC's highest-rated freshman series of the year; and My Big Fat Fabulous Life, which has been renewed for another season and performed extremely well, joining our established series like 19 Kids and Counting, which helped made TLC the #1 cable network for women on Tuesday nights. And last night, was another big Tuesday for us. 
Our other U.S. brands continued to post impressive gains. ID was again #1 in length of tune in all of TV, meaning ID viewers spent almost twice as much time watching ID on average than other cable networks. The network had its highest year ever for prime and total day and was the #5 cable network for women 25 to 54 for all of 2014. The channel continues to defy gravity with passionate superfans. 
And Velocity continues to attract new audiences and posted impressive double-digit ratings gains in prime and total day for the year. Velocity also added 5 million U.S. subscribers in the past year and now reaches 61 million homes.
We are focused on optimizing the programming and performance of the U.S., leveraging this content across our global footprint and unlocking the value of Discovery's distribution advantage around the world. Demonstrating our ability to light up our strong brands on a global basis, we launched our new brand, Discovery Life, in the U.S. and Poland on the same day in January. 
While we are not satisfied with our U.S. ratings performance in 2014, and with the softer U.S. ad sales in the second half of the year, it is important to note that we program for a global audience. River Monsters, Fast N' Loud, Dual Survival, Naked and Afraid, Gold Rush, MythBusters, Say Yes to the Dress, all reached more than 200 million global viewers each year. Developing such globally appealing shows drives our ability to gain share and reach new audiences around the world. 
While our ratings were down for the year in the United States, we set a new international record with the highest average audience in our history, up more than double digit in market share. With new leadership at our flagship Discovery and momentum out of the gate in 2015, I am confident we have some real creative wind in our backs and a growing and dynamic development pipeline. 
The strengthening U.S. dollar had a big impact on our financial results last year across our entire global footprint, however, we are focused on the operating leverage we are creating. And concerns about currency headwinds aside, our international business remains the key differentiator among our U.S. peers and an engine that continues to have strong organic growth.
During 2014, we hit 2 major inflection points. More than 50% of Discovery's revenue comes from outside the U.S., so we generated more than $1 billion in international OIBDA. Discovery's strong organic growth around the world is being driven by our distribution advantage, strong global brands, local managers and staff and smart, strategic acquisitions, led by our new Eurosport brands across Europe and Asia. 
TLC launched in Germany last year and has grown audience across the Central and Eastern European region by 36%. We also supersized TLC in Australia, with an improved channel position and tripled our female viewers. 
ID and Turbo are our hottest new global brands, set to fuel the next generation of worldwide growth. Now reaching over 100 million global homes and since it's launch in Denmark in November, ID has had fantastic success and already ranks as the #4 of our 9 pay-TV channels in Denmark, regularly generating between a 2% and 4% share despite not yet being fully distributed. 
Velocity's international brand, which we call Turbo, is also taking off, particularly in Latin America. We've invested in Turbo and doubled the channel subscribers across the region to over 20 million homes. In fact, Turbo has greater distribution in Brazil after 1 year than many other major brands have after 20 years in the market. We're on track to reach more than 125 million homes for Turbo by the end of 2015.
Latin America continued to lead our organic growth with prime time ratings up 14% year-over-year and our flagship channels, Discovery Channel, Discovery Kids and Discovery Home & Health, ranked as top 10 channels across the region in the key market. Discovery Kids just earned its sixth straight year as the #1 pay-TV channel in all of Brazil. 
Brazil is also a great example of the power of our global content engine. Dual Survivor Brazil, a U.S. format with a locally produced version, delivered the highest-rating ever for Discovery Channel in the country. This is our fastest-growing market in Latin America. Ad sales rose more than 40% year-over-year and pay-TV penetration rates are still just 30%. So we're excited about our continued strong position in this important market.
In Europe, it has been nearly 9 months since we took majority control of Eurosport, and I am more excited than ever about this acquisition and the opportunities that lie ahead. Discovery is now the largest sports player in Eastern and Western Europe by number of subscribers and feeds. Our integration efforts have been focused on going to market as one team, bringing greater scale and depth to distribution and ad sales, bolstering our strategic investments in sports rights to enhance Eurosport's offering and strengthening the bundle of our combined portfolio of leading global brands. 
We're strengthening Eurosport's pan-regional strategy of being the home of sports that are popular across Europe, such as tennis, cycling, winter sports, with all rights and additional exclusivity. We reached 130 million homes across Eastern and Western Europe. 
From May to year-end, we signed 24 incremental deals, including Spanish cycling, alpine sports across Europe, FIFA Women's World Cup Soccer, handball and hockey in the Nordics, and we continue to bolster our tennis and soccer rights. But we're doing it in an efficient and effective and cost-effective way. In addition, we're strengthening Eurosport's local relevancy by acquiring must-have rights to both marquee sports and local sports incredibly important to European fans, while maximizing the distribution of our portfolio of channels. 
In addition to the content and sports rights, we have leveraged our local infrastructure and expertise to merge our distribution teams and have already completed 30 combined distribution deals. And our ad sales teams have sold our joint offering at many upfronts across Europe, highlighted the power of our combined brands and content offering, more than 10 channels in every market, which reaches all the key advertiser demos.
To bolster our strategic leadership and capability in sports, we've hired sports industry veteran, Peter Hutton, as CEO of Eurosport. Peter will use his more than 30 years in the business to lead our negotiations of key sports rights, launching new local feeds into larger advertising markets and to grow the Eurosport Player, which we're very excited about because it's our first real success in direct-to-consumer across Eastern and Western Europe.
And finally, in Asia, India's portfolio of our established global brands achieved best-ever audience levels for prime time and all day, with now 8 networks in 5 languages, reaching 260 million cumulative subscribers. And we're looking closely at what else we can do in India to capitalize on our local team, infrastructure and strong brand position. 
With organic growth opportunities across our global platform and more ways to display and sell our content than ever before, we remain confident that Discovery is well positioned to continue taking market share, deliver long-term growth and increase shareholder value in the years ahead. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David highlighted, despite industry challenges in the domestic ad market and increasing foreign currency headwinds, our expansive network portfolio drove audience and market share gains around the globe. 
On a reported basis, total company revenue for the year increased 13% and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. As expected, given that over half of our revenues are now outside the U.S., the strengthening dollar was a major headwind in 2014 as changes in currency rates had an approximately $100 million negative revenue impact and $70 million negative adjusted OIBDA impact versus 2013, and reduced our full year reported revenue growth by 2% and our adjusted OIBDA growth by 3%. It's important to note that the additional negative FX impact since our November 4 earnings call, we would have been within our then guided full year OIBDA range. 
Total company organic revenues, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, SVOD licensing revenues, newly acquired businesses and the consolidation of the Discovery Family, grew 7% and adjusted OIBDA grew 6% for the year as we further demonstrated our ability to deliver consistent financial results, even as we continued to invest in building our networks and operations worldwide. Total company margins on an organic basis were 42%, in line with 2013.
Full year net income available to Discovery Communications grew 6% to $1.1 billion in 2014, primarily due to improved operating performance as well as $105 million decline in mark-to-market equity-based compensation, a $56 million decline in losses from hedging derivatives and a $49 million decline in tax expense, partially offset by a $74 million increase from restructuring costs associated with Discovery Family and Eurosport and $62 million less in gains related to Discovery Japan and Eurosport transactions. 
Our full year book tax rate came down 300 basis points to 35% as we remain laser-focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates by fully utilizing the increasingly international mix of our business. We remain confident on our ability to bring our global effective tax rate to 30% or less for fiscal 2017, which will drive net income growth, as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth. Earnings per diluted share were $1.66 as adjusted earnings per diluted share, a much more relevant metric from a comparability perspective as it excludes the impact from noncash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, was $1.84, a 13% improvement year-over-year.
For the full year, free cash flow increased 2% to $1.2 billion, driven by solid operating performance, partially offset by higher content investments and cash tax payments. Content spend for the full year, excluding newly acquired businesses, increased mid-single digits, and as David discussed, this increased programming spend is delivering global audience market share growth and higher advertising revenue. Free cash flow per share, a critical metric for us and the metric that most influences our strategic and planning execution, was up even more as our share count continued to decline due to our buying back over $1.4 billion worth of our shares over the course of 2014.
Focusing now on the fourth quarter, results only. Foreign exchange had a 5% negative impact on revenue growth and a 6% negative impact on adjusted OIBDA growth. Excluding FX, licensing revenues, Eurosport and Discovery Family, organic revenues were up 4% and organic adjusted OIBDA declined by 2%.
Net income available to Discovery Communications decreased to $250 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the before-mentioned restructuring charges and lower equity earnings this quarter, as positive earnings from OWN and other nonconsolidated investments were more than offset by losses from our 50% stake in All3Media. 
All3Media had positive nonconsolidated adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter. But amortization and acquisition-related intangible assets and mark-to-market losses on both foreign currency and debt-related interest derivatives led to a net equity earnings loss as hedge accounting was not applied. Going forward, we expect All3Media's adjusted OIBDA profits to continue. However, mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives used to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risks are included in their earnings and may cause their net results to fluctuate.
Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share was $0.38 and adjusted EPS was $0.43 compared to $0.46 a year ago. Free cash flow increased an impressive 23% in the fourth quarter to $390 million, as improved operating performance and lower tax payments were partially offset by higher content spend.
Moving now to the individual operating units. U.S. Networks fourth quarter revenue grew 1% on a reported basis but declined 1%, excluding the consolidation of Discovery Family in the quarter and licensing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013. Reported advertising revenues decreased 3% in the quarter due to lower delivery and demand. Delivery did improve slightly from Q3 but was still down mid-single digits versus the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Looking ahead to 2015, we expect U.S. ad sales to improve from the fourth quarter results, driven by scatter pricing holding up nicely versus the upfront and modest volume growth. Our current assumption is that the overall advertising market will be relatively tepid this year, similar to 4Q '14. But our ultimate full year ad sales outcome will depend upon a variety of factors, with the most important being our network delivery performance.
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from Discovery Family and licensing agreements, were up 6%, consistent with this year's previously reported quarterly growth rates. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter 2015, until there's a new Comcast carriage deal, we expect our organic distribution growth rate to continue to accelerate as we benefit from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as from our now recognizing revenues from our new Hulu deal. Note that unlike our SVOD deals in prior years, we expect the revenue recognition from Hulu to be relatively smooth over the life of the contract.
For the full year, our domestic advertising revenues were up 2% as higher ad pricing and volume more than offset lower delivery. And our distribution revenues were up 6%, excluding the impact of licensing agreements and Discovery Family consolidation.
Turning to the cost side of our U.S. Networks. Fourth quarter organic domestic operating expenses were up 6% as cost of revenues were up 15%, primarily due to the [indiscernible] event; while SG&A was down 8%, driven by aggressive base cost productivity and lower marketing costs. For the full year, domestic adjusted OIBDA was down 2% on a reported basis but increased 2%, excluding the impact of Discovery Family and licensing agreements. 
Turning to the International segment. Our International Networks delivered another quarter of strong results, capping off another exceptional year. Our reported Q4 international revenues were up 17% and adjusted OIBDA was up 11%, while reported fully revenues were up 28% and adjusted OIBDA was up 18%.Foreign exchange reduced fourth quarter international revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 10% and 13%, respectively, and full year revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates were reduced by 4% and 8%, respectively. Reported results also include the results of Eurosport for May 2014 and of SBS from April 2013. 
For comparability purposes, the international commentary that follows will refer to our organic results only. They exclude Eurosport results for all periods and excludes SBS's first quarter 2014 results. They also exclude the impact of foreign exchange.
Fourth quarter international revenues were up 8%, led by 10% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Advertising, again, grew double digits in the fourth quarter, led by Western Europe, primarily from the continued success of our free-to-air initiatives, and to a lesser extent, the Latin America from higher volumes, especially in Brazil. Affiliate revenues had another robust quarter of 8% growth, driven primarily by subscriber growth and higher pricing, especially in Latin America. For the full year, organic advertising revenues were up 14%, and organic distribution revenues were up 9%, both very impressive growth rates that reflect the vitality of our international business.
Looking ahead to 2015, we expect organic international advertising to grow consistent with the double-digit increases we delivered in the fourth quarter 2014, even including the ad sales ban in Russia. While organic and affiliate revenues should grow high single digits despite the overall slowing growth of the international pay-TV market and a negative impact from renegotiating several affiliate deals in Russia as a result of the heavy devaluation of the ruble and the collapse of their economy.
Turning to the cost side. Organic operating costs internationally were up 4% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher content amortization, partially offset by a decline in SG&A. Our focus and ability to grow revenues faster than costs led to international organic adjusted OIBDA growing 15% and organic margin expanding 300 basis points in the quarter to 41%.For the full year, international organic adjusted OIBDA was up 16%, and organic margins were up fully 200 basis points to 40%.
Focusing now on Education and studios businesses. We reorganized all of our existing and newly acquired global studio production assets into a stand-alone operating division and reclassified these results out of our U.S. and International Networks segments and combined them with the Education segment. This redefined and growing segment posted a 14% increase in revenues for the year, mostly driven by the acquisitions of Raw on the studio side and Espresso in the Education side, as well as strong acceptance of our recently launched Education digital textbooks. Adjusted OIBDA was down year-over-year. 
Going forward in 2015, there will, again, be minimal profits with this division as we continue to invest in growing both our Education techbook business and our studio IP and owned content. 
Now moving to our go-forward capital allocation policies and commitments. It is very important to remind investors that our first priority remains investing in our core business to drive sustained, long-term organic growth. Our second priority is investing in strategic, bolt-on acquisition, such as Eurosport, to strengthen our global platforms. And our third priority remains returning capital to shareholders through execution of a share repurchase program.
In 2014, we repurchased over $1.4 billion worth of over shares. We have now spent over $5.7 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the and of 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by 27% as we find the return on repurchasing our own shares very attractive.
As we articulate our 2015 capital allocation expectations, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating, especially given current global economic uncertainties. Therefore, we currently expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of available capital for full year 2015 to fund both share repurchases, as well as to fund any additional strategic M&A investments, including the potential TF1 put for the remaining 49% stake in Eurosport. 
As you may recall, TF1 is a put right for their 49% stake from this July to September as well as for the same period in 2016. Separately, our calculated free cash flow per share IRR remains very compelling. So we expect to continue to allocate a sustained and growing amount of our capital to share repurchases in future years.
Now let's focus on our 2015 guidance. We expect foreign currency headwinds to persist this year and are, therefore, changing the way we issue guidance to exclude the impact of currency movements in order to provide investors a clearer view of our local currency-based business. 
Given this, we expect that full year 2015 revenues will grow in the high single- to low double-digit range, adjusted OIBDA will grow in the low to mid-single-digit range and adjusted EPS will grow in the high single- to low double-digit range, driven by the solid operating performance and a lower tax rate, partially offset by approximately $25 million of higher interest expense. It is important to highlight and appreciate that the difficult geopolitical situation in Russia is adversely impacting this revenue guidance range by approximately $50 million, driven by the cable ad sales ban as well a necessity to renegotiate several pre-existing affiliate contracts in the region.
Revenue growth in 2015 will outpace adjusted OIBDA growth, mostly due to increased content spend at Eurosport. After 9 months of controlling the asset, we have now determined that we must bolster our investments in sports rights in the near term in order to fully maximize the growth potential of the asset in the medium and long term. While we will be very diligent and selective about which sports rights we pursue to drive long-term, cost-effective, market-influencing growth, we do intend to make 2015 a year of real investment in the business, with full year Eurosport margins down from high teens in 2014 to high single digits in 2015. 
As David highlighted, we see very compelling potential for Eurosport, even more upside than we thought when we brought the asset in the business 2 years ago and fully expect these increased sports rights investments to pay off, both at Eurosport as well as across our entire international portfolio. 
Let me to further clarify the foreign exchange impact on our 2015 results. At current spot rates, FX is reducing our constant currency guided revenue by $350 million or roughly 6% and adjusted OIBDA by $150 million, also roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results. 
Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures. The revenue mix in 2015 is expected to be around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks adjusted OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be about 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short the British pound as our international headquarters are in London. 
Lastly, we anticipate reported free cash flow growth of low single digits in 2015, with growth and cash flow from operating businesses partially offset by higher cash taxes due to prior year timing benefits related to Section 181. We do expect cash taxes in 2016 to decline significantly as the cash tax deferral effect of 181 subsides. 
Thanks again for your time this morning. Now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Look, I think that the existing marketplace in the U.S. is going to stay as is. I don't think it's going to grow the ecosystem in terms of the basic cable bundle, but it seems to be quite stable. What we are learning outside the U.S. is that if",545,"Sure, Ben. Look, I think that the existing marketplace in the U.S. is going to stay as is. I don't think it's going to grow the ecosystem in terms of the basic cable bundle, but it seems to be quite stable. What we are learning outside the U.S. is that if we have superfan content, our Eurosport app, that's $8 a month, we're getting big spikes before the Australian Open with people signing up, where they can get 8 courts. It's not affecting our viewership on Eurosport at all. We got a big spike right before the Tour de France. So that owning sports rights, particularly for affinity groups, we don't need to own the big soccer. And so we've been out acquiring a lot of specialty rights that we think can really bolster that business. 
And with 250,000 people and growing, we're talking to them, we're seeing what they like and so I think if anything, we've learned that the superfan group is really valuable, that people still love to watch TV traditionally. But when they're going out of their home and their's something that they really love, and sports is probably the easiest one -- the other area that we think we have a real chance to monetize is down in Latin America, where we have Kids, which is another. Sports and kids being probably the 2 areas that most lend themselves to a superfan and the direct-to-consumer. But we're also offering an over-the-top service in Northern Europe, in Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland with Dplay, and we're finding some success with that. 
Here in the U.S., we're hoping that TV Everywhere continues to grow. We were very effective in getting our deals done at the end of the year, with big step-ups and double-digit increases. You see that -- you see our increased distribution fees coming through. It was 6 last year. We expect that they will grow outside of Comcast, high single and drive to double digit. So we're getting real value for our content. TV Everywhere will help that. It will be additive. We did Hulu. We did Sony. 
The good news for us is we own all of our content. There's great superfans for Oprah. We have superfans for Science. Discovery is the #1 network for men again. And so we believe our content has a lot of value. We just have to figure out how to do it. The best way would be a broad deployment of TV Everywhere in the U.S. and maybe taking some of our superfan affinity groups and going after them, the way Oprah is now with offering courses for $60 or $70 to go -- to do deep dives. 
But I think that the ecosystem here in the U.S. is going to stay basically as is for the next 3 years. And the question is, 4 or 5 or 6 years from now, will there be peal off of this direct-to-consumer business? I think mostly in the U.S., if TV Everywhere doesn't develop the way that it should, which would a positive for all of us. And if it doesn't, it would be -- it will require all of us to go directly to consumer because the cable guys aren't getting it done."

Look, I think that when we look at Discovery Channel in general, we feel great about it. First, it's terrific to have a strong creative leader with Rich there, and he's brought on a few good people in areas where we thought that we could build on. And he -- we also have a great team at Discovery.  But when you look at Discovery last year, it was flat. Outside the U.S., we were up double digit. So we're up in 229 countries, double-digit, and in the U.S., we're flat. 
One thing to remember is we program our channels, Discovery, Animal Planet, Science, TLC, ID, we program these globally, Velocity. It gives us tremendous leverage. So the fact that in 229 countries, we were up double digit, and in the U.S., we were flat, actually was a successful year for us. We're not satisfied because the U.S. is a big market and we want to drive it. The good news is that Discovery has shown a tremendous amount of strength coming into this first -- into the first 6 weeks of the year. We're up more than 20% from where you were in the third and fourth quarter. Discovery is now the #1 non-sports network in America, every week of the last 6 weeks. On Friday nights, Discovery is the #1 network in America, including the broadcasters for men. 
And to your point, one of Rich's key initiatives is to bring more women back. If you look at Discovery outside the U.S., we have much more co-viewing in terms of a younger demographic, and we have much more women watching. And we've taken a big step on Friday nights, where we have Gold Rush and Alaska Bush. Not only are we the #1 network, beating the broadcasters, but Alaskan Bush is the #1 network -- we're the #1 network for women on Friday night from 10 to 11. And so this drive of bringing back women and bringing back a younger generation to co-view, which is something we saw here in the U.S., we got away from a little bit in the last 2 or 3 years. Rich is target focused on that, but Discovery is very strong. It's strong here in the U.S. It's strong around the world, and I think Rich is going to take it to the next level. 
The -- on the issue of pushing our programming a little bit? We -- right now, we have -- we're going to get back to some of our traditional programming, a little bit more of our natural history, science and space. That stuff is working much better outside the U.S. and we want the blue chip stuff, so we'll drive that. And we'll also push on some -- in scripted, but it's going to be -- it won't be a lot. It'll be just some because we think it all needs to be part of the overall recipe. And when we do it, we'll be doing it with content that works around the world. 
And we do make choices. If we wanted Discovery to be up 5% or 6% last year, we could've done it. We opted not to do certain programming that we thought would do well in the U.S. but wouldn't play well outside the U.S. And so our sharing ratio is up to 85, which makes us more efficient and the scripted programming that we'll do -- and Rich has one scripted series that we think is going to be very strong around the world."

We wanted for investors to clarify and simplify kind of how we look at the business. Obviously, the studio business is very different from the networks business. So as we've invested in IP, as we've grown our presence in the studio business, we wanted to separate that and have it clarified so that the U.S. Networks, International Networks were truly stand-alone. 
So within this new segment called Education and studios, we do expect for 2015 Education to have a slightly lower OIBDA than it had in 2014, as we invest in a longer-cycle techbook. And also, we expect Studios to have a continued loss profile as again, we build that asset and own more and more global IP. 
So think in terms of that segment -- well, understand the OIBDA was meaningfully down in the fourth quarter, driven by, again, investment in assets, particularly long-cycle techbook as well as studio IP. And we expect in '15 again, that to be roughly breakeven OIBDA for that segment."

Looks like the content investment there, especially in sports, will keep going up. But on the other hand, is there any offset in terms of maybe integrated the sales forces or cost items that we can expect, now that we've been a few months into the Eurosport? 
And the second question is on the FX side. Could you break out for us what the cash impact of FX is? Is it largely a translation impact that we're looking at right now?"

Look, on the international rights that we're acquiring, one of the advantages that I think we have with Eurosport, we reach 130 million homes with our Eurosport Pan-European feed. And then we have another 2 to 3 channels in 55 countries across Eastern and Western Europe. 
Unlike the U.S., where it's football, baseball and basketball, which are very popular and if you're in sports, you have to have those 3. The equivalent of that would be soccer. But aside from soccer, there are affinity sports that are very popular in some regions and not so popular in others. So we've been able to pick up sports rights, I think, for very good -- very, very good values. 
Now we're investing because we think having those rights will build our over-the-top service, where we make almost $100 a subscriber. We also see that we don't -- when we look at Eurosport, we look at it as, how does it build our whole package? So we might have 3 sport channels, but then we have another 10 channels. And we have integrated on distribution and on the ad sales side with very little incremental costs, because we already have local teams in place. And we're finding that the ability to go to the distributor with all of it will get us more value. And so you might see Eurosport's margins dropping as it's broken out individually, but the overall package of international will be rising and we think will accelerate. Because having these must-have rights together with our 10 channels -- were in almost every market, Discovery's the #1 channel for men, we have women's channels, will give us more strength. 
In addition, we are going to be careful. We looked at Formula 1 and we liked the idea of Formula 1 because it's popular in 220 of our 230 countries. But the valuation was just way too high. So we walked away.

So as we think about 2015, while investing in sports and that will create a lot of long-term leverage and value, will depress margins, outside Eurosport and outside foreign exchange, we still see margin accretion for international business even despite what I mentioned was the $50 million bad guy associated with the collapse of the Russian currency and the economy. 
So we still see that operating leverage. We're having a lot of success on cost productivity. We've done a really good job on driving cost synergies at both SBS and Eurosport. So we're going to invest in content that drives value, and we're going to continue to look at cost productivity to ensure base organic margins are up year-over-year over year."

And we have full conviction because these things are cyclical. We're looking at growing our international business double digit. We're looking at drive -- we have our local teams in place. Our market share grew over 13% last year. We think we can do that again this year. A lot of others are not investing internationally. Our model of global brands and global content gives us tremendous efficiency, and we love our international business. 
I think over time, things can flip the other way, where it's working for us. But we're continuing to drive our market share, and we're being helped by the fact that others are walking away. 
We also have conviction in Russia. We have a big business there. We have great brands and there is some challenges in terms of the politics. But having said that, by the end of the year, we need to restructure where we own only 20% of the entity. But there's been a lot of interest in our brands and our content and getting us value for that. And there's also been some green shoots around Putin looking again at pay-TV. So for us, we think Russia is a long-term growth market. There's certainly a lot of turbulence there, but our cost of content is very low. We have a huge amount of content in Russian language that's already and relationships. So while others are saying, ""Let's invest less internationally and let's walk away from Russia,"" we're staying in Russia. And we're continuing to push very hard on international, where we see not only great growth, but a lot of what we've talked about in terms of what's facing the U.S. market, the slowing behavioral changes in the way content is consumed. The Latin America is 4, 5 or 6 years behind. There are markets in Eastern Europe that may be more than that, so we see it as a big hedge and a big opportunity to take advantage of what we've built over the last 7 or 8 years."

I think in history, she's doing a very nice job for them and she's a great programmer. 
I would say that I somewhat disagree. I think the risk taking has been too much. We're actually going in the other direction. 
If you look at what's happened to nonfiction, you see the aggressiveness of picking really kind of wacky characters of -- it's almost become scripted in the way that it's presented. And I think the audience here in America gets it. They get that this isn't really nonfiction. That some of these fights aren't real. That some of these characters aren't real. 
And so what's really been working for us is, forget about what everyone else is doing, which is looking for more extreme characters, more extreme contention, to get back to basics. And we've actually made a strategic decision to do that and it's working for us. If you look at Treehouse Masters, no one's throwing mud at each other in Treehouse Masters. 
This past Tuesday night, we did 19 and Counting. We're the #1 network in America for women, and we have got a 2 6 in the demo. And what is it about? It's about a family that homeschools their kids. And we followed it with another very wholesome family that's struggling with the issues that everyone in America's struggling with. 
And so for us, whether it's Alaskan Bush, Gold Rush, Last Frontier, 19 Kids and Counting, Treehouse Masters, we think that a lot of the nonfiction challenge has been going into this extreme area. We're getting back to great characters, heroic characters that are doing jobs, that are facing challenges, that all of us, as we sit on the couch, look at and admire. That's what -- that's why people love Gold Rush. That's why they still, after 11 seasons, love Deadliest Catch. Last Frontier and Bush are about families living off the grid. And so I think that nonfiction is working very well for us, and we have to remember what we do best, which is great authentic characters that are fighting the fight to live, to make the best of their lives. And when we do that, we do very well."

On the upfront, that was really a decision that was driven by Joe Abruzzese and the team.

And we find that the more senior players are coming to the dinners and that we weren't getting the real -- the buyers that are making a difference in the upfront.

In -- aside from just Russia, we saw strength across Eastern and Western Europe. We saw a lot of strength in Latin America. And for the first time in the fourth quarter, Asia was not double digit where it's been, but it's been mostly made up for the fact that Brazil has been exploding. 
One of the things that we're seeing in Latin America is how important Brazil is to us. Advertising revenue, up almost 50% last year in Brazil, and in the first quarter, we're seeing -- even though it's lapping, similar. So the fact that it's gotten to 30% penetration in Brazil, that's kind of triggered the advertising marketplace to start spending more time there.

We said we've seen acceleration of U.S. affiliate, because the deals that we successfully gotten done as well as the inclusion of Sony.

As you look around the world, it's sad that you look at the U.S. as being on the very -- on the lower end of antiquated measurement systems. It's one of the -- it may be the most robust advertising market in the world and the most efficient. And yet, the measurement is very weak. 
You look -- you go to markets like Norway and it's cue tone based. So anybody that watches anything, whether you're watching in a bar or you're watching at your house, whether you're watching on your iPad, it counts. And viewership on -- in Norway is up 15%. Before they implemented last year this new system, it showed that viewership on television was down double digit. And it was a huge swing. 
We're working with Nielsen, all the programmers are. The problem is it's a monopoly here in the U.S. it's a real -- it is a real challenge and there's no question that it's under-measuring, but it's the system that we have. 
When you look at, for instance, how we do when you aggregate one -- of the reasons we went to live plus 3 is our viewership is up dramatically. And there's just a lot of unmeasured here in the U.S. So it is what it is. Outside the U.S., we do a little bit better. I think they'll fix it over time, but it's a problem."

It's how we went from 5% of viewership with 14 channels here in the U.S. to almost 13% of viewership now, when almost the majority of media companies have lost market share. We picked up hockey rights. They're not that expensive in Northern Europe. 
So we know that we have this Eurosport channel that's in 130 million homes, the only platform like it. We know we have an average of 10 traditional channels in every market. But we have 2 to 3 other sports channels that we're getting paid on. They're in basic. And so when we buy the hockey rights, we now have a hockey -- a regional hockey channel in -- that have launched in Sweden. And so it wasn't very expensive. And we've seen the value of the regional sports networks here in the U.S. with the YES Network -- the YES Network been more valuable than the Yankees themselves. And so we see the playbook. The cost of a lot of this content, when we pick up affinity sports, is not that high. We already have the channels. We won't have these, what we're calling a regional sports networks in every country. But the ability to pick up rights and just flip a switch and have a Pan-European Eurosport, our 10 channels and then, boom, we got a hockey channel. Now we're going to distributors; we're going to advertisers; our incremental cost, not that high. We think that could be a real accelerator for us."

Last year, Discovery's investment in content, brands and new international platforms generated more impressions and scale than ever before. Better than double-digit growth in international audiences, expansion of our global flagships into new markets and establishing the leading sports provider in Europe is creating strong operating leverage across the company and long-term value for advertisers, audiences, distributors and shareholders. 
2015 marks Discovery's 30th anniversary. And we built our portfolio and brands through a consistent strategy, a strategy of investing in our channels and programming to take market share in the U.S. and market share around the world; investing in local teams, infrastructure and boots on the ground to drive our global business; and owning our rights and IP across platforms and regions to strengthen our network portfolio and provide the foundation for our direct-to-consumer offerings.
The core of our strategy is to continue investing in content, which feeds in average of 10 channels in more than 220 countries; and to grow our market share in markets around the world. This investment has paid off and our share of prime time viewers, 25 to 54 in the U.S., has risen from 7% in 2008 to 12% today. 
Our international viewership continues to set records, gain share and grow dollars in key markets around the world. We ended 2014 with nearly 3 billion cumulative global subscribers, up from 2.5 billion at the end of 2013. And we grew our average international audience by 13%.
More people are spending more time with our content than ever before. Consumers all over the world are consuming more video and more programming than ever. Because we own the vast majority of our worldwide content and IP, we can take advantage of new ways to distribute and monetize our program. New distributor entrants, over-the-top platforms and SVOD expand our optionality and our chance to bring in more dollars and reach more people.
Last quarter, we reached our first-ever long-form distribution agreement with Hulu in the U.S., providing another strong brand and linear TV friendly environment for our content. And in terms of new marketplace entrants, we closed a favorable deal for all of our U.S. channels with Sony for its new cloud-based service, PlayStation Vue. 
Discovery has a direct-to-consumer business that is profitable and growing, something very few media companies can say. And our opportunities within this landscape are growing rapid rapidly. A look at our recent progress in Europe gives us good reason to be optimistic about our near- and long-term growth in this area. 
In Europe, we've gained subscriptions, valuable insights and a new marketing and sales platform with our own direct-to-consumer products. One is Dplay in the Nordics and the other is the Eurosport Player, which we distribute across the continent. Those services have almost 0.25 million subscribers, bringing in an average of $8 per month in U.S. Our European OTT offerings is giving us a growing revenue stream, a growing direct-to-consumer offering and valuable learnings that we can apply in the U.S. and other markets.
And we're just getting started. For 2015, our goals are to launch a new integrated platform to scale the back end for both services; deploy Dplay to additional markets across Europe and acquire specialty rights at a low cost to strengthen Eurosport's Player and have its growth accelerate; and take all of our learnings and expertise to support the strategy we will be taking to distribution partners and consumers in the U.S., Latin America and around the world. You will hear much more about our products in this area in the months to come.
Further demonstrating the value we continue to earn from our distributors, we completed strong renewals with all of our U.S. distribution partners for deals expiring at the end of 2014, including Suddenlink, Cablevision, NTTC and our latest distribution agreement, a strong renewal with Mediacom that we are announcing today.
In addition to favorable economic terms, each agreement offers subscribers authenticated access to Discovery content inside and outside the home, a good start to building a robust U.S. TV Everywhere offering in earnest and another element of our strategy of capturing a growing share of the streaming audience. These renewals are critical components in growing our U.S. affiliate revenue line, driving our over-the-top offerings, like TV Everywhere, and it demonstrates that the marketplace continues to place a high value on quality content and brands.
Comcast announced last year that our deal with them is up at the end of June. As we all know, Comcast is the largest cable company, a key platform for any independent programmer, of which Discovery is the largest. With our deal coming up, we are hopeful that Comcast will negotiate in good faith, like all of our other distributors have over the last several years.
We continue driving hard on development and a new pipeline of content across our networks here in the U.S. Discovery Channel was the top 4 cable channel for men last year and had 5 of the top 10 cable shows for men, led by Gold Rush at #1; Deadliest Catch at #3; and Fast N' Loud at #4. So far this year, Discovery has vaulted to the #1 nonsports cable network for men 25 to 54, a very strong position in the marketplace. And while Discovery Channel has some nice momentum, we believe its best days are ahead. 
In January, Rich Ross officially started, a terrific creative leader, who in less than 2 short months, has reinvigorated our flagship channel. Rich secured the key strong leaders at Discovery and in addition, has hired seasoned executives onto his leadership team, including John Hoffman, a 17-year HBO veteran, to lead our big tent-pole specials and event programming; and John Goldwyn, a long-time producer, who has developed many feature films and most recently, Dexter, to oversee Discovery Channels' scripted and miniseries strategy. 
Rich and his team are planning on being very aggressive in developing both of these categories, such as Racing with Extinction (sic) [Racing Extinction], which debuted at Sundance and will be a global television event this fall, as only Discovery can do with reach into over 500 million homes around the world.
Following ratings softness last year, Animal Planet continues to build ratings momentum on the strength of series such as Treehouse Masters, Pit Bulls & Parolees and, of course, Puppy Bowl, which was once again the #1 cable telecast on Super Bowl Sunday, drawing nearly 11 million total viewers, nearly 3 million streams and reaching more than 17 million fans on social media. 
TLC also experienced some softness last year, largely driven by the cancellation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. We're moving forward by adding compelling new series like 90 Day Fiance, TLC's highest-rated freshman series of the year; and My Big Fat Fabulous Life, which has been renewed for another season and performed extremely well, joining our established series like 19 Kids and Counting, which helped made TLC the #1 cable network for women on Tuesday nights. And last night, was another big Tuesday for us. 
Our other U.S. brands continued to post impressive gains. ID was again #1 in length of tune in all of TV, meaning ID viewers spent almost twice as much time watching ID on average than other cable networks. The network had its highest year ever for prime and total day and was the #5 cable network for women 25 to 54 for all of 2014. The channel continues to defy gravity with passionate superfans. 
And Velocity continues to attract new audiences and posted impressive double-digit ratings gains in prime and total day for the year. Velocity also added 5 million U.S. subscribers in the past year and now reaches 61 million homes.
We are focused on optimizing the programming and performance of the U.S., leveraging this content across our global footprint and unlocking the value of Discovery's distribution advantage around the world. Demonstrating our ability to light up our strong brands on a global basis, we launched our new brand, Discovery Life, in the U.S. and Poland on the same day in January. 
While we are not satisfied with our U.S. ratings performance in 2014, and with the softer U.S. ad sales in the second half of the year, it is important to note that we program for a global audience. River Monsters, Fast N' Loud, Dual Survival, Naked and Afraid, Gold Rush, MythBusters, Say Yes to the Dress, all reached more than 200 million global viewers each year. Developing such globally appealing shows drives our ability to gain share and reach new audiences around the world. 
While our ratings were down for the year in the United States, we set a new international record with the highest average audience in our history, up more than double digit in market share. With new leadership at our flagship Discovery and momentum out of the gate in 2015, I am confident we have some real creative wind in our backs and a growing and dynamic development pipeline. 
The strengthening U.S. dollar had a big impact on our financial results last year across our entire global footprint, however, we are focused on the operating leverage we are creating. And concerns about currency headwinds aside, our international business remains the key differentiator among our U.S. peers and an engine that continues to have strong organic growth.
During 2014, we hit 2 major inflection points. More than 50% of Discovery's revenue comes from outside the U.S., so we generated more than $1 billion in international OIBDA. Discovery's strong organic growth around the world is being driven by our distribution advantage, strong global brands, local managers and staff and smart, strategic acquisitions, led by our new Eurosport brands across Europe and Asia. 
TLC launched in Germany last year and has grown audience across the Central and Eastern European region by 36%. We also supersized TLC in Australia, with an improved channel position and tripled our female viewers. 
ID and Turbo are our hottest new global brands, set to fuel the next generation of worldwide growth. Now reaching over 100 million global homes and since its launch in Denmark in November, ID has had fantastic success and already ranks as the #4 of our 9 pay-TV channels in Denmark, regularly generating between a 2% and 4% share despite not yet being fully distributed. 
Velocity's international brand, which we call Turbo, is also taking off, particularly in Latin America. We've invested in Turbo and doubled the channel subscribers across the region to over 20 million homes. In fact, Turbo has greater distribution in Brazil after 1 year than many other major brands have after 20 years in the market. We're on track to reach more than 125 million homes for Turbo by the end of 2015.
Latin America continued to lead our organic growth with prime time ratings up 14% year-over-year and our flagship channels, Discovery Channel, Discovery Kids and Discovery Home & Health, ranked as top 10 channels across the region in the key market. Discovery Kids just earned its sixth straight year as the #1 pay-TV channel in all of Brazil. 
Brazil is also a great example of the power of our global content engine. Dual Survivor Brazil, a U.S. format with a locally produced version, delivered the highest-rating ever for Discovery Channel in the country. This is our fastest-growing market in Latin America. Ad sales rose more than 40% year-over-year and pay-TV penetration rates are still just 30%. So we're excited about our continued strong position in this important market.
In Europe, it has been nearly 9 months since we took majority control of Eurosport, and I am more excited than ever about this acquisition and the opportunities that lie ahead. Discovery is now the largest sports player in Eastern and Western Europe by number of subscribers and feeds. Our integration efforts have been focused on going to market as one team, bringing greater scale and depth to distribution and ad sales, bolstering our strategic investments in sports rights to enhance Eurosport's offering and strengthening the bundle of our combined portfolio of leading global brands. 
We're strengthening Eurosport's pan-regional strategy of being the home of sports that are popular across Europe, such as tennis, cycling, winter sports, with all rights and additional exclusivity. We reach 130 million homes across Eastern and Western Europe. 
From May to year-end, we signed 24 incremental deals, including Spanish cycling, alpine sports across Europe, FIFA Women's World Cup Soccer, handball and hockey in the Nordics, and we continue to bolster our tennis and soccer rights. But we're doing it in an efficient and effective and cost-effective way. In addition, we're strengthening Eurosport's local relevancy by acquiring must-have rights to both marquee sports and local sports incredibly important to European fans, while maximizing the distribution of our portfolio of channels. 
In addition to the content and sports rights, we have leveraged our local infrastructure and expertise to merge our distribution teams and have already completed 30 combined distribution deals. And our ad sales teams have sold our joint offering at many upfronts across Europe, highlighting the power of our combined brands and content offering, more than 10 channels in every market, which reaches all the key advertiser demos.
To bolster our strategic leadership and capability in sports, we've hired sports industry veteran, Peter Hutton, as CEO of Eurosport. Peter will use his more than 30 years in the business to lead our negotiations of key sports rights, launching new local feeds into larger advertising markets and to grow the Eurosport Player, which we're very excited about because it's our first real success in direct-to-consumer across Eastern and Western Europe.
And finally, in Asia, India's portfolio of our established global brands achieved best-ever audience levels for prime time and all day, with now 8 networks in 5 languages, reaching 260 million cumulative subscribers. And we're looking closely at what else we can do in India to capitalize on our local team, infrastructure and strong brand position. 
With organic growth opportunities across our global platform and more ways to display and sell our content than ever before, we remain confident that Discovery is well positioned to continue taking market share, deliver long-term growth and increase shareholder value in the years ahead. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results."

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David highlighted, despite industry challenges in the domestic ad market and increasing foreign currency headwinds, our expansive network portfolio drove audience and market share gains around the globe. 
On a reported basis, total company revenue for the year increased 13% and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. As expected, given that over half of our revenues are now outside the U.S., the strengthening dollar was a major headwind in 2014 as changes in currency rates had an approximately $100 million negative revenue impact and $70 million negative adjusted OIBDA impact versus 2013, and reduced our full year reported revenue growth by 2% and our adjusted OIBDA growth by 3%. It's important to note that the additional negative FX impact since our November 4 earnings call, we would have been within our then guided full year OIBDA range. 
Total company organic revenues, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, SVOD licensing revenues, newly acquired businesses and the consolidation of the Discovery Family, grew 7% and adjusted OIBDA grew 6% for the year as we further demonstrated our ability to deliver consistent financial results, even as we continued to invest in building our networks and operations worldwide. Total company margins on an organic basis were 42%, in line with 2013.
Full year net income available to Discovery Communications grew 6% to $1.1 billion in 2014, primarily due to improved operating performance as well as a $105 million decline in mark-to-market equity-based compensation, a $56 million decline on losses from hedging derivatives and a $49 million decline in tax expense, partially offset by a $74 million increase from restructuring costs associated with Discovery Family and Eurosport and $62 million less in gains related to Discovery Japan and Eurosport transactions. 
Our full year book tax rate came down 300 basis points to 35% as we remain laser-focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates by fully utilizing the increasingly international mix of our business. We remain confident on our ability to bring our global effective tax rate to 30% or less for fiscal 2017, which will drive net income growth, as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth. Earnings per diluted share were $1.66 as adjusted earnings per diluted share, a much more relevant metric from a comparability perspective as it excludes the impact from noncash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, was $1.84, a 13% improvement year-over-year.
For the full year, free cash flow increased 2% to $1.2 billion, driven by solid operating performance, partially offset by higher content investments and cash tax payments. Content spend for the full year, excluding newly acquired businesses, increased mid-single digits, and as David discussed, this increased programming spend is delivering global audience market share growth and higher advertising revenue. Free cash flow per share, a critical metric for us and the metric that most influences our strategic and planning execution, was up even more as our share count continued to decline due to our buying back over $1.4 billion worth of our shares over the course of 2014.
Focusing now on the fourth quarter, results only. Foreign exchange had a 5% negative impact on revenue growth and a 6% negative impact on adjusted OIBDA growth. Excluding FX, licensing revenues, Eurosport and Discovery Family, organic revenues were up 4% and organic adjusted OIBDA declined by 2%.
Net income available to Discovery Communications decreased to $250 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the before-mentioned restructuring charges and lower equity earnings this quarter, as positive earnings from OWN and other nonconsolidated investments were more than offset by losses from our 50% stake in All3Media. 
All3Media had positive nonconsolidated adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter. But amortization and acquisition-related intangible assets and mark-to-market losses on both foreign currency and debt-related interest derivatives led to a net equity earnings loss as hedge accounting was not applied. Going forward, we expect All3Media's adjusted OIBDA profits to continue. However, mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives used to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risks are included in their earnings and may cause their net results to fluctuate.
Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share was $0.38 and adjusted EPS was $0.43 compared to $0.46 a year ago. Free cash flow increased an impressive 23% in the fourth quarter to $390 million, as improved operating performance and lower tax payments were partially offset by higher content spend.
Moving now to the individual operating units. U.S. Networks fourth quarter revenue grew 1% on a reported basis but declined 1%, excluding the consolidation of Discovery Family in the quarter and licensing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013. Reported advertising revenues decreased 3% in the quarter due to lower delivery and demand. Delivery did improve slightly from Q3 but was still down mid-single digits versus the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Looking ahead to 2015, we expect U.S. ad sales to improve from the fourth quarter results, driven by scatter pricing holding up nicely versus the upfront and modest volume growth. Our current assumption is that the overall advertising market will be relatively tepid this year, similar to 4Q '14. But our ultimate full year ad sales outcome will depend upon a variety of factors, with the most important being our network delivery performance.
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from Discovery Family and licensing agreements, were up 6%, consistent with this year's previously reported quarterly growth rates. 
Looking ahead to the first quarter 2015, until there's a new Comcast carriage deal, we expect our organic distribution growth rate to continue to accelerate as we benefit from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as from our now recognizing revenues from our new Hulu deal. Note that unlike our SVOD deals in prior years, we expect the revenue recognition from Hulu to be relatively smooth over the life of the contract.
For the full year, our domestic advertising revenues were up 2% as higher ad pricing and volume more than offset lower delivery. And our distribution revenues were up 6%, excluding the impact of licensing agreements and Discovery Family consolidation.
Turning to the cost side of our U.S. Networks. Fourth quarter organic domestic operating expenses were up 6% as cost of revenues were up 15%, primarily due to the Wallenda event; while SG&A was down 8%, driven by aggressive base cost productivity and lower marketing costs. For the full year, domestic adjusted OIBDA was down 2% on a reported basis but increased 2%, excluding the impact of Discovery Family and licensing agreements. 
Turning to the International segment. Our International Networks delivered another quarter of strong results, capping off another exceptional year. Our reported Q4 international revenues were up 17% and adjusted OIBDA was up 11%, while reported full year revenues were up 28% and adjusted OIBDA was up 18%. Foreign exchange reduced fourth quarter international revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 10% and 13%, respectively, and full year revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates were reduced by 4% and 8%, respectively. Reported results also include the results of Eurosport for May 2014 and of SBS from April 2013. 
For comparability purposes, the international commentary that follows will refer to our organic results only. They exclude Eurosport's results for all periods and excludes SBS's first quarter 2014 results. They also exclude the impact of foreign exchange.
Fourth quarter international revenues were up 8%, led by 10% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Advertising, again, grew double digits in the fourth quarter, led by Western Europe, primarily from the continued success of our free-to-air initiatives, and to a lesser extent, the Latin America from higher volumes, especially in Brazil. Affiliate revenues had another robust quarter of 8% growth, driven primarily by subscriber growth and higher pricing, especially in Latin America. For the full year, organic advertising revenues were up 14%, and organic distribution revenues were up 9%, both very impressive growth rates that reflect the vitality of our international business.
Looking ahead to 2015, we expect organic international advertising to grow consistent with the double-digit increases we delivered in the fourth quarter 2014, even including the ad sales ban in Russia. While organic and affiliate revenues should grow high single digits despite the overall slowing growth of the international pay-TV market and a negative impact from renegotiating several affiliate deals in Russia as a result of the heavy devaluation of the ruble and the collapse of their economy.
Turning to the cost side. Organic operating costs internationally were up 4% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher content amortization, partially offset by a decline in SG&A. Our focus and ability to grow revenues faster than costs led to international organic adjusted OIBDA growing 15% and organic margin expanding 300 basis points in the quarter to 41%. For the full year, international organic adjusted OIBDA was up 16%, and organic margins were up fully 200 basis points to 40%.
Focusing now on Education and studios businesses. We reorganized all of our existing and newly acquired global studio production assets into a stand-alone operating division and reclassified these results out of our U.S. and International Networks segments and combined them with the Education segment. This redefined and growing segment posted a 14% increase in revenues for the year, mostly driven by the acquisitions of Raw on the studio side and Espresso in the Education side, as well as strong acceptance of our recently launched Education digital textbooks. Adjusted OIBDA was down year-over-year. 
Going forward in 2015, there will, again, be minimal profits with this division as we continue to invest in growing both our Education Techbook business and our studio IP and owned content. 
Now moving to our go-forward capital allocation policies and commitments. It is very important to remind investors that our first priority remains investing in our core business to drive sustained, long-term organic growth. Our second priority is investing in strategic, bolt-on acquisition, such as Eurosport, to strengthen our global platforms. And our third priority remains returning capital to shareholders through execution of a share repurchase program.
In 2014, we repurchased over $1.4 billion worth of over shares. We have now spent over $5.7 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by 27% as we find the return on repurchasing our own shares very attractive.
As we articulate our 2015 capital allocation expectations, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating, especially given current global economic uncertainties. Therefore, we currently expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of our available capital for full year 2015 to fund both share repurchases, as well as to fund any additional strategic M&A investments, including the potential TF1 put for the remaining 49% stake in Eurosport. 
As you may recall, TF1 is a put right for their 49% stake from this July through September as well as for the same period in 2016. Separately, our calculated free cash flow per share IRR remains very compelling. So we expect to continue to allocate a sustained and growing amount of our capital to share repurchases in future years.
Now let's focus on our 2015 guidance. We expect foreign currency headwinds to persist this year and are, therefore, changing the way we issue guidance to exclude the impact of currency movements in order to provide investors a clearer view of our local currency-based business. 
Given this, we expect that full year 2015 revenues will grow in the high single- to low double-digit range, adjusted OIBDA will grow in the low to mid-single-digit range and adjusted EPS will grow in the high single- to low double-digit range, driven by the solid operating performance and a lower tax rate, partially offset by approximately $25 million of higher interest expense. It is important to highlight and appreciate that the difficult geopolitical situation in Russia is adversely impacting this revenue guidance range by approximately $50 million, driven by the cable ad sales ban as well a necessity to renegotiate several pre-existing affiliate contracts in the region.
Revenue growth in 2015 will outpace adjusted OIBDA growth, mostly due to increased content spend at Eurosport. After 9 months of controlling the asset, we have now determined that we must bolster our investments in sports rights in the near term in order to fully maximize the growth potential of the asset in the medium and long term. While we will be very diligent and selective about which sports rights we pursue to drive long-term, cost-effective, market-influencing growth, we do intend to make 2015 a year of real investment in the business, with full year Eurosport margins down from high teens in 2014 to high single digits in 2015. 
As David highlighted, we see very compelling potential for Eurosport, even more upside than we thought when we brought the asset in the business 2 years ago and fully expect these increased sports rights investments to pay off, both at Eurosport as well as across our entire international portfolio. 
Let me to further clarify the foreign exchange impact on our 2015 results. At current spot rates, FX is reducing our constant currency guided revenue by $350 million or roughly 6% and adjusted OIBDA by $150 million, also roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results. 
Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures. The revenue mix in 2015 is expected to be around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks adjusted OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be about 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short the British pound as our international headquarters are in London. 
Lastly, we anticipate reported free cash flow growth of low single digits in 2015, with growth and cash flow from operating businesses partially offset by higher cash taxes due to prior year timing benefits related to Section 181. We do expect cash taxes in 2016 to decline significantly as the cash tax deferral effect of 181 subsides. 
Thanks again for your time this morning. Now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Look, I think that the existing marketplace in the U.S. is going to stay as is. I don't think it's going to grow the ecosystem in terms of the basic cable bundle, but it seems to be quite stable. What we are learning outside the U.S. is that if",545,"Sure, Ben. Look, I think that the existing marketplace in the U.S. is going to stay as is. I don't think it's going to grow the ecosystem in terms of the basic cable bundle, but it seems to be quite stable. What we are learning outside the U.S. is that if we have superfan content, our Eurosport app, that's $8 a month, we're getting big spikes before the Australian Open with people signing up, where they can get 8 courts. It's not affecting our viewership on Eurosport at all. We got a big spike right before the Tour de France. So that owning sports rights, particularly for affinity groups, we don't need to own the big soccer. And so we've been out acquiring a lot of specialty rights that we think can really bolster that business. 
And with 250,000 people and growing, we're talking to them, we're seeing what they like and so I think if anything, we've learned that the superfan group is really valuable, that people still love to watch TV traditionally. But when they're going out of their home and their's something that they really love, and sports is probably the easiest one -- the other area that we think we have a real chance to monetize is down in Latin America, where we have Kids, which is another. Sports and kids being probably the 2 areas that most lend themselves to a superfan and the direct-to-consumer. But we're also offering an over-the-top service in Northern Europe, in Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland with Dplay, and we're finding some success with that. 
Here in the U.S., we're hoping that TV Everywhere continues to grow. We were very effective in getting our deals done at the end of the year, with big step-ups and double-digit increases. You see that -- you see our increased distribution fees coming through. It was 6 last year. We expect that they will grow outside of Comcast, high single and drive to double digit. So we're getting real value for our content. TV Everywhere will help that. It will be additive. We did Hulu. We did Sony. 
The good news for us is we own all of our content. There's great superfans for Oprah. We have superfans for Science. Discovery is the #1 network for men again. And so we believe our content has a lot of value. We just have to figure out how to do it. The best way would be a broad deployment of TV Everywhere in the U.S. and maybe taking some of our superfan affinity groups and going after them, the way Oprah is now with offering courses for $60 or $70 to go -- to do deep dives. 
But I think that the ecosystem here in the U.S. is going to stay basically as is for the next 3 years. And the question is, 4 or 5 or 6 years from now, will there be peel off of this direct-to-consumer business? I think mostly in the U.S., if TV Everywhere doesn't develop the way that it should, which would a positive for all of us. And if it doesn't, it would be -- it will require all of us to go directly to consumer because the cable guys aren't getting it done."

And then for Andy, I just had a quick one, which was you guys in the quarter reclassified some of your OIBDA. OIBDA losses, I guess, from your U.S. and International segments into Education.

Look, I think that when we look at Discovery Channel in general, we feel great about it. First, it's terrific to have a strong creative leader with Rich there, and he's brought on a few good people in areas where we thought that we could build on. And he -- we also have a great team at Discovery.  But when you look at Discovery last year, it was flat. Outside the U.S., we were up double digit. So we're up in 229 countries, double-digit, and in the U.S., we're flat. 
One thing to remember is we program our channels, Discovery, Animal Planet, Science, TLC, ID, we program these globally, Velocity. It gives us tremendous leverage. So the fact that in 229 countries, we were up double digit, and in the U.S., we were flat, that actually was a successful year for us. We're not satisfied because the U.S. is a big market and we want to drive it. The good news is that Discovery has shown a tremendous amount of strength coming into this first -- into the first 6 weeks of the year. We're up more than 20% from where you were in the third and fourth quarter. Discovery is now the #1 non-sports network in America, every week of the last 6 weeks. On Friday nights, Discovery is the #1 network in America, including the broadcasters for men. 
And to your point, one of Rich's key initiatives is to bring more women back. If you look at Discovery outside the U.S., we have much more co-viewing in terms of a younger demographic, and we have much more women watching. And we've taken a big step on Friday nights, where we have Gold Rush and Alaska Bush. Not only are we the #1 network, beating the broadcasters, but Alaskan Bush is the #1 network -- we're the #1 network for women on Friday night from 10 to 11. And so this drive of bringing back women and bringing back a younger generation to co-view, which is something we saw here in the U.S., we got away from a little bit in the last 2 or 3 years. Rich is target focused on that, but Discovery is very strong. It's strong here in the U.S. It's strong around the world, and I think Rich is going to take it to the next level. 
The -- on the issue of pushing our programming a little bit? We -- right now, we have -- we're going to get back to some of our traditional programming, a little bit more of our natural history, science and space. That stuff is working much better outside the U.S. and we want the blue chip stuff, so we'll drive that. And we'll also push on some -- in scripted, but it's going to be -- it won't be a lot. It'll be just some because we think it all needs to be part of the overall recipe. And when we do it, we'll be doing it with content that works around the world. 
And we do make choices. If we wanted Discovery to be up 5% or 6% last year, we could've done it. We opted not to do certain programming that we thought would do well in the U.S. but wouldn't play well outside the U.S. And so our sharing ratio is up to 85, which makes us more efficient and the scripted programming that we'll do -- and Rich has one scripted series that we think is going to be very strong around the world."

We wanted for investors to clarify and simplify kind of how we look at the business. Obviously, the studio business is very different from the networks business. So as we've invested in IP, as we've grown our presence in the studio business, we wanted to separate that and have it clarified so that the U.S. Networks, International Networks were truly stand-alone. 
So within this new segment called Education and studios, we do expect for 2015 Education to have a slightly lower OIBDA than it had in 2014, as we invest in a longer-cycle Techbook. And also, we expect Studios to have a continued loss profile as again, we build that asset and own more and more global IP. 
So think in terms of that segment -- well, understand the OIBDA was meaningfully down in the fourth quarter, driven by, again, investment in assets, particularly long-cycle Techbook as well as studio IP. And we expect in '15 again, that to be roughly breakeven OIBDA for that segment."

Look, on the international rights that we're acquiring, one of the advantages that I think we have with Eurosport, we reach 130 million homes with our Eurosport Pan-European feed. And then we have another 2 to 3 channels in 55 countries across Eastern and Western Europe. 
Unlike the U.S., where it's football, baseball and basketball, which are very popular and if you're in sports, you have to have those 3. The equivalent of that would be soccer. But aside from soccer, there are affinity sports that are very popular in some regions and not so popular in others. So we've been able to pick up sports rights, I think, for very good -- very, very good values. 
Now we're investing because we think having those rights will build our over-the-top service, where we make almost $100 a subscriber. We also see that we don't -- when we look at Eurosport, we look at it as, how does it build our whole package? So we might have 3 sport channels, but then we have another 10 channels. And we have integrated on distribution and on the ad sales side with very little incremental costs, because we already have local teams in place. And we're finding that the ability to go to the distributor with all of it will get us more value. And so you might see Eurosport's margins dropping as it's broken out individually, but the overall package of international will be rising and we think will accelerate. Because having these must-have rights together with our 10 channels -- where in almost every market, Discovery's the #1 channel for men, we have women's channels, will give us more strength. 
In addition, we are going to be careful. We looked at Formula 1 and we liked the idea of Formula 1 because it's popular in 220 of our 230 countries. But the valuation was just way too high. So we walked away.

I think over time, things can flip the other way, where it's working for us. But we're continuing to drive our market share, and we're being helped by the fact that others are walking away. 
We also have conviction in Russia. We have a big business there. We have great brands and there is some challenges in terms of the politics.

But there's been a lot of interest in our brands and our content and getting us value for that. And there's also been some green shoots around Putin looking again at pay-TV. So for us, we think Russia is a long-term growth market. There's certainly a lot of turbulence there, but our cost of content is very low. We have a huge amount of content in Russian language that's already and relationships. So while others are saying, ""Let's invest less internationally and let's walk away from Russia,"" we're staying in Russia. And we're continuing to push very hard on international, where we see not only great growth, but a lot of what we've talked about in terms of what's facing the U.S. market, the slowing behavioral changes in the way content is consumed.

Nancy Dubuc, CEO of A+E, recently lamented the lack of creativity and risk taking. She's been seen in the nonfiction genre the last couple of years, and so a pretty sort of core genre for you. I'm curious, David, would you agree with that characterization? And whether you agree or disagree, can you walk us through how the market for nonfiction has been changing over time in your view? 
And Andy, I'm not very good at math, so I just wanted to make I'm doing the guidance correctly. Is the $1.82 to $1.91 sort of basically the EPS after FX impact range? You're giving us FX impact about $0.16. Am I doing that math right?"

I think in history, she's doing a very nice job for them and she's a great programmer. 
I would say that I somewhat disagree. I think the risk taking has been too much. We're actually going in the other direction. 
If you look at what's happened to nonfiction, you see the aggressiveness of picking really kind of wacky characters of -- it's almost become scripted in the way that it's presented. And I think the audience here in America gets it. They get that this isn't really nonfiction. That some of these fights aren't real. That some of these characters aren't real. 
And so what's really been working for us is, forget about what everyone else is doing, which is looking for more extreme characters, more extreme contention, to get back to basics. And we've actually made a strategic decision to do that and it's working for us. If you look at Treehouse Masters, no one's throwing mud at each other in Treehouse Masters. 
This past Tuesday night, we did 19 and Counting. We're the #1 network in America for women, and we have got a 2 6 in the demo. And what is it about? It's about a family that homeschools their kids. And we followed it with another very wholesome family that's struggling with the issues that everyone in America's struggling with. 
And so for us, whether it's Alaskan Bush, Gold Rush, Last Frontier, 19 Kids and Counting, Treehouse Masters, we think that a lot of the nonfiction challenge has been going into this extreme area. We're getting back to great characters, heroic characters that are doing jobs, that are facing challenges, that all of us, as we sit on the couch, look at and admire. That's what -- that's why people love Gold Rush. That's why they still, after 11 seasons, love Deadliest Catch. Last Frontier and Bush are about families living off the grid. And so I think that nonfiction is working very well for us, and we have to remember what we do best, which is great authentic characters that are fighting the fight to live, to make the best of their lives. And when we do that, we do very well."

Volume is better now but we're just not prepared to give guidance to say that volume is going to continue at this level and accelerate. So I think your guess is as good as ours. 
On the upfront, that was really a decision that was driven by Joe Abruzzese and the team. We looked at who's been coming to the upfront over the last couple of years, and then we looked who comes to the -- a number of the dinners that we do around that time. And we find that the more senior players are coming to the dinners and that we weren't getting the real -- the buyers that are making a difference in the upfront. So we're going to have a lot of the same material. We're going to have the same sell, but we're going to do it in small teams going directly to the buyers and the agencies. And we think this -- that, that could be more effective. We'll assess how it goes. It was really Joe feeling that going to the offices of the actual buyers will be stronger, getting directly to the buyers themselves."

Part of the commentary around '15 is, while we're going to be consolidating the full year, we do expect the margins on Eurosport stand-alone to go from high teen to high single digits. 
But one thing David talked about was, it's less relevant, I think, today more than ever to look at Eurosport by itself because of the overall leverage we're getting across the whole international portfolio. So I think as we talk about Eurosport, it's got to be on the holistic view versus just Eurosport itself, because so much of the benefits we're deriving are outside the 4 walls of just Eurosport performance."

And part of it also has to do with the marketplace. 
In -- aside from just Russia, we saw strength across Eastern and Western Europe. We saw a lot of strength in Latin America. And for the first time in the fourth quarter, Asia was not double digit where it's been, but it's been mostly made up for the fact that Brazil has been exploding. 
One of the things that we're seeing in Latin America is how important Brazil is to us. Advertising revenue, up almost 50% last year in Brazil, and in the first quarter, we're seeing -- even though it's lapping, similar. So the fact that it's gotten to 30% penetration in Brazil, that's kind of triggered the advertising marketplace to start spending more time there. 
So I think we're losing -- we lost Russia. We picked up a lot in Brazil. And the rest of the marketplace is pretty strong, with the exception of Asia."

To your point, we said that advertising will be better than the fourth quarter result. So call it in line or maybe a little lower than we had for the full year U.S. in 2014. We said we've seen acceleration of U.S. affiliate, because the deals that we successfully gotten done as well as the inclusion of Sony.

So anybody that watches anything, whether you're watching in a bar or you're watching at your vacation house, whether you're watching on your iPad, it counts. And viewership on -- in Norway is up 15%. Before they implemented last year this new system, it showed that viewership on television was down double digit. And it was a huge swing. 
We're working with Nielsen, all the programmers are. The problem is it's a monopoly here in the U.S. it's a real -- it is a real challenge and there's no question that it's under-measuring, but it's the system that we have.

But we have 2 to 3 other sports channels that we're getting paid on. They're in basic. And so when we buy the hockey rights, we now have a hockey -- a regional hockey channel in -- that we have launched in Sweden. And so it wasn't very expensive. And we've seen the value of the regional sports networks here in the U.S. with the YES Network -- the YES Network been more valuable than the Yankees themselves. And so we see the playbook. The cost of a lot of this content, when we can pick up affinity sports, is not that high. We already have the channels. We won't have these, what we're calling a regional sports networks in every country. But the ability to pick up rights and just flip a switch and have a Pan-European Eurosport, our 10 channels and then, boom, we got a hockey channel.

Discovery was founded 30 years ago with a mission to satisfy curiosity, ignite minds and educate and entertain viewers. Our purpose-driven approach continues to drive our global content engine today. It sets us apart from our peers and propels our sustained ability to produce strong results over the long term.
Nowhere is that more clear than on our flagship Discovery Channel which kicked of its 30th year on the air stronger than ever and has been resurgent from the second half of last year. Discovery had its best quarter ever in prime in the target demo and its total viewers in the U.S. were a double-digit increase over a year ago.
Rich Ross took over as President in January and is off to a fantastic start. While much of his creative vision won't hit the air until the third and fourth quarters, Rich has already put forward and delivered results on a plan to diversify Discovery's audience, attracting more women, millennials and co- viewing while continuing to nourish our core male audience and passionate super fans.
For the quarter, Gold Rush was the #1 unscripted show on cable with all male demos and the #7 with women 25 to 54. And new hit series, Alaskan Bush People, was the #2 unscripted show among men 25 to 54 on cable and was in the top 10 for women 25 to 54.
Both series made Discovery #1 in all of cable on Friday nights, among all demos, total viewers and households and proved as a real opportunity to expand our audience mix on the network. In addition, for the quarter, Discovery was the #1 network on all of cable for men 18 to 34, which is a huge accomplishment. And this quarter, we continue to lead as the #1 network in most weeks.
Discovery's programming success in the quarter wasn't just the U.S. phenomena. Many of our top U.S. shows are hits around the globe. Discovery Channel's average international audience rose more than 5% last quarter with Gold Rush replicating its U.S. success, it is 1 of our top international series. And Fast N' Loud and Misfit Garage are also off to strong starts overseas so far this quarter.
Other wins included TLC's 19 Kids and Counting which has recently made TLC the #1 network for women on Tuesday night. The network's family-oriented characters have become pop-culture magnets and continue to resonate and nourish super fans across middle America and abroad. In international markets, TLC's average audience rose 26% due to  strong gains in the Netherlands and from successful launches in Germany last year and Hungary this quarter.
In the U.S., our juggernaut ID posted its best quarter ever in prime and total day among total viewers and was a top 3 ad-supported cable network with women 25 to 54 in total day, fueled by ID super fans who watched the network for much longer than any other channel on cable. ID's launch last late last year in India led to another impressive quarter of viewership gains internationally. The network's rapid global ascent is simply stunning.
For the first 4 months of the year, Discovery's domestic portfolio has outperformed the market with particularly strong ratings in the month of April where we were up against an industry that was down mid-single digit.
Turning to the advertising market. We were very pleased with our upfront presentations over the past couple of months. After talking with clients and agencies last year, we decided to change our upfront presentation strategy in 2015 to a series of up close and personal in-agency meetings in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. It was a departure from the traditional stage presentation format and the response has been enthusiastic from top agencies because we were able to get more senior and more robust attendance and engagement at their offices.
In addition, there's been strong client response in these key sales markets. While its certainly too early to make predictions on the upfront, we feel confident that we articulated our content and sales strategy in the right agencies and clients in an effective and efficient manner. And with leading growth metrics on our channels, and strong on-brand networks, we believe we are well positioned across our portfolio heading into this year's market.
In the first quarter, we saw a nice acceleration from the fourth quarter with total U.S. ad sales up 400 basis points to 1%. Current trends seem relatively steady to slightly up. Pricing is healthy but delivery and demand remain a little improved but still a bit challenged. Overall in our projections, since we don't have visibility, we continue to expect the advertising market to remain tepid for the remainder of the year in our numbers.
In terms of distribution. The deals we signed late last year in the U.S. all recognize the full value of our content having grown from 7% of viewership on cable 6 years ago to more than 12% of viewership on cable today, underscoring the strong affiliate growth we experienced this quarter of 8%.
I would note our Time Warner Cable rates we renegotiated at end of 2013 will be preserved now that they will not be merging with Comcast. However, as has been previously disclosed by Comcast, our renewal with them is upcoming. Like all of the deals we negotiated over the past several years, we remain optimistic that Comcast and Discovery will be able to resolve a renewal that is fair and valuable for both companies.
The U.S. market remains a strong cash flow business for us and we'll manage costs appropriately to maintain our industry-leading margins. Outside the U.S., our international business remains a focus and a growth engine.
Beyond our homegrown brands in the U.S., our newest contributor to our international business is Eurosport. At the end of the month, we will reach the 1 year mark of taking control of Eurosport. We named a new CEO of Eurosport, sports veteran Peter Hutton, who started in March and has moved quickly to pursue  new strategic rights that create new value on a local level and strengthen existing rights with additional exclusivities and more comprehensive coverage. The goal is to build at least 2 strong sports channels in every market by utilizing the Discovery model of sharing rights across channels and markets to drive investment efficiency and audience engagement. Simply put, we buy rights in 3 ways: Pan-regional, like our deal for U.S. Major League Soccer rights for Europe to put on the broad platform which reaches just about 130 million homes across 55 countries in Europe and was the largest deal for the MLS outside the U.S.; two, would be multi market deals like MotoGP for Germany and Benelux; the three, would be just local rights like National Hockey rights in Sweden, and the recently announced Champions League Games airing in Singapore, which illustrates our commitment to strengthening our sports offering across Asia-Pacific.  
In the case of the MotoGP, it is a major driver of our initial localization strategy in Germany which improved ratings by 22% during the first quarter. We also just acquired exclusive German TV and digital rights for England's prestigious FA Cup Soccer. In the U.K., we won the rights for 5 more tennis tournaments for British Eurosport. And in France, we successfully bid on key local rugby rights, both of which feed the appetites of passionate local fans.
All in all, more than 30 sports rights and IP deals in the last 6 months, and we still expect Eurosport to have high single digit margins this year. Along with focused investments in key sports rights, we are bolstering Eurosport's production values and on-air talent to give the channels a new personality and build excitement and audiences. We recently announced the global tennis icon, Chris Ebbert, will provide expert analysis and commentary for the French Open starring in a new show, Tennis Forever, along with Matt [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] who will be commentating and providing content in Paris.
Regarding our broader IP investments. We also are very pleased with the progress at All3Media, our joint venture with Liberty Global. Just last month, All3Media acquired one of the U.K.'s most respected, independent scripted production companies. Sam Mendes, Niel Street Productions, creators of the hip PVC series called the Midwife and Penny Dreadful for Showtime. The acquisition adds to our growing stable of creative worldwide producers and expands our ownership of valuable global IP. 
With an average of more than 10 channels, in more than 220 countries, nearly 3 billion cumulative worldwide subscribers, we are pushing hard to expand our unmatched network on linear and digital platforms.
Internationally, we again achieved new record reach and market share gains. And we had 10% average audience growth across our entire global portfolio in the quarter, 10%. Our audience and share gains were led by our pay-TV channels in India, Brazil and Mexico, each of which just recorded their best quarter ever for Discovery Channel. 
Our free-to-air strategy is also paying dividends with our portfolio growing to an average audience of nearly 700,000 led by Discovery MAX in Spain, which grew audience by over 21% during the first quarter. And we're seeing some real recovery in Spain which is providing real value.
In the U.S. and internationally, we are leveraging our content and brands on new distribution platforms around the world as the ecosystem evolves. This strategy can also be summarized in a new mantra I've recently shared with our leadership team, maximize linear while aggressively attacking digital around the world. 
Owning our content has been a key differentiator for Discovery for 30 years. It allows us to be platform-ready and flexible in how we reach consumers as viewing habits change. Our recent affiliate deals have all included TV Everywhere rights. We are eager to work with our distribution partners to maximize the potential of this powerful nonlinear platform as its a win for operators, programmers and consumers. We'll continue to do our part to develop this platform in the months to come.
Ultimately, we remain platform-agnostic as long as we received the economics our content deserves. We're also aggressively pursuing new distribution platforms as the market evolves. Our content is valuable and our new deals with Hulu and Sony's new PlayStation Vue recognize that value.
In Europe, Discovery's leadership and market share are providing us a unique opportunity to launch new OTT products with the type of diverse must-have content that consumers love. Outside the U.S., we have 2 direct-to-consumer products, Dplay in select markets across Europe, and the Eurosport Player now available in 54 countries across Europe.
I believe Discovery is holding a great hand as we have for the past 30 years by creating big brands, compelling stories and characters and taking them around the world. We're focused on continuing to grow market share which translates into real economics, launching new channels and extending our reach into new markets and maybe most importantly, new platforms. And we're committed to our long-term strategy of investing in content, formats and IP. This is a strong start to the year and we're making great progress toward delivering increased value to shareholders in 2015 and the years ahead. 
Finally, I'm excited to announce that we will host our first-ever Discovery Investor Day in New York City on September 29? We will send details over the next couple of months and look forward to sharing with you an in-depth look at our global business and strategy. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to detail our strong first quarter financial results. Thanks so much."
22666093,286426557,803361,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, we were excited that Discovery is off to a very solid hard to 2015. On a reported basis, total company first quarter revenues increased 9% and adjusted OIBDA increased 8%. A",2040,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, we were excited that Discovery is off to a very solid hard to 2015. On a reported basis, total company first quarter revenues increased 9% and adjusted OIBDA increased 8%. As expected, given our increasingly international business mix, the continued strengthening of the dollar remained a major headwind and changes in currency rates reduced our reported revenue growth by 8% and reduced our adjusted OIBDA growth by 6%. Excluding currency, revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up an impressive 17% and 14%, respectively. 
On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as contributions from Eurosport and Discovery Family which have not yet been fully locked, total company revenues grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA grew 11% as revenue growth outpaced cost growth by 200 basis points. Our strong successful cost discipline led the total company margins on an organic basis of 39%, up 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2014.
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $250 million was up 9% from the first quarter a year ago primarily driven by the strong operating performance in the current year and an $11 million year-over-year improvement in mark-to-market equity-based compensation partially offset by a $12 million decline in equity earnings, $8 million of higher interest expense and $6 million of higher restructuring cost. As expected, equity earnings declined as positive first quarter earnings at OWN and other nonconsolidated investments were partially offset by losses from our 50% stake in All3Media related to below the line items.
We also lowered our effective tax rate another 200 basis points from the full year 2014 rate to 33% this quarter as we remain extremely focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates. We still expect our effective tax rate to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017 which will drive net income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth.
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.37, 12% above the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share or more relevant metric from a comparability perspective, it excludes the impact from acquisition related noncash amortization of intangible assets was $0.42, an 11% improvement versus Q1 2014. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 17% for the quarter. For the last 12 months, adjusted EPS was $1.89, or 12% over the prior 12 months. 
Free cash flow in the first quarter declined to $29 million as the strong operating performance and lower stock-based compensation were offset by timing of tax payments which increased approximately $180 million versus last year as well as by higher content payments. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low-single digits versus 2014 but cash tax payments will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year and will significantly subside in the second half. 
Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks grew revenues 6% led by positive advertising revenue growth of 1% and a very impressive 13% increase in distribution revenues. Our advertising revenue growth was due to higher pricing offsetting lower delivery. Delivery did improve slightly from Q4 led by the flagship Discovery Network but were still down mid-single digits versus the first quarter of last year. As David mentioned, domestic ad trends, however, remained relatively steady to slightly better since we last reported or we still have a muted view of full year advertising growth.
Our full year ad sales outcome will ultimately depend upon a variety of factors. The most important being, our network ratings performance. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, were up 8%, a 200 basis points improvement from the 6% organic growth rate in 2014, as we benefited from the higher rates regarded from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 as well as from contributions from our new Hulu deal, which started on January 1 of this year.
As a reminder, unlike our prior SVOD deals, the revenue recognition for Hulu will be relatively smooth over the life of the contract and therefore not significant to any one quarter. So we will no longer be breaking out our digital licensing revenues separately.
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 2% on a reported basis but were down 2% excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. Excluding Family, cost of revenues were up 5% while SG&A declined 11% in large part due to higher marketing spend on Klondike last year. 
Our focus on controlling costs led to domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 10% on a reported basis versus last year's first quarter and 6% excluding Family. And margins on a reported basis and excluding Family both expanded by almost 200 basis points year-over-year to 57%.
Now reviewing international operations. Our international division delivered another quarter of strong results. On a reported basis, revenues grew 10% and reported adjusted OIBDA declined 2%. Excluding currency, revenues increased 27% and adjusted OIBDA increased 11% as changes in FX rates reduced revenue growth by 17% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 13% as the strengthening dollar remains a major headwind.
On an organic basis, which excludes currency as well as the Eurosport acquisition, revenues and adjusted OIBDA increased 9% and 11%, respectively. For comparability purposes, our following international comments will refer to our organic results only. So it excludes the impact of Eurosport and foreign exchange.
The 9% first quarter revenue growth was led by 12% advertising growth and 6% distribution growth. Our advertising growth was broad based as our industry leading global distribution platform and IP enabled us to benefit from the continued growth in global pay-TV subscribers while simultaneously taking share and increasing pricing at our existing networks while further rolling out our global TLC, ID and Velocity brands to more and more markets around the world.
Excluding Russia, all regions except Asia saw double-digit ad growth increases led by the continued success of our free-to-air initiatives across Europe and by Latin America driven by increased volume in Brazil and Mexico. While organic advertising growth is expected to moderate in the second quarter due to tough comps as well as elections here in the U.K., we still expect full year organic advertising growth to be in the low double-digit range.
On the affiliate front. The 6% affiliate revenue increase in the quarter was driven primarily by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rates and the continued expansion of pay-television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. [indiscernible] also had solid growth as despite the renegotiations of deals in Russia and some recent contract terminations in the Ukrainian, we benefited from continued growth in Germany and across southeastern Europe. Due to the Ukraine terminations plus a pivot to a dual pay free-to-air strategy in certain Eastern European markets, similar to the strategy that has been very successful for us in Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K., we now expect organic affiliate growth each quarter this year to be in the mid- to high single digit range.
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 8% in the first quarter primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we further localize our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% and international organic margins expanded fully 100 basis points to 34%.
Taking a look at our overall financial position. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of $370 [ph] million worth of shares. We have now spent over $6 billion in buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by 29% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our shares very attractive.
As we stated on our last year end call, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating as we still expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of available capital for full year 2015 to fund both share repurchasesas as well as to fund any additional M&A strategic investments, including the potential TF1 put for the remaining 49% in Eurosport. As a reminder, the first of their 2 put windows for TF1 will occur this summer from July to September with the second window next summer during the same period. 
Turning to our full year guidance excluding currency, we still expect full year 2015 revenues will grow in the high single to low double-digit range. Adjusted OIBDA will grow in the mid-to low-single digit range and adjusted EPS will grow in the high single to low double-digit range. Growth will be driven by solid operating performance and a lower tax rate, partially offset by approximately $10 million of higher interest expense. We are reiterating our guidance despite our new news that we are selling the noncore SBS radio assets as this will be mostly offset the positive financial impact from Time Warner Cable, not being acquired by Comcast.
Additionally, note that this guidance has always included results from consolidating Eurosport France from the second quarter through year end. As that deal closed as expected and the guidance also still includes the $50 million negative impact from Russia.
I will also highlight again the revenue growth this quarter will outpace adjusted OIBDA growth mostly due to increased content spend at Eurosport as we look to further bolster our investments in sports rights in the near-term in order to fully maximize the growth potential of the asset in the medium and long-term.
Eurosport had no OIBDA margin in the first quarter due to their first quarter being the seasonally lowest advertising quarter as there are far fewer sporting events aired in the first few months of the year. We still expect though that full year Eurosport margins will be in the high single digit range. As David highlighted, we remain extremely bullish on the prospects of the Eurosport and expect to increase investments in sports rights to pay off both Eurosport and as well as across our international portfolio.
In addition, while first quarter total company growth rates excluding currency were above the rates we guided to for the full year, we remind investors that top line growth excluding currency was always expected to peak in Q1 primarily due to the timing of the Eurosport transaction last year which will begin to be lapped at the end of May, also cost comparisons get tougher as the year progresses.
Before we move on to Q&A, I do want update the expected foreign currency impact on our 2015 results. Given that the dollar has further strengthened since we gave guidance in our year-end call this past February. While have successfully hedged out a portion of our currency exposures and did realize gains in these hedges in the first quarter, we only hedge about 60% of our transactional exposures. We also do not hedge translational exposures as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Therefore, net of our hedging strategy at current spot rates, FX is now expected to reduce our constant currency guided revenue by $425 million or roughly 6% and adjusted OIBDA still by $150 million, also roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results.
Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures. The revenue mix in 2015 is expected to be around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be around 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short to British pound as our international headquarters are in London.
Lastly, as previously stated, we reiterate our guidance of reported free cash flow growth of low-single digits for 2015 as we still expect significant growth and operating cash flow to be partially offset by higher full year cash taxes due to prior year timing benefits related to Section 181. We do expect cash taxes is 2016 to decline significantly as the cash tax deferral effect of 181 subsides.
Thanks again for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you might have."

First, I would say broadly, we've reflected a strategy which we started about a year ago, which is to get back to the core brands. And I think that's really working for us. I think there was some brand drift across the industry. There was some brand drift across our platforms. And in order to have our content working stronger here in the U.S., having more valued advertisers and working in a much more compelling way around the world, we got rid of some of the program that wasn't on-brand. So you really see that difference on Science, you see it on Discovery, which has been 2 of the bigger drivers, having Discovery now as the #1 network for men 18 to 49 for the majority this year and having that kind of leadership and having that content work around the world is a big deal for us. And it goes to everyone of our channels that we really focus on what's the brand, how do we deliver on it. I think that works also not only for around the world and in U.S. but we own all of that IP and as this transitions to people want to be curated for the content they want. People know when they go to Animal Planet or they go to Science or they go to Discovery, or TLC or the Oprah Winfrey Network, that they see content on brand. It reinforces the viewership. I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing gaines. Quarter-to-date we're either up 1% or relatively flat against the market that's down 7% or 8%. And in April, we're seeing better trends. So I think, that pivot to being on-brand is helping us. Our GMs are really focused on using our 12% to 13% viewership on cable to promote between channels, which we think is much more effective. We did these in Latin America where we actually curate and let people know across our channels what's coming up. You are watching Discovery in Brazil and I'll tell you what's coming up on Science, what's coming up on Animal Planet, what's coming up on our car channel, and that had a real value for us. So we're starting to take that around the world. On the advertising side, I do think that with our ratings momentum that we have and the brand strength, that if the volume is there that we could do -- that we can continue to accelerate a differential. The question on the advertising side is, will the volume be there? As we have said for our projections for the year, we're assuming it stays tepid. It's been slightly better. We have been able to take advantage of it to some extent. But if there was more volume, we would have a much more robust quarter because we have the inventory, we have the strength, we have very attractive demographics. And so we're not getting excited, we can't see really what's happening in the upfront yet although we sold about 30% of the upfront so far. And we're staying conservative."

But the ecosystem at least for the next few years I believe will stay together in terms of the overall majority. For most of our channels, we have contractual agreements, long-term agreements that require 90%, 85%, 95% that our channels be provided. So the ability to just determine to offer a smaller bundle I just don't see that as likely given the contractual obligations across the industry. Having said that, since we own all of our content, to the extent that others want to pick the best channels and make those available domestically and around the world or even take content outside of channels and offer them, that's more dollars for us and more opportunity. In the longer term, I think it's important for us to continue to keep the existing ecosystem, which is very favorable to us. And as we transition to fight for the right kind of economics like platforms like TV Everywhere. So I think that you will see at the margins, if you look at what Charlie's doing, it's starting, it's growing small but there are certain gates on that in terms of its ability to be marketed to only subscribers that don't have cable. I think the Apple platform is interesting and all these things are good if you own all of your content and you have content that people really want. And that's way we've been really focusing hard on our super fans, talking who loves Discovery, Science, Oprah, Animal Planet, ID. Having really strong brands that people love that we can curate to is more important. I think we got out early on that and we will continue to take advantage of that."

So I think we are quite attractive with Discovery as the #1 network and TLC is #1 in many of the markets in Middle America. And as we said, of the affinity channels we have like Oprah and Science, we had conversations and negotiations. I am going to see Niel later after this call, I'm headed to Chicago. I saw Niel on Saturday night and so I think that it's business as usual now. Comcast is a great company. They're going to look to create a deal that's fair for them and so will we hear can we have plenty of time and we're very hopeful they will get something done. I know they are too."

These are long cycle lease deals and they take some time. What you have seen in the short-term is given the geopolitical issues you see in the Ukraine, which is as we all know what's happened there, we took a one-time only hit there because it's affected the cable market. And in one Andy mentioned said market, it's really 1 market in Eastern Europe and we'll announce in the next few weeks, which one it is. We've gone from a pay-only to pay and over-the-air. I think it's going to be quite effective for us, I think, it's going to be a good deal. It will generate more value for us. We're able to take this to market that doesn't have enough pay-TV. So that's a market that we are going free-to-air as well as pay. So and we think we'll get pretty meaningful incremental value out of that. Having said that, we look at still think that you'll see a Discovery high single and longer term, you will see some good affiliate growth as those deals come up as we have an ability to take advantage of scale. And the scale part of the scale is our market share growth. One of the key elements for our growth as a company has that been that we have been able to grow our market share outside the U.S. at it translates almost pretty efficiently to advertising revenue and we're getting a little getting better at advertising revenue so we're overdelivering. So the fact we were up 10% in market share around the world and then we were able to grow advertising 12% is really effective and it's driven by our channels getting stronger, a little bit more localization but also by the fact that we have real conviction across Eastern and Western Europe. We have conviction in Latin America and in Asia and a lot of the local players as the economies have gotten more challenging are spending less on content and allow the U.S. players are pulling out and spending is on content. And so we have seen an average mid-teen growth over the last 4 years and we expect that's going to continue. We have an awful lot of momentum on our growth. And so we remain very optimistic about our international business. We have between channels and free-to-air, as well as sports in Europe and leadership with kids in Latin America, very strong hand. We are seeing a slowdown in Asia. So I would say an acceleration in Latin America, continued strong performance in Eastern and Western Europe with a little bit of a hiccup from some geopolitical. And the overall market in Asia outside of India, a little bit slow that we were seeing double-digit growth there over the years and that's really flat now. Until but overall, I think our stories are intact or better. And we're aggregating a lot more IP under the covers. If not helping our market share in helping over brands around the world is better positioning us for the new world."

There were some markets where I think a lot of the hard work that we have done work will really pay off over the next couple of years. Some of the issues we see, the gestational slowing of the U.S. and the question of what business models will emerge and how quickly and how -- what will happen to bundling over the next 5 to 7 years? And outside the U.S. in a number of markets particularly Latin America and India, it's almost as if -- it feels a lot like the U.S. did 10 years ago and a lot of what we see here will take many, many years. Brazil for instance reached 30% cable penetration last year. As a result of that, we saw 40% or 50% advertising gains. Brazil is probably our strongest market we're the leader in kids, we're the #1 cable channel in all of Brazil, not just for kids. We have a channel called Home & Health which is like the Home and Garden of Latin America and that's the #3 channel for women down there or we have Discovery. So when you look at our 11 channels in Brazil, it's extremely strong, we have 5 of the top 15. And coming off of last year where was up 40% or 50%, we're seeing growth this year of another 40% to 50%. There's moment in a lot of these markets were all of a sudden what was just the AR stores to move over into advertising and the start to see the acceleration we saw here in the U.S. in '96, with '97, '98 and so Mexico and Brazil in particular I think are going to be engines that will really help us both gestationally but also in terms of revenue growth because we have such strong content down there."

And I think it's a philosophical long-term position for our company. We're still investing a lot in contents, we're investing in IP, we're seeing how do we position Discovery so that we have more viewers, we have better content and we have more strength 3 to 4 years from now than we do now. So you won't see us adding a lot of minutes to make a good quarter. We're going to focus much more on are we getting more people, enjoying spending time with our channels, are we building more characters and building more shows that could really work not just on linear but outside of linear. Right now, SVOD is relatively immaterial here in the U.S. Because we own all of our content and we have 30-year library. We have a fair amount of optionality. And depending on how the marketplace develops, there's a chance for us to do that, but that would be upside. And if there is a change in the marketplace and there are -- there is curation directly to consumers even if that content is not brand new, the ability to develop content, which we have looked at for instance on Science, developing a Science app, it's already converted into 48 languages. There has been some interest us we look to the marketplace for signs that there could be some interest in Animal Planet that we could offer much like you would see a Silicon Valley new media company, where we could offer some of those worldwide concepts like Science or Animal Planet, in an app around the world over-the-top with content is that given that [indiscernible] goods and the recent affinity group.

Because in a world where there's a lot of opportunity, you want the best stuff with the most people that are yearning for. The for us, it's all about the economics.

We opted not to do certain SVOD deals in the U.S. the customer didn't think the money were strong enough we thought would rather hold on to it ourselves and either do something personal directed to summarize something or sell directly to distributors. If we do something with existing distributors. So and every time there's a new player in the market, it's looking for content. It's if we as an industry can stay discipline about economics, and how that content is offered, it just reinforces the fact that, whether it's Apple, whether it's a Sony device,, whether it's cable distributed product or a satellite, or any new device, those are all essentially in the nicest way there [indiscernible]  device to a consumer but the consumer really wants to great bands, great characters, great stories that make those devices with those interfaces come alive.

When you look at our overall -- the revenue that we take from the marketplace, most of the money goes to sports and returns, and that's just we don't complain about it because that's the way it works. But if you looked at those players, they would have a percentage of viewership and the revenue would be a multiple some percentage significantly higher than that. In our case, we have 12% trending toward 13% of viewership and we have between 3%, 4% or 5% of the economics. So even when look at those existing platforms, not only are we attractive because our content has some leading edge to it and the demos that we deliver. But even if there is -- even if we get what looks like a great deal for us or very favorable deal, still compared with some of the other content that's out there, we're pretty good buy. And so I think that helps us in domestically and around the world that to be in the #1 channel in America 18 to 49 and look at our cost base versus some of the guys we compete with, including the sports guys, that's pretty compelling model and that's pretty much true in the majority of countries around the world that we are the #1 channel for men in nonfiction and in many of the countries where we launch over the air Turbo channels, the demo was even younger where we're really not 18 to 25 with the cars. So I think aggregating those audiences is going to be helpful and we tend to get much better deals with new players around the world. But it also is because our looks of our content compared to the sports guys is much more reasonable and they're scripted."

I'm pleased to report that Discovery is off to a strong start to the year. And despite facing a challenging U.S. marketplace and increasing currency headwinds, we continue to execute our long-term strategy of investing in marquee content, leveraging it across our unmatched distribution platforms around the world and driving operating momentum and strong financial results.
Discovery was founded 30 years ago with a mission to satisfy curiosity, ignite minds and educate and entertain viewers. Our purpose-driven approach continues to drive our global content engine today. It sets us apart from our peers and propels our sustained ability to produce strong results over the long term. Nowhere is that more clear than on our flagship Discovery Channel, which kicked of its 30th year on the air stronger than ever and has been resurgent from the second half of last year. Discovery had its best quarter ever in prime in the target demo, and its total viewers in the U.S. were a double-digit increase over a year ago.
Rich Ross took over as President in January and is off to a fantastic start. While much of his creative vision won't hit the air until the third and fourth quarters, Rich has already put forward and delivered results on a plan to diversify Discovery's audience, attracting more women, millennials and co-viewing, while continuing to nourish our core male audience and passionate super fans.
For the quarter, Gold Rush was the #1 unscripted show on cable with all male demos and the #7 with women 25 to 54. And new hit series, Alaskan Bush People, was the #2 unscripted show among men 25 to 54 on cable and was in the top 10 for women 25 to 54.  Both series made Discovery #1 in all of cable on Friday nights, among all demos, total viewers and households and proved as a real opportunity to expand our audience mix on the network. In addition, for the quarter, Discovery was the #1 network on all of cable for men 18 to 34, which is a huge accomplishment. And this quarter, we continue to lead as the #1 network in most weeks.
Discovery's programming success in the quarter wasn't just the U.S. phenomena. Many of our top U.S. shows are hits around the globe. Discovery Channel's average international audience rose more than 5% last quarter with Gold Rush replicating its U.S. success. It is one of our top international series. And Fast N' Loud and Misfit Garage are also off to strong starts overseas so far this quarter.
Other wins included TLC's 19 Kids and Counting, which has recently made TLC the #1 network for women on Tuesday night. The network's family-oriented characters have become pop-culture magnets and continue to resonate and nourish super fans across Middle America and abroad. In international markets, TLC's average audience rose 26% due to strong gains in the Netherlands and from successful launches in Germany last year and Hungary this quarter.
In the U.S., our juggernaut ID posted its best quarter ever in prime and total day among total viewers and was a top 3 ad-supported cable network with women 25 to 54 in total day, fueled by ID super fans, who watched the network for much longer than any other channel on cable. ID's launch last late last year in India led to another impressive quarter of viewership gains internationally. The network's rapid global ascent is simply stunning. For the first 4 months of the year, Discovery's domestic portfolio has outperformed the market with particularly strong ratings in the month of April where we were up against an industry that was down mid-single digit.
Turning to the advertising market. We were very pleased with our upfront presentations over the past couple of months. After talking with clients and agencies last year, we decided to change our upfront presentation strategy in 2015 to a series of up close and personal in-agency meetings in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. It was a departure from the traditional stage presentation format and the response has been enthusiastic from top agencies because we were able to get more senior and more robust attendance and engagement at their offices.
In addition, there's been strong client response in these key sales markets. While its certainly too early to make predictions on the upfront, we feel confident that we articulated our content and sales strategy in the right agencies and clients in an effective and efficient manner. And with leading growth metrics on our channels and strong on-brand networks, we believe we are well positioned across our portfolio heading into this year's market.
In the first quarter, we saw a nice acceleration from the fourth quarter with total U.S. ad sales up 400 basis points to 1%. Current trends seem relatively steady to slightly up. Pricing is healthy but delivery and demand remain a little improved but still the challenge. Overall in our projections, since we don't have visibility, we continue to expect the advertising market to remain tepid for the remainder of the year in our numbers.
In terms of distribution. The deals we signed late last year in the U.S. all recognize the full value of our content having grown from 7% of viewership on cable 6 years ago to more than 12% of viewership on cable today, underscoring the strong affiliate growth we experienced this quarter of 8%.
I would note, our Time Warner Cable rates we negotiated at the end of 2013 will be preserved now that they will not be merging with Comcast. However, as has been previously disclosed by Comcast, our renewal with them is upcoming. Like all other deals we negotiated over the past several years, we remain optimistic that Comcast and Discovery will be able to resolve a renewal that is fair and valuable for both companies.
The U.S. market remains a strong cash flow business for us, and we'll manage costs appropriately to maintain our industry-leading margins. Outside the U.S., our international business remains a focus and a growth engine. Beyond our homegrown brands in the U.S., our newest contributor to our international business is Eurosport. At the end of the month, we will reach the 1 year mark of taking control of Eurosport. We named a new CEO of Eurosport, sports veteran, Peter Hutton, who started in March and has moved quickly to pursue new strategic rights that create new value on a local level and strengthen existing rights with additional exclusivities and more comprehensive coverage. The goal is to build at least 2 strong sports channels in every market by utilizing the Discovery model of sharing rights across channels and markets to drive investment efficiency and audience engagement. Simply put, we buy rights in 3 ways: pan-regional, like our deal for U.S. Major League soccer rights for Europe to put on the broad platform which reaches about 130 million homes across 55 countries in Europe. And it was the largest deal for the MLS outside the U.S. Two, would be multi-market deals like MotoGP for Germany and Benelux. And three, would be just local rights like National Hockey rights in Sweden and the recently announced Champions League games airing in Singapore, which illustrates our commitment to strengthening our sports offering across Asia-Pacific.  
In the case of the MotoGP, it is a major driver of our initial localization strategy in Germany which improved ratings by 22% during the first quarter. We also just acquired exclusive German TV and digital rights for England's prestigious FA Cup soccer. In the U.K., we won the rights for 5 more tennis tournaments for British Eurosport. And in France, we successfully bid on key local rugby rights, both of which feed the appetites of passionate local fans.
All in all, more than 30 sports rights and IP deals in the last 6 months, and we still expect Eurosport to have high-single digit margins this year. Along with focused investments in key sports rights, we are bolstering Eurosport's production values and on-air talent to give the channels a new personality and build excitement and audiences. We recently announced the global tennis icon, Chris Evert, will provide expert analysis and commentary for the French Open starring in a new show, Tennis For Evert, along with Mats Wilander and [indiscernible] who will be commentating and providing content in Paris.
Regarding our broader IP investments. We also are very pleased with the progress at All3Media, our joint venture with Liberty Global. Just last month, All3Media acquired one of the U.K.'s most respected, independent scripted production companies, Sam Mendes' Neal Street Productions, creators of the hip BBC series called, the Midwife and Penny Dreadful for Showtime. The acquisition adds to our growing stable of creative worldwide producers and expands our ownership of valuable global IP. With an average of more than 10 channels in more than 220 countries, nearly 3 billion cumulative worldwide subscribers, we are pushing hard to expand our unmatched network on linear and digital platforms.
Internationally, we again achieved new record reach and market share gains. And we had 10% average audience growth across our entire global portfolio in the quarter, 10%. Our audience and share gains were led by our pay-TV channels in India, Brazil and Mexico, each of which just recorded their best quarter ever for Discovery Channel. 
Our free-to-air strategy is also paying dividends with our portfolio growing to an average audience of nearly 700,000 led by Discovery MAX in Spain, which grew audience by over 21% during the first quarter. And we're seeing some real recovery in Spain, which is providing real value.
In the U.S. and internationally, we are leveraging our content and brands on new distribution platforms around the world as the ecosystem evolves. This strategy can also be summarized in a new mantra I've recently shared with our leadership team, ""Maximize linear while aggressively attacking digital around the world."" 
Owning our content has been a key differentiator for Discovery for 30 years. It allows us to be platform-ready and flexible in how we reach consumers as viewing habits change. Our recent affiliate deals have all included TV Everywhere rights. We are eager to work with our distribution partners to maximize the potential of this powerful nonlinear platform as its a win for operators, programmers and consumers. We'll continue to do our part to develop this platform in the months to come.  Ultimately, we remain platform-agnostic as long as we receive the economics our content deserves. We're also aggressively pursuing new distribution platforms as the market evolves. Our content is valuable, and our new deals with Hulu and Sony's new PlayStation Vue recognize that value.
In Europe, Discovery's leadership and market share are providing us a unique opportunity to launch new OTT products with the type of diverse must-have content that consumers love. Outside the U.S., we have 2 direct-to-consumer products, Dplay in select markets across Europe, and the Eurosport Player now available in 54 countries across Europe.
I believe Discovery is holding a great hand as we have for the past 30 years by  creating big brands, compelling stories and characters and taking them around the world. We're focused on continuing to grow market share which translates into real economics, launching new channels and extending our reach into new markets and maybe most importantly, new platforms. And we're committed to our long-term strategy of investing in content, formats and IP. This is a strong start to the year, and we're making great progress toward delivering increased value to shareholders in 2015 and the years ahead. 
Finally, I'm excited to announce that we will host our first-ever Discovery Investor Day in New York City on September 29. We will send details over the next couple of months and look forward to sharing with you an in-depth look at our global business and strategy. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to detail our strong first quarter financial results. Thanks so much."
22666093,286426557,803783,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, we were excited that Discovery is off to a very solid start to 2015. On a reported basis, total company first quarter revenues increased 9%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 8",2041,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, we were excited that Discovery is off to a very solid start to 2015. 
On a reported basis, total company first quarter revenues increased 9%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 8%. As expected, given our increasingly international business mix, the continued strengthening of the dollar remained a major headwind and changes in currency rates reduced our reported revenue growth by 8% and reduced our adjusted OIBDA growth by 6%. Excluding currency, revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up an impressive 17% and 14%, respectively. 
On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as contributions from Eurosport and Discovery Family, which have not yet been fully lapped, total company revenues grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA grew 11%, as revenue growth outpaced cost growth by 200 basis points. Our strong and successful cost discipline led the total company margins on an organic basis of 39%, up 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2014.
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $250 million was up 9% from the first quarter a year ago primarily driven by the strong operating performance in the current year and an $11 million year-over-year improvement in mark-to-market equity-based compensation, partially offset by a $12 million decline in equity earnings, $8 million of higher interest expense and $6 million of higher restructuring cost. As expected, equity earnings declined as positive first quarter earnings at OWN and other nonconsolidated investments were partially offset by losses from our 50% stake in All3Media related to below-the-line items. We also lowered our effective tax rate, another 200 basis points from the full year 2014 rate to 33% this quarter as we remain extremely focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates. We still expect our effective tax rate to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017, which will drive net income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth.
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.37, 12% above the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share or more relevant metric from a comparability perspective, it excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets was $0.42, an 11% improvement versus Q1 2014.  Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 17% for the quarter. For the last 12 months, adjusted EPS was $1.89, up 12% over the prior 12 months. 
Free cash flow in the first quarter declined to $29 million as the strong operating performance and lower stock-based compensation were offset by timing of tax payments which increased approximately $180 million versus last year as well as by higher content payments. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low-single digits versus 2014 but cash tax payments will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year and will significantly subside in the second half. 
Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks grew revenues 6%, led by positive advertising revenue growth of 1% and a very impressive 13% increase in distribution revenues. Our advertising revenue growth was due to higher pricing offsetting lower delivery. Delivery did improve slightly from Q4 led by the flagship Discovery Network, but were still down mid-single digits versus the first quarter of last year. As David mentioned, domestic ad trends, however, remained relatively steady to slightly better since we last reported. And we still have a muted view of full year advertising growth. Our full year ad sales outcome will ultimately depend upon a variety of factors. The most important being, our network ratings performance. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, were up 8%, a 200 basis points improvement from the 6% organic growth rate in 2014, as we benefited from the higher rates regarded from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 as well as from contributions from our new Hulu deal, which started on January 1 of this year.
As a reminder, unlike our prior SVOD deals, the revenue recognition for Hulu will be relatively smooth over the life of the contract, and therefore, not as significant in any one quarter. So we will no longer be breaking out our digital licensing revenues separately.
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 2% on a reported basis, but were down 2% excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. Excluding Family, cost of revenues were up 5% while SG&A declined 11% in large part due to higher marketing spend on Klondike last year. Our focus on controlling costs led to domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 10% on a reported basis versus last year's first quarter and 6% excluding Family. And margins on a reported basis and excluding Family both expanded by almost 200 basis points year-over-year to 57%.
Now reviewing international operations. Our international division delivered another quarter of strong results. On a reported basis, revenues grew 10% and reported adjusted OIBDA declined 2%. Excluding currency, revenues increased 27% and adjusted OIBDA increased 11% as changes in FX rates reduced revenue growth by 17% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 13% as the strengthening dollar remains a major headwind.
On an organic basis, which excludes currency as well as the Eurosport acquisition, revenues and adjusted OIBDA increased 9% and 11%, respectively. For comparability purposes, our following international comments will refer to our organic results only. So it excludes the impact of Eurosport and foreign exchange. The 9% first quarter revenue growth was led by 12% advertising growth and 6% distribution growth. Our advertising growth was broad-based as our industry leading global distribution platform and IP enabled us to benefit from the continued growth in global pay-TV subscribers while simultaneously taking share and increasing pricing at our existing networks while further rolling out our global TLC, ID and Velocity brands to more and more markets around the world. Excluding Russia, all regions except Asia saw double-digit ad growth increases led by the continued success of our free-to-air initiatives across Europe and by Latin America driven by increased volume in Brazil and Mexico. While organic advertising growth is expected to moderate in the second quarter due to tough comps as well as elections this year in the U.K., we still expect full year organic advertising growth to be in the low double-digit range.
On the affiliate front. The 6% affiliate revenue increase in the quarter was driven primarily by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rates and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. [indiscernible] also had solid growth as despite the renegotiations of deals in Russia and some recent contract terminations in the Ukrain, we benefited from continued growth in Germany and across Southeastern Europe. Due to the Ukraine terminations plus a pivot to a dual-pay free-to-air strategy in certain Eastern European markets, similar to the strategy that has been very successful for us in Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K., we now expect organic affiliate growth each quarter this year to be in the mid  to high-single digit range.
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 8% in the first quarter primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we further localize our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 11%. And international organic margins expanded fully, 100 basis points to 34%.
Taking a look at our overall financial position. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of 370 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $6 billion in buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we've reduced our outstanding share count by 29% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our shares very attractive.
As we stated on our last year end call, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating as we still expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of available capital for full year 2015 to fund both share repurchases as well as to fund any additional M&A strategic investments, including the potential TF1 put for the remaining 49% in Eurosport. As a reminder, the first of their 2 put windows for TF1 will occur this summer from July to September with the second window next summer during the same period. 
Turning to our full year guidance excluding currency, we still expect full year 2015 revenues will grow in the high single to low double-digit range. Adjusted OIBDA will grow in the low to mid-single digit range, and adjusted EPS will grow in the high single to low double-digit range. Growth will be driven by solid operating performance and a lower tax rate, partially offset by approximately $10 million of higher interest expense. We are reiterating our guidance despite our new news that we are selling the noncore SBS radio assets as this will be mostly offset by the positive financial impact from Time Warner Cable, not being acquired by Comcast.  Additionally, note that this guidance has always included results from consolidating Eurosport France from the second quarter through year end. As that deal closed as expected and the guidance also still includes the $50 million negative impact from Russia.
I will also highlight again that revenue growth this quarter will outpace adjusted OIBDA growth mostly due to increased content spend at Eurosport as we look to further bolster our investments in sports rights in the near term in order to fully maximize the growth potential of the asset in the medium and long term.
Eurosport had no OIBDA margin in the first quarter due to their first quarter being the seasonally lowest advertising quarter as there are far fewer sporting events aired in the first few months of the year. We still expect though that full year Eurosport margins will be in the high-single digit range. As David highlighted, we remain extremely bullish on the prospects of the Eurosport and expect to increase investments in sports rights to pay off both Eurosport and as well as across our entire international portfolio.
In addition, while first quarter total company growth rates, excluding currency, were above the rates we guided to for the full year, we remind investors that top line growth excluding currency was always expected to peak in Q1 primarily due to the timing of the Eurosport transaction last year which will begin to be lapped at the end of May. Also cost comparisons get tougher as the year progresses.
Before we move on to Q&A, I do want update the expected foreign currency impact on our 2015 results. Given that the dollar has further strengthened since we gave guidance on our year end call this past February. While we have successfully hedged a portion of our currency exposures and did realize gains in these hedges in the first quarter, we only hedge about 60% of our transactional exposures. We also do not hedge translational exposures as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Therefore, net of our hedging strategy at current spot rates, FX is now expected to reduce our constant currency guided revenue by $425 million or roughly 6% and adjusted OIBDA still by $150 million, also roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results.
Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures. The revenue mix in 2015 is expected to be around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be around 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short to British pound as our international headquarters are in London.
Lastly, as previously stated, we reiterate our guidance of reported free cash flow growth of low-single digits  in 2015 as we still expect significant growth and operating cash flow to be partially offset by higher full year cash taxes due to prior year timing benefits related to Section 181. We do expect cash taxes in 2016 to decline significantly as the cash tax deferral effect of 181 subsides.
Thanks again for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

First, I would say broadly, we've affected a strategy which we started about a year ago, which is to get back to the core brands. And I think that's really working for us. I think there was some brand drift across the industry. There was some brand drift across our platforms. And in order to have our content working stronger here in the U.S., having more valued advertisers and working in a much more compelling way around the world, we got rid of some of the program, and it wasn't on brand. And so you really see that difference on Science, you see it on Discovery, which has been 2 of the bigger drivers, having Discovery now as the #1 network in America for men, 18 to 49, for the majority this year and having that kind of leadership. And having that content work around the world is a big deal for us. And it goes to everyone of our channels that we really focused on what is the brand, how do we deliver on it? And I think that works also, not only for around the world and in U.S. but we own all that IP. And as this transitions to people who want to be curated for the content they want, people knowing that when they go to Animal Planet or they go to Science or they go to Discovery or TLC or the Oprah Winfrey Network, that they see content on brand. It reinforces the viewership. I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing gains. Quarter-to-date, we're either up 1% or relatively flat against the market that's down 7% or 8%. And in April, we're seeing even better trends. So I think that pivot to being on-brand is really helping us. Our GMs are really focused on using our 12% to 13% viewership on cable to promote between channels, which we think is much more effective. We did this in Latin America where we actually curate and let people know across our channels what's coming up. You're watching Discovery in Brazil, and I'll tell you what's coming up on Science, what's coming up on Animal Planet, what's coming up on our car channel. And that had real value for us. So we're starting to take that around the world. On the advertising side, I do think that with our ratings momentum that we have and the brand strength, that if the volume is there that we could do -- that we can continue to accelerate a differential. The question on the advertising side is will the volume be there? As we've said for our projections for the year, we're assuming it stays tepid. It's been slightly better. We've been taking -- been able to take advantage of it to some extent. But if there was more volume, we would have had a much more robust quarter because we had the inventory, we had the strength. We had very attractive demographics. And so we're not getting excited, we can't see really what's happening in the upfront yet, although we've sold about 30% of the upfront so far. And we're staying conservative."

But the ecosystem, at least, for the next few years, I believe, will stay together in terms of the overall majority. For most of our channels, we have contractual agreements, long-term agreements that require 90%, 85%, 95% that our channels be provided. So the ability to just determine to offer a smaller bundle, I just don't see that as likely given the contractual obligations across the industry. Having said that, since we own  all of our content, to the extent that others want to pick the best channels and make those available domestically and around the world or even take content outside of channels and offer them, that's more dollars for us and more opportunity. In the longer term, I think it's important for us to continue to keep the existing ecosystem, which is very favorable to us. And as we transition to fight for the right kind of economics, like platforms like TV Everywhere. So I think that you'll see it at the margins. If you look at what Charlie's doing, it's starting, it's growing small. But there are certain gates on that in terms of its ability to be marketed to only subscribers that don't have cable. I think the Apple platform is interesting. And all these things are good if you own all of your content and you have content that people really want. And that's why we've been really focusing hard on our super fans, talking who loves Discovery Science, Oprah, Animal Planet, ID. Having really strong brands that people love that we can curate to is more important. I think we got out early on that, and we'll continue to take advantage of it."

The concerns that we raised, the concerns that we raised around the world, issues of what is consolidation due to content, what happens in terms of content investments, that's all behind us now. I think the goal for us and for Comcast is to find a deal that make sense for both of us. We've been able to do, over the last 3 years, over 180 deals that where we were happy, the distributors were happy. We represent between 12% and 13% of viewership on cable. And we still only represent between 4% and 5% of the economics. So I think we're quite attractive with Discovery as the #1 network, and TLC is #1 in many of the markets in Middle America. And as we've said, a lot of the affinity channels we have like Oprah and Science, we've had conversations and negotiations. I am going to see Neil later after this call, I'm headed to Chicago.

Look, I think that the fact that we have 10 traditional channels and 220 or 230 markets and now we have 2 to 3 sports channels across all of Europe, these are long-cycle lease deals, and they take some time. What you've seen in the short term is given the geopolitical issues in the Ukraine, which as we all know what's happened there, we took a onetime only hit there from -- because it's affected the cable market. And in one -- Andy mentioned said market. It's really 1 market in Eastern Europe, and we'll announce in the next few weeks which one it is. We've gone from a pay-only to pay and over-the-air. I think it's going to be quite effective for us. I think it's going to be a very good deal. It will generate more value for us. We're able to -- Turkey is a market that doesn't have enough pay-TV. So that's a market that we are going free-to-air as well as pay. And we think we'll get pretty meaningful incremental value out of that. Having said that, we look at -- we still think that you'll see a trend to high single. And longer term, you will see some good affiliate growth as those deals come up as we have an ability to take advantage of scale. And the scalest part of the scale is our market share growth. One of the key elements for our growth as a company has been that we've been able to grow our market share outside the U.S. And it translates almost pretty efficiently to advertising revenue. And we're getting a little better at advertising revenues, so we're overdelivering. So the fact that we were up 10% in market share around the world and then we were able to grow advertising 12% is really effective. And it's driven by our channels getting stronger, a little bit more localization, but also by the fact that we have real conviction across Eastern and Western Europe. We have conviction in Latin America and in Asia and a lot of the local players as the economies have gotten more challenging are spending less on content. And a lot of the U.S. players are pulling out and spending less on content. And so we've seen on average midteen growth over the last 4 years, and we expect that's going to continue. We have an awful lot of momentum on our growth. And so we remain very optimistic about our international business. We have between channels and free-to-air, as well as sports in Europe and leadership with kids in Latin America, very strong hand. We are seeing a slowdown in Asia. So I would say an acceleration in Latin America, continued strong performance in Eastern and Western Europe with a little bit of a hiccup from some geopolitical. And the overall market in Asia outside of India, a little bit slow that we were seeing double-digit growth there over the years. And that's really flattened now. But overall, I think our stories are intact or better. And we're aggregating a lot more IP under the covers. That's not only helping our market share and helping our brands around the world, but is better positioning us for the new world."

There were some markets where I think a lot of the hard work that we've done, will really pay off over the next couple of years. Some of the issues that we see, the gestational slowing of the U.S. and the question of what business models will emerge, and how quickly and how -- what will happen to bundling over the next 5 to 7 years? And outside the U.S. in a number of markets, particularly Latin America and India, it's almost as -- it feels a lot like the U.S. did 10 years ago. And a lot of what we see here will take many, many years. Brazil, for instance, reached 30% cable penetration last year. As a result of that, we saw 40% or 50% advertising gains. Brazil is probably our strongest market. We're the leader in kids. We're the #1 cable channel in all of Brazil, not just for kids. We have a channel called, Home & Health, which is like the Home and Garden of Latin America. And that's the #3 channel for women down there, and we have Discovery. So when you look at our 11 channels in Brazil, it's extremely strong. We have 5 of the top 15. And coming off of last year where it was up 40% or 50%, we're seeing growth this year of another 40% to 50%. And so there is this moment in a lot of these markets where all of a sudden what was just DR [ph] starts to move over into advertising. And you start to see the acceleration that we saw here in the U.S. in '96, '97, '98. And so Mexico and Brazil, in particular, I think are going to be engines that will really help us both gestationally, but also in terms of revenue growth because we have such strong content down there."

There's no question about it. We're significantly less than a lot of our peers. But we think the long-term brand value, that's important. And I think it's a philosophical long-term position for our company. We're still investing a lot in content, we're investing in IP. We're seeing how do we position Discovery so that we have more viewers, we have better content and we have more strength 3 to 4 years from now than we do now. So you won't see us adding a lot of minutes to make a good quarter. We're going to focus much more on, are we getting more people, enjoying spending time with our channels? Are we building more characters and building more shows that could really work, not just on linear but outside of linear. Right now, SVOD is relatively immaterial here in the U.S. Because we own all of our content, and we have a 30-year library. We have a fair amount of optionality. And depending on how the marketplace develops, there's a chance for us to do that, but that would be upside. And if there is a change in the marketplace and there are -- there is curation directly to consumers even if that content is not brand new. The ability to develop content, which we've looked at, for instance, on Science, developing a Science app. It's already converted into 48 languages. There has been some interest us we've look in for the marketplace. For Science, there could be some interest in Animal Planet that we could offer much like you would see a Silicon Valley new media company, where we could offer some of those worldwide concepts like Science or Animal Planet in an app around the world over-the-top with content that isn't even that fresh that could nourish an affinity group.

And then would you consider doing it at the old Apple TV that encompassed only, let's say, a few of your networks as opposed to all of them? And do you think that you'd include robust portion of that 30-year library that you've mentioned with VOD content from Discovery be a big piece of that sort of agreement?"

We don't -- we can't speak about any specific deal. We're really -- we are platform agnostic. But I think as the -- as there is some transition within the marketplace, the fact that we have -- that Discovery is stronger than it's ever been and it's the #1 channel for men 18 to 34 in America and we're winning a number of nights where we're even beating the broadcasters. The fact that TLC has real strength where we can be in a position where several nights a week in 40 of the middle states in America with the #1 cable network for women. And Oprah is -- and Tyler, Tyler's programming, when he goes on the air on OWN, we have over  20 share of the African-American community. And Oprah's programming is working so well on OWN. And ID is the most -- is the stickiest channel on cable. These more -- become more and more important when people can make choices about what shows they want and what channels to put on different platforms and how much they're going to pay for those channels. Because in a world where there's a lot of opportunity, you want the best stuff with the most people that are yearning for. The -- for us, it's all about the economics. We want to make sure we get the right economics for our programming. We opted not to do certain SVOD deals in the U.S. because we didn't think the money was strong enough. And we thought we'd rather hold on to it ourselves and either do something ourselves directly with consumers or do something with the existing to distributors. And every time there's a new player in the market that's looking for content, it's -- if we as an industry can stay disciplined about economics and how that content is offered, it just reinforces the fact that whether it's Apple, whether it's a Sony device, whether it's cable-distributed product or a satellite or any new device, those are all essentially, in the nicest way, they're a pipe or a device to a consumer. What the consumer really wants is great brands, great characters, great stories that make those devices with those interfaces come alive. And anybody that's going to curate is -- on any of those platforms, no one's going to buy it for the pipe of the platform. So our mission stays the same, but even more focused on the best content, the best brands. We'll make Discovery more successful in the future on every platform."

And they're offering, I think, a platform that's interesting, and we were rooting for them. We hope like they, every other platform out there, does well. I would say that when there's a new platform, if we have channels that have real leadership with affinity groups, and we're very strong particularly with young demos as we are across a lot of our portfolio, that it gives us a strong hand in those discussions. But again, we're coming off a small base. When you look at our overall -- the revenue that we take from the marketplace, most of the money goes to sports and retrans. And that's just -- we don't complain about it because that's the way it works. But if you looked -- if those players, they would have a percentage of viewership and then the revenue would be a multiple, some percentage significantly higher than that. In our case, we have 12% trending toward 13% of viewership. And we have between 3%, 4% or 5% of the economics. And so even when you look at those existing platforms, not only are we attractive because our content has some leading edge to it and the demos that we deliver. But even if there's-- even if we get what looks like a great deal for us or a very favorable deal, still compared with some of the other content that's out there, we're a pretty good buy. And so I think -- and I think that helps us in domestically and around the world that to be in the #1 channel in America, 18 to 49, and look at our cost base versus some of the guys that we compete with, including the sports guys, that's pretty compelling model. And that's pretty much true in the majority of countries around the world that we're the #1 channel for men in nonfiction. And in many of these countries where we've launched over-the-air Turbo channels, the demo was even younger. We're really in that 18 to 25 with the cars. So I think aggregating those audiences is going to be helpful. And we tend to get much better deals with new players around the world. But it also is because our looks of our content compared to the sports guys is much more reasonable. And it's scripted."

Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that Discovery is off to a strong start to the year.

I'm pleased to report that Discovery is off to a strong start to the year. And despite facing a challenging U.S. marketplace and increasing currency headwinds, we continue to execute our long-term strategy of investing in marquee content, leveraging it across our unmatched distribution platforms around the world and driving operating momentum and strong financial results.
Discovery was founded 30 years ago with a mission to satisfy curiosity, ignite minds and educate and entertain viewers. Our purpose-driven approach continues to drive our global content engine today. It sets us apart from our peers and propels our sustained ability to produce strong results over the long term. Nowhere is that more clear than on our flagship Discovery Channel, which kicked off its 30th year on the air stronger than ever and has been resurgent from the second half of last year. Discovery had its best quarter ever in prime in the target demo, and its total viewers in the U.S. saw a double-digit increase over a year ago.
Rich Ross took over as President in January and is off to a fantastic start. While much of his creative vision won't hit the air until the third and fourth quarters, Rich has already put forward and delivered results on a plan to diversify Discovery's audience, attracting more women, millennials and co-viewing, while continuing to nourish our core male audience and passionate super fans.
For the quarter, Gold Rush was the #1 unscripted show on cable with all male demos and the #7 with women 25 to 54. And new hit series, Alaskan Bush People, was the #2 unscripted show among men 25 to 54 on cable and was in the top 10 for women 25 to 54.  Both series made Discovery #1 in all of cable on Friday nights, among all demos, total viewers and households and proved as a real opportunity to expand our audience mix on the network. In addition, for the quarter, Discovery was the #1 network on all of cable for men 18 to 34, which is a huge accomplishment. And this quarter, we continue to lead as the #1 network in most weeks.
Discovery's programming success in the quarter wasn't just the U.S. phenomena. Many of our top U.S. shows are hits around the globe. Discovery Channel's average international audience rose more than 5% last quarter with Gold Rush replicating its U.S. success. It is one of our top international series. And Fast N' Loud and Misfit Garage are also off to strong starts overseas so far this quarter.
Other wins included TLC's 19 Kids and Counting, which has recently made TLC the #1 network for women on Tuesday night. The network's family-oriented characters have become pop-culture magnets and continue to resonate and nourish super fans across Middle America and abroad. In international markets, TLC's average audience rose 26% due to strong gains in the Netherlands and from successful launches in Germany last year and Hungary this quarter.
In the U.S., our juggernaut ID posted its best quarter ever in prime and total day among total viewers and was a top 3 ad-supported cable network with women 25 to 54 in total day, fueled by ID super fans, who watched the network for much longer than any other channel on cable. ID's launch last late last year in India led to another impressive quarter of viewership gains internationally. The network's rapid global ascent is simply stunning. For the first 4 months of the year, Discovery's domestic portfolio has outperformed the market with particularly strong ratings in the month of April where we were up against an industry that was down mid-single digit.
Turning to the advertising market. We were very pleased with our upfront presentations over the past couple of months. After talking with clients and agencies last year, we decided to change our upfront presentation strategy in 2015 to a series of up close and personal in-agency meetings in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. It was a departure from the traditional stage presentation format and the response has been enthusiastic from top agencies because we were able to get more senior and more robust attendance and engagement at their offices.
In addition, there's been strong client response in these key sales markets. While it's certainly too early to make predictions on the upfront, we feel confident that we articulated our content and sales strategy in the right agencies and clients in an effective and efficient manner. And with leading growth metrics on our channels and strong on-brand networks, we believe we are well positioned across our portfolio heading into this year's market.
In the first quarter, we saw a nice acceleration from the fourth quarter with total U.S. ad sales up 400 basis points to 1%. Current trends seem relatively steady to slightly up. Pricing is healthy but delivery and demand remain a little improved but still the challenge. Overall in our projections, since we don't have visibility, we continue to expect the advertising market to remain tepid for the remainder of the year in our numbers.
In terms of distribution. The deals we signed late last year in the U.S. all recognize the full value of our content having grown from 7% of viewership on cable 6 years ago to more than 12% of viewership on cable today, underscoring the strong affiliate growth we experienced this quarter of 8%.
I would note, our Time Warner Cable rates we negotiated at the end of 2013 will be preserved now that they will not be merging with Comcast. However, as has been previously disclosed by Comcast, our renewal with them is upcoming. Like all other deals we negotiated over the past several years, we remain optimistic that Comcast and Discovery will be able to resolve a renewal that is fair and valuable for both companies.
The U.S. market remains a strong cash flow business for us, and we'll manage costs appropriately to maintain our industry-leading margins. Outside the U.S., our international business remains a focus and a growth engine. Beyond our homegrown brands in the U.S., our newest contributor to our international business is Eurosport. At the end of the month, we will reach the 1 year mark of taking control of Eurosport. We named a new CEO of Eurosport, sports veteran, Peter Hutton, who started in March and has moved quickly to pursue new strategic rights that create new value on a local level and strengthen existing rights with additional exclusivities and more comprehensive coverage. The goal is to build at least 2 strong sports channels in every market by utilizing the Discovery model of sharing rights across channels and markets to drive investment efficiency and audience engagement. Simply put, we buy rights in 3 ways: pan-regional, like our deal for U.S. Major League soccer rights for Europe to put on the broad platform which reaches about 130 million homes across 55 countries in Europe. And it was the largest deal for the MLS outside the U.S. Two, would be multi-market deals like MotoGP for Germany and Benelux. And three, would be just local rights like National Hockey rights in Sweden and the recently announced Champions League games airing in Singapore, which illustrates our commitment to strengthening our sports offering across Asia-Pacific.  
In the case of the MotoGP, it is a major driver of our initial localization strategy in Germany which improved ratings by 22% during the first quarter. We also just acquired exclusive German TV and digital rights for England's prestigious FA Cup soccer. In the U.K., we won the rights for 5 more tennis tournaments for British Eurosport. And in France, we successfully bid on key local rugby rights, both of which feed the appetites of passionate local fans.
All in all, more than 30 sports rights and IP deals in the last 6 months, and we still expect Eurosport to have high-single digit margins this year. Along with focused investments in key sports rights, we are bolstering Eurosport's production values and on-air talent to give the channels a new personality and build excitement and audiences. We recently announced the global tennis icon, Chris Evert, will provide expert analysis and commentary for the French Open starring in a new show, Tennis For Evert, along with Mats Wilander and Henri Lecant [ph] who will be commentating and providing content in Paris.
Regarding our broader IP investments. We also are very pleased with the progress at All3Media, our joint venture with Liberty Global. Just last month, All3Media acquired one of the U.K.'s most respected, independent scripted production companies, Sam Mendes' Neal Street Productions, creators of the hip BBC series called, the Midwife and Penny Dreadful for Showtime. The acquisition adds to our growing stable of creative worldwide producers and expands our ownership of valuable global IP. With an average of more than 10 channels in more than 220 countries, nearly 3 billion cumulative worldwide subscribers, we are pushing hard to expand our unmatched network on linear and digital platforms.
Internationally, we again achieved new record reach and market share gains. And we had 10% average audience growth across our entire global portfolio in the quarter, 10%. Our audience and share gains were led by our pay-TV channels in India, Brazil and Mexico, each of which just recorded their best quarter ever for Discovery Channel. 
Our free-to-air strategy is also paying dividends with our portfolio growing to an average audience of nearly 700,000 led by Discovery MAX in Spain, which grew audience by over 21% during the first quarter. And we're seeing some real recovery in Spain, which is providing real value.
In the U.S. and internationally, we are leveraging our content and brands on new distribution platforms around the world as the ecosystem evolves. This strategy can also be summarized in a new mantra I've recently shared with our leadership team, ""Maximize linear while aggressively attacking digital around the world."" 
Owning our content has been a key differentiator for Discovery for 30 years. It allows us to be platform-ready and flexible in how we reach consumers as viewing habits change. Our recent affiliate deals have all included TV Everywhere rights. We are eager to work with our distribution partners to maximize the potential of this powerful nonlinear platform as its a win for operators, programmers and consumers. We'll continue to do our part to develop this platform in the months to come.  Ultimately, we remain platform-agnostic as long as we receive the economics our content deserves. We're also aggressively pursuing new distribution platforms as the market evolves. Our content is valuable, and our new deals with Hulu and Sony's new PlayStation Vue recognize that value.
In Europe, Discovery's leadership and market share are providing us a unique opportunity to launch new OTT products with the type of diverse must-have content that consumers love. Outside the U.S., we have 2 direct-to-consumer products, Dplay in select markets across Europe, and the Eurosport Player now available in 54 countries across Europe.
I believe Discovery is holding a great hand as we have for the past 30 years by  creating big brands, compelling stories and characters and taking them around the world. We're focused on continuing to grow market share which translates into real economics, launching new channels and extending our reach into new markets and maybe most importantly, new platforms. And we're committed to our long-term strategy of investing in content, formats and IP. This is a strong start to the year, and we're making great progress toward delivering increased value to shareholders in 2015 and the years ahead. 
Finally, I'm excited to announce that we will host our first-ever Discovery Investor Day in New York City on September 29. We will send details over the next couple of months and look forward to sharing with you an in-depth look at our global business and strategy. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to detail our strong first quarter financial results. Thanks so much."
22666093,286426557,804066,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, we were excited that Discovery is off to a very solid start to 2015. On a reported basis, total company first quarter revenues increased 9%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 8",2044,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, we were excited that Discovery is off to a very solid start to 2015. 
On a reported basis, total company first quarter revenues increased 9%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 8%. As expected, given our increasingly international business mix, the continued strengthening of the dollar remained a major headwind and changes in currency rates reduced our reported revenue growth by 8% and reduced our adjusted OIBDA growth by 6%. Excluding currency, revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up an impressive 17% and 14%, respectively. 
On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as contributions from Eurosport and Discovery Family, which have not yet been fully lapped, total company revenues grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA grew 11%, as revenue growth outpaced cost growth by 200 basis points. Our strong and successful cost discipline led the total company margins on an organic basis of 39%, up 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2014.
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $250 million was up 9% from the first quarter a year ago primarily driven by the strong operating performance in the current year and an $11 million year-over-year improvement in mark-to-market equity-based compensation, partially offset by a $12 million decline in equity earnings, $8 million of higher interest expense and $6 million of higher restructuring cost. As expected, equity earnings declined as positive first quarter earnings at OWN and other nonconsolidated investments were partially offset by losses from our 50% stake in All3Media related to below-the-line items. We also lowered our effective tax rate, another 200 basis points from the full year 2014 rate to 33% this quarter as we remain extremely focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates. We still expect our effective tax rate to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017, which will drive net income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth.
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.37, 12% above the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective, it excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets was $0.42, an 11% improvement versus Q1 2014.  Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 17% for the quarter. For the last 12 months, adjusted EPS was $1.89, up 12% over the prior 12 months. 
Free cash flow in the first quarter declined to $29 million as the strong operating performance and lower stock-based compensation were offset by timing of tax payments which increased approximately $180 million versus last year as well as by higher content payments. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low-single digits versus 2014 but cash tax payments will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year and will significantly subside in the second half. 
Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks grew revenues 6%, led by positive advertising revenue growth of 1% and a very impressive 13% increase in distribution revenues. Our advertising revenue growth was due to higher pricing offsetting lower delivery. Delivery did improve slightly from Q4 led by the flagship Discovery Network, but were still down mid-single digits versus the first quarter of last year. As David mentioned, domestic ad trends, however, remained relatively steady to slightly better since we last reported. And we still have a muted view of full year advertising growth. Our full year ad sales outcome will ultimately depend upon a variety of factors. The most important being, our network ratings performance. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, were up 8%, a 200 basis points improvement from the 6% organic growth rate in 2014, as we benefited from the higher rates regarded from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 as well as from contributions from our new Hulu deal, which started on January 1 of this year.
As a reminder, unlike our prior SVOD deals, the revenue recognition for Hulu will be relatively smooth over the life of the contract, and therefore, not as significant in any one quarter. So we will no longer be breaking out our digital licensing revenues separately.
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 2% on a reported basis, but were down 2% excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. Excluding Family, cost of revenues were up 5% while SG&A declined 11% in large part due to higher marketing spend on Klondike last year. Our focus on controlling costs led to domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 10% on a reported basis versus last year's first quarter and 6% excluding Family. And margins on a reported basis and excluding Family both expanded by almost 200 basis points year-over-year to 57%.
Now reviewing our international operations. Our international division delivered another quarter of strong results. On a reported basis, revenues grew 10% and reported adjusted OIBDA declined 2%. Excluding currency, revenues increased 27% and adjusted OIBDA increased 11% as changes in FX rates reduced revenue growth by 17% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 13% as the strengthening dollar remains a major headwind.
On an organic basis, which excludes currency as well as the Eurosport acquisition, revenues and adjusted OIBDA increased 9% and 11%, respectively. For comparability purposes, our following international comments will refer to our organic results only. So it excludes the impact of Eurosport and foreign exchange. The 9% first quarter revenue growth was led by 12% advertising growth and 6% distribution growth. Our advertising growth was broad-based as our industry leading global distribution platform and IP enabled us to benefit from the continued growth in global pay-TV subscribers while simultaneously taking share and increasing pricing at our existing networks while further rolling out our global TLC, ID and Velocity brands to more and more markets around the world. Excluding Russia, all regions except Asia saw double-digit ad growth increases led by the continued success of our free-to-air initiatives across Europe and by Latin America driven by increased volume in Brazil and Mexico. While organic advertising growth is expected to moderate in the second quarter due to tough comps as well as elections this year in the U.K., we still expect full year organic advertising growth to be in the low double-digit range.
On the affiliate front. The 6% affiliate revenue increase in the quarter was driven primarily by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rates and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Sinea [ph] also had solid growth as despite the renegotiations of deals in Russia and some recent contract terminations in the Ukraine, we benefited from continued growth in Germany and across Southeastern Europe. Due to the Ukraine terminations plus a pivot to a dual-pay free-to-air strategy in certain Eastern European markets, similar to the strategy that has been very successful for us in Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K., we now expect organic affiliate growth each quarter this year to be in the mid- to high-single digit range.
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 8% in the first quarter primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we further localize our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 11%. And international organic margins expanded fully, 100 basis points to 34%.
Taking a look at our overall financial position. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of $370 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $6 billion in buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we've reduced our outstanding share count by 29% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our shares very attractive.
As we stated on our last year end call, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating as we still expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of available capital for full year 2015 to fund both share repurchases as well as to fund any additional M&A strategic investments, including the potential TF1 put for the remaining 49% in Eurosport. As a reminder, the first of their 2 put windows for TF1 will occur this summer from July to September with the second window next summer during the same period. 
Turning to our full year guidance excluding currency, we still expect full year 2015 revenues will grow in the high single to low double-digit range. Adjusted OIBDA will grow in the low to mid-single digit range, and adjusted EPS will grow in the high single to low double-digit range. Growth will be driven by solid operating performance and a lower tax rate, partially offset by approximately $10 million of higher interest expense. We are reiterating our guidance despite our new news that we are selling the noncore SBS radio assets as this will be mostly offset by the positive financial impact from Time Warner Cable, not being acquired by Comcast.  Additionally, note that this guidance has always included results from consolidating Eurosport France from the second quarter through year end. As that deal closed as expected and the guidance also still includes the $50 million negative impact from Russia.
I will also highlight again that revenue growth this quarter will outpace adjusted OIBDA growth mostly due to increased content spend at Eurosport as we look to further bolster our investments in sports rights in the near term in order to fully maximize the growth potential of the asset in the medium and long term.
Eurosport had no OIBDA margin in the first quarter due to their first quarter being the seasonally lowest advertising quarter as there are far fewer sporting events aired in the first few months of the year. We still expect though that full year Eurosport margins will be in the high-single digit range. As David highlighted, we remain extremely bullish on the prospects of the Eurosport and expect our increase investments in sports rights to pay off both at Eurosport and as well as across our entire international portfolio.
In addition, while first quarter total company growth rates, excluding currency, were above the rates we guided to for the full year, we remind investors that top line growth excluding currency was always expected to peak in Q1 primarily due to the timing of the Eurosport transaction last year which will begin to be lapped at the end of May. Also cost comparisons get tougher as the year progresses.
Before we move on to Q&A, I do want update the expected foreign currency impact on our 2015 results. Given that the dollar has further strengthened since we gave guidance on our year end call this past February. While we have successfully hedged a portion of our currency exposures and did realize gains in these hedges in the first quarter, we only hedge about 60% of our transactional exposures. We also do not hedge translational exposures as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Therefore, net of our hedging strategy at current spot rates, FX is now expected to reduce our constant currency guided revenue by $425 million or roughly 6% and adjusted OIBDA still by $150 million, also roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results.
Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures. The revenue mix in 2015 is expected to be around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be around 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short to British pound as our international headquarters are in London.
Lastly, as previously stated, we reiterate our guidance of reported free cash flow growth of low-single digits  in 2015 as we still expect significant growth and operating cash flow to be partially offset by higher full year cash taxes due to prior year timing benefits related to Section 181. We do expect cash taxes in 2016 to decline significantly as the cash tax deferral effect of 181 subsides.
Thanks again for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have."

First, I would say broadly, we've affected a strategy which we started about a year ago, which is to get back to the core brands. And I think that's really working for us. I think there was some brand drift across the industry. There was some brand drift across our platforms. And in order to have our content working stronger here in the U.S., having more valued advertisers and working in a much more compelling way around the world, we got rid of some of the programming that wasn't on brand. And so you really see that difference on Science, you see it on Discovery, which has been 2 of the bigger drivers, having Discovery now as the #1 network in America for men, 18 to 49, for the majority this year and having that kind of leadership. And having that content work around the world is a big deal for us. And it goes through everyone of our channels that we really focused on what is the brand, how do we deliver on it? And I think that works also, not only for around the world and in U.S. but we own all that IP. And as this transitions to people who want to be curated for the content they want, people knowing that when they go to Animal Planet or they go to Science or they go to Discovery or TLC or the Oprah Winfrey Network, that they see content on brand. It reinforces the viewership. I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing gains. Quarter-to-date, we're either up 1% or relatively flat against the market that's down 7% or 8%. And in April, we're seeing even better trends. So I think that pivot to being on-brand is really helping us. Our GMs are really focused on using our 12% to 13% viewership on cable to promote between channels, which we think is much more effective. We did this in Latin America where we actually curate and let people know across our channels what's coming up. You're watching Discovery in Brazil, and I'll tell you what's coming up on Science, what's coming up on Animal Planet, what's coming up on our car channel. And that had real value for us. So we're starting to take that around the world. On the advertising side, I do think that with our ratings momentum that we have and the brand strength, that if the volume is there that we could do -- that we can continue to accelerate a differential. The question on the advertising side is will the volume be there? As we've said for our projections for the year, we're assuming it stays tepid. It's been slightly better. We've been taking -- been able to take advantage of it to some extent. But if there was more volume, we would have had a much more robust quarter because we had the inventory, we had the strength. We had very attractive demographics. And so we're not getting excited, we can't see really what's happening in the upfront yet, although we've sold about 30% of the upfront so far. And we're staying conservative."

But the ecosystem, at least, for the next few years, I believe, will stay together in terms of the overall majority. For most of our channels, we have contractual agreements, long-term agreements that require 90%, 85%, 95% that our channels be provided. So the ability to just determine to offer a smaller bundle, I just don't see that as likely given the contractual obligations across the industry. Having said that, since we own  all of our content, to the extent that others want to pick the best channels and make those available domestically and around the world or even take content outside of channels and offer them, that's more dollars for us and more opportunity. In the longer term, I think it's important for us to continue to keep the existing ecosystem, which is very favorable to us. And as we transition to fight for the right kind of economics, like platforms like TV Everywhere. So I think that you'll see it at the margins. If you look at what Charlie's doing, it's starting, it's growing small. But there are certain gates on that in terms of its ability to be marketed to only subscribers that don't have cable. I think the Apple platform is interesting. And all these things are good if you own all of your content and you have content that people really want. And that's why we've been really focusing hard on our super fans, talking who loves Discovery Science, Oprah, Animal Planet, ID. Having really strong brands that people love that we can curate to is more important. I think we got out early on that, and we'll continue to take advantage of it."

The concerns that we raised, the concerns that we raised around the world, issues of what is consolidation due to content, what happens in terms of content investments, that's all behind us now. I think the goal for us and for Comcast is to find a deal that make sense for both of us. We've been able to do, over the last 3 years, over 180 deals that where we were happy, the distributors were happy. We represent between 12% and 13% of viewership on cable. And we still only represent between 4% and 5% of the economics. So I think we're quite attractive with Discovery as the #1 network, and TLC is #1 in many of the markets in Middle America. And as we've said, a lot of the affinity channels we have like Oprah and Science, we've had conversations and negotiations. I am going to see Neil later after this call, I'm headed to Chicago.

Look, I think that the fact that we have 10 traditional channels in 220 or 230 markets and now we have 2 to 3 sports channels across all of Europe, these are long-cycle lease deals, and they take some time. What you've seen in the short term is given the geopolitical issues in the Ukraine, which as we all know what's happened there, we took a onetime only hit there from -- because it's affected the cable market. And in one -- Andy mentioned said market. It's really 1 market in Eastern Europe, and we'll announce in the next few weeks which one it is. We've gone from a pay-only to pay and over-the-air. I think it's going to be quite effective for us. I think it's going to be a very good deal. It will generate more value for us. We're able to -- Turkey is a market that doesn't have enough pay-TV. So that's a market that we are going free-to-air as well as pay. And we think we'll get pretty meaningful incremental value out of that. Having said that, we look at -- we still think that you'll see a trend to high single. And longer term, you will see some good affiliate growth as those deals come up as we have an ability to take advantage of scale. And the scale is part of the scale is our market share growth. One of the key elements for our growth as a company has been that we've been able to grow our market share outside the U.S. And it translates almost pretty efficiently to advertising revenue. And we're getting a little better at advertising revenues, so we're overdelivering. So the fact that we were up 10% in market share around the world and then we were able to grow advertising 12% is really effective. And it's driven by our channels getting stronger, a little bit more localization, but also by the fact that we have real conviction across Eastern and Western Europe. We have conviction in Latin America and in Asia and a lot of the local players as the economies have gotten more challenging are spending less on content. And a lot of the U.S. players are pulling out and spending less on content. And so we've seen on average midteen growth over the last 4 years, and we expect that's going to continue. We have an awful lot of momentum on our growth. And so we remain very optimistic about our international business. We have between channels and free-to-air, as well as sports in Europe and leadership with kids in Latin America, a very strong hand. We are seeing a slowdown in Asia. So I would say an acceleration in Latin America, continued strong performance in Eastern and Western Europe with a little bit of a hiccup from some geopolitical. And the overall market in Asia outside of India, a little bit slow that we were seeing double-digit growth there over the years. And that's really flattened now. But overall, I think our stories are intact or better. And we're aggregating a lot more IP under the covers. That's not only helping our market share and helping our brands around the world, but is better positioning us for the new world."

There were some markets where I think a lot of the hard work that we've done, will really pay off over the next couple of years. Some of the issues that we see, the gestational slowing of the U.S. and the question of what business models will emerge, and how quickly and how -- what will happen to bundling over the next 5 to 7 years? And outside the U.S. in a number of markets, particularly Latin America and India, it's almost as -- it feels a lot like the U.S. did 10 years ago. And a lot of what we see here will take many, many years. Brazil, for instance, reached 30% cable penetration last year. As a result of that, we saw 40% or 50% advertising gains. Brazil is probably our strongest market. We're the leader in kids. We're the #1 cable channel in all of Brazil, not just for kids. We have a channel called, Home & Health, which is like the Home and Garden of Latin America. And that's the #3 channel for women down there, and we have Discovery. So when you look at our 11 channels in Brazil, it's extremely strong. We have 5 of the top 15. And coming off of last year where it was up 40% or 50%, we're seeing growth this year of another 40% to 50%. And so there is this moment in a lot of these markets where all of a sudden what was just DR starts to move over into advertising. And you start to see the acceleration that we saw here in the U.S. in '96, '97, '98. And so Mexico and Brazil, in particular, I think are going to be engines that will really help us both gestationally, but also in terms of revenue growth because we have such strong content down there."

There's no question about it. We're significantly less than a lot of our peers. But we think the long-term brand value, that's important. And I think it's a philosophical long-term position for our company. We're still investing a lot in content, we're investing in IP. We're seeing how do we position Discovery so that we have more viewers, we have better content and we have more strength 3 to 4 years from now than we do now. So you won't see us adding a lot of minutes to make a good quarter. We're going to focus much more on, are we getting more people, enjoying spending time with our channels? Are we building more characters and building more shows that could really work, not just on linear but outside of linear. Right now, SVOD is relatively immaterial here in the U.S. Because we own all of our content, and we have a 30-year library. We have a fair amount of optionality. And depending on how the marketplace develops, there's a chance for us to do that, but that would be upside. And if there is a change in the marketplace and there are -- there is curation directly to consumers even if that content is not brand new. The ability to develop content, which we've looked at, for instance, on Science, developing a Science app. It's already converted into 48 languages. There has been some interest as we've look into the marketplace for Science, there could be some interest in Animal Planet that we could offer much like you would see a Silicon Valley new media company, where we could offer some of those worldwide concepts like Science or Animal Planet in an app around the world over-the-top with content that isn't even that fresh that could nourish an affinity group.

I know Rich has now firmly installed in the last quarter, you mentioned several high-profile direct reports to Rich overseeing things, like scripted or did programming miniseries programming. You talked about broadening your appeal to more targets. I guess, one listening to all that could interpret that to sound like somewhat of a shift toward a little more scripted, or may I say, expensive sounding programming. I just want to test to whether that would be a correct interpretation, whether you feel like an imperative given the increasing on-demand consumption model to move to more sort of higher profile and maybe even scripted programming? Or would that be a misread? Is it more just getting back to the core Discovery nonfiction plan?"

We don't -- we can't speak about any specific deal. We're really -- we are platform agnostic. But I think as the -- as there is some transition within the marketplace, the fact that we have -- that Discovery is stronger than it's ever been and it's the #1 channel for men 18 to 34 in America and we're winning a number of nights where we're even beating the broadcasters. The fact that TLC has real strength where we can be in a position where several nights a week in 40 of the middle states in America we're the #1 cable network for women. And Oprah is -- and Tyler, Tyler's programming, when he goes on the air on OWN, we have over  20 share of the African-American community. And Oprah's programming is working so well on OWN. And ID is the most -- is the stickiest channel on cable. These more -- become more and more important when people can make choices about what shows they want and what channels to put on different platforms and how much they're going to pay for those channels. Because in a world where there's a lot of opportunity, you want the best stuff with the most people that are yearning for it. The -- for us, it's all about the economics. We want to make sure we get the right economics for our programming. We opted not to do certain SVOD deals in the U.S. because we didn't think the money was strong enough. And we thought we'd rather hold on to it ourselves and either do something ourselves directly with consumers or do something with the existing distributors. And every time there's a new player in the market that's looking for content, it's -- if we as an industry can stay disciplined about economics and how that content is offered, it just reinforces the fact that whether it's Apple, whether it's a Sony device, whether it's a cable-distributed product or a satellite or any new device, those are all essentially, in the nicest way, they're a pipe or a device to a consumer. What the consumer really wants is great brands, great characters, great stories that make those devices with those interfaces come alive. And anybody that's going to curate is -- on any of those platforms, no one's going to buy it for the pipe or the platform. So our mission stays the same, but even more focused on the best content, the best brands. We'll make Discovery more successful in the future on every platform."

And they're offering, I think, a platform that's interesting, and we were rooting for them. We hope like they, every other platform out there, does well. I would say that when there's a new platform, if we have channels that have real leadership with affinity groups, and we're very strong particularly with young demos as we are across a lot of our portfolio, that it gives us a strong hand in those discussions. But again, we're coming off a small base. When you look at our overall -- the revenue that we take from the marketplace, most of the money goes to sports and retrans. And that's just -- we don't complain about it because that's the way it works. But if you looked -- at those players, they would have a percentage of viewership and then the revenue would be a multiple, some percentage significantly higher than that. In our case, we have 12% trending toward 13% of viewership. And we have between 3%, 4% or 5% of the economics. And so even when you look at those existing platforms, not only are we attractive because our content has some leading edge to it and the demos that we deliver. But even if there's-- even if we get what looks like a great deal for us or a very favorable deal, still compared with some of the other content that's out there, we're a pretty good buy. And so I think -- and I think that helps us in domestically and around the world that to be in the #1 channel in America, 18 to 49, and look at our cost base versus some of the guys that we compete with, including the sports guys, that's pretty compelling model. And that's pretty much true in the majority of countries around the world that we're the #1 channel for men in nonfiction. And in many of these countries where we've launched over-the-air Turbo channels, the demo was even younger. We're really in that 18 to 25 with the cars. So I think aggregating those audiences is going to be helpful. And we tend to get much better deals with new players around the world. But it also is because our -- the looks of our content compared to the sports guys is much more reasonable. And it's scripted."

Discovery's strong start to the year continued in the second quarter, with steady growth across our global portfolio of brands and businesses. Propelled from a strong second quarter into what was a momentous start to the third quarter, I extremely confident in Discovery's future growth prospects.
I believe we will look back on July 2015 as the pivotal month in our company's history as we announced 3 transformative agreements: Multiplatform rights to the Olympic Games in Europe for the next decade; deal to acquire 100% control of Eurosport; and lastly, a favorable long-term renewal with Comcast for our U.S. Network portfolio and distribution on the XFinity Comcast platform. These deals together stabilize and enhance our U.S. growth profile, continue our diversification internationally and give us more blue-chip IP content and more distribution so we can continue to drive audience share across all consumer platforms.
Earlier this month, we announced an exclusive deal in Europe, with the IOC for all of the TV and multiplatform media rights to the 4 Olympic Games from 2018 to 2024. Never before has 1 media company being granted all rights on all platforms across Europe.
We believe the Olympic Games will be a foundation programming piece for Eurosport and Discovery across the continent. Eurosport already dedicates over 40% to its programming schedule to Olympic sports and bolstering our rights and offerings with the world's greatest sporting event is a perfect editorial and strategic fit for the linear channel and for Eurosport.com, the leading online sports platform in Europe.
Combined with full access to the Olympic programming archive, our use of the Olympic rings immediately following Rio and our existing sports Federation agreements, this deal will substantially strengthen the Eurosport platform and bring the Olympic Games to more viewers on more platforms across Europe than ever before. We will maximize our reach to Europe's 700 million residents across platforms.
Following the June 29th Olympic announcement, we have seen an increase in conversations and feedback from our European distributors, advertising partners and phone and new media players who want to work more closely with us. 
Soon after the Olympic deal, we struck an agreement to acquire full ownership of Eurosport from the TF1 group. In 2012, we've began our investment with 20% stake in Eurosport and increased that investment to 51% more than a year ago. Taking full control of Eurosport allows us to further strengthen the brand and decision-making process. More readily secure important sports rights on a local or pan and regional basis and fully realize the business's growth potential.
Eurosport's 2 or 3 channels across 130 million homes, Eurosport.com, now the Olympics for the next decade makes us the clear leader in sports in Europe.
Finally, the third transaction was signing a long-term distribution agreement with Comcast. Our renewal with Comcast is significant. It demonstrates the distributors continue to place great value on our content and brands with meaningful increases, and it solidifies our TV Everywhere strategy with deployment on XFinity, the primary TV Everywhere platform in the U.S.
Four years ago, we said we would reset our domestic affiliate right structure with a step-up and more manyfold increases to reflect our increase investment in content and the growth of our audience share that our channel brands had earned. I'm proud to say that we've achieved it. 
Prior to this renewal cycle, our deals have price escalators at CPI, but we have now reset all of our affiliate agreements that have come up in the last 4 years, which is the majority, at a meaningful rate increase that reflects the strength of our brands and our increased market share. Andy will give you more details. But today, we are positioned for long-term growth in the United States.
Locking up that long-cycle money, which strong price escalators allows us to focus on other aspects of the business and gives our U.S. business a steady growth rate for years to come.
And there's still real opportunity for value creation even on the affiliate side going forward. At 13% share of viewing, where we're only getting a mid-single-digit share of affiliate fees, even with our increases, there is still a gap to close in the future as well, which we see as real opportunity in the years ahead, even in a marketplace in the U.S. that is relatively flat and challenged.
Combined with our multiple TV Everywhere rights deals signed in the past 2 years, we are now accelerating the expansion of streaming choices for our content across platforms and diversifying our distribution channels with multiple partners. It's positive when new entrants come into the market, particularly when you have the #1 channel in America for men, the Discovery Channel. Several top channels for women and the top channel for African-American, with OWN. All at a price point that is very good value, which gives us a real advantage. 
Today, I'm pleased to announce an agreement with Verizon to bring long and short-form content from Discovery channel, TLC and Animal Planet, ID and the Science Channel, including full episodes of prior seasons of hit shows to Verizon's U.S. mobile subscribers. This deal extends our platform reach to Verizon customers beyond our traditional pay-TV customer base, and adds yet another source to our distribution revenue stream.
While we drive to extend the delivery of our content to new platforms, we also are working to maximize and exploit our traditional business in the U.S. Headwinds notwithstanding, the U.S. pay-TV marketplace remains one of the world's most important programming and advertising markets. Long-term, we are evolving our approach to integrate advertising more deeply into our content, adding more branded integrations, pushing programmatic buying and driving higher CPMs from the scatter marketplace.
In the second quarter in the U.S., revenue growth yet again outpaced cost increases and adjusted OIBDA reached an all-time high. Hitting these metrics illustrates the strong command and control we have in our business.
We have seen advertising market momentum pick up across all of our channels so far in Q3. As we continue to benefit from ratings outperformance, driven by the flagship, Discovery Channel.
Led by new President, Rich Gross, the Discovery Channel team has done a fantastic job of creating and building programming that nourishes Discovery's core male viewers, while attracting more diverse audiences, including women, millennials, Hispanic viewers and family coviewing.
For the quarter, Discovery's prime time delivery with persons 25 to 54 rose 12%; and 9%, with men 25 to 54; and 16% with women 25 to 54. The network ranked as the #4 channel in ad-supported cable for persons 25 to 54, up 2 spots from a year ago, and with women 25 to 54 rose 7 spots to number 9.
Discovery held all of cable's top 5 unscripted series for men, this tax, Naked and Afraid, Alaskan Bush People, Fast N' Loud and Street Outlaws. More recently, Shark Week, which aired a month earlier this year continues to be a pop culture juggernaut. The science-based slate of programming that reinforced Discovery Channel's heritage, Shark Week 2015 became our highest rated ever among persons 25 to 54 and women 25 to 54.
And Discovery Channel's performance in July, outside of Shark Week, was strong as prime time delivery jumped 34% for persons 25 to 54 and 26% for men and 50% for women in the same age bracket. All making Discovery Channel the #1 channel for men for the month of July. 
Internationally, Discovery Channel again reached a record audience as many of our 10th poll shows replicated their success globally. Discovery Channel show particular strength in India, Brazil and Mexico, where our share of audience rose more than 20%. 
ID also posted strong viewership gains in the U.S. and abroad in the second quarter. ID's U.S. delivery rose 7% and it was a top 3 ad-supported cable network with women 25 to 54 in total day, up 3.
ID's average international audience rose a record 23% for the quarter, fueled by new market launches on organic viewership growth, including the June launch of ID in Sweden. 
In TLC, we have moved forward with new series that speak to what the TLC brand is best at, holding the merit of the culture and telling stories in a thoughtful and sensitive way. There are no better examples than I am Jazz, a heartwarming new series about a transgender teen and its loving family. In its premiere, the series posted 1.8 million viewers. And My Giant Life, a new series that chronicles the remarkable stories of the world's tallest women and has averaged nearly 2 million total viewers. These shows will soon be joined by returning series of Our Little Family and the Little Couple.
Meanwhile TLC's viewership overseas continues to grow. TLC's average international audience rose 15% in the second quarter, led by strong viewership in South Africa, the Netherlands, U.K. and Russia. 
Just as our global networks and programming are performing well, it is also important to note our IP content investments are similarly making real strides, All3, which we owned through a joint venture with Liberty Global International, was nominated for 11 prime time Emmys this year, including the hit series, Undercover Boss and Penny Dreadful.
Overall, we again achieved new record reach and market share gains internationally. With 6% audience share growth across our entire global portfolio in the quarter, our audience and share gains were led by our pay-TV channels in India, Brazil and Mexico, with the Discovery kids, TLC and Animal Planet brands driving our gains. We also saw a strong delivery in the U.K., Germany and Italy as we have many pay-TV and free-to-air channels in those markets and a strong and growing share presence.
Latin America once again delivered a stellar quarter with average audience up 13%. We continue to see broad-based gains in viewership across the region. Led by the Discovery kids, Brazil's portfolio was up 23% and Mexico jumped 16%.
Our CEEMEA reason posted 5% growth in average audience in the second quarter. Last week in the region, we officially announced an expanded partnership in Turkey, with the Media Group, one of leading media companies in the country. God is an important distribution partner for our 12 pay-TV channels in Turkey and with this new strategic partnership, we were able to expand our portfolio with positive economics and agreed to purchase our first free-to-air channel in this emerging growth market that expands and diversifies our platforms and windows for our content in Turkey, a key market for us. We'll also partner with noblesse to be our new exclusive representative for our advertising sales.
We're also deploying a free-to-air partnership strategy in the growing Middle East and North African market. In June, we announced plans to launch Quest Arabia in the region in the fourth quarter through an agreement with Image Nation, the leading content creators in the Middle East. This free-to-air Arabic language channel will reach 45 million homes, with the best locally produced male-oriented factual programming mixed with program from Discovery's the best global content engine. Quest Arabia will expand Discovery's 7 network portfolio in the market, which already includes 6 pay-TV Discovery brands and the free-to-air channel, Fatafeat.
Across Europe and Asia, our investment in Eurosport continues to demonstrate progress, with the business posting 6% increase in average audience this quarter alone. 
As we approach the 2018 Olympic Winter games, we will continue to build Eurosport's offering and brand for the long-term across Europe and Asia. Since taking control of Eurosport, a little more than a year ago, we've added 7,500 hours of coverage per year, with more than 3,300 of that live through more than 50 sports rights deals to drive viewership and strength of the offering. And Eurosport remains meaningfully profitable. Recent rights included the exclusive television and digital rights for 8 major international cycle races from 2017 to 2021 in Asia-Pacific, Wimbledon in Belgium, the PGA Tour Golf in Norway and the Europa League in the Nordics. 
Nonlinear, we are bullish about the impact of the Olympics and all the local and niche sports content we are acquiring will have on driving adoption of our over-the-top products in Europe. With the Eurosport player in 52 countries, in Dplay, which was recently launched in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Italy, we are continuing to drive toward our stated goal, march to 1 million subscribers across those platforms in the next 2 years. And we now have over 300,000 subscribers as of the end of last month.
We're making real progress in our goal to maximize the linear platform, while aggressively attacking digital distribution around the world. Our strategy centers on investing in premium content to grow market share such as the Olympics, maximizing audience reach on pay-TV platforms by locking down long-cycle agreements, like Comcast, while aggressively pushing our content to new distribution platforms, like Verizon in the U.S. And finding new ways to monetize our content, like with in Turkey, and evolving our approach to advertising through the use of data to drive addressability, dynamic ad insertion and secondary guarantees using set-top box data. All of these efforts are designed to enhance growth in the U.S. will driving the expansion aggressively of our international footprint.
Based on our 30-year track record of success, the transformative partnerships we've signed in just the past month alone and our continued global growth horizon, I believe Discovery is well positioned to grow across our 220 markets around the world for the years to come.
With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to detail our second quarter financial results."

Discovery's ability to execute on key strategic global growth initiatives, while focusing and tailor controlling cost lead to another quarter of solid results. 
On a reported basis, total company second quarter revenues increased 3% and adjusted OIBDA was down 2%. As expected, given our increasingly international business mix, the stronger dollar remained a headwind and changes in currency rates reduced both our reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 8%. Therefore, excluding currency, revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up an impressive 11% and 6%, respectively.
On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the inclusion of Eurosport and Discovery Family, total company revenues grew 4% and adjusted OIBDA grew 3%, while organic margins were flat year-over-year at 44%.
Our strong cost and content spend allocation discipline and management continues, but note that we do expect to see a significant uptick in cost domestically and internationally in the third quarter, given the timing of of certain content and marketing investments. This 3Q cost uptick is embedded in our full year guidance.
Note also that because the difficulties in separating Eurosport France and the rest of Eurosport results, we will continue to breakout the impact of both transactions to the end of this year. It's important to remind people, however, that when we breakout and report the combined Eurosport results for another few quarters, the benefits of our owning Eurosport extends far beyond the stand-alone Eurosport results through the rest of Discovery portfolio in Europe and Asia to the combined distribution and ad sales leverage in this country.
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $286 million was down versus last year's second quarter net income of $379 million, primarily due to unusually large amounts related to higher foreign currency losses of $54 million from the revaluation of both our euro-denominated debt and monetary assets in Venezuela, $28 million of lower gains lead to selling SBS radio this year versus gains related to HowStuffWorks and Eurosport last year and higher restructuring and other charges this year of $19 million, primarily due to content impairment charges from canceling TLC's 19 Kids and Counting.
These all was partially offset by lower income tax expense as our effective tax rate decreased another 300 basis points year-over-year to 32%, as we remain extremely focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates. We expect our effective tax rate to be 33% for 2015 and still expect it to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017, which will continue to drive sustained income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow.
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.44 and adjusted earnings per diluted share from our relevant metric from the comparability perspective that excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.49. Excluding negative currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 4% for the quarter and up 11% for the last 12 months.
Free cash flow in the second quarter increased an impressive 55% to $313 million due to lower cash taxes, bring capital improvements, lower cash interest payments and lower capital expenditures. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low single-digits versus 2014 and accelerate nicely in 2016.
Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks grew revenue 5% as we benefited from another quarter of strong distribution growth, up 12% versus last year's second quarter and a small increase in ad sales. Our advertising revenues were up slightly versus last year's second quarter as higher pricing and the consolidation of Discovery Family offset lower delivery. Total U.S. delivery did improve from the first quarter but once again by the flagship Discovery network but were still down low single-digits versus second quarter of last year.
As David mentioned, this quarter marks our highest ad sales quarter in the company's history as we benefited from the overall market shift and advanced upfront ad buying, a higher scatter volume as we also sold a record amount of scatter ad volume. Looking ahead, we were bullish on our third quarter ad trends as our improved delivery, especially at Discovery is allowing us to continue to take advantage of the healthier scatter market and we expect our third quarter U.S. advertising revenue growth to modestly accelerate to low single-digit.
It's still too early to have a solid read on Q4. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, were up 6% this quarter, as we again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as from contributions from our new Hulu deal, which started January 1 of this year.
Organic growth decelerated from the first quarter due to tougher year-over-year SVOD comps and a decline of approximately 1% from the pay subscription universe. Given the onetime nature of the SVOD comp, we expect organic affiliate growth to accelerate slightly to the second half of the year, assuming that rate of subscriber losses does not tick top.
I also want to address the financial impact of our recently announced Comcast renewal. We are extremely pleased with the rate structure of our new comprehensive long-term agreement that again recognizes the value of Discovery's networks. Price include new deal goes to affect January 1st of next year and includes a healthy initial step-up followed by continued rate escalators over the life of the deal.
This deal, along with our other recently completed deals, helps stabilize and accelerate our U.S. affiliate growth trajectory to high single-digits in 2016 and significantly enhances our domestic affiliate revenue and cash flow growth expectations.
Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 1% on a reported basis, but were down 3% excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. Excluding Family, cost of revenue were up 2% while SG&A declined 11%.
Our laser focus on controlling costs led to domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 7% on a reported basis versus last year's second quarter and up 4%, excluding Family. While margins on a reported basis and excluding Family both expanded by 100 basis points year-over-year to our all-time high margin rate of 61%.
Moving onto international operations. International division drove another solid quarter of organic distribution growth, but did experience a near-term slowdown in organic advertising that is already reversing in the third quarter.
On a reported basis, revenues grew 1% and reported adjusted OIBDA declined 11%, excluding currency, revenues increased 19% and adjusted OIBDA increased 7% as changes in FX rates reduced both revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 18%, as the stronger dollar versus last year remained a major headwind.
On an organic basis, though excluding currency impacts as well as Eurosport, revenues and adjusted OIBDA both increased 7%. For coverability purposes, by following international comments, we refer to our organic results only to exclude the impact of Eurosport and FX.
The 7% second quarter revenue growth is led by 7% advertising growth and 7% distribution growth. Ad growth was led by another quarter of 20%-plus growth in Latin America, led by strong volume, pricing and delivery in Brazil as well as strength in Argentina and Mexico. Asia Pac has also recovered nicely and grew advertising over 10%. 
The majority of the reasons our advertising growth rate decelerated from the first quarter were onetime in nature, namely tough comps related to the World Cup last year as well as the slowdown in the U.K. due to elections in May. But we are now seeing a nice acceleration into the third quarter.
We are also hurt in 2Q by a lower audience share in Norway. Looking forward, we still forecast full year organic advertising growth to be in the low double-digit range though will depend upon no further share losses in Norway.
Distribution revenues grew 7%, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America with the higher rate and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. We still expect organic affiliate growth in the back half of this year in the mid to high single-digit range.
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 7% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we further localize our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 7% and international organic margins were in line with last year at 38%.
Eurosport stand-alone margin in the second quarter was 11% and we still expect margins to be in the high single-digit range for the full year. We continue to see significant strategic value on investing in additional sports IP in order to bolster and enhance both the Eurosport and total Discovery European platforms. And while these investments will drive real long-term portfolio value, they will also continue to depress margins at stand-alone Eurosport and will also limit margin expansion going forward for total D&I.
For Education and other segment reported small operating loss for the quarter. Given our strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content for our in-house OWN production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in Education digital textbooks to drive the long-term value of this industry disrupting business. This segment, in total, continue to operate at a small loss for the remainder of the year.
Now taking a look at our overall financial position. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total of $207 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $6.2 billion buying back shares as we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by 30% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our own shares extremely attractive.
As we have previously stated, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating, and we will manage our capital planning and allocation with this commitment in mind. The rating agencies have recently taken a more conservative view on the media industry and given our current debt-to-EBITDA threshold, it's at the higher end of target levels for BBB company. We are now focused on preserving cash for the remainder of this year.
Therefore, we now expect to have less total available capital for fiscal 2015 than we had previously stated, including the $52 million worth of stock that we will soon buy from advanced Newhouse under our preexisting buyback agreement with them, we will spend $575 million on total share buybacks this year and unlikely to repurchase any additional common stock for the remainder of this year.
Given our capital allocation priorities remain: First and foremost, to invest in drive organic growth; and second to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP; and third, buyback our stock. For the remainder of 2015, we need to retain flexibility for additional potential strategic investments, which is our recently announced accretive and growth-driving investment with Dogas in Turkey, while continuing to pay down debt. 
As we look towards 2016, however, we forecast having fully more capital available and expect, the of capital allocated to share repurchases to increase significantly next year.
Turning to full year guidance. Excluding currency impact, we are pleased to reaffirm that we still expect revenue growth to be in the high single to low double-digit range and adjusted OIBDA growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. Given our solid operating performance and lower tax rate trends, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS excluding currency growth expectations, to be low double-digits. These guidance ranges still include the sale of the noncore SBS Radio assets, which closed at the end of the second quarter as well as the $50 million negative non-FX-related impact from Russia.
Before I do move on to Q&A, I want to update our full year foreign exchange impact on our 2015 results. While the dollar has been less volatile, there's slightly higher currency headwinds versus when we last reported, in large part due to Venezuela. At current spot rates, FX is now expected to reduce our constant currency guided revenues by $440 million or roughly 7% and adjusted OIBDA by $160 million, roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results. 
In addition, we are now disclosing that FX will have a $0.23 and $0.28 impact on adjusted EPS versus last year reported results, assuming no further below the line currency adjustments.
Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures, the revenue mix in 2015 remains the same at around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% [ph] U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks adjusted OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be around 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short to British pound is our international headquarters in London.
Lastly, as a reminder, while we have successfully hedged a portion of our currency exposures and did realize gains from these hedges in the first half, we only hedge about 60% of international transactional exposures. We also do not hedge translational exposures as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
In conclusion, as I look across our portfolio, I couldn't be happier with how we're currently position. Our current exposure to higher growth in international market is 50% growing. And while we will continue to benefit from the global evolution of pay-TV and continued audience share gains us levers our marquee content across our unmatched global distribution platforms, about half our global revenues are allowed in the next several years through long-term affiliate agreement, both domestically and internationally.
David and I will forward to discussing our compelling and highly unique portfolio positioning in more depth at our Investor Day in September 29th. And now I'd like to open the line up for questions."

The Comcast was one of the final pieces of this overall strategy over the last 4 years, where we grew our viewership from 5% share of viewership on cable to 13% and to try and get more value and bigger increases. And so Comcast together with all of our deals, to be in a position where we now can look forward and see high single-digit affiliate growth in the U.S. with all of our channels being carried with very limited exposure to this is up Skinner bundles because almost all of our deals require that all of our channels be carried to a very high percentage of subscribers. It puts us in I think a very good position and makes the U.S. for us as we look forward a growth market. And when we say high single, we're putting in after an expectation that the U.S. will recognize it's mature, it's been declining at about 1% and we think we can get high single even if that accelerates a little bit. And so the big piece here is that we've really -- we have a very good affiliate revenue stream now. And as I've mentioned, we still only represent about 5 or a little bit more than 5% of the economics even though we are 13% of viewership. Before, we were at 3%, about 3.5%. So we're quite a good bargain when someone looking for our content, whether it be over-the-top platforms and so on. On the data piece, there's the the relationship with Comcast that we established and I think that's critical. Because the data inside the box is very important. Comcast platform is probably the, if not the best, it's certainly up there or the X1 platform is terrific. It's a leader in TV Everywhere, but it's also one of the leaders in data capture, which could help us on the monetization side. So we're all in on TV Everywhere with Comcast and with kneel. We're glad to have that deal behind us. The other pieces that we own all of our own content, which is quite unusual. And I think it's going to be a very important element as you look at the future of a mature market because we own all of our content, we don't have long-term commitments to sports, we don't have long-term commitment of network. And when we put our content on platforms, we get all the money. So it gives us the chance to move our content on to platforms but it also to the extent that the marketplace moves in a particular direction, we have real ability to maneuver from a cost perspective and we don't have any long tail expensive programming costs."

I really feel like plus from David's comments, the fact that we do have more content cost flexibility. We definitely are demonstrating a lot of committee control around other non-content costs, particularly in SG&A. And we're seeing that benefit over the last several quarters. To your point though, in 3Q, we do expect double-digit increases for both domestic and international, predominantly on the content side. And a little bit on the marketing side as we're going to put some -- more support and tailwind behind some of our new program launches. So there'll be definitely be a cost uptick in 3Q, but definitely want to highlight the fact that, as I think about our cost structures and I think about going forward, I feel really good about our sustained level of productivity and driving SG&A in particular to be kind of in that low single to mid-single-digit range. The second question about the foreign exchange impact. Yes, the $0.23 to $0.28 is the latest view. That's a few cents higher than what we would have thought on our May conference call. It's really highlighting more the fact that while euro has been relatively stable, given our global reach and global expansion of our platforms, clearly, some of the other currencies in particular Venezuela and Brazil have continued to be an additional headwind. So we definitely the want to go forward continue to wind that for everyone kind of what the impact is on our adjusted EPS."

And so the 1 element here is positioning ourselves for the future, where between Eurosport where we own all the sports IP and we have Olympic sports have Olympic sports and if we charge of sports in particular countries plus the Olympics, it positions us where for the long term, for the next 10 years, we have must-have IP. And we have said response in the market in a meaningful way by a number of different players on all platforms interested to talk to us about the Olympics, but also the sports content that lead up to the Olympics. So we could take you from Michael Phelps every event by read up with a gold-medal. And so there's real value in that and we're ting figure that out. On the -- when we look at how the Olympics has done in Europe, and I was involved with the Olympics for 15 years in the U.S., NBC was quite effective in involving the Olympics from being just that free-to-air product to free-to-air in cable, including getting incremental fees and incremental -- and lifting up the whole bundle of the NBC channels. And then moving it on to other platforms. If you look at Europe, U.S. is about 300 million, 330 million people, all rights in Europe are over 700 million people. But almost everyone of those markets, it's sort of where U.S. was was in 1992 basically almost only free-to-air in each country and they had been sold to free-to-air players and to that BVS, to the public stations in each market. And so we're now the holder of that content and we will look to monetize it together with all of our assets. So I think it's a little bit of falls piece of data to look at just where Eurosport is. You will need to take a look at what is our affiliate revenue in the aggregate doing. What's our advertising revenue in the aggregate wing, and what's our sponsorship advertising revenue in the aggregate look like. And as we mentioned earlier, we're pushing hard in over-the-top. I think we're the only company in Europe that's going directly to consumer with sports, and we have over 300,000 subscribers now that are paying us between $6 and $8 a subscriber in order to get the Eurosport programming. So for the French Open instead of watching 3 courts [ph], if you have 3 Eurosport channels in your country, you could watch 15 courts. On cycling, you can follow 15 cyclists.

And the scale that we've been able to get by the growth of our pay-TV together with free-to-air, puts us in a much better position as we sit down with distributors. And what's happened is a lot of other companies that are local because of the fact that most countries are either in recession or flat and it's been a long haul, a lot of the local companies have spent less on content, which has helped us gain share. And a lot of the players from outside have taken cost out and done the opposite rather than go local and spend more on content reduce.

In July, to have Discovery be the #1 cable channel in America for men. There have been several months in the last 8 months where Discovery has been a core structure that's very different from entertainment and sports channel to be the #1 cable channel. And remember, 80% of that content we get to reuse around the world. We don't rent it for just the U.S. So it's a very effective model. We also have seen that the amount of time that our content is DVR has been up significantly [indiscernible] much people want our content. And we're excited about going full in to TV Everywhere. I think we will learn more about that. Our deal with Verizon in Europe we're talking to a lot of different players. So I think we are develop that right now. We're able to reach it with Verizon. We think our content is more valuable. We could be on every SVOD platform if we wanted to. But since we OWN all of our content, we could also go directly to consumer, which is very possible. And we're doing it throughout in Europe now with sports, across all of Europe, we're doing with entertainment content and sports content in a number of countries in Northern Europe and in Italy. And so we have all that flexibility. My only point on the upside is that in a declining market, where people are choosing channels, the fact that we're 13% -- our 14 channels are 13% of viewership on cable and we're only 5% of the money, that's not something to brag about. We were much lower. The good news is we've gotten a significant step-up and big increases. But I think that the other piece of good news for us is that when people are looking to launch channels, they can get our channels, whether they took 8 of them or took 13 of them or 14 of them. And even if we charge more come it's a lot less expensive than maybe most of the channels. There are a lot of the entertainment and sports channels that are in the inverse. They might have 5% of viewership and be 20% of the money. So I think it makes us quite attractive. But also, as we continue to make our case over the next several years, we grew share in the last couple of months, a lot of others are losing share. So the fact that if we can continue to gain share as our deals come up, will continue to do what we have done over the last 4 years, which is make the value the argument that we're underindexed on economics and trying to continue to drive our affiliate line even in the marketplace that has some decline on subscribers."

The fact that we have a higher fees locked in and we can be in a position where we could say no even if the advertising market is weak and it ends up being flat, we still have a mid-single growth U.S. business, which is only half of our company. And most of -- a lot of our growth is coming from outside the U.S., where there's still double-digit or better growth and the kind of general growth dynamics that we saw in the U.S. historically. The idea of going directly to consumers is something we have every opportunity to do. We own all of our content, we have super fan groups, so I think we're very well positioned. We're looking at everything. But I think the marketplace at least for the next 3 years is going to stay relatively stable, and we'll probably have more people going our content. And we'll be in a position if we want what any moment to start picking off some of those super fan groups. That's what we do in Europe. Viewership in Eurosport is up, but the people that absolutely love tennis or love cycling or love Olympics purser Winter Sports, are signing up for Eurosport or can what we're finding is in most cases, there watching more Eurosport. But when they're out of their home, they want to be able to watch the sports they like. So for the near-term at least, we're double dipping.

When you're looking at Europe, you're looking at 55 countries and 20 languages and different regulations in each country. The good news for us is that's what we do for a living. We're already in all 55 of those countries. We have teams on the ground. We have an infrastructure that converts into every language. And so for us, it is what we do for a living. On the Olympics side, there are specific restrictions that the IOC has on how much has to be free-to-air for summer and for winter. And in some countries, there are requirement's that are -- in addition to the IOC requirements on free-to-air. We own all the rights. And so for instance, in the U.K., it's if the BBC has the rights, then we would sit down with them historically, and we can talk about how much we want to give them. We would look in most cases to preserve all the rights other than free-to-air. So we could sub distribute the free-to-air rights. In many markets we have free-to-air channels that meet the requirements in Italy, in Germany, in Spain, in the U.K., in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland. So there are a lot of markets where we have the free-to-air rights. And in that case, we'll have to decide, are we better of selling to someone in the market, the free-to-air only? Maybe we sell 60% of the rights, hold back 40% for cable and then hold back old the rights for phone and other devices to go directly. We have plenty of time to think about it. The good news is it's been just free-to-air. And so when you look back at the early '90s, whenever Kim the city of you can and your own producer, you could watch these on broadcast, swimming, but you could see driving and you could see cycling and you could see judo on cable. We could bring that to Europe and I think it could be quite effective and we have the ability to make those decisions. And we have the ability in many cases in many of the big markets to go all in ourselves if we want to. So I think that gives us very good optionality."

And then just when you look at your commentary about kind of the ability to hit subscription numbers, clearly, we've gone from a video subscriptions base that's been growing to a video subscription base that's now declining. What gives you confidence that a 1%-ish decline or even a little larger than that is reasonable? Why can't it the 4% or 5%? And the same thing with advertising, seems like that both advertising subscription have gone from growth to kind of flat to negative.

We're now seeing a rising advertising. So I can't the point word advertising market is going to go, but I can say that pricing in scatter has been good and that the market has picked up. I don't know if it will continue to. On the affiliate side, we've been able to get step-up. So over the last 4 years, when your new deal comes in, we to the step-up and then we get increases and even assuming that there is some decline, we see some very good affiliate growth over the next several years and that we're okay. And so the way that we look at it is, I say, okay, if we got high single, affiliate growth, even if there's some decline, and if the advertising market is even weak, then we still have a mid-single growth business here in the U.S. If we -- and having that would cost basis that's very manageable and probably lower than most, where we got to reuse our content around the world, we then use that mid-singles growth business to fuel 65% or 70% of the content we need around the world where we're seeing much higher growth. And most of those countries outside the U.S. not experiencing what you're talking about. They're getting advertising growth. They're getting affiliate growth. Our market share is growing. And so I think we've really stabilized the U.S. business. I feel good about it. If you put in a lot of the parade, we still have a nice mid-single growth business. We're not assuming that there's a dramatic jump into. But I don't see any despite all the headlines and discussions, anything that would make in any way concerned that there is a delta, a meaningful tilt or over here. There is a much mature market that is shoving some decline. And we have stabilized it and put ourselves in a position for growth here. On the Europe side, we've actually done the opposite of what you have said. The only big ticket item we have gotten is the Olympics. We paid a little less than $1.5 billion for 4 Olympic Games that we're we have very little cost until 2018. And we began to get the Olympic library and the earnings to use on Eurosport and use on Eurosport.com, which is the leader online beginning right after Rio. The rest of the sports rights that we've gotten and we have done over 50 deals, most of the money goes to soccer. Soccer is like the NFL times 2 in Europe. And distributors are fighting over who gets to get the soccer. We opted out of that game and we think we can get everything else and we can monetize it on a very reasonable basis and we can monetize it on our European platform and we can monetize it are rate to consumer and online. We carry the leads of soccer on Eurosport.com, which is the equivalent of ESPN.com here in the U.S. It's the leading online site. But we don't need to OWN soccer. As we have the Olympics together with the dominant position on -- in everything else, which I think now that we own the Olympics and we have relationship with the federation, we don't see it that the prices of speedskating is going up going to go up dramatically. In fact come in some of the markets where people have begun soccer, debuted too much money that they come to us and said would you want to buy some of our other sports rights because we just have a step-up with such increases on soccer. So we think Eurosport will be EBITDA positive at in itself and will lift our overall portfolio. And when you think of Eurosport as being at 130 million homes, and then another 2 or 3 sports channels, and you think of where ESPN was years ago, we haven't begun to monetize the subscriber economics. We haven't begun to aggressively -- we only started selling locally 4 months ago. We haven't begun to monetize the advertising piece and we have the IP and the Olympics. If we could do a new of what either has been able to do over the last 15 years in gaining significant subscribers, building on the dominant platform that he has, we can and using it to build the rest of his company, we could have a hell of a business. And he did it in a marketplace this that has 330 million homes with a leader in sports and have the Olympics over the next decade in a market that has ever had million homes but you're not going to do the NFL. We're not going to do soccer."

Discovery's strong start to the year continued in the second quarter, with steady growth across our global portfolio of brands and businesses. Propelled from a strong second quarter into what was a momentous start to the third quarter, I join you extremely confident in Discovery's future growth prospects.
I believe we will look back on July 2015 as the pivotal month in our company's history as we announced 3 transformative agreements: multiplatform rights to the Olympic Games in Europe for the next decade; deal to acquire 100% control of Eurosport; and lastly, a favorable long-term renewal with Comcast for our U.S. Network portfolio and distribution on the XFinity Comcast platform. These deals together stabilize and enhance our U.S. growth profile, continue our diversification internationally and give us more blue-chip IP content and more distribution so we can continue to drive audience share across all consumer platforms.
Earlier this month, we announced an exclusive deal in Europe, with the IOC for all of the TV and multiplatform media rights to the 4 Olympic Games from 2018 to 2024. Never before has one media company been granted all rights on all platforms across Europe.
We believe the Olympic Games will be a foundation programming piece for Eurosport and Discovery across the continent. Eurosport already dedicates over 40% to its programming schedule to Olympic sports and bolstering our rights and offerings with the world's greatest sporting event is a perfect editorial and strategic fit for the linear channel and for Eurosport.com, the leading online sports platform in Europe.
Combined with full access to the Olympic programming archive, our use of the Olympic Rings immediately following Rio and our existing sports federation agreements, this deal will substantially strengthen the Eurosport platform and bring the Olympic Games to more viewers on more platforms across Europe than ever before. We will maximize our reach to Europe's 700 million residents across platforms. Following the June 29 Olympic announcement, we have seen an increase in conversations and feedback from our European distributors, advertising partners and phone and new media players who want to work more closely with us. 
Soon after the Olympic deal, we struck an agreement to acquire full ownership of Eurosport from the TF1 group. In 2012, we began our investment with a 20% stake in Eurosport and increased that investment to 51% more than a year ago. Taking full control of Eurosport allows us to further strengthen the brand and decision-making process, more readily secure important sports rights on a local or pan-regional basis and fully realize the business' growth potential. Eurosport's 2 or 3 channels across 130 million homes, Eurosport.com, now the Olympics for the next decade makes us the clear leader in sports in Europe.
Finally, the third transaction was signing a long-term distribution agreement with Comcast. Our renewal with Comcast is significant. It demonstrates that distributors continue to place great value on our content and brands with meaningful increases, and it solidifies our TV Everywhere strategy with deployment on XFinity, the primary TV Everywhere platform in the U.S.
4 years ago, we said we would reset our domestic affiliate rate structure with a step-up and more meaningful increases to reflect our increased investment in content and the growth of our audience share that our channel brands had earned. I'm proud to say that we've achieved it. Prior to this renewal cycle, our deals had price escalators at CPI, but we have now reset all of our affiliate agreements that have come up in the last 4 years, which is the majority, at a meaningful rate increase that reflects the strength of our brands and our increased market share. Andy will give you more details. But today, we are positioned for long-term growth in the United States. Locking up that long-cycle money with strong price escalators allows us to focus on other aspects of the business and gives our U.S. business a steady growth rate for years to come. 
And there's still real opportunity for value creation even on the affiliate side going forward. At 13% share of viewing, where we're only getting a mid-single-digit share of affiliate fees even with our increases, there is still a gap to close in the future as well, which we see as real opportunity in the years ahead, even in a marketplace like the U.S. that is relatively flat and challenged.
Combined with our multiple TV Everywhere rights deals signed in the past 2 years, we are now accelerating the expansion of streaming choices for our content across platforms and diversifying our distribution channels with multiple partners. It's positive when new entrants come into the market, particularly when you have the #1 channel in America for men, the Discovery Channel; several top channels for women; and the top channel for African-American women with OWN, all at a price point that is a very good value, which gives us a real advantage. 
Today, I'm pleased to announce an agreement with Verizon to bring long and short-form content from Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, ID and the Science channel, including full episodes of prior seasons of hit shows to Verizon's U.S. mobile subscribers. This deal extends our platform reach to Verizon customers beyond our traditional pay-TV customer base, and adds yet another source to our distribution revenue stream.
While we drive to extend the delivery of our content to new platforms, we also are working to maximize and exploit our traditional business in the U.S. Headwinds notwithstanding, the U.S. pay-TV marketplace remains one of the world's most important programming and advertising markets. Long term, we are evolving our approach to integrate advertising more deeply into our content, adding more branded integrations, pushing programmatic buying and driving higher CPMs from the scatter marketplace.
In the second quarter in the U.S., revenue growth yet again outpaced cost increases and adjusted OIBDA reached an all-time high. Hitting these metrics illustrates the strong command and control we have over our business. 
We have seen advertising market momentum pick up across all of our channels so far in Q3 as we continue to benefit from ratings outperformance, driven by the flagship, Discovery Channel. Led by new President, Rich Ross, the Discovery Channel team has done a fantastic job of creating and building programming that nourishes Discovery's core male viewers, while attracting more diverse audiences, including women, millennials, Hispanic viewers and family co-viewing.
For the quarter, Discovery's prime time delivery with persons 25 to 54 rose 12%, and 9% with men 25 to 54, and 16% with women 25 to 54. The network ranked as the #4 channel in ad-supported cable for persons 25 to 54, up 2 spots from a year ago; and with women 25 to 54, rose 7 spots to #9.
Discovery held all of cable's top 5 unscripted series for men: Deadliest Catch, Naked and Afraid, Alaskan Bush People, Fast N' Loud and Street Outlaws. More recently, Shark Week, which aired a month earlier this year, continues to be a pop culture juggernaut. With a science-based slate of programming that reinforced Discovery Channel's heritage, Shark Week 2015 became our highest rated ever among persons 25 to 54 and women 25 to 54. And Discovery Channel's performance in July, outside of Shark Week, was strong as prime time delivery jumped 34% for persons 25 to 54 and 26% for men and 50% for women in the same age bracket, all making Discovery Channel the #1 channel for men for the month of July. 
Internationally, Discovery Channel again reached a record audience as many of our tent-pole shows replicated their success globally. Discovery Channel showed particular strength in India, Brazil and Mexico, where our share of audience rose more than 20%. 
ID also posted strong viewership gains in the U.S. and abroad in the second quarter. ID's U.S. delivery rose 7% and it was a top 3 ad-supported cable network with women 25 to 54 in total day, top 3. ID's average international audience rose a record 23% for the quarter, fueled by new market launches and organic viewership growth, including the June launch of ID in Sweden. 
On TLC, we have moved forward with new series that speak to what the TLC brand is best at: holding a mirror to the culture and telling stories in a thoughtful and sensitive way. There are no better examples than I Am Jazz, a heartwarming new series about a transgender teen and her loving family. In its premiere, the series posted 1.8 million viewers. And My Giant Life, a new series that chronicles the remarkable stories of the world's tallest women and has averaged nearly 2 million total viewers. These shows will soon be joined by returning series, Our Little Family and the Little Couple. Meanwhile TLC's viewership overseas continues to grow. TLC's average international audience rose 15% in the second quarter, led by strong viewership in South Africa, the Netherlands, the U.K. and Russia. 
Just as our global networks and programming are performing well, it is also important to note our IP content investments are similarly making real strides. All3, which we own through a joint venture with Liberty Global international, was nominated for 11 prime time Emmys this year, including the hit series, Undercover Boss and Penny Dreadful.
Overall, we again achieved new record reach and market share gains internationally. With 6% audience share growth across our entire global portfolio in the quarter, our audience and share gains were led by our pay-TV channels in India, Brazil and Mexico, with the Discovery Kids, TLC and Animal Planet brands driving our gains. We also saw strong delivery in the U.K., Germany and Italy as we have many pay-TV and free-to-air channels in those markets and a strong and growing share presence. Latin America once again delivered a stellar quarter with average audience up 13%. We continue to see broad-based gains in viewership across the region. Led by the Discovery Kids, Brazil's portfolio was up 23% and Mexico jumped 16%.
Our CEEMEA region posted 5% growth in average audience in the second quarter. Last week in the region, we officially announced an expanded partnership in Turkey with the Dogus Media Group, one of leading media companies in the country. Dogus is an important distribution partner for our 12 pay-TV channels in Turkey. And with this new strategic partnership, we were able to extend our portfolio with positive economics and agreed to purchase our first free-to-air channel in this emerging growth market that expands and diversifies our platforms and windows for our content in Turkey, a key market for us. We will also partner with Dogus to be our new exclusive representative for our advertising sales.
We are also deploying a free-to-air partnership strategy in the growing Middle East and North African market. In June, we announced plans to launch Quest Arabiya in the region in the fourth quarter through an agreement with Image Nation, the leading content creators in the Middle East. This free-to-air Arabic-language channel will reach 45 million homes, with the best locally produced male-oriented factual programming mixed with program from Discovery's vast global content engine. Quest Arabiya will expand Discovery's 7-network portfolio in the market, which already includes 6 pay-TV Discovery brands and the free-to-air channel, Fatafeat.
Across Europe and Asia, our investment in Eurosport continues to demonstrate progress, with the business posting a 6% increase in average audience this quarter alone. As we approach the 2018 Olympic Winter Games, we will continue to build Eurosport's offering and brand for the long term across Europe and Asia. 
Since taking control of Eurosport a little more than a year ago, we've added 7,500 hours of coverage per year, with more than 3,300 of that live, through more than 50 sports rights deals to drive viewership and strength of the offering. And Eurosport remains meaningfully profitable. Recent rights include the exclusive television and digital rights for 8 major international cycle races from 2017 to 2021 in Asia-Pacific, Wimbledon in Belgium, the PGA Tour golf in Norway and the Europa League in the Nordics. 
Beyond linear, we are bullish about the impact of the Olympics and all the local and niche sports content we are acquiring will have on driving adoption of our over-the-top products in Europe. With the Eurosport Player in 52 countries, and Dplay, which recently launched in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Italy, we are continuing to drive toward our stated goal, march to 1 million subscribers across those platforms in the next 2 years. And we now have over 300,000 subscribers as of the end of last month.
We're making real progress on our goal to maximize the linear platform, while aggressively attacking digital distribution around the world. Our strategy centers on investing in premium content to grow market share, such as the Olympics; maximizing audience reach on pay-TV platforms by locking down long-cycle agreements, like Comcast, while aggressively pushing our content to new distribution platforms, like Verizon in the U.S.; and finding new ways to monetize our content, like with Dogus in Turkey; and evolving our approach to advertising through the use of data to drive addressability, dynamic ad insertion and secondary guarantees using set-top box data. All of these efforts are designed to enhance growth in the U.S. while driving the expansion aggressively of our international footprint. Based on our 30-year track record of success, the transformative partnerships we've signed in just the past month alone and our continued global growth horizon, I believe Discovery is well positioned to grow across our 220 markets around the world for the years to come.
With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to detail our second quarter financial results."
22666093,300903366,849567,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros.

Discovery's ability to execute on key strategic global growth initiatives while focusing on tightly controlling costs lead to another quarter of solid results. On a reported basis, total company second quarter revenues increased 3% and adjusted OIBDA was down 2%. As expected, given our increasingly international business mix, the stronger dollar remained a headwind, and changes in currency rates reduced both our reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 8%. Therefore, excluding currency, revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up an impressive 11% and 6%, respectively. On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the inclusion of Eurosport and Discovery Family, total company revenues grew 4% and adjusted OIBDA grew 3%, while organic margins were flat year-over-year at 44%.
Our strong cost and content spend allocation discipline and management continues, but note that we do expect to see a significant uptick in cost domestically and internationally in the third quarter, given the timing of certain content and marketing investments. This 3Q cost uptick is embedded in our full year guidance.
Note also that because of the difficulties in separating Eurosport France from the rest of Eurosport results, we will continue to break out the impact of both transactions to the end of this year. It's important to remind people, however, that when we break out and report the combined Eurosport results for another few quarters, the benefits of our owning Eurosport extends far beyond the stand-alone Eurosport results to the rest of the Discovery portfolio in Europe and Asia through the combined distribution and ad sales leverage in each country.
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $286 million was down versus last year's second quarter net income of $379 million, primarily due to unusually large amounts related to higher foreign currency losses of $54 million from the revaluation of both our euro-denominated debt and monetary assets in Venezuela; $28 million of lower gains related to selling SBS radio this year versus gains related to HowStuffWorks and Eurosport last year; and higher restructuring and other charges this year of $19 million, primarily due to content impairment charges from canceling TLC's 19 Kids and Counting.
These all was partially offset by lower income tax expense as our effective tax rate decreased another 300 basis points year-over-year to 32%, as we remain extremely focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates. We expect our effective tax rate to be 33% for 2015 and still expect it to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017, which will continue to drive sustained income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow.
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.44 and adjusted earnings per diluted share form a relevant metric from a comparability perspective that excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.49. Excluding negative currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 4% for the quarter and up 11% for the last 12 months.
Free cash flow in the second quarter increased an impressive 55% to $313 million due to lower cash taxes, working capital improvements, lower cash interest payments and lower capital expenditures. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low single digits versus 2014 and accelerate nicely in 2016.
Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks grew revenue 5% as we benefited from another quarter of strong distribution growth, up 12% versus last year's second quarter, and a small increase in ad sales. Our advertising revenues were up slightly versus last year's second quarter as higher pricing and the consolidation of Discovery Family offset lower delivery. Total U.S. delivery did improve from the first quarter, led once again by the flagship Discovery network, but were still down low single digits versus second quarter of last year.
As David mentioned, this quarter marked our highest ad sales quarter in the company's history as we benefited from the overall market shift from an advanced upfront ad buying to higher-priced scatter volume, as we also sold a record amount of scatter ad volume. Looking ahead, we were bullish on our third quarter ad trends as our improved delivery, especially at Discovery, is allowing us to continue to take advantage of the healthier scatter market. And we expect our third quarter U.S. advertising revenue growth to modestly accelerate to low single digit. It is still too early to have a solid read on Q4. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, were up 6% this quarter, as we again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NCTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as from contributions from our new Hulu deal, which started January 1 of this year.
Organic growth decelerated from the first quarter due to tougher year-over-year SVOD comps and a decline of approximately 1% in the pay subscription universe. Given the onetime nature of the SVOD comp, we expect organic affiliate growth to accelerate slightly into the second half of the year, assuming that the rate of subscriber losses does not pick up.
I also want to address the financial impact of our recently announced Comcast renewal. We are extremely pleased with the rate structure of our new comprehensive long-term agreement that again recognizes the value of Discovery's networks. Pricing for the new deal goes into effect January 1 of next year and includes a healthy initial step-up followed by continued rate escalators over the life of the deal. This deal, along with our other recently completed deals, helps stabilize and accelerate our U.S. affiliate growth trajectory to high single digits in 2016 and significantly enhances our domestic affiliate revenue and cash flow growth expectations.
Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 1% on a reported basis, but were down 3% excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. Excluding Family, cost of revenue were up 2% while SG&A declined 11%.
Our laser focus on controlling costs led to domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 7% on a reported basis versus last year's second quarter and up 4%, excluding Family, while margins on a reported basis and excluding Family both expanded by 100 basis points year-over-year to our all-time high margin rate of 61%.
Moving on to international operations. International division drove another solid quarter of organic distribution growth, but did experience a near-term slowdown in organic advertising that is already reversing in the third quarter. On a reported basis, revenues grew 1% and reported adjusted OIBDA declined 11%. Excluding currency, revenues increased 19% and adjusted OIBDA increased 7% as changes in FX rates reduced both revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 18%, as the strong dollar versus last year remained a major headwind.
On an organic basis, so excluding currency impacts as well as Eurosport, revenues and adjusted OIBDA both increased 7%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so exclude the impact of Eurosport and FX.
The 7% second quarter revenue growth was led by 7% advertising growth and 7% distribution growth. Ad growth was led by another quarter of 20%-plus growth in Latin America, led by strong volume, pricing and delivery in Brazil as well as strength in Argentina and Mexico. Asia-Pac has also recovered nicely and grew advertising over 10%. 
 
The majority of the reasons our advertising growth rate decelerated from the first quarter were onetime in nature, namely tough comps related to the World Cup last year as well as the slowdown in the U.K. due to elections in May. But we are now seeing a nice acceleration into the third quarter.
We were also hurt in 2Q by a lower audience share in Norway. Looking forward, we still forecast full year organic advertising growth to be in the low double-digit range, though it will depend upon no further share losses in Norway.
Distribution revenues grew 7%, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rate and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. We still expect organic affiliate growth in the back half of this year to be in the mid- to high single-digit range.
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 7% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we further localize our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 7% and international organic margins were in line with last year at 38%.
Eurosport's stand-alone margin in the second quarter was 11% and we still expect margins to be in the high single-digit range for the full year. We continue to see significant strategic value of investing in additional sports IP in order to bolster and enhance both the Eurosport and total Discovery European platforms. And while these investments will drive real long-term portfolio value, they will also continue to depress margins at stand-alone Eurosport and will also limit margin expansion going forward for total D&I.
For Education and Other segment reported a small operating loss for the quarter. Given our strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content for our in-house OWN production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in education's digital textbooks to drive the long-term value of this industry-disrupting business, this segment, in total, continued to operate at a small loss for the remainder of the year.
Now taking a look at our overall financial position. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total of $207 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $6.2 billion buying back shares as we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by 30% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our own shares extremely attractive.
As we have previously stated, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating, and we'll manage our capital planning and allocation with this commitment in mind. The rating agencies have recently taken a more conservative view on the media industry, and given our current debt-to-EBITDA threshold, it's at the higher end of target levels for a BBB company. We are now focused on preserving cash for the remainder of this year.
Therefore, we now expect to have less total available capital for fiscal 2015 than we had previously stated. Including the $52 million worth of stock that we will soon buy from Advanced/Newhouse under our preexisting buyback agreement with them, we will have spent $575 million on total share buybacks this year and are unlikely to repurchase any additional common stock for the remainder of this year.
Given our capital allocation priorities remain, first and foremost, to invest and drive organic growth; and second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP; and third, to buy back our stock, for the remainder of 2015, we need to retain flexibility for additional potential strategic investments, such as our recently announced accretive and growth-driving investment with Dogus in Turkey, while continuing to pay down debt. As we look towards 2016, however, we forecast we're having meaningfully more capital available and expect the amount of capital allocated to share repurchases to increase significantly next year.
Turning to full year guidance. Excluding currency impacts, we are pleased to reaffirm that we still expect revenue growth to be in the high single to low double-digit range and adjusted OIBDA growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. Given our solid operating performance and lower tax rate trends, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS, excluding currency growth expectation, to be low double digits. These guidance ranges still include the sale of the noncore SBS radio assets, which closed at the end of the second quarter, as well as the $50 million negative non-FX-related impacts from Russia.
Before I move on to Q&A, I want to update our full year foreign exchange impact on our 2015 results. While the dollar has been less volatile, there's slightly higher currency headwinds versus when we last reported, in large part due to Venezuela. At current spot rates, FX is now expected to reduce our constant-currency-guided revenues by $440 million or roughly 7% and adjusted OIBDA by $160 million, roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results. In addition, we are now disclosing that FX will have a $0.23 to $0.28 impact on adjusted EPS versus last year reported results, assuming no further below-the-line currency adjustments.
Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures. The revenue mix in 2015 remains the same at around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks adjusted OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be around 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short to British pound as our international headquarters are in London.
Lastly, as a reminder, while we have successfully hedged a portion of our currency exposures and did realize gains from these hedges in the first half, we only hedge about 50% [ph] of our international transactional exposures. We also do not hedge translational exposures as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
In conclusion, as I look across our portfolio, I couldn't be happier with how we are currently position. Our current exposure to higher-growth international markets is 50% and growing. And while we will continue to benefit from the global evolution of pay-TV and continued audience share gains as we leverage our marquee content across our unmatched global distribution platforms, about half our global revenues are locked in for the next several years through long-term affiliate agreements, both domestically and internationally. David and I look forward to discussing our compelling and highly unique portfolio positioning in more depth at our Investor Day in September 29. 
And now we'd like to open the line up for questions."

Some of your peers have network apps that are specific to the networks. Just wondering as part of your deal, do you have the right to launch your own authenticated network app as part of the deal?

And so Comcast, together",462,"Thanks, Anthony. The Comcast was one of the final pieces of this overall strategy over the last 4 years, where we grew our viewership from 5% share of viewership on cable to 13% and to try and get more value and bigger increases. And so Comcast, together with all of our deals, to be in a position where we now can look forward and see high single-digit affiliate growth in the U.S., with all of our channels being carried, with very limited exposure to this issue of skinny bundles because almost all of our deals require that all of our channels be carried to a very high percentage of subscribers, it puts us in, I think, a very good position and makes the U.S. for us, as we look forward, a growth market. And when we say high single, we're putting in there an expectation that the U.S. -- we recognize that it's mature. It's been declining at about 1% and we think we can get high single even if that accelerates a little bit. And so the big piece here is that we've really -- we have a very good affiliate revenue stream now. And as I mentioned, we still only represent about 5% or a little bit more than 5% of the economics even though we're 13% of viewership. Before, we were at 3%, about 3.5%. So we're quite a good bargain when someone is looking for our content, whether it be new over-the-top platforms and so on. On the data piece, there is a data relationship with Comcast that we established and I think that's critical because the data inside the box is very important. Comcast's platform is probably the, if not the best, it's certainly up there. The X1 platform is terrific. It's a leader in TV Everywhere, but it also is one of the real leaders in data capture, which could help us, I think, on the monetization side. So we're all in on TV Everywhere with Comcast and with Neil. We're glad to have that deal behind us. The other piece is that we own all of our own content, which is quite unusual and I think it's going to be a very important element as you look at the future of a mature market. Because we own all of our content, we don't have long-term commitments to sports, we don't have long term -- to off network. And when we put our content on platforms, we get all the money. So it gives us the chance to move our content onto platforms but it also, to the extent that the marketplace moves in a particular direction, we have real ability to maneuver from a cost perspective, and we don't have any long-tail expensive programming costs."

I really feel like -- plus from David's comments, the fact that we do have more content cost flexibility. We're definitely demonstrating a lot of community [ph] control around other non-content costs, particularly in SG&A. And we're seeing that benefit over the last several quarters. To your point though, in 3Q, we do expect double-digit increases for both domestic and international, predominantly on the content side, and a little bit on the marketing side as we're going to put some more support and tailwind behind some of our new program launches. So there'll definitely be a cost uptick in 3Q, but definitely want to highlight the fact that, as I think about our cost structures and I think about going forward, I feel really good about our sustained level of productivity and driving SG&A in particular to be kind of in that low single to mid-single-digit range. 
The second question about the foreign exchange impact. Yes, it's -- the $0.23 to $0.28 is the latest view. That's a few cents higher than we would have thought back on our May conference call. It's really highlighting more the fact that while euro has been relatively stable, given our global reach and global expansion of our platforms, clearly, some of the other currencies, in particular, Venezuela and Brazil, have continued to be some additional headwind. So we definitely do want to, going forward, continue to highlight for everyone kind of what the impact is on our adjusted EPS."

Now that the deal is done and as you look forward into your affiliate renewals and the whole cycle when it comes to Eurosport going forward, what's the kind of operating leverage you see from this process, especially when it comes to Eurosport's margins?

And so the one element here is positioning ourselves for the future, where between Eurosport where we own all the sports IP and we have Olympic sports, many of which are top sports in particular countries, plus the Olympics, it positions us where, for the long term, for the next 10 years, we have must-have IP. And we've seen the response in the market in a meaningful way by a number of different players on all platforms, interested in talking to us about the Olympics, but also the sports content that leads up to the Olympics. So we could take you from Michael Phelps' every event right up to the gold medal. And so there's real value in that and we're trying to figure that out. On the -- when we look at how the Olympics has done in Europe -- and I was involved with the Olympics for 15 years in the U.S. NBC was quite effective in evolving the Olympics from being just a free-to-air product to free-to-air in cable, including getting incremental fees and incremental -- and lifting up the whole bundle of the NBC channels and then moving it on to other platforms. If you look at Europe, the U.S. is about 300 million -- 330 million people. Our rights in Europe are over 700 million people. But in almost every one of those markets, it's sort of where the U.S. was in 1992, basically almost only free-to-air in each country. And they had been sold to free-to-air players and to the PBS, to the public stations in each market. And so we are now the holder of that content and we will look to monetize it together with all of our assets. So I think it's a little bit of a false piece of data to look at just where Eurosport is. You'll need to take a look at what is our affiliate revenue in the aggregate doing, what is our advertising revenue in the aggregate doing, and what is our sponsorship advertising revenue in the aggregate look like. And as we mentioned earlier, we're pushing hard in over-the-top. I think we're the only company in Europe that's going directly to consumer with sports, and we have over 300,000 subscribers now that are paying us between $6 and $8 a subscriber in order to get the Eurosport programming. So for the French Open, instead of watching 3 courts, if you had 3 Eurosport channels in your country, you could watch 15 courts. On cycling, you can follow 15 cyclists. And so this is -- we're really looking to restructure our company for significant growth in the future by better IP, while at the same time, growing our linear platforms. And I think the Olympics, together with Eurosport, allows us to do that."

And we're the largest pay-TV player around the world but -- internationally. But in Europe, we are now by far the largest pay-TV media company. And the scale that we've been able to get by the growth of our pay-TV, together with free-to-air, puts us in a much better position as we sit down with distributors. And what's happened is a lot of other companies that are local, because of the fact that most countries are either in recession or flat and it's been a long haul, a lot of the local companies have spent less on content, which has helped us gain share. And a lot of the players from outside have taken cost out and done the opposite. Rather than go local and spend more on content, reduced. And so our market share is up.

There have been several months in the last 8 months where Discovery has been, with a core structure that's very different from entertainment and sports channels, to be the #1 cable channel. And remember, 80% of that content we get to reuse around the world. We don't rent it for just the U.S. So it's a very effective model. We also have seen that the amount of time that our content is DVR-ed has gone up significantly, [indiscernible] much people want our content. And we're excited about going full in to TV Everywhere. We think we'll learn more about that. Our deal with Verizon in Europe, we're talking to a lot of different players. So I think we're at value gap right now. We were able to reach it with Verizon. We think our content is more valuable. We could be on every SVOD platform if we wanted to. But since we own all of our content, we could also go directly to consumer, which is very possible. And we're doing it throughout in Europe now with sports, across all of Europe. We're doing it in -- with entertainment content and sports content in a number of countries in Northern Europe and in Italy. And so we have all that flexibility. My only point on the upside is that in a declining market where people are choosing channels, the fact that we're 13% -- our 14 channels are 13% of viewership on cable and we're only 5% of the money, that's not something to brag about. We were much lower. The good news is we've gotten a significant step-up and big increases. But the -- I think the other piece of good news for us is that when people are looking to launch channels, they can get our channels, whether they took 8 of them or took 13 of them or 14 of them. And even if we charge more, it's a lot less expensive than maybe -- than most of the channels. There are a lot of the entertainment and sports channels that are in the inverse. They might have 5% of viewership and be 20% of the money. So I think it makes us quite attractive. But also, as we continue to make our case over the next several years, we grew share in the last couple of months. A lot of others are losing share. And so the fact that if we can continue to gain share as our deals come up, we'll continue to do what we've done over the last 4 years, which is make the value argument that we're under-indexing on economics and trying to continue to drive our affiliate line even in a marketplace that has some decline on subscribers."

The fact that we have higher fees locked in and we can be in a position where we could say now that, even if the advertising market is weak and it ends up being flat, we still have a mid-single-growth U.S. business, which is only half of our company. And most of -- a lot of our growth is coming from outside the U.S., where there's still double digit or better growth and the kind of general growth dynamics that we saw in the U.S. historically. The idea of going directly to consumers is something we have every opportunity to do. We own all of our content. We have superfan groups, so I think we're very well positioned. We're looking at everything. But I think the marketplace, at least for the next 3 years, is going to stay relatively stable, and we'll probably have more people buying our content.

And what we're finding is in most cases, they're watching more Eurosport. But when they're out of their home, they want to be able to watch the sports they like. So for the near term at least, we're double dipping. And the idea of having more than 300,000 people that we have their credit card, we have a direct relationship, we could talk to them about what they like about our app, what they don't, we're learning an awful lot so that if we want to move into any other region, we can."

When you're looking at Europe, you're looking at 55 countries and 20 languages and different regulations in each country. The good news for us is that's what we do for a living. We're already in all 55 of those countries. We have teams on the ground. We have an infrastructure that converts into every language. And so for us, it is what we do for a living. On the Olympics side, there are specific restrictions that the IOC has on how much has to be free-to-air for summer and for winter. And in some countries, there are requirement's that are -- in addition to the IOC requirements on free-to-air. We own all the rights. And so for instance, in the U.K., if the BBC has the rights, then we would sit down with them historically, and we can talk about how much we want to give them. We would look in most cases to preserve all the rights other than free-to-air. So we could sub-distribute the free-to-air rights. In many markets we have free-to-air channels that meet the requirements: in Italy, in Germany, in Spain, in the U.K., in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland. So there are a lot of markets where we have the free-to-air rights. And in that case, we'll have to decide, are we better of selling it to someone in that market, the free-to-air only? Maybe we sell 60% to the rights, hold back 40% for cable and then hold back all the rights for phone and other devices to go directly. We have plenty of time to think about it. The good news is it's been just free-to-air. And so when you look back at the early '90s when Ebersol came up with this idea of you can be your own producer. You could watch this on broadcast, swimming, but you could see driving and you could see cycling and you could see judo on cable. We could bring that to Europe and I think it could be quite effective. And we have the ability to make those decisions. And we have the ability in many cases, in many of the big markets, to go all in ourselves if we want to. And so I think that gives us very good optionality."

But as I look at what you're doing now in Europe with the Olympics, it seems like you are actually getting into some of the sports kind of very long-term big number commitments despite the rapidly changing landscape. And then, just when you look at your commentary about kind of the ability to hit subscription numbers, clearly, we've gone from a video subscription base that's been growing to a video subscription base that's now declining. What gives you confidence that a 1%-ish decline, or even a little larger than that, is reasonable? Why can't it be 4% or 5%? And the same thing with advertising. It seems like both advertising and subscription have gone from growth to kind of flat to negative. What gives you confidence that you can keep them in moderation on the decline side or even towards flat?"

First of all, on the advertising side, we saw flat to slightly negative in fourth and first. We're now seeing a rising advertising. So I can't opine on where the advertising market is going to go, but I can say that the pricing in scatter has been good and that the market has picked up. I don't know if it'll continue to. On the affiliate side, we've been able to get a step-up. So over the last 4 years, when your new deal comes in, we a step-up and then we get increases. And even assuming that there's some decline, we see some very good affiliate growth over the next several years and that we're okay. And so the way that we look at it is I say, ""Okay, if we got high single affiliate growth, even if there's some decline, and if the advertising market is even weak, then we still have a mid-single growth business here in the U.S. And if we -- and having that with a cost basis that's very manageable and probably lower than most, where we get to reuse our content around the world, we then use that mid-single-growth business to fuel 65% or 70% of the content we need around the world where we're seeing much higher growth. And most of those countries outside the U.S. are not experiencing what you're talking about. They're getting advertising growth. They're getting affiliate growth. Our market share is growing. And so I think we've really stabilized the U.S. business. I feel good about it. If you put in a lot of the parade, we still have a nice mid-single-growth business. We're not assuming that there's a dramatic jump tilt and tip. But I don't see any, despite all the headlines and discussion, anything that would make me in any way concerned that there's a tilt, a meaningful tilt or tip over here. There's a -- this is a mature market that's showing some decline. And we've stabilized it and put ourselves in a position for growth here. On the Europe side, we've actually done the opposite of what you have said. The only big-ticket item that we've gotten is the Olympics. We paid a little less than $1.5 billion for 4 Olympic Games that -- where we have very little cost until 2018. And we'll begin to get the Olympic library and the Rings to use on Eurosport and use on Eurosport.com, which is the leader online, beginning right after Rio. The rest of the sports rights that we've gotten, and we've done over 50 deals, are -- most of the money goes to soccer. Soccer is like the NFL times 2 in Europe. And distributors are fighting over who gets to get the soccer. We've opted out of that game and we think we can get everything else and we can do it on a very reasonable basis. And we can monetize it on our European platform and we can monetize it direct to consumer and online. We carry the clips of soccer on Eurosport.com, which is the equivalent of ESPN.com here in the U.S. It's the leading online site. But we don't need to own soccer. And so we have the Olympics together with a dominant position on -- in everything else, which I think -- now that we own the Olympics and we have relationship with the federations, we don't see that the prices of speedskating is going to go up dramatically. And in fact, in some of the markets where people have bid on soccer, they bid so much money that they've come to us and said, ""Would you -- Do you want to buy some of our other sports rights because we just had a step-up with such increases on soccer."" So we think Eurosport will be EBITDA positive in itself and will lift our overall portfolio. And when you think of Eurosport as being in 130 million homes, and then another 2 or 3 sports channels, and you think of where ESPN was years ago, we haven't begun to monetize the subscriber economics. We haven't begun to aggressively -- we only started selling locally 4 months ago. We haven't begun to monetize the advertising piece and we have the IP and the Olympics. If we could do a little of what Iger has been able to do over the last 15 years in gaining significant subscribers, building on the dominant platform that he has, we can -- and using it to build the rest of his company, we could have a hell of a business. And he did it with -- in a marketplace that has 330 million homes. We're the leader in sports and have the Olympics for the next decade in a market that has 700 million homes. But we're not going to do the NFL. We're not going to do soccer."

Discovery's strong start to the year continued in the second quarter, with steady growth across our global portfolio of brands and businesses. Propelled from a strong second quarter into what was a momentous start to the third quarter, I join you extremely confident in Discovery's future growth prospects.
I believe we will look back on July 2015 as the pivotal month in our company's history as we announced 3 transformative agreements: multiplatform rights to the Olympic Games in Europe for the next decade; deal to acquire 100% control of Eurosport; and lastly, a favorable long-term renewal with Comcast for our U.S. Network portfolio and distribution on the XFinity Comcast platform. These deals together stabilize and enhance our U.S. growth profile, continue our diversification internationally and give us more blue-chip IP content and more distribution so we can continue to drive audience share across all consumer platforms.
Earlier this month, we announced an exclusive deal in Europe, with the IOC for all of the TV and multi-platform media rights to the 4 Olympic Games from 2018 to 2024. Never before has one media company been granted all rights on all platforms across Europe.
We believe the Olympic Games will be a foundation programming piece for Eurosport and Discovery across the continent. Eurosport already dedicates over 40% to its programming schedule to Olympic sports and bolstering our rights and offerings with the world's greatest sporting event is a perfect editorial and strategic fit for the linear channel and for Eurosport.com, the leading online sports platform in Europe.
Combined with full access to the Olympic programming archive, our use of the Olympic Rings immediately following Rio and our existing sports federation agreements, this deal will substantially strengthen the Eurosport platform and bring the Olympic Games to more viewers on more platforms across Europe than ever before. We will maximize our reach to Europe's 700 million residents across platforms. Following the June 29 Olympic announcement, we have seen an increase in conversations and feedback from our European distributors, advertising partners and phone and new media players who want to work more closely with us. 
Soon after the Olympic deal, we struck an agreement to acquire full ownership of Eurosport from the TF1 group. In 2012, we began our investment with a 20% stake in Eurosport and increased that investment to 51% more than a year ago. Taking full control of Eurosport allows us to further strengthen the brand and decision-making process, more readily secure important sports rights on a local or pan-regional basis and fully realize the business' growth potential. Eurosport's 2 or 3 channels across 130 million homes, Eurosport.com, now the Olympics for the next decade makes us the clear leader in sports in Europe.
Finally, the third transaction was signing a long-term distribution agreement with Comcast. Our renewal with Comcast is significant. It demonstrates that distributors continue to place great value on our content and brands with meaningful increases, and it solidifies our TV Everywhere strategy with deployment on XFinity, the primary TV Everywhere platform in the U.S.
4 years ago, we said we would reset our domestic affiliate rate structure with a step-up and more meaningful increases to reflect our increased investment in content and the growth of our audience share that our channel brands had earned. I'm proud to say that we've achieved it. Prior to this renewal cycle, our deals had price escalators at CPI, but we have now reset all of our affiliate agreements that have come up in the last 4 years, which is the majority, at a meaningful rate increase that reflects the strength of our brands and our increased market share. Andy will give you more details. But today, we are positioned for long-term growth in the United States. Locking up that long-cycle money with strong price escalators allows us to focus on other aspects of the business and gives our U.S. business a steady growth rate for years to come. 
And there's still real opportunity for value creation even on the affiliate side going forward. At 13% share of viewing, where we're only getting a mid-single-digit share of affiliate fees even with our increases, there is still a gap to close in the future as well, which we see as real opportunity in the years ahead, even in a marketplace like the U.S. that is relatively flat and challenged.
Combined with our multiple TV Everywhere rights deals signed in the past 2 years, we are now accelerating the expansion of streaming choices for our content across platforms and diversifying our distribution channels with multiple partners. It's positive when new entrants come into the market, particularly when you have the #1 channel in America for men, the Discovery Channel; several top channels for women; and the top channel for African-American women with OWN, all at a price point that is a very good value, which gives us a real advantage. 
Today, I'm pleased to announce an agreement with Verizon to bring long- and short-form content from Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, ID and the Science channel, including full episodes of prior seasons of hit shows to Verizon's U.S. mobile subscribers. This deal extends our platform reach to Verizon customers beyond our traditional pay-TV customer base, and adds yet another source to our distribution revenue stream.
While we drive to extend the delivery of our content to new platforms, we also are working to maximize and exploit our traditional business in the U.S. Headwinds notwithstanding, the U.S. pay-TV marketplace remains one of the world's most important programming and advertising markets. Long term, we are evolving our approach to integrate advertising more deeply into our content, adding more branded integrations, pushing programmatic buying and driving higher CPMs from the scatter marketplace.
In the second quarter in the U.S., revenue growth yet again outpaced cost increases and adjusted OIBDA reached an all-time high. Hitting these metrics illustrates the strong command and control we have over our business. 
We have seen advertising market momentum pick up across all of our channels so far in Q3 as we continue to benefit from ratings outperformance, driven by the flagship, Discovery Channel. Led by new President, Rich Ross, the Discovery Channel team has done a fantastic job of creating and building programming that nourishes Discovery's core male viewers, while attracting more diverse audiences, including women, millennials, Hispanic viewers and family co-viewing.
For the quarter, Discovery's prime time delivery with persons 25- 54 rose 12%, and 9% with men 25-54, and 16% with women 25-54. The network ranked as the #4 channel in ad-supported cable for persons 25-54, up 2 spots from a year ago; and with women 25-54, rose 7 spots to #9.
Discovery held all of cable's top 5 unscripted series for men: Deadliest Catch, Naked and Afraid, Alaskan Bush People, Fast N' Loud and Street Outlaws. More recently, Shark Week, which aired a month earlier this year, continues to be a pop culture juggernaut. With a science-based slate of programming that reinforced Discovery Channel's heritage, Shark Week 2015 became our highest rated ever among persons 25-54 and women 25-54. And Discovery Channel's performance in July, outside of Shark Week, was strong as prime time delivery jumped 34% for persons 25-54 and 26% for men and 50% for women in the same age bracket, all making Discovery Channel the #1 channel for men for the month of July. 
Internationally, Discovery Channel again reached a record audience as many of our tent-pole shows replicated their success globally. Discovery Channel showed particular strength in India, Brazil and Mexico, where our share of audience rose more than 20%. 
ID also posted strong viewership gains in the U.S. and abroad in the second quarter. ID's U.S. delivery rose 7% and it was a top 3 ad-supported cable network with women 25-54 in total day, top 3. ID's average international audience rose a record 23% for the quarter, fueled by new market launches and organic viewership growth, including the June launch of ID in Sweden. 
On TLC, we have moved forward with new series that speak to what the TLC brand is best at: holding a mirror to the culture and telling stories in a thoughtful and sensitive way. There are no better examples than I Am Jazz, a heartwarming new series about a transgender teen and her loving family. In its premiere, the series posted 1.8 million viewers. And My Giant Life, a new series that chronicles the remarkable stories of the world's tallest women and has averaged nearly 2 million total viewers. These shows will soon be joined by returning series, Our Little Family and the Little Couple. Meanwhile TLC's viewership overseas continues to grow. TLC's average international audience rose 15% in the second quarter, led by strong viewership in South Africa, the Netherlands, the U.K. and Russia. 
Just as our global networks and programming are performing well, it is also important to note our IP content investments are similarly making real strides. All3, which we own through a joint venture with Liberty Global international, was nominated for 11 prime time Emmys this year, including the hit series, Undercover Boss and Penny Dreadful.
Overall, we again achieved new record reach and market share gains internationally. With 6% audience share growth across our entire global portfolio in the quarter, our audience and share gains were led by our pay-TV channels in India, Brazil and Mexico, with the Discovery Kids, TLC and Animal Planet brands driving our gains. We also saw strong delivery in the U.K., Germany and Italy as we have many pay-TV and free-to-air channels in those markets and a strong and growing share presence. Latin America once again delivered a stellar quarter with average audience up 13%. We continue to see broad-based gains in viewership across the region. Led by the Discovery Kids, Brazil's portfolio was up 23% and Mexico jumped 16%.
Our CEEMEA region posted 5% growth in average audience in the second quarter. Last week in the region, we officially announced an expanded partnership in Turkey with the Dogus Media Group, one of leading media companies in the country. Dogus is an important distribution partner for our 12 pay-TV channels in Turkey. And with this new strategic partnership, we were able to extend our portfolio with positive economics and agreed to purchase our first free-to-air channel in this emerging growth market that expands and diversifies our platforms and windows for our content in Turkey, a key market for us. We will also partner with Dogus to be our new exclusive representative for our advertising sales.
We are also deploying a free-to-air partnership strategy in the growing Middle East and North African market. In June, we announced plans to launch Quest Arabiya in the region in the fourth quarter through an agreement with Image Nation, the leading content creators in the Middle East. This free-to-air Arabic-language channel will reach 45 million homes, with the best locally produced male-oriented factual programming mixed with program from Discovery's vast global content engine. Quest Arabiya will expand Discovery's 7-network portfolio in the market, which already includes 6 pay-TV Discovery brands and the free-to-air channel, Fatafeat.
Across Europe and Asia, our investment in Eurosport continues to demonstrate progress, with the business posting a 6% increase in average audience this quarter alone. As we approach the 2018 Olympic Winter Games, we will continue to build Eurosport's offering and brand for the long term across Europe and Asia. 
Since taking control of Eurosport a little more than a year ago, we've added 7,500 hours of coverage per year, with more than 3,300 of that live, through more than 50 sports rights deals to drive viewership and strength of the offering. And Eurosport remains meaningfully profitable. Recent rights include the exclusive television and digital rights for 8 major international cycle races from 2017 to 2021 in Asia-Pacific, Wimbledon in Belgium, the PGA Tour golf in Norway and the Europa League in the Nordics. 
Beyond linear, we are bullish about the impact of the Olympics and all the local and niche sports content we are acquiring will have on driving adoption of our over-the-top products in Europe. With the Eurosport Player in 52 countries, and Dplay, which recently launched in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Italy, we are continuing to drive toward our stated goal, march to 1 million subscribers across those platforms in the next 2 years. And we now have over 300,000 subscribers as of the end of last month.
We're making real progress on our goal to maximize the linear platform, while aggressively attacking digital distribution around the world. Our strategy centers on investing in premium content to grow market share, such as the Olympics; maximizing audience reach on pay-TV platforms by locking down long-cycle agreements, like Comcast, while aggressively pushing our content to new distribution platforms, like Verizon in the U.S.; and finding new ways to monetize our content, like with Dogus in Turkey; and evolving our approach to advertising through the use of data to drive addressability, dynamic ad insertion and secondary guarantees using set-top box data. All of these efforts are designed to enhance growth in the U.S. while driving the expansion aggressively of our international footprint. Based on our 30-year track record of success, the transformative partnerships we've signed in just the past month alone and our continued global growth horizon, I believe Discovery is well positioned to grow across our 220 markets around the world for the years to come.
With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to detail our second quarter financial results."
22666093,300903366,849814,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Discovery's ability to execute on key strategic global growth initiatives while focusing on tightly controlling costs lead to another quarter of solid results. On a reported basis, total compan",2330,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Discovery's ability to execute on key strategic global growth initiatives while focusing on tightly controlling costs lead to another quarter of solid results. On a reported basis, total company second quarter revenues increased 3% and adjusted OIBDA was down 2%. As expected, given our increasingly international business mix, the stronger dollar remained a headwind, and changes in currency rates reduced both our reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 8%. Therefore, excluding currency, revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up an impressive 11% and 6%, respectively. On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the inclusion of Eurosport and Discovery Family, total company revenues grew 4% and adjusted OIBDA grew 3%, while organic margins were flat year-over-year at 44%.
Our strong cost and content spend allocation discipline and management continues, but note that we do expect to see a significant uptick in costs domestically and internationally in the third quarter, given the timing of certain content and marketing investments. This 3Q cost uptick is embedded in our full year guidance.
Note also that because of the difficulties in separating Eurosport France from the rest of Eurosport results, we will continue to break out the impact of both transactions to the end of this year. It's important to remind people, however, that when we break out and report the combined Eurosport results for another few quarters, the benefits of our owning Eurosport extends far beyond the stand-alone Eurosport results to the rest of the Discovery portfolio in Europe and Asia through the combined distribution and ad sales leverage in each country.
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $286 million was down versus last year's second quarter net income of $379 million, primarily due to unusually large amounts related to higher foreign currency losses of $54 million from the revaluation of both our euro-denominated debt and monetary assets in Venezuela; $28 million of lower gains related to selling SBS radio this year versus gains related to HowStuffWorks and Eurosport last year; and higher restructuring and other charges this year of $19 million, primarily due to content impairment charges from canceling TLC's 19 Kids and Counting.
These all was partially offset by lower income tax expense as our effective tax rate decreased another 300 basis points year-over-year to 32%, as we remain extremely focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates. We expect our effective tax rate to be 33% for 2015 and still expect it to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017, which will continue to drive sustained income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow.
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.44 and adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective, that excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.49. Excluding negative currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 4% for the quarter and up 11% for the last 12 months.
Free cash flow in the second quarter increased an impressive 55% to $313 million due to lower cash taxes, working capital improvements, lower cash interest payments and lower capital expenditures. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low single digits versus 2014 and accelerate nicely in 2016.
Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks grew revenue 5% as we benefited from another quarter of strong distribution growth, up 12% versus last year's second quarter, and a small increase in ad sales. Our advertising revenues were up slightly versus last year's second quarter as higher pricing and the consolidation of Discovery Family offset lower delivery. Total U.S. delivery did improve from the first quarter, led once again by the flagship Discovery network, but were still down low single digits versus second quarter of last year.
As David mentioned, this quarter marked our highest ad sales quarter in the company's history as we benefited from the overall market shift from an advanced upfront ad buying to higher-priced scatter volume, as we also sold a record amount of scatter ad volume. Looking ahead, we were bullish on our third quarter ad trends as our improved delivery, especially at Discovery, is allowing us to continue to take advantage of the healthier scatter market. And we expect our third quarter U.S. advertising revenue growth to modestly accelerate to low single digit. It is still too early to have a solid read on Q4. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, were up 6% this quarter, as we again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NCTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as from contributions from our new Hulu deal, which started January 1 of this year.
Organic growth decelerated from the first quarter due to tougher year-over-year SVOD comps and a decline of approximately 1% in the pay subscription universe. Given the onetime nature of the SVOD comp, we expect organic affiliate growth to accelerate slightly into the second half of the year, assuming that the rate of subscriber losses does not pick up.
I also want to address the financial impact of our recently announced Comcast renewal. We are extremely pleased with the rate structure of our new comprehensive long-term agreement that again recognizes the value of Discovery's networks. Pricing for the new deal goes into effect January 1 of next year and includes a healthy initial step-up followed by continued rate escalators over the life of the deal. This deal, along with our other recently completed deals, helps stabilize and accelerate our U.S. affiliate growth trajectory to high single digits in 2016 and significantly enhances our domestic affiliate revenue and cash flow growth expectations.
Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 1% on a reported basis, but were down 3% excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. Excluding Family, cost of revenue were up 2% while SG&A declined 11%.
Our laser focus on controlling costs led to a domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 7% on a reported basis versus last year's second quarter and up 4%, excluding Family, while margins on a reported basis and excluding Family both expanded by 100 basis points year-over-year to our all-time high margin rate of 61%.
Moving on to international operations. International division drove another solid quarter of organic distribution growth, but did experience a near-term slowdown in organic advertising that is already reversing in the third quarter. On a reported basis, revenues grew 1% and reported adjusted OIBDA declined 11%. Excluding currency, revenues increased 19% and adjusted OIBDA increased 7% as changes in FX rates reduced both revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 18%, as the strong dollar versus last year remained a major headwind.
On an organic basis, so excluding currency impacts as well as Eurosport, revenues and adjusted OIBDA both increased 7%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so exclude the impact of Eurosport and FX.
The 7% second quarter revenue growth was led by 7% advertising growth and 7% distribution growth. Ad growth was led by another quarter of 20%-plus growth in Latin America, led by strong volume, pricing and delivery in Brazil as well as strength in Argentina and Mexico. Asia-Pac has also recovered nicely and grew advertising over 10%. 
 
The majority of the reasons our advertising growth rate decelerated from the first quarter were onetime in nature, namely tough comps related to the World Cup last year as well as the slowdown in the U.K. due to elections in May. But we are now seeing a nice acceleration into the third quarter.
We were also hurt in 2Q by a lower audience share in Norway. Looking forward, we still forecast full year organic advertising growth to be in the low double-digit range, though it will depend upon no further share losses in Norway.
Distribution revenues grew 7%, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rate and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. We still expect organic affiliate growth in the back half of this year to be in the mid- to high single-digit range.
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 7% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we further localize our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 7% and international organic margins were in line with last year at 38%.
Eurosport's stand-alone margin in the second quarter was 11% and we still expect margins to be in the high single-digit range for the full year. We continue to see significant strategic value of investing in additional sports IP in order to bolster and enhance both the Eurosport and total Discovery European platforms. And while these investments will drive real long-term portfolio value, they will also continue to depress margins at stand-alone Eurosport and will also limit margin expansion going forward for total D&I.
For Education and Other segment reported a small operating loss for the quarter. Given our strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content for our in-house, owned production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in education's digital textbooks to drive the long-term value of this industry-disrupting business, this segment, in total, continued to operate at a small loss for the remainder of the year.
Now taking a look at our overall financial position. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total of $207 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $6.2 billion buying back shares as we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by 30% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our own shares extremely attractive.
As we have previously stated, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating, and we will manage our capital planning and allocation with this commitment in mind. The rating agencies have recently taken a more conservative view on the media industry, and given our current debt-to-EBITDA threshold, it's at the higher end of target levels for a BBB company. We are now focused on preserving cash for the remainder of this year.
Therefore, we now expect to have less total available capital for fiscal 2015 than we had previously stated. Including the $52 million worth of stock that we will soon buy from Advance/Newhouse under our preexisting buyback agreement with them, we will have spent $575 million on total share buybacks this year and are unlikely to repurchase any additional common stock for the remainder of this year.
Given our capital allocation priorities remain, first and foremost, to invest and drive organic growth; and second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP; and third, to buy back our stock, for the remainder of 2015, we need to retain flexibility for additional potential strategic investments, such as our recently announced accretive and growth-driving investment with Dogus in Turkey, while continuing to pay down debt. As we look towards 2016, however, we forecast we're having meaningfully more capital available and expect the amount of capital allocated to share repurchases to increase significantly next year.
Turning to full year guidance. Excluding currency impacts, we are pleased to reaffirm that we still expect revenue growth to be in the high single to low double-digit range and adjusted OIBDA growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. Given our solid operating performance and lower tax rate trends, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS, excluding currency growth expectation, to be low double digits. These guidance ranges still include the sale of the noncore SBS radio assets, which closed at the end of the second quarter, as well as the $50 million negative non-FX-related impacts from Russia.
Before I move on to Q&A, I want to update our full year foreign exchange impact on our 2015 results. While the dollar has been less volatile, there's slightly higher currency headwinds versus when we last reported, in large part due to Venezuela. At current spot rates, FX is now expected to reduce our constant-currency guided revenues by $440 million or roughly 7% and adjusted OIBDA by $160 million, roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results. In addition, we are now disclosing that FX will have a $0.23 to $0.28 impact on adjusted EPS versus last year reported results, assuming no further below-the-line currency adjustments.
Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures. The revenue mix in 2015 remains the same at around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks adjusted OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be around 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short the British pound as our international headquarters are in London.
Lastly, as a reminder, while we have successfully hedged a portion of our currency exposures and did realize gains from these hedges in the first half, we only hedge about 60% of our international transactional exposures. We also do not hedge translational exposures as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
In conclusion, as I look across our portfolio, I couldn't be happier with how we are currently positioned. Our current exposure to higher-growth international markets is 50% and growing. And while we will continue to benefit from the global evolution of pay-TV and continued audience share gains as we leverage our marquee content across our unmatched global distribution platforms, about half our global revenues are locked in for the next several years through long-term affiliate agreements, both domestically and internationally. David and I look forward to discussing our compelling and highly unique portfolio positioning in more depth at our Investor Day on September 29. 
And now we'd like to open the line up for questions."

And so Comcast, together",461,"Thanks, Anthony. The Comcast was one of the final pieces of this overall strategy over the last 4 years, where we grew our viewership from 5% share of viewership on cable to 13% and to try and get more value and bigger increases. And so Comcast, together with all of our deals, to be in a position where we now can look forward and see high single-digit affiliate growth in the U.S., with all of our channels being carried, with very limited exposure to this issue of skinny bundles because almost all of our deals require that all of our channels be carried to a very high percentage of subscribers, it puts us in, I think, a very good position and makes the U.S. for us, as we look forward, a growth market. And when we say high single, we're putting in there an expectation that the U.S. -- we recognize that it's mature, it's been declining at about 1% and we think we can get high single even if that accelerates a little bit. And so the big piece here is that we've really -- we have a very good affiliate revenue stream now. And as I mentioned, we still only represent about 5% or a little bit more than 5% of the economics even though we're 13% of viewership. Before, we were at 3% or 3.5%. So we're quite a good bargain when someone is looking for our content, whether it be new over-the-top platforms and so on. On the data piece, there is a data relationship with Comcast that we established and I think that's critical because the data inside the box is very important. Comcast's platform is probably the, if not the best, it's certainly up there. The X1 platform is terrific. It's a leader in TV Everywhere, but it also is one of the real leaders in data capture, which could help us, I think, on the monetization side. So we're all in on TV Everywhere with Comcast and with Neil. We're glad to have that deal behind us. The other piece is that we own all of our own content, which is quite unusual and I think it's going to be a very important element as you look at the future of a mature market. Because we own all of our content, we don't have long-term commitments to sports, we don't have long term commitment to off-network. And when we put our content on platforms, we get all the money. So it gives us the chance to move our content onto platforms but it also, to the extent that the marketplace moves in a particular direction, we have real ability to maneuver from a cost perspective, and we don't have any long-tail expensive programming costs."

I really feel like -- plus from David's comments the fact that we do have more content cost flexibility. We definitely are demonstrating a lot of command and control around other non-content costs, particularly in SG&A. And we're seeing that benefit over the last several quarters. To your point though, in 3Q, we do expect double-digit increases for both domestic and international, predominantly on the content side, and a little bit on the marketing side as we're going to put some more support and tailwind behind some of our new program launches. So there'll definitely be a cost uptick in 3Q, but definitely want to highlight the fact that, as I think about our cost structures and I think about going forward, I feel really good about our sustained level of productivity and driving SG&A in particular to be kind of in that low single to mid-single-digit range. 
The second question about the foreign exchange impact. Yes, it's -- the $0.23 to $0.28 is the latest view. That's a few cents higher than we would have thought back on our May conference call. It's really highlighting more the fact that while euro has been relatively stable, given our global reach and global expansion of our platforms, clearly, some of the other currencies, in particular, Venezuela and Brazil, have continued to be some additional headwind. So we definitely do want to, going forward, continue to highlight for everyone kind of what the impact is on our adjusted EPS."

Now that the deal is done and as you look forward into your affiliate renewals and the whole cycle when it comes to Eurosport going forward, what's the kind of operating leverage you see from this process, especially when it comes to Eurosport's margins? I mean, you guys are still at the high single-digits kind of margin profile. And once this process is completed, are we looking at a substantial bump over where Eurosport was when you guys acquired this asset?"

Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Well, look, I think exactly how the Olympics will play out long term and the impact, some of it -- one of the reasons why we were really keen about getting the Olympics for the next decade and we get the Rings and the library and access right after Rio, i",525,"Well, look, I think exactly how the Olympics will play out long term and the impact, some of it -- one of the reasons why we were really keen about getting the Olympics for the next decade and we get the Rings and the library and access right after Rio, is that we have it on all platforms. And so the one element here is positioning ourselves for the future, where between Eurosport where we own all the sports IP and we have Olympic sports, many of which are top sports in particular countries, plus the Olympics, it positions us where, for the long term, for the next 10 years, we have must-have IP. And we've seen the response in the market in a meaningful way by a number of different players on all platforms, interested in talking to us about the Olympics, but also the sports content that leads up to the Olympics. So we could take you from Michael Phelps' every event right up to the gold medal. And so there's real value in that and we're trying to figure that out. On the -- when we look at how the Olympics has done in Europe -- and I was involved with the Olympics for 15 years in the U.S. NBC was quite effective in evolving the Olympics from being just a free-to-air product to free-to-air in cable, including getting incremental fees and incremental -- and lifting up the whole bundle of the NBC channels and then moving it on to other platforms. If you look at Europe, the U.S. is about 300 million -- 330 million people. Our rights in Europe are over 700 million people. But in almost every one of those markets, it's sort of where the U.S. was in 1992, basically almost only free-to-air in each country. And they had been sold to free-to-air players and to the PBS, to the public stations in each market. And so we are now the holder of that content and we will look to monetize it together with all of our assets. So I think it's a little bit of a false piece of data to look at just where Eurosport is. You'll need to take a look at what is our affiliate revenue in the aggregate doing, what is our advertising revenue in the aggregate doing, and what is our sponsorship advertising revenue in the aggregate look like. And as we mentioned earlier, we're pushing hard in over-the-top. I think we're the only company in Europe that's going directly to consumer with sports, and we have over 300,000 subscribers now that are paying us between $6 and $8 a subscriber in order to get the Eurosport programming. So for the French Open, instead of watching 3 courts, if you had 3 Eurosport channels in your country, you could watch 15 courts. On cycling, you can follow 15 cyclists. And so this is -- we're really looking to restructure our company for significant growth in the future by better IP, while at the same time, growing our linear platforms. And I think the Olympics, together with Eurosport, allows us to do that."

And we've gone local in those markets. We've launched free-to-air channels that are very low cost where we use our content to reach some markets that have low pay-TV, and we've done some more local content in markets. And we're the largest pay-TV player around the world but -- internationally. But in Europe, we are now by far the largest pay-TV media company. And the scale that we've been able to get by the growth of our pay-TV, together with free-to-air, puts us in a much better position as we sit down with distributors. And what's happened is a lot of other companies that are local, because of the fact that most countries are either in recession or flat and it's been a long haul, a lot of the local companies have spent less on content, which has helped us gain share. And a lot of the players from outside have taken cost out and done the opposite. Rather than go local and spend more on content, reduced. And so our market share is up. So we think that Eurosport and the Olympics, together with our market share being up and people spending more time with our channels, gives us, over the next several years, some upside as we push for higher pricing. And we intend to do that and we've started to."

In July, to have Discovery be the #1 cable channel in America for men, there have been several months in the last 8 months where Discovery has been, with a cost structure that's very different from entertainment and sports channels, to be the #1 cable channel -- and remember, 80% of that content we get to reuse around the world. We don't rent it for just the U.S. So it's a very effective model. We also have seen that the amount of time that our content is DVR-ed has gone up significantly, which is a real.
[Audio Gap]
much people want our content. And we're excited about going full in to TV Everywhere. We think we'll learn more about that. Our deal with Verizon in Europe, we're talking to a lot of different players. So I think we're at value gap right now. We were able to reach it with Verizon. We think our content is more valuable. We could be on every SVOD platform if we wanted to. But since we own all of our content, we could also go directly to consumer, which is very possible. And we're doing it throughout in Europe now with sports, across all of Europe. We're doing it in -- with entertainment content and sports content in a number of countries in Northern Europe and in Italy. And so we have all that flexibility. My only point on the upside is that in a declining market where people are choosing channels, the fact that we're 13% -- our 14 channels are 13% of viewership on cable and we're only 5% of the money, that's not something to brag about. We were much lower. The good news is we've gotten a significant step-up and big increases. But the -- I think the other piece of good news for us is that when people are looking to launch channels, they can get our channels, whether they took 8 of them or took 13 of them or 14 of them. And even if we charge more, it's a lot less expensive than maybe -- than most of the channels. There are a lot of the entertainment and sports channels that are in the inverse. They might have 5% of viewership and be 20% of the money. So I think it makes us quite attractive. But also, as we continue to make our case over the next several years, we grew share in the last couple of months. A lot of others are losing share. And so the fact that if we can continue to gain share as our deals come up, we'll continue to do what we've done over the last 4 years, which is make the value argument that we're under-indexing on economics and trying to continue to drive our affiliate line even in a marketplace that has some decline on subscribers."

But I was at NBC when viewership on the networks were declining. They're still declining. The fact that subscribers are going down 1%, maybe it grows to 1.5%, that's not a good thing. The fact that we have higher fees locked in and we can be in a position where we could say now that, even if the advertising market is weak and it ends up being flat, we still have a mid-single-growth U.S. business, which is only half of our company. And most of -- a lot of our growth is coming from outside the U.S., where there's still double digit or better growth and the kind of general growth dynamics that we saw in the U.S. historically. The idea of going directly to consumers is something we have every opportunity to do. We own all of our content. We have superfan groups, so I think we're very well positioned. We're looking at everything. But I think the marketplace, at least for the next 3 years, is going to stay relatively stable, and we'll probably have more people buying our content. And we'll be in a position, if we want at any moment, to start picking off some of those superfan groups. That's what we do in Europe. Viewership on Eurosport is up, but the people that absolutely love tennis or love cycling or love Olympic sports or winter sports, they're signing up for Eurosport. And what we're finding is in most cases, they're watching more Eurosport. But when they're out of their home, they want to be able to watch the sports they like. So for the near term at least, we're double dipping. And the idea of having more than 300,000 people that we have their credit cards, we have a direct relationship, we could talk to them about what they like about our app, what they don't, we're learning an awful lot so that if we want to move into any other region, we can."

When you're looking at Europe, you're looking at 55 countries and 20 languages and different regulations in each country. The good news for us is that's what we do for a living. We're already in all 55 of those countries. We have teams on the ground. We have an infrastructure that converts into every language. And so for us, it is what we do for a living. On the Olympics side, there are specific restrictions that the IOC has on how much has to be free-to-air for summer and for winter. And in some countries, there are requirement's that are in addition to the IOC requirements on free-to-air. We own all the rights. And so for instance, in the U.K., if the BBC has the rights, then we would sit down with them historically, and we can talk about how much we want to give them. We would look in most cases to preserve all the rights other than free-to-air. So we could sub-distribute the free-to-air rights. In many markets we have free-to-air channels that meet the requirements: in Italy, in Germany, in Spain, in the U.K., in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland. So there are a lot of markets where we have the free-to-air rights. And in that case, we'll have to decide, are we better of selling it to someone in that market, the free-to-air only? Maybe we sell 60% of the rights, hold back 40% for cable and then hold back all the rights for phone and other devices to go directly. We have plenty of time to think about it. The good news is it's been just free-to-air. And so when you look back at the early '90s when Ebersol came up with this idea of you can be your own producer. You could watch this on broadcast, swimming, but you could see driving and you could see cycling and you could see judo on cable. We could bring that to Europe and I think it could be quite effective. And we have the ability to make those decisions. And we have the ability in many cases, in many of the big markets, to go all-in ourselves if we want to. And so I think that gives us very good optionality."

Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Okay, why don't I hit each of them quick. First of all, on the advertising side, we saw flat to slightly negative in fourth and first.

First of all, on the advertising side, we saw flat to slightly negative in fourth and first. We're now seeing a rising advertising. So I can't opine on where the advertising market is going to go, but I can say that the pricing in scatter has been good and that the market has picked up. I don't know if it'll continue to. 
On the affiliate side, we've been able to get a step-up. So over the last 4 years, when your new deal comes in, we a step-up and then we get increases. And even assuming that there's some decline, we see some very good affiliate growth over the next several years and that we're okay. And so the way that we look at it is -- I say, okay, if we got high single affiliate growth, even if there's some decline, and if the advertising market is even weak, then we still have a mid-single growth business here in the U.S. And if we -- and having that with a cost basis that's very manageable and probably lower than most, where we get to reuse our content around the world, we then use that mid-single-growth business to fuel 65% or 70% of the content we need around the world where we're seeing much higher growth. And most of those countries outside the U.S. are not experiencing what you're talking about. They're getting advertising growth. They're getting affiliate growth. Our market share is growing. And so I think we've really stabilized the U.S. business. I feel good about it. If you put in a lot of the parade, we still have a nice mid-single-growth business. We're not assuming that there's a dramatic jump tilt and tip. But I don't see any, despite all the headlines and discussion, anything that would make me in any way concerned that there's a tilt, a meaningful tilt or tip over here. There's a -- this is a mature market that's showing some decline. And we've stabilized it and put ourselves in a position for growth here. 
On the Europe side, we've actually done the opposite of what you have said. The only big-ticket item that we've gotten is the Olympics. We paid a little less than $1.5 billion for 4 Olympic Games that -- where we have very little cost until 2018. And we begin to get the Olympic library and the Rings to use on Eurosport and use on Eurosport.com, which is the leader online, beginning right after Rio. The rest of the sports rights that we've gotten, and we've done over 50 deals, are -- most of the money goes to soccer. Soccer is like the NFL times 2 in Europe. And distributors are fighting over who gets to get the soccer. We've opted out of that game and we think we can get everything else and we can do it on a very reasonable basis. And we can monetize it on our European platform and we can monetize it direct to consumer and online. We carry the clips of soccer on Eurosport.com, which is the equivalent of ESPN.com here in the U.S. It's the leading online site. But we don't need to own soccer. And so we have the Olympics together with a dominant position on -- in everything else, which I think -- now that we own the Olympics and we have relationship with the federations, we don't see that the prices of speed skating is going to go up dramatically. And in fact, in some of the markets where people have bid on soccer, they bid so much money that they've come to us and said, ""Would you -- Do you want to buy some of our other sports rights because we just had a step-up with such increases on soccer."" So we think Eurosport will be EBITDA positive in itself and will lift our overall portfolio. 
And when you think of Eurosport as being in 130 million homes, and then another 2 or 3 sports channels, and you think of where ESPN was years ago, we haven't begun to monetize the subscriber economics. We haven't begun to aggressively -- we only started selling locally 4 months ago. We haven't begun to monetize the advertising piece and we have the IP and the Olympics. If we could do a little of what Iger has been able to do over the last 15 years in gaining significant subscribers, building on the dominant platform that he has, we can -- and using it to build the rest of his company, we could have a hell of a business. And he did it with -- in a marketplace that has 330 million homes. We're the leader in sports and have the Olympics for the next decade in a market that has 700 million homes. But we're not going to do the NFL. We're not going to do soccer."

Discovery's strong start to the year continued in the second quarter, with steady growth across our global portfolio of brands and businesses. Propelled from a strong second quarter into what was a momentous start to the third quarter, I join you extremely confident in Discovery's future growth prospects.
I believe we will look back on July 2015 as the pivotal month in our company's history as we announced 3 transformative agreements: multiplatform rights to the Olympic Games in Europe for the next decade; deal to acquire 100% control of Eurosport; and lastly, a favorable long-term renewal with Comcast for our U.S. Network portfolio and distribution on the XFinity Comcast platform. These deals together stabilize and enhance our U.S. growth profile, continue our diversification internationally and give us more blue-chip IP content and more distribution so we can continue to drive audience share across all consumer platforms.
Earlier this month, we announced an exclusive deal in Europe, with the IOC for all of the TV and multi-platform media rights to the 4 Olympic Games from 2018 to 2024. Never before has one media company been granted all rights on all platforms across Europe.
We believe the Olympic Games will be a foundation programming piece for Eurosport and Discovery across the continent. Eurosport already dedicates over 40% to its programming schedule to Olympic sports and bolstering our rights and offerings with the world's greatest sporting event is a perfect editorial and strategic fit for the linear channel and for Eurosport.com, the leading online sports platform in Europe.
Combined with full access to the Olympic programming archive, our use of the Olympic Rings immediately following Rio and our existing sports federation agreements, this deal will substantially strengthen the Eurosport platform and bring the Olympic Games to more viewers on more platforms across Europe than ever before. We will maximize our reach to Europe's 700 million residents across platforms. Following the June 29 Olympic announcement, we have seen an increase in conversations and feedback from our European distributors, advertising partners and phone and new media players who want to work more closely with us. 
Soon after the Olympic deal, we struck an agreement to acquire full ownership of Eurosport from the TF1 group. In 2012, we began our investment with a 20% stake in Eurosport and increased that investment to 51% more than a year ago. Taking full control of Eurosport allows us to further strengthen the brand and decision-making process, more readily secure important sports rights on a local or pan-regional basis and fully realize the business' growth potential. Eurosport's 2 or 3 channels across 130 million homes, Eurosport.com, now the Olympics for the next decade makes us the clear leader in sports in Europe.
Finally, the third transaction was signing a long-term distribution agreement with Comcast. Our renewal with Comcast is significant. It demonstrates that distributors continue to place great value on our content and brands with meaningful increases, and it solidifies our TV Everywhere strategy with deployment on XFinity, the primary TV Everywhere platform in the U.S.
4 years ago, we said we would reset our domestic affiliate rate structure with a step-up and more meaningful increases to reflect our increased investment in content and the growth of our audience share that our channel brands had earned. I'm proud to say that we've achieved it. Prior to this renewal cycle, our deals had price escalators at CPI, but we have now reset all of our affiliate agreements that have come up in the last 4 years, which is the majority, at a meaningful rate increase that reflects the strength of our brands and our increased market share. Andy will give you more details. But today, we are positioned for long-term growth in the United States. Locking up that long-cycle money with strong price escalators allows us to focus on other aspects of the business and gives our U.S. business a steady growth rate for years to come. 
And there's still real opportunity for value creation even on the affiliate side going forward. At 13% share of viewing, where we're only getting a mid-single-digit share of affiliate fees even with our increases, there is still a gap to close in the future as well, which we see as real opportunity in the years ahead, even in a marketplace like the U.S. that is relatively flat and challenged.
Combined with our multiple TV Everywhere rights deals signed in the past 2 years, we are now accelerating the expansion of streaming choices for our content across platforms and diversifying our distribution channels with multiple partners. It's positive when new entrants come into the market, particularly when you have the #1 channel in America for men, the Discovery Channel; several top channels for women; and the top channel for African-American women with OWN, all at a price point that is a very good value, which gives us a real advantage. 
Today, I'm pleased to announce an agreement with Verizon to bring long- and short-form content from Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, ID and the Science channel, including full episodes of prior seasons of hit shows to Verizon's U.S. mobile subscribers. This deal extends our platform reach to Verizon customers beyond our traditional pay-TV customer base, and adds yet another source to our distribution revenue stream.
While we drive to extend the delivery of our content to new platforms, we also are working to maximize and exploit our traditional business in the U.S. Headwinds notwithstanding, the U.S. pay-TV marketplace remains one of the world's most important programming and advertising markets. Long term, we are evolving our approach to integrate advertising more deeply into our content, adding more branded integrations, pushing programmatic buying and driving higher CPMs from the scatter marketplace.
In the second quarter in the U.S., revenue growth yet again outpaced cost increases and adjusted OIBDA reached an all-time high. Hitting these metrics illustrates the strong command and control we have over our business. 
We have seen advertising market momentum pick up across all of our channels so far in Q3 as we continue to benefit from ratings outperformance, driven by the flagship, Discovery Channel. Led by new President, Rich Ross, the Discovery Channel team has done a fantastic job of creating and building programming that nourishes Discovery's core male viewers, while attracting more diverse audiences, including women, millennials, Hispanic viewers and family co-viewing.
For the quarter, Discovery's prime time delivery with persons 25 to 54 rose 12%, and 9% with men 25 to 54, and 16% with women 25 to 54. The network ranked as the #4 channel in ad-supported cable for persons 25 to54, up 2 spots from a year ago; and with women 25 to54, rose 7 spots to #9.
Discovery held all of cable's top 5 unscripted series for men: Deadliest Catch, Naked and Afraid, Alaskan Bush People, Fast N' Loud and Street Outlaws. More recently, Shark Week, which aired a month earlier this year, continues to be a pop culture juggernaut. With a science-based slate of programming that reinforced Discovery Channel's heritage, Shark Week 2015 became our highest rated ever among persons 25 to 54 and women 25 to 54. And Discovery Channel's performance in July, outside of Shark Week, was strong as prime time delivery jumped 34% for persons 25 to 54 and 26% for men and 50% for women in the same age bracket, all making Discovery Channel the #1 channel for men for the month of July. 
Internationally, Discovery Channel again reached a record audience as many of our tent-pole shows replicated their success globally. Discovery Channel showed particular strength in India, Brazil and Mexico, where our share of audience rose more than 20%. 
ID also posted strong viewership gains in the U.S. and abroad in the second quarter. ID's U.S. delivery rose 7% and it was a top 3 ad-supported cable network with women 25 to 54 in total day, top 3. ID's average international audience rose a record 23% for the quarter, fueled by new market launches and organic viewership growth, including the June launch of ID in Sweden. 
On TLC, we have moved forward with new series that speak to what the TLC brand is best at: holding a mirror to the culture and telling stories in a thoughtful and sensitive way. There are no better examples than I Am Jazz, a heartwarming new series about a transgender teen and her loving family. In its premiere, the series posted 1.8 million viewers. And My Giant Life, a new series that chronicles the remarkable stories of the world's tallest women and has averaged nearly 2 million total viewers. These shows will soon be joined by returning series, Our Little Family and the Little Couple. Meanwhile TLC's viewership overseas continues to grow. TLC's average international audience rose 15% in the second quarter, led by strong viewership in South Africa, the Netherlands, the U.K. and Russia. 
Just as our global networks and programming are performing well, it is also important to note our IP content investments are similarly making real strides. All3, which we own through a joint venture with Liberty Global international, was nominated for 11 prime time Emmys this year, including the hit series, Undercover Boss and Penny Dreadful.
Overall, we again achieved new record reach and market share gains internationally. With 6% audience share growth across our entire global portfolio in the quarter, our audience and share gains were led by our pay-TV channels in India, Brazil and Mexico, with the Discovery Kids, TLC and Animal Planet brands driving our gains. We also saw strong delivery in the U.K., Germany and Italy as we have many pay-TV and free-to-air channels in those markets and a strong and growing share presence. Latin America once again delivered a stellar quarter with average audience up 13%. We continue to see broad-based gains in viewership across the region. Led by the Discovery Kids, Brazil's portfolio was up 23% and Mexico jumped 16%.
Our CEEMEA region posted 5% growth in average audience in the second quarter. Last week in the region, we officially announced an expanded partnership in Turkey with the Dogus Media Group, one of leading media companies in the country. Dogus is an important distribution partner for our 12 pay-TV channels in Turkey. And with this new strategic partnership, we were able to extend our portfolio with positive economics and agreed to purchase our first free-to-air channel in this emerging growth market that expands and diversifies our platforms and windows for our content in Turkey, a key market for us. We will also partner with Dogus to be our new exclusive representative for our advertising sales.
We are also deploying a free-to-air partnership strategy in the growing Middle East and North African market. In June, we announced plans to launch Quest Arabiya in the region in the fourth quarter through an agreement with Image Nation, the leading content creators in the Middle East. This free-to-air Arabic-language channel will reach 45 million homes, with the best locally produced male-oriented factual programming mixed with program from Discovery's vast global content engine. Quest Arabiya will expand Discovery's 7-network portfolio in the market, which already includes 6 pay-TV Discovery brands and the free-to-air channel, Fatafeat.
Across Europe and Asia, our investment in Eurosport continues to demonstrate progress, with the business posting a 6% increase in average audience this quarter alone. As we approach the 2018 Olympic Winter Games, we will continue to build Eurosport's offering and brand for the long term across Europe and Asia. 
Since taking control of Eurosport a little more than a year ago, we've added 7,500 hours of coverage per year, with more than 3,300 of that live, through more than 50 sports rights deals to drive viewership and strength of the offering. And Eurosport remains meaningfully profitable. Recent rights include the exclusive television and digital rights for 8 major international cycle races from 2017 to 2021 in Asia-Pacific, Wimbledon in Belgium, the PGA Tour golf in Norway and the Europa League in the Nordics. 
Beyond linear, we are bullish about the impact of the Olympics and all the local and niche sports content we are acquiring will have on driving adoption of our over-the-top products in Europe. With the Eurosport Player in 52 countries, and Dplay, which recently launched in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Italy, we are continuing to drive toward our stated goal, march to 1 million subscribers across those platforms in the next 2 years. And we now have over 300,000 subscribers as of the end of last month.
We're making real progress on our goal to maximize the linear platform, while aggressively attacking digital distribution around the world. Our strategy centers on investing in premium content to grow market share, such as the Olympics; maximizing audience reach on pay-TV platforms by locking down long-cycle agreements, like Comcast, while aggressively pushing our content to new distribution platforms, like Verizon in the U.S.; and finding new ways to monetize our content, like with Dogus in Turkey; and evolving our approach to advertising through the use of data to drive addressability, dynamic ad insertion and secondary guarantees using set-top box data. All of these efforts are designed to enhance growth in the U.S. while driving the expansion aggressively of our international footprint. Based on our 30-year track record of success, the transformative partnerships we've signed in just the past month alone and our continued global growth horizon, I believe Discovery is well positioned to grow across our 220 markets around the world for the years to come.
With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to detail our second quarter financial results."
22666093,300903366,850502,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros.

Discovery's ability to execute on key strategic global growth initiatives while focusing on tightly controlling costs lead to another quarter of solid results. On a reported basis, total compan",2330,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Discovery's ability to execute on key strategic global growth initiatives while focusing on tightly controlling costs lead to another quarter of solid results. On a reported basis, total company second quarter revenues increased 3% and adjusted OIBDA was down 2%. As expected, given our increasingly international business mix, the stronger dollar remained a headwind, and changes in currency rates reduced both our reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 8%. Therefore, excluding currency, revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up an impressive 11% and 6%, respectively. On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the inclusion of Eurosport and Discovery Family, total company revenues grew 4% and adjusted OIBDA grew 3%, while organic margins were flat year-over-year at 44%.
Our strong cost and content spend allocation discipline and management continues, but note that we do expect to see a significant uptick in costs domestically and internationally in the third quarter, given the timing of certain content and marketing investments. This 3Q cost uptick is embedded in our full year guidance.
Note also that because of the difficulties in separating Eurosport France from the rest of Eurosport results, we will continue to break out the impact of both transactions to the end of this year. It's important to remind people, however, that when we break out and report the combined Eurosport results for another few quarters, the benefits of our owning Eurosport extends far beyond the stand-alone Eurosport results to the rest of the Discovery portfolio in Europe and Asia through the combined distribution and ad sales leverage in each country.
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $286 million was down versus last year's second quarter net income of $379 million, primarily due to unusually large amounts related to higher foreign currency losses of $54 million from the revaluation of both our euro-denominated debt and monetary assets in Venezuela; $28 million of lower gains related to selling SBS radio this year versus gains related to HowStuffWorks and Eurosport last year; and higher restructuring and other charges this year of $19 million, primarily due to content impairment charges from canceling TLC's 19 Kids and Counting.
These all was partially offset by lower income tax expense as our effective tax rate decreased another 300 basis points year-over-year to 32%, as we remain extremely focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates. We expect our effective tax rate to be 33% for 2015 and still expect it to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017, which will continue to drive sustained income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow.
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.44 and adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective, that excludes the impact from acquisition-related noncash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.49. Excluding negative currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 4% for the quarter and up 11% for the last 12 months.
Free cash flow in the second quarter increased an impressive 55% to $313 million due to lower cash taxes, working capital improvements, lower cash interest payments and lower capital expenditures. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low single digits versus 2014 and accelerate nicely in 2016.
Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks grew revenue 5% as we benefited from another quarter of strong distribution growth, up 12% versus last year's second quarter, and a small increase in ad sales. Our advertising revenues were up slightly versus last year's second quarter as higher pricing and the consolidation of Discovery Family offset lower delivery. Total U.S. delivery did improve from the first quarter, led once again by the flagship Discovery network, but were still down low single digits versus second quarter of last year.
As David mentioned, this quarter marked our highest ad sales quarter in the company's history as we benefited from the overall market shift from an advanced upfront ad buying to higher-priced scatter volume, as we also sold a record amount of scatter ad volume. Looking ahead, we were bullish on our third quarter ad trends as our improved delivery, especially at Discovery, is allowing us to continue to take advantage of the healthier scatter market. And we expect our third quarter U.S. advertising revenue growth to modestly accelerate to low single digit. It is still too early to have a solid read on Q4. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, were up 6% this quarter, as we again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NCTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as from contributions from our new Hulu deal, which started January 1 of this year.
Organic growth decelerated from the first quarter due to tougher year-over-year SVOD comps and a decline of approximately 1% in the pay subscription universe. Given the onetime nature of the SVOD comp, we expect organic affiliate growth to accelerate slightly into the second half of the year, assuming that the rate of subscriber losses does not pick up.
I also want to address the financial impact of our recently announced Comcast renewal. We are extremely pleased with the rate structure of our new comprehensive long-term agreement that again recognizes the value of Discovery's networks. Pricing for the new deal goes into effect January 1 of next year and includes a healthy initial step-up followed by continued rate escalators over the life of the deal. This deal, along with our other recently completed deals, helps stabilize and accelerate our U.S. affiliate growth trajectory to high single digits in 2016 and significantly enhances our domestic affiliate revenue and cash flow growth expectations.
Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 1% on a reported basis, but were down 3% excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. Excluding Family, cost of revenue were up 2% while SG&A declined 11%.
Our laser focus on controlling costs led to a domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 7% on a reported basis versus last year's second quarter and up 4%, excluding Family, while margins on a reported basis and excluding Family both expanded by 100 basis points year-over-year to our all-time high margin rate of 61%.
Moving on to international operations. International division drove another solid quarter of organic distribution growth, but did experience a near-term slowdown in organic advertising that is already reversing in the third quarter. On a reported basis, revenues grew 1% and reported adjusted OIBDA declined 11%. Excluding currency, revenues increased 19% and adjusted OIBDA increased 7% as changes in FX rates reduced both revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 18%, as the strong dollar versus last year remained a major headwind.
On an organic basis, so excluding currency impacts as well as Eurosport, revenues and adjusted OIBDA both increased 7%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so exclude the impact of Eurosport and FX.
The 7% second quarter revenue growth was led by 7% advertising growth and 7% distribution growth. Ad growth was led by another quarter of 20%-plus growth in Latin America, led by strong volume, pricing and delivery in Brazil as well as strength in Argentina and Mexico. Asia-Pac has also recovered nicely and grew advertising over 10%. 
 
The majority of the reasons our advertising growth rate decelerated from the first quarter were onetime in nature, namely tough comps related to the World Cup last year as well as the slowdown in the U.K. due to elections in May. But we are now seeing a nice acceleration into the third quarter.
We were also hurt in 2Q by a lower audience share in Norway. Looking forward, we still forecast full year organic advertising growth to be in the low double-digit range, though it will depend upon no further share losses in Norway.
Distribution revenues grew 7%, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rate and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. We still expect organic affiliate growth in the back half of this year to be in the mid- to high single-digit range.
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 7% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we further localize our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 7% and international organic margins were in line with last year at 38%.
Eurosport's stand-alone margin in the second quarter was 11% and we still expect margins to be in the high single-digit range for the full year. We continue to see significant strategic value of investing in additional sports IP in order to bolster and enhance both the Eurosport and total Discovery European platforms. And while these investments will drive real long-term portfolio value, they will also continue to depress margins at stand-alone Eurosport and will also limit margin expansion going forward for total D&I.
For Education and Other segment reported a small operating loss for the quarter. Given our strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content for our in-house, owned production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in education's digital textbooks to drive the long-term value of this industry-disrupting business, this segment, in total, continued to operate at a small loss for the remainder of the year.
Now taking a look at our overall financial position. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total of $207 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $6.2 billion buying back shares as we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by 30% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our own shares extremely attractive.
As we have previously stated, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating, and we will manage our capital planning and allocation with this commitment in mind. The rating agencies have recently taken a more conservative view on the media industry, and given our current debt-to-EBITDA threshold, it's at the higher end of target levels for a BBB company. We are now focused on preserving cash for the remainder of this year.
Therefore, we now expect to have less total available capital for fiscal 2015 than we had previously stated. Including the $52 million worth of stock that we will soon buy from Advance/Newhouse under our preexisting buyback agreement with them, we will have spent $575 million on total share buybacks this year and are unlikely to repurchase any additional common stock for the remainder of this year.
Given our capital allocation priorities remain, first and foremost, to invest and drive organic growth; and second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP; and third, to buy back our stock, for the remainder of 2015, we need to retain flexibility for additional potential strategic investments, such as our recently announced accretive and growth-driving investment with Dogus in Turkey, while continuing to pay down debt. As we look towards 2016, however, we forecast we're having meaningfully more capital available and expect the amount of capital allocated to share repurchases to increase significantly next year.
Turning to full year guidance. Excluding currency impacts, we are pleased to reaffirm that we still expect revenue growth to be in the high single to low double-digit range and adjusted OIBDA growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. Given our solid operating performance and lower tax rate trends, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS, excluding currency growth expectation, to be low double digits. These guidance ranges still include the sale of the noncore SBS radio assets, which closed at the end of the second quarter, as well as the $50 million negative non-FX-related impacts from Russia.
Before I move on to Q&A, I want to update our full year foreign exchange impact on our 2015 results. While the dollar has been less volatile, there's slightly higher currency headwinds versus when we last reported, in large part due to Venezuela. At current spot rates, FX is now expected to reduce our constant-currency guided revenues by $440 million or roughly 7% and adjusted OIBDA by $160 million, roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results. In addition, we are now disclosing that FX will have a $0.23 to $0.28 impact on adjusted EPS versus last year reported results, assuming no further below-the-line currency adjustments.
Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures. The revenue mix in 2015 remains the same at around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks adjusted OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be around 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short the British pound as our international headquarters are in London.
Lastly, as a reminder, while we have successfully hedged a portion of our currency exposures and did realize gains from these hedges in the first half, we only hedge about 60% of our international transactional exposures. We also do not hedge translational exposures as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
In conclusion, as I look across our portfolio, I couldn't be happier with how we are currently positioned. Our current exposure to higher-growth international markets is 50% and growing. And while we will continue to benefit from the global evolution of pay-TV and continued audience share gains as we leverage our marquee content across our unmatched global distribution platforms, about half our global revenues are locked in for the next several years through long-term affiliate agreements, both domestically and internationally. David and I look forward to discussing our compelling and highly unique portfolio positioning in more depth at our Investor Day on September 29. 
And now we'd like to open the line up for questions."

And so Comcast, together",461,"Thanks, Anthony. The Comcast was one of the final pieces of this overall strategy over the last 4 years, where we grew our viewership from 5% share of viewership on cable to 13% and to try and get more value and bigger increases. And so Comcast, together with all of our deals, to be in a position where we now can look forward and see high single-digit affiliate growth in the U.S., with all of our channels being carried, with very limited exposure to this issue of skinny bundles because almost all of our deals require that all of our channels be carried to a very high percentage of subscribers, it puts us in, I think, a very good position and makes the U.S. for us, as we look forward, a growth market. And when we say high single, we're putting in there an expectation that the U.S. -- we recognize that it's mature, it's been declining at about 1% and we think we can get high single even if that accelerates a little bit. And so the big piece here is that we've really -- we have a very good affiliate revenue stream now. And as I mentioned, we still only represent about 5% or a little bit more than 5% of the economics even though we're 13% of viewership. Before, we were at 3% or 3.5%. So we're quite a good bargain when someone is looking for our content, whether it be new over-the-top platforms and so on. On the data piece, there is a data relationship with Comcast that we established and I think that's critical because the data inside the box is very important. Comcast's platform is probably the, if not the best, it's certainly up there. The X1 platform is terrific. It's a leader in TV Everywhere, but it also is one of the real leaders in data capture, which could help us, I think, on the monetization side. So we're all in on TV Everywhere with Comcast and with Neil. We're glad to have that deal behind us. The other piece is that we own all of our own content, which is quite unusual and I think it's going to be a very important element as you look at the future of a mature market. Because we own all of our content, we don't have long-term commitments to sports, we don't have long term commitment to off-network. And when we put our content on platforms, we get all the money. So it gives us the chance to move our content onto platforms but it also, to the extent that the marketplace moves in a particular direction, we have real ability to maneuver from a cost perspective, and we don't have any long-tail expensive programming costs."

I really feel like -- plus from David's comments the fact that we do have more content cost flexibility. We definitely are demonstrating a lot of command and control around other non-content costs, particularly in SG&A. And we're seeing that benefit over the last several quarters. To your point though, in 3Q, we do expect double-digit increases for both domestic and international, predominantly on the content side, and a little bit on the marketing side as we're going to put some more support and tailwind behind some of our new program launches. So there'll definitely be a cost uptick in 3Q, but definitely want to highlight the fact that, as I think about our cost structures and I think about going forward, I feel really good about our sustained level of productivity and driving SG&A in particular to be kind of in that low single to mid-single-digit range. 
The second question about the foreign exchange impact. Yes, it's -- the $0.23 to $0.28 is the latest view. That's a few cents higher than we would have thought back on our May conference call. It's really highlighting more the fact that while euro has been relatively stable, given our global reach and global expansion of our platforms, clearly, some of the other currencies, in particular, Venezuela and Brazil, have continued to be some additional headwind. So we definitely do want to, going forward, continue to highlight for everyone kind of what the impact is on our adjusted EPS."

And so the one element here is positioning ourselves for the future, where between Eurosport where we own all the sports IP and we have Olympic sports, many of which are top sports in particular countries, plus the Olympics, it positions us where, for the long term, for the next 10 years, we have must-have IP. And we've seen the response in the market in a meaningful way by a number of different players on all platforms, interested in talking to us about the Olympics, but also the sports content that leads up to the Olympics. So we could take you from Michael Phelps' every event right up to the gold medal. And so there's real value in that and we're trying to figure that out. On the -- when we look at how the Olympics has done in Europe -- and I was involved with the Olympics for 15 years in the U.S. NBC was quite effective in evolving the Olympics from being just a free-to-air product to free-to-air in cable, including getting incremental fees and incremental -- and lifting up the whole bundle of the NBC channels and then moving it on to other platforms. If you look at Europe, the U.S. is about 300 million -- 330 million people. Our rights in Europe are over 700 million people. But in almost every one of those markets, it's sort of where the U.S. was in 1992, basically almost only free-to-air in each country. And they had been sold to free-to-air players and to the PBS, to the public stations in each market. And so we are now the holder of that content and we will look to monetize it together with all of our assets. So I think it's a little bit of a false piece of data to look at just where Eurosport is. You'll need to take a look at what is our affiliate revenue in the aggregate doing, what is our advertising revenue in the aggregate doing, and what is our sponsorship advertising revenue in the aggregate look like. And as we mentioned earlier, we're pushing hard in over-the-top. I think we're the only company in Europe that's going directly to consumer with sports, and we have over 300,000 subscribers now that are paying us between $6 and $8 a subscriber in order to get the Eurosport programming. So for the French Open, instead of watching 3 courts, if you had 3 Eurosport channels in your country, you could watch 15 courts. On cycling, you can follow 15 cyclists. And so this is -- we're really looking to restructure our company for significant growth in the future by better IP, while at the same time, growing our linear platforms. And I think the Olympics, together with Eurosport, allows us to do that."

And what's happened is a lot of other companies that are local, because of the fact that most countries are either in recession or flat and it's been a long haul, a lot of the local companies have spent less on content, which has helped us gain share. And a lot of the players from outside have taken cost out and done the opposite. Rather than go local and spend more on content, reduced. And so our market share is up.

In July, to have Discovery be the #1 cable channel in America for men, there have been several months in the last 8 months where Discovery has been, with a cost structure that's very different from entertainment and sports channels, to be the #1 cable channel -- and remember, 80% of that content we get to reuse around the world. We don't rent it for just the U.S. So it's a very effective model. We also have seen that the amount of time that our content is DVR-ed has gone up significantly, which is a real.
[Audio Gap]
much people want our content. And we're excited about going full in to TV Everywhere. We think we'll learn more about that. Our deal with Verizon in Europe, we're talking to a lot of different players. So I think we're at value gap right now. We were able to reach it with Verizon. We think our content is more valuable. We could be on every SVOD platform if we wanted to. But since we own all of our content, we could also go directly to consumer, which is very possible. And we're doing it throughout in Europe now with sports, across all of Europe. We're doing it in -- with entertainment content and sports content in a number of countries in Northern Europe and in Italy. And so we have all that flexibility. My only point on the upside is that in a declining market where people are choosing channels, the fact that we're 13% -- our 14 channels are 13% of viewership on cable and we're only 5% of the money, that's not something to brag about. We were much lower. The good news is we've gotten a significant step-up and big increases. But the -- I think the other piece of good news for us is that when people are looking to launch channels, they can get our channels, whether they took 8 of them or took 13 of them or 14 of them. And even if we charge more, it's a lot less expensive than maybe -- than most of the channels. There are a lot of the entertainment and sports channels that are in the inverse. They might have 5% of viewership and be 20% of the money. So I think it makes us quite attractive. But also, as we continue to make our case over the next several years, we grew share in the last couple of months. A lot of others are losing share. And so the fact that if we can continue to gain share as our deals come up, we'll continue to do what we've done over the last 4 years, which is make the value argument that we're under-indexing on economics and trying to continue to drive our affiliate line even in a marketplace that has some decline on subscribers."

But I was at NBC when viewership on the networks were declining. They're still declining. The fact that subscribers are going down 1%, maybe it grows to 1.5%, that's not a good thing. The fact that we have higher fees locked in and we can be in a position where we could say now that, even if the advertising market is weak and it ends up being flat, we still have a mid-single-growth U.S. business, which is only half of our company. And most of -- a lot of our growth is coming from outside the U.S., where there's still double digit or better growth and the kind of general growth dynamics that we saw in the U.S. historically. The idea of going directly to consumers is something we have every opportunity to do. We own all of our content. We have superfan groups, so I think we're very well positioned. We're looking at everything. But I think the marketplace, at least for the next 3 years, is going to stay relatively stable, and we'll probably have more people buying our content. And we'll be in a position, if we want at any moment, to start picking off some of those superfan groups. That's what we do in Europe. Viewership on Eurosport is up, but the people that absolutely love tennis or love cycling or love Olympic sports or winter sports, they're signing up for Eurosport. And what we're finding is in most cases, they're watching more Eurosport. But when they're out of their home, they want to be able to watch the sports they like. So for the near term at least, we're double dipping. And the idea of having more than 300,000 people that we have their credit cards, we have a direct relationship, we could talk to them about what they like about our app, what they don't, we're learning an awful lot so that if we want to move into any other region, we can."

When you're looking at Europe, you're looking at 55 countries and 20 languages and different regulations in each country. The good news for us is that's what we do for a living. We're already in all 55 of those countries. We have teams on the ground. We have an infrastructure that converts into every language. And so for us, it is what we do for a living. On the Olympics side, there are specific restrictions that the IOC has on how much has to be free-to-air for summer and for winter. And in some countries, there are requirement's that are in addition to the IOC requirements on free-to-air. We own all the rights. And so for instance, in the U.K., if the BBC has the rights, then we would sit down with them historically, and we can talk about how much we want to give them. We would look in most cases to preserve all the rights other than free-to-air. So we could sub-distribute the free-to-air rights. In many markets we have free-to-air channels that meet the requirements: in Italy, in Germany, in Spain, in the U.K., in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland. So there are a lot of markets where we have the free-to-air rights. And in that case, we'll have to decide, are we better of selling it to someone in that market, the free-to-air only? Maybe we sell 60% of the rights, hold back 40% for cable and then hold back all the rights for phone and other devices to go directly. We have plenty of time to think about it. The good news is it's been just free-to-air. And so when you look back at the early '90s when Ebersol came up with this idea of you can be your own producer. You could watch this on broadcast, swimming, but you could see driving and you could see cycling and you could see judo on cable. We could bring that to Europe and I think it could be quite effective. And we have the ability to make those decisions. And we have the ability in many cases, in many of the big markets, to go all-in ourselves if we want to. And so I think that gives us very good optionality."

But as I look at what you're doing now in Europe with the Olympics, it seems like you are actually getting into some of the sports kind of very long-term big number commitments despite the rapidly changing landscape. 
And then, just when you look at your commentary about kind of the ability to hit subscription numbers, clearly, we've gone from a video subscription base that's been growing to a video subscription base that's now declining. What gives you confidence that a 1%-ish decline, or even a little larger than that, is reasonable? Why can't it be 4% or 5%? And the same thing with advertising. It seems like both advertising and subscription have gone from growth to kind of flat to negative. What gives you confidence that you can keep them in moderation on the decline side or even towards flat?"

First of all, on the advertising side, we saw flat to slightly negative in fourth and first. We're now seeing a rising advertising. So I can't opine on where the advertising market is going to go, but I can say that the pricing in scatter has been good and that the market has picked up. I don't know if it'll continue to. 
On the affiliate side, we've been able to get a step-up. So over the last 4 years, when your new deal comes in, we a step-up and then we get increases. And even assuming that there's some decline, we see some very good affiliate growth over the next several years and that we're okay. And so the way that we look at it is -- I say, okay, if we got high single affiliate growth, even if there's some decline, and if the advertising market is even weak, then we still have a mid-single growth business here in the U.S. And if we -- and having that with a cost basis that's very manageable and probably lower than most, where we get to reuse our content around the world, we then use that mid-single-growth business to fuel 65% or 70% of the content we need around the world where we're seeing much higher growth. And most of those countries outside the U.S. are not experiencing what you're talking about. They're getting advertising growth. They're getting affiliate growth. Our market share is growing. And so I think we've really stabilized the U.S. business. I feel good about it. If you put in a lot of the parade, we still have a nice mid-single-growth business. We're not assuming that there's a dramatic jump tilt and tip. But I don't see any, despite all the headlines and discussion, anything that would make me in any way concerned that there's a tilt, a meaningful tilt or tip over here. There's a -- this is a mature market that's showing some decline. And we've stabilized it and put ourselves in a position for growth here. 
On the Europe side, we've actually done the opposite of what you have said. The only big-ticket item that we've gotten is the Olympics. We paid a little less than $1.5 billion for 4 Olympic Games that -- where we have very little cost until 2018. And we begin to get the Olympic library and the Rings to use on Eurosport and use on Eurosport.com, which is the leader online, beginning right after Rio. The rest of the sports rights that we've gotten, and we've done over 50 deals, are -- most of the money goes to soccer. Soccer is like the NFL times 2 in Europe. And distributors are fighting over who gets to get the soccer. We've opted out of that game and we think we can get everything else and we can do it on a very reasonable basis. And we can monetize it on our European platform and we can monetize it direct to consumer and online. We carry the clips of soccer on Eurosport.com, which is the equivalent of ESPN.com here in the U.S. It's the leading online site. But we don't need to own soccer. And so we have the Olympics together with a dominant position on -- in everything else, which I think -- now that we own the Olympics and we have relationship with the federations, we don't see that the prices of speed skating is going to go up dramatically. And in fact, in some of the markets where people have bid on soccer, they bid so much money that they've come to us and said, ""Would you -- Do you want to buy some of our other sports rights because we just had a step-up with such increases on soccer."" So we think Eurosport will be EBITDA positive in itself and will lift our overall portfolio. 
And when you think of Eurosport as being in 130 million homes, and then another 2 or 3 sports channels, and you think of where ESPN was years ago, we haven't begun to monetize the subscriber economics. We haven't begun to aggressively -- we only started selling locally 4 months ago. We haven't begun to monetize the advertising piece and we have the IP and the Olympics. If we could do a little of what Iger has been able to do over the last 15 years in gaining significant subscribers, building on the dominant platform that he has, we can -- and using it to build the rest of his company, we could have a hell of a business. And he did it with -- in a marketplace that has 330 million homes. We're the leader in sports and have the Olympics for the next decade in a market that has 700 million homes. But we're not going to do the NFL. We're not going to do soccer."

I",907,"Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. A month ago, Discovery hosted our first Investor Day to provide a detailed overview of our global strategy and outlook and introduce you to our corporate and international executive management team. It was great to see so many of you there. 
During that presentation, you heard me talk about where we've come as a global media company, where we're going, what sets us apart and the keys to our continued operational growth and financial success. 
Because of our confidence in our financial performance and our free cash flow outlook, much of which is locked in through long cycle affiliate deals. Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have increased our buyback authorization by $2 billion. And we will be back in the market buying our shares this quarter. Andy will share more information on the buyback authorization increase and take you through the financial details in just a moment. 
First, let me briefly take you through some of this quarter's top line performance highlights. First and foremost, our strong brands and award-winning content in the U.S. market continued to perform remarkably well, generating enduring value. I'm pleased to report our portfolio of U.S. channels, again, outperformed broadcast and cable peers and commanded an increase of share of our ad-supported cable. 
Discovery Channel had the highest rated quarter ever for persons 25 to 54 delivery and has been the #1 ad-supported cable channel for men 4 months so far this year alone. 
As we showcased at Investor Day, our ability to reach audiences around the world with great storytelling will be on full display on December 2 when Discovery Channel premieres the landmark documentary, Racing Extinction, a truly global event reaching 1 billion viewers in over 220 countries on 1 day. Only Discovery can do this. It is our unique advantage. 
Among women, ID was the #1 ad-supported cable channel in total delivery for the month of September, #1 ad-supported cable channel for women in September, really extraordinary. And prime delivery on ID rose 16%. 
Given our low cost per hour, our ability to top the ranking charts and grow delivery across ad-supported cable is significant for ID. 
Our U.S. ad sales were very strong this quarter, up 6% versus last year due to record scatter volume, strong pricing and improved demand, and we were able to monetize our ratings improvements at key networks like Discovery Channel, ID and Velocity. 
On the affiliate side, revenues rose 12% in the third quarter. We continue to see the benefits of the strong price increases we have secured through the current renewal cycle, of which we are now 80% complete here in the U.S. 
The price escalators are locked in for years to come, and we also are adding revenue from new partners such as Verizon Go90, Hulu and Sony. 
At our Investor Day, I also said that our leading global distribution platforms is discovery's secret sauce, that's, once again, true in the third quarter. International viewership grew mid-single digit overall, with ID, TLC and Eurosport, up double-digit or better. 
Our ability to increase share of viewership internationally helped drive strong organic advertising and affiliate growth. 
Organic ad sales rose 12% and organic distribution growth also were strong, up 8%. These figures demonstrate our strong international growth profile and best-in-class platform. 
Across Europe, we are continuing to build Eurosport's offering by strategically investing in sports rights and increasing production values to bring local fans closer to the action. As a result, viewership is up 16% this quarter, with some countries like Poland and Germany gaining market share rapidly where we have added locally popular franchises to our lineup. 
Owning our IP, another key to our performance and growth, is also presenting new possibilities. In a multiplatform world, ownership of our content gives us the ability to tell stories, create brands, build community on new platforms, and we have found that our content does play in multiple ecosystems. 
We have recently seen a dramatic increase in views across Discovery Digital Networks as we nourish audiences in storytelling only we can do across multiple platforms. 
Now we have seen real engagement with our online channels, including Test Tube, Seeker and Source Fed, 3 of 90 YouTube channels that we have, which now aggregate to over 200 million views a month, 50 million of them on Facebook alone. 
To better leverage the value of our content across all of these platforms, we have brought Paul Guyardo to our executive team. Paul was a leader working for Barry Diller, and he spent many years at DIRECTV with their marketing and direct-to-consumer business. 
As Chief Commercial Officer, Paul is hyper focused on maximizing our powerful brands and programming revenue across all platforms. 
Overall, the combination of Discovery's unique content with our IP ownership position, category leadership and creative and innovative management team ensures we will be one of the leading content creators for years into the future. No other media company owns such great content in IP to exploit against platforms. No other media company has such a broad international distribution platform. And brands that resonates so deeply with global audiences and super fans. 
I remain extremely confident and excited about our future and in Discovery's ability to succeed and grow. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Andy for more details on our financial results and plans to return capital to our shareholders."
22666093,310568730,889805,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros.

Discovery continues to execute well on our stated operational and financial goals and while as expected, cost were elevated in the quarter mostly due to the timing of content and marketing investments. We are extremely pleased with a solid organic top line growth we generated, both in the U.S. and internationally. 
All of our key third quarter financial metrics are in line with the numbers that I presented at our September Investor Day. 
On a reported basis, total company third quarter revenues decreased 1% and adjusted OIBDA was down 9%. Excluding currencies, revenues were up 8% and adjusted OIBDA was down 1%. 
On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the impact of Eurosport, Discovery Family and the June 30 sale of SBS Radio, total company revenues increased 7% and adjusted OIBDA declined 1%. 
As we had anticipated and have previously discussed, after 2 quarters of strong cost control, we saw significant uptick in cost, both domestically and internationally given this year's cadence of content and marketing investments, which are weighted towards the second half of the year and peaked in the third quarter. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $279 million was relatively flat versus last year's third quarter net income of $280 million as the lower operating performance was offset by a positive swing in our mark-to-market stock-based compensation as well as lower income taxes. 
Our third quarter tax rate decreased by 400 basis points versus last year to 31% due to some discrete onetime tax settlements during the quarter. 
We still expect our effective tax rate to be 33% for full year 2015 and to be at/or below 30% for fiscal 2017. 
Our declining tax rate will continue to drive sustained net income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth overtime. 
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $0.43, and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.47. Excluding currency impacts, both above and below the line, adjusted EPS was up 25% for the third quarter and up 11% for the last 12 months. 
Free cash flow in the third quarter decreased to $234 million after being up 55% in the second quarter, primarily due to the timing of working capital and content spend. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low single digits versus 2014 and expected to accelerate nicely in 2016. 
Turning now to the operating units. Despite all the talk about domestic secular concerns, our U.S. Networks grew revenues an impressive 8% this quarter as we benefited from another quarter of strong distribution growth, up 12% and a significant acceleration advertising growth to up 6% year-over-year. 
We are extremely pleased with our third quarter ad sales performance. As David mentioned, our ratings outperformed the industry and this outperformance helped us benefit from robust scatter pricing and volume as well as stronger growth overall demand. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, did accelerate from the second quarter and were up 7% this quarter. We, again, benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 as well as some contributions from our new Hulu deal we started January 1 of this year. 
Discovery Family will be fully lapped starting in the fourth quarter so our 4Q reported and organic growth range will be the same and then looking ahead, our favorable Comcast renewal will go to effect on January 1 of 2016. 
Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 14% on a reported basis and were up 11%, excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. 
Excluding family, cost of revenues were up 8% due to the timing of content spend and SG&A was at 15% as we ramped up marketing spend after 2 quarters of declines. This led to a 200 basis points decline in reported and organic margins to 57% versus the prior year. 
Moving on to our international operations. Our international division saw an impressive organic ad and distribution growth in the third quarter. On a reported basis, revenues declined 9% and reported OIBDA declined 21%. But excluding currency, revenues increased 6% and adjusted OIBDA decreased 4%. 
Changes in FX rates reduced our revenue growth rates by 15% and our adjusted OIBDA growth rate by 17% as the stronger dollar versus last year especially versus the Brazilian real, which fell another 21% during the quarter remained a major headwind. 
On an organic basis, so excluding currency impacts as well as Eurosport and the recent sale of SBS Radio, revenues were up 9% and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. For comparability purposes, by following international comments refer to organic results only, so exclude the impact of Eurosport, SBS Radio and foreign exchange. 
The 9% third quarter revenue growth was led by 12% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Added growth is led by extremely strong 30-plus percent growth from Latin America, led by higher volumes and pricing in Brazil as well as strong trends in Mexico, Columbia and Argentina. 
Southern Europe also grew ad revenues over 30%, led by higher volumes, pricing and ratings in Italy and solid double-digit growth in Spain. 
Excluding Russia, CEEMEA, led by Germany, also continued to grow nicely with advertising revenues up 15%. 
Distribution revenues grew 8%, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rates and the continued extension of  pay-television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. 
And to a lesser extent, increases in subscribers in Central and Eastern Europe. This country level results reflects the strong long-term opportunity for international markets that you've heard about from JB Perrette last month. 
For just one quarter remaining, we're confident that full year international organic advertising growth will be in the low double-digit range, and we can now firmly say that organic affiliate growth for the full year will be in the high single digit range. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 13% in the quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we continue to focus on localizing our international businesses. 
Adjusted OIBDA grew 4% and international organic margins were down 200 basis points to 36% versus the prior year. 
Eurosport's standalone margin in the third quarter was 6%, and we still expect margins to be in the high single digit range in the full year. As we've stated, the benefit of increased investments in sports is expected to double Eurosport's ad revenue from 2015 to 2020 and will help Discovery's entire European business to sustain strong top line growth for years to come. 
Now moving on to Education and Other segment, which reported a small operating loss for the quarter. Given our strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content from our in-house own production studios, which has no margin associated with it and our continued investment in education's digital textbooks to drive the long-term value of the industry disrupting business, this segment is expected to report a small loss in the fourth quarter as well. 
So now taking a look at our overall company financial position. In the third quarter, we only repurchased $52 million worth of preferred shares. But as David mentioned, we will resume our common share repurchases this quarter and intent the buyback approximately $1.5 billion worth of our stock over the next 12 months. 
Given this, the board has increased our share repurchase authorization by another $2 billion. Our previous authorization only has $450 million remaining and expires in February of next year, while this additional authorization does not expire until October of 2017. 
On our last earnings call we stated, we were unlikely to repurchase additional shares through the end of 2015 in an effort to retain capital allocation flexibility for strategic transactions as well as to pay down debt to lower our leverage ratios. But given our solid and better-than-expected third quarter revenues and bottom line results, the successful Comcast renewal, our significant higher level of confidence and our ability to drive accelerating free cash flow, our high and growing cash flow to total debt yield, the continued favorable interest rate environment, and finally, the refine and return and buying our shares at these levels to be extremely attractive, we have adjusted our view on leverage. After very careful consideration, we are now comfortable with increasing our gross debt to adjusted OIBDA ratio to the 3.25 to 3.4x range versus the 2.75x target we previously outlined, all while being highly committed to remaining an investment-grade debt issuer. 
As we stated during our Investor Day and our previous earnings calls, our capital allocation priorities remained the same. First, to invest in driving organic growth; second, to invest in strategic M&A platforms and IP; and third, to repurchase our stock. 
We had been active borrowers of our stock since inception of our buyback program in 2010. And to-date, we've repurchased over $6.2 billion of our stock and reduced our outstanding share count by over 30%. 
Turning now to our full year guidance for 2015, which we updated at our September Investor Day. We are still confident in our ability to achieve every metric that we laid out at the beginning of this year. To iterate our constant-currency guidance I gave in September, we expect revenues to grow at 9% to 10%, adjusted OIBDA to grow in the mid-single digit range and adjusted EPS to grow in the low double-digit range. These guidance ranges still include the recent sale of the non-core SBS Radio assets as well as the just over $50 million negative non-FX-related impact from Russia. 
We're also today updating our full year foreign exchange impact versus last year's reported results. At current spot rates, FX is still expected tour reduce our constant-currency guided revenue for the year by $460 million or roughly 7%, adjusted OIBDA by $180 million, also roughly 7% while adjusted EPS is now expected to be reduced by $0.26 to $0.31 assuming no further below-the-line currency adjustments. Longer term, as we outlined at our Investor Day, we conservatively expect our constant currency adjusted EPS and reported free cash flow to both grow at a low double-digit CAGR from 2015 to 2018. 
In conclusion, while there is currently much uncertainty in the marketplace, I remain extremely bullish on our global market positioning, our long-term strategic outlook and our continued ability to achieve our stated financial goals. 
Now we'll open the line for questions."

Because obviously, it comes with a lot of sort of retail success at DIRECTV and building kind of strategic businesses and I don't know, if there was a connection there. And then I'll just ask my second. Andy, on the leverage change, do you plan to operate at that 3.25 to 3.4 growth leverage ratio you're not there today, and if you do, kind of how quickly do you think you're going to get there?

The direct-to-consumer business is something we're just getting started with, but we have invested over the last 1.5 years primarily through our Eurosport partnership and in Northern Europe with the Eurosport app and with Dplay. We're learning a lot. Both of those platforms are growing meaningfully. We do have a target in place, which we're calling March to a million. We have a couple hundred thousand subscribers now and if we can get to 1 million at the $6 to $8 a month, we can generate close to $100 million in revenue, which I think gets our whole company's attention in terms of culture. The exciting thing about the Eurosport app is that we're growing our direct-to-consumer business, but it's not coming at the expense of the linear channel. In fact, the linear channel grew group than 15% in the past quarter. So people are signing up for the U.S. open and they're watching maybe a choice of 18 courts. Most of it is when they're outside the home. And then when in their home, they're watching 1 of the 3 Eurosport channels in most cases. So we're finding that it's additive, we're learning a lot. The good news for us is, we've improved our IP. So we did a lot of deals for Eurosport that were in the low single digit increase for rights where we stayed away from the big soccer. We've acquired a lot of kids rights, we were leader in kids in Latin America and now in Asia, and we own all of our content on Discovery, on TLC where we've kind of really focused more on being on brand with stronger bigger content. And so we have a lot of optionality. I think it's just -- it's early days, but we do have a lot of flexibility here in the U.S. to make a move if we want to. And we're looking at it, we're looking at it."

And so we're always looking opportunistically, but we don't need any additional assets. If in fact, we have free-to-air channels in a number of markets in Europe that we could take advantage of with the Olympics, we just launched free-to-air channel acquired in Turkey, which gives us some optionality. So I think if we can -- we'll be looking at the question of can we grow as fast or faster by acquiring additional assets outside the U.S. and we look at everything, but we don't feel like we need to do anything.

We don't see, right now, anything that gives us a sense that things are better or worse. The only thing that we see that's attractive is the advertising market in third and fourth has been consistent and is better than it was in fourth, first and second. On the Eurosport side, we've been quite aggressive about going out and doing deals. And so far, we've learned a couple of things, we've learned that we can grow viewership significantly without buying big time soccer. We've also watched just big time soccer has grown in terms of rates across Europe, 60%, 70%, 80%, 100% in terms of fees. And in many cases, it's big distributors that are fighting for that and in many cases there has to be 1 distributor that gets it. And so it's created kind of a feeding frenzy around that content. The good thing for us is we've kind of duck our heads on that. And because so much economics has gone to soccer and because we're the only player that can offer a pan-European platform, we've been able to sweep in 60 plus deals of very compelling rights, whether it's speedskating, ski jumping, most of Winter Sports, summer track and field, more cycling, more tennis at mid-single digit. And we're even having discussions with some players that bought soccer that are looking to pick up some extra economics by selling some of these niche sports. And for us, those niches sports are looking like those are 2 drivers that are quite attractive for the Eurosport app. Those are the superfan groups that love -- they want to see all the speedskating or want to see all the cycling. And so right now, I think we're quite comfortable that we already committed that Eurosport will not go upside down, it will be profitable. We took the profitability margins down from in the 20s to single digits, and we think over time, that we can -- we should be able to not only be profitable, but we should start to get some of the benefits of the app, which is all incremental. And the viewership gains that we're getting now, which will get the benefit, and we've seen in some markets already that when you put Eurosport together with our 10 traditional channels, we get benefit. And by selling Eurosport locally, we're getting better. I say so far, so good."

It moved away quickly in the fourth quarter, we didn't quite know why, it flattened out and now there's no question that volume has been much stronger and pricing has been good. A piece of that candidly is that we're outperforming. There were a number of players in the industry that have -- ratings have dropped significantly. And so there's been a meaningful ADU issue in the marketplace, and so if you want to put money to work, the fact that our ratings are up and more importantly, our share is up, we didn't have that issue, so we had -- we were open for business. The other thing is that our channels are on brand, so Discovery has never been stronger and the ability to get aligned with the #1 network for men and now we have ID, which was the #1 network for women. ID is still meaningfully underpriced. When you look at the CPM differential between broadcast and cable in general, it's still over 30%, and we can deliver with gold rush, we could be #1 for men and beat the broadcasters, ID's length of view was so high, we have superfan groups around Oprah and Tyler and Science. So I think that being on brand has really helped us, and we have a good momentum story by having gone back to brand and the fact that we, our share is growing. And so we're just going to have to see. I think right now, Joe and his team are doing a very good job, and so our programming teams in the aggregate here in the U.S. And so we're going to continue to write this out, hope that advertising market space, we'll see."

First, the cycle internationally in general tends to be more like 3 years versus 5 or 6 or 7 years here in the U.S., that's first. And this won't surprise most of you, but there really is a difference historically in pricing of distribution deals. The way that it's worked historically is that you get your extra pricing by growth. So price has been relatively flat over the last 10 years for most of us in the content business. And it's because distribution was growing pretty aggressively almost around the world. We still see aggressive growth, meaningful growth in Latin America, particularly Brazil and Mexico, although Brazil has slowed down a little bit with the economy. And India was seeing meaningful growth in Eastern Europe. There are a lot of other markets that are more mature now like Western Europe and a number of the markets in Japan. What we've been able to do are our strategy, which has started to come through and will take us worker time than it did here in the U.S. for the cycle is longer is we have been scaling up in Europe over the last 4, 5 years. And with the Olympics, with Eurosport, but more importantly, just with the overall scale expansion because we've been growing our market share double-digit for the last 6 consecutive years in Europe and Latin America, we now sit with distributors, and we started about 1.5 years ago, where in Western Europe, since there's very modest sub growth, it's not going to work for us. And so the good news is we have enough scale, we believe, so we've been able to do that as our deals come up. The same way we had our attack plan to drive a step-up in pricing here in the U.S, we have that outside the U.S. We don't -- we're not executing it everywhere because there are a number of markets where you're getting better than double-digit growth just because gestationally, these are hot -- continued to be higher growth markets. And in those markets, we'll play the old game where we're continuing to grow share, we're getting our channels carried, distributors are promoting us, and we're getting double-digit growth. In the more mature markets, we are being quite aggressive. Look, in Sweden, we pulled our signal, and we were off for 4 days and then we went back on, we were able to get better than double-digit increase. Across much of Europe, on renewals, we have been very clear that our scale is up, our investment is up, and we need significant increases. And so you'll see those come in over the next couple of years. One other point, Todd, that I think we could provide that I think is meaningful is that TV Everywhere and SVOD is becoming a big part, particularly TV Everywhere and VOD across those mature markets. And we have a 20-year library in language, and we also have the Olympic IP, and we also have sports IP. And so the ability for us to have a win-win, which is you take our channels but in addition, we'll give you some more content for TV Everywhere because we have a ton of it. It's a win for them, it's a win for us, and it helps us further substantiate the pricing rather than just deal, tune out or deal take around."

Some of them have gained subs, others are declining at much lower rates. If that flows through, that will be meaningful upside for us to what our plan is because we've assumed that there'll be slight decline and even at the numbers that we were seeing in the recent earnings reports, that's better than what we have in our plan. And so, we'll just have to see. For us, the good news is we're very protected on the bundle. We could have gotten more price and structure deals where there was more flexibility to move some of our channels. We opted to have the maximum security for our channels and get price. And so we will track pretty closely what the universe estimates are because we did build into our deals over the last 4 years, less flexibility to play, to move around our channels."

I",902,"Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. A month ago, Discovery hosted our first Investor Day to provide a detailed overview of our global strategy and outlook and introduce you to our corporate and international executive management team. It was great to see so many of you there. 
During that presentation, you heard me talk about where we've come as a global media company, where we're going, what sets us apart and the keys to our continued operational growth and financial success. 
Because of our confidence in our financial performance and our free cash flow outlook, much of which is locked in through long-cycle affiliate deals, today, I'm pleased to announce that we have increased our buyback authorization by $2 billion, and we will be back in the market buying our shares this quarter. Andy will share more information on the buyback authorization increase and take you through the financial details in just a moment. 
First, let me briefly take you through some of this quarter's top line performance highlights. First and foremost, our strong brands and award-winning content in the U.S. market continued to perform remarkably well, generating enduring value. I'm pleased to report our portfolio of U.S. channels again outperformed broadcast and cable peers and commanded an increase of share of our ad-supported cable. 
Discovery Channel had the highest-rated quarter ever for persons 25 to 54 delivery and has been the #1 ad-supported cable channel for men 4 months so far this year alone. 
As we've showcased at Investor Day, our ability to reach audiences around the world with great storytelling will be on full display on December 2 when Discovery Channel premieres the landmark documentary, Racing Extinction, a truly global event reaching 1 billion viewers in over 220 countries on 1 day. Only Discovery can do this. It is our unique advantage. 
Among women, ID was the #1 ad-supported cable channel in total delivery for the month of September, #1 ad-supported cable channel for women in September, really extraordinary. And prime delivery on ID rose 16%. Given our low cost per hour, our ability to top the ranking charts and grow delivery across ad-supported cable is significant for ID. 
Our U.S. ad sales were very strong this quarter, up 6% versus last year due to record scatter volume, strong pricing and improved demand, and we were able to monetize our ratings improvements at key networks like Discovery Channel, ID and Velocity. 
On the affiliate side, revenues rose 12% in the third quarter. We continue to see the benefits of the strong price increases we have secured through the current renewal cycle, of which we are now 80% complete here in the U.S. 
The price escalators are locked in for years to come, and we also are adding revenue from new partners such as Verizon Go90, Hulu and Sony. 
At our Investor Day, I also said that our leading global distribution platform is Discovery's secret sauce. That's once again true in the third quarter. International viewership grew mid-single digit overall, with ID, TLC and Eurosport up double digit or better. Our ability to increase share of viewership internationally helped drive strong organic advertising and affiliate growth. 
Organic ad sales rose 12%, and organic distribution growth also was strong, up 8%. These figures demonstrate our strong international growth profile and best-in-class platform. 
Across Europe, we are continuing to build Eurosport's offering by strategically investing in sports rights and increasing production values to bring local fans closer to the action. As a result, viewership is up 16% this quarter, with some countries like Poland and Germany gaining market share rapidly where we have added locally popular franchises to our lineup. 
Owning our IP, another key to our performance and growth, is also presenting new possibilities. In a multi-platform world, ownership of our content gives us the ability to tell stories, create brands, build community on new platforms, and we have found that our content does play in multiple ecosystems. 
We have recently seen a dramatic increase in views across Discovery Digital Networks as we nourish audiences with storytelling only we can do across multiple platforms. And we have seen real engagement with our online channels, including TestTube, Seeker and SourceFed, 3 of 90 YouTube channels that we have, which now aggregate to over 200 million views a month, 50 million of them on Facebook alone. 
To better leverage the value of our content across all of these platforms, we have brought Paul Guyardo to our executive team. Paul was a leader working for Barry Diller, and he spent many years at DIRECTV with their marketing and direct-to-consumer business. As Chief Commercial Officer, Paul is hyperfocused on maximizing our powerful brands and programming revenue across all platforms. 
Overall, the combination of Discovery's unique content with our IP ownership position, category leadership and creative and innovative management team ensures we will be one of the leading content creators for years into the future. No other media company owns such great content and IP to exploit against platforms. No other media company has such a broad international distribution platform and brands that resonate so deeply with global audiences and superfans. 
I remain extremely confident and excited about our future and in Discovery's ability to succeed and grow. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Andy for more details on our financial results and plans to return capital to our shareholders."
22666093,310568730,890121,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Discovery continues to execute well on our stated operational and financial goals. And while as expected, costs were elevated in the quarter mostly due to the timing of content and marketing",1765,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
Discovery continues to execute well on our stated operational and financial goals. And while as expected, costs were elevated in the quarter mostly due to the timing of content and marketing investments, we are extremely pleased with the solid organic top line growth we generated, both in the U.S. and internationally. All of our key third quarter financial metrics are in line with the numbers that I presented at our September Investor Day. 
On a reported basis, total company third quarter revenues decreased 1%, and adjusted OIBDA was down 9%. Excluding currencies, revenues were up 8%, and adjusted OIBDA was down 1%. 
On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the impact of Eurosport, Discovery Family and the June 30 sale of SBS Radio, total company revenues increased 7%, and adjusted OIBDA declined 1%. 
As we had anticipated and have previously discussed, after 2 quarters of strong cost control, we saw a significant uptick in costs, both domestically and internationally, given this year's cadence of content and marketing investments, which are weighted towards the second half of the year and peaked in the third quarter. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $279 million was relatively flat versus last year's third quarter net income of $280 million as the lower operating performance was offset by a positive swing in our mark-to-market stock-based compensation as well as lower income taxes. 
Our third quarter tax rate decreased by 400 basis points versus last year to 31% due to some discrete onetime tax settlements during the quarter. We still expect our effective tax rate to be 33% for full year 2015 and to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017. Our declining tax rate will continue to drive sustained net income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth over time. 
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $0.43, and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.47. Excluding currency impacts both above and below the line, adjusted EPS was up 25% for the third quarter and up 11% for the last 12 months. 
Free cash flow in the third quarter decreased to $234 million after being up 55% in the second quarter primarily due to the timing of working capital and content spend. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low single digits versus 2014 and expect it to accelerate nicely in 2016. 
Turning now to the operating units. Despite all the talk about domestic secular concerns, our U.S. Networks grew revenues an impressive 8% this quarter as we benefited from another quarter of strong distribution growth, up 12%, and a significant acceleration in advertising growth to up 6% year-over-year. 
We are extremely pleased with our third quarter ad sales performance. As David mentioned, our ratings outperformed the industry, and this outperformance helped us benefit from robust scatter pricing and volume as well as stronger overall demand. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, did accelerate from the second quarter and were up 7% this quarter. We again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 as well as some contributions from our new Hulu deal we started January 1 of this year. 
Discovery Family will be fully lapped starting in the fourth quarter, so our 4Q reported and organic growth rates will be the same, and then looking ahead, our favorable Comcast renewal will go into effect on January 1, 2016. 
Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 14% on a reported basis and were up 11%, excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. 
Excluding Family, cost of revenues were up 8% due to the timing of content spend, and SG&A was up 15% as we ramped up marketing spend after 2 quarters of declines. This led to a 200 basis point decline in reported and organic margins to 57% versus the prior year. 
Moving on to our international operations. Our international division saw an impressive organic ad and distribution growth in the third quarter. On a reported basis, revenues declined 9%, and reported OIBDA declined 21%. But excluding currency, revenues increased 6%, and adjusted OIBDA decreased 4%. 
Changes in FX rates reduced our revenue growth rates by 15% and our adjusted OIBDA growth rate by 17% as the stronger dollar versus last year especially versus the Brazilian real, which fell another 21% during the quarter, remained a major headwind. 
On an organic basis, so excluding currency impacts as well as Eurosport and the recent sale of SBS Radio, revenues were up 9%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments refer to our organic results only, so exclude the impacts of Eurosport, SBS Radio and foreign exchange. 
The 9% third quarter revenue growth was led by 12% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Added growth is led by extremely strong 30-plus percent growth from Latin America, led by higher volumes and pricing in Brazil as well as strong trends in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. 
Southern Europe also grew ad revenues over 30%, led by higher volumes, pricing and ratings in Italy and solid double-digit growth in Spain. 
Excluding Russia, CEEMEA, led by Germany, also continued to grow nicely, with advertising revenues up 15%. 
Distribution revenues grew 8%, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rates and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina and, to a lesser extent, increases in subscribers in Central and Eastern Europe. This country-level result reflects the strong long-term opportunity for international markets that you heard about from JB Perrette last month. 
With just 1 quarter remaining, we are confident that full year international organic advertising growth will be in the low double-digit range, and we can now firmly say that organic affiliate growth for the full year will be in the high single-digit range. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 13% in the quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we continue to focus on localizing our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 4%, and international organic margins were down 200 basis points to 36% versus the prior year. 
Eurosport's stand-alone margin in the third quarter was 6%, and we still expect margins to be in the high single-digit range for the full year. As we've stated, the benefit of increased investments in sports is expected to double Eurosport's ad revenue from 2015 to 2020 and will help Discovery's entire European business to sustain strong top line growth for years to come. 
Now moving on to Education and Other segment, which reported a small operating loss for the quarter. Given our strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content from our in-house own production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in education's digital textbooks to drive the long-term value of this industry-disrupting business, this segment is expected to report a small loss in the fourth quarter as well. 
So now taking a look at our overall company financial position. In the third quarter, we only repurchased $52 million worth of preferred shares. But as David mentioned, we will resume our common share repurchases this quarter and intend to buy back approximately $1.5 billion worth of our stock over the next 12 months. 
Given this, the board has increased our share repurchase authorization by another $2 billion. Our previous authorization only has $450 million remaining and expires in February of next year while this additional authorization does not expire until October of 2017. 
On our last earnings call, we stated that we were unlikely to repurchase additional shares through the end of 2015 in an effort to retain capital allocation flexibility for strategic transactions as well as to pay down debt to lower our leverage ratios. But given our solid and better-than-expected third quarter revenues and bottom line results, the successful Comcast renewal, our significant higher level of confidence in our ability to drive accelerating free cash flow, our high and growing cash flow-to-total debt yield, the continued favorable interest rate environment and, finally, that we find the return of buying our shares at these levels to be extremely attractive, we have adjusted our view on leverage. After very careful consideration, we are now comfortable with increasing our gross debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio to the 3.25 to 3.4x range versus the 2.75x target we previously outlined, all while being highly committed to remaining an investment-grade debt issuer. 
As we stated during our Investor Day and our previous earnings calls, our capital allocation priorities remain the same: first, to invest in driving organic growth; second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP; and third, to repurchase our stock. 
We had been active buyers of our stock since inception of our buyback program in 2010 and, to date, have repurchased over $6.2 billion of our stock and have reduced our outstanding share count by over 30%. 
Turning now to our full year guidance for 2015, which we updated at our September Investor Day. We are still confident in our ability to achieve every metric that we laid out at the beginning of this year. To reiterate our constant-currency guidance I gave in September, we expect revenues to grow at 9% to 10%, adjusted OIBDA to grow in the mid-single-digit range and adjusted EPS to grow in the low double-digit range. These guidance ranges still include the recent sale of the noncore SBS Radio assets as well as the just over $50 million negative non-FX-related impact from Russia. 
We are also today updating our full year foreign exchange impacts versus last year's reported results. At current spot rates, FX is still expected to reduce our constant-currency guided revenue for the year by $460 million or roughly 7%, adjusted OIBDA by $180 million, also roughly 7%, while adjusted EPS is now expected to be reduced by $0.26 to $0.31 assuming no further below-the-line currency adjustments. 
Longer term, as we outlined at our Investor Day, we conservatively expect our constant-currency adjusted EPS and reported free cash flow to both grow at a low double-digit CAGR from 2015 to 2018. 
In conclusion, while there is currently much uncertainty in the marketplace, I remain extremely bullish on our global market positioning, our; long-term strategic outlook and our continued ability to achieve our stated financial goals. 
Now we'll open the line for questions."

Because obviously, he comes with a lot of sort of retail success at DIRECTV and building kind of subscription businesses. I didn't know if there was a connection there. And then I'll just ask my second. Andy, on the leverage change, do you plan to operate at that 3.25 to 3.4 gross leverage ratio because you're not there today?

We're learning a lot. It's -- both of those platforms are growing meaningfully. We do have a target in place, which we're calling March to a Million. We have a couple of hundred thousand subscribers now. And if we can get to 1 million at the $6 to $8 a month, we could generate close to $100 million in revenue, which I think gets our whole company's attention in terms of culture. The exciting thing about the Eurosport app is that we're growing our direct-to-consumer business, but it's not coming at the expense of the linear channel. In fact, the linear channel grew more than 15% in the past quarter. So people are signing up for the U.S. Open, and they're watching maybe a choice of 18 courts. Most of it is when they're outside the home. And then when they're in the home, they're watching 1 of the 3 Eurosport channels in most cases. So we're finding that it's additive. We're learning a lot. The good news for us is we've improved our IP. So we did a lot of deals for Eurosport that were in the low single-digit increase for rights where we stayed away from the big soccer. We've acquired a lot of kids' rights where we are leader in kids in Latin America and now in Asia. And we own all of our content on Discovery, on TLC where we've kind of really focused more on being on brand with stronger bigger content. And so we have a lot of optionality. I think it's just -- it's early days, but we do have a lot of flexibility here in the U.S. to make a move if we want to. And we're looking at it, we're looking at it."

We don't see right now anything that gives us a sense that things are better or worse. We -- the only thing that we see that's attractive is the advertising market in third and fourth has been consistent and is better than it was in fourth, first and second. On the Eurosport side, we've been quite aggressive about going out and doing deals. And so far, we've learned a couple of things. We've learned that we can grow viewership significantly without buying big-time soccer. We've also watched just big-time soccer has grown in terms of rates across Europe 60%, 70%, 80%, 100% in terms of fees. And in many cases, it's big distributors that are fighting for that, and in many cases, there has to be more than one distributor that gets it. And so it's created kind of a feeding frenzy around that content. The good thing for us is we've kind of ducked our heads on that. And because so much economics has gone to soccer and because we're the only player that can offer a Pan-European platform, we've been able to sweep in 60-plus deals of very compelling rights, whether with speedskating, ski jumping, most of Winter Sports, summer track and field, more cycling, more tennis at mid-single digit. And we're even having discussions with some players that bought soccer that are looking to pick up some extra economics by selling some of these niche sports. And for us, those niche sports are looking like those are the drivers that are quite attractive for the Eurosport app. Those are the superfan groups that love -- that want to see all the speedskating or want to see all the cycling. And so right now, I think we're quite comfortable that we already committed that Eurosport will not go upside down, it will be profitable. We took the profitability margins down from in the 20s to single digits. And we think over time that we can -- we should be able to not only be profitable, but we should start to get some of the benefit of the app, which is all incremental and the viewership gains that we're getting now, which we'll get the benefit. And we've seen in some markets already that when you put Eurosport together with our 10 traditional channels, we get benefit. And by selling Eurosport locally, we're getting benefit. So I'd say so far, so good."

And so there's another thing that Paul and our team is looking at, that we've been, I think, best-of-class in -- with linear. And over the next 2 to 3 years, if we could really build up our capability and our expertise in digital, I think that'll be a significant upside because we haven't been great at it."

It moved away quickly in the fourth quarter. We didn't quite know why. It flattened out, and now there's no question that volume has been much stronger and pricing has been good. A piece of that candidly is that we're outperforming. There were a number of players in the industry that are -- that have -- ratings have dropped significantly. And so there's been a meaningful ADU issue in the marketplace. And so if you want to put money to work, the fact that our ratings are up and our -- more importantly, our share is up, we didn't have that issue. So we had -- we were open for business. The other thing is that our channels are on brand, so Discovery has never been stronger, and the ability to get aligned with the #1 network for men, and now we have ID, which was the #1 network for women. ID is still meaningfully underpriced. When you look at the CPM differential between broadcast and cable in general, it's still over 30%. And we can deliver with Gold Rush. We could be #1 for men and beat the broadcasters, and ID's length of view was so high. We have superfan groups around Oprah and Tyler and Science. So I think that being on brand has really helped us. And we have a good momentum story by having gone back to brand and the fact that we -- our share is growing. And so we're just going to have to see. I think right now, Joe Abruzzese and his team are doing a very good job, and so are our programming teams in the aggregate here in the U.S. And so we're going to continue to ride this out and hope that the advertising market stays.

First, the cycle internationally in general tends to be more like 3 years versus 5 or 6 or 7 years here in the U.S. That's first. And this won't surprise most of you, but there really is a difference historically in pricing of distribution deals. The way that it's worked historically is that you get your extra pricing by growth. So price has been relatively flat over the last 10 years for most of us in the content business, and it's because distribution was growing pretty aggressively almost around the world. We still see aggressive growth, meaningful growth in Latin America, particularly Brazil and Mexico, although Brazil has slowed down a little bit with the economy. And India was seeing meaningful growth and Eastern Europe. There are a lot of other markets that are more mature now, like Western Europe and a number of the markets in Japan. What we've been able to do with our strategy, which is starting to come through and will take us shorter time than it did here in the U.S. where the cycle is longer, is we have been scaling up in Europe over the last 4, 5 years. And with the Olympics, with Eurosport but more importantly, just with the overall scale expansion because we've been growing our market share double digit for the last 6 consecutive years in Europe and Latin America, we now sit with distributors. And we started about 1.5 years ago where in Western Europe that -- since there's very modest sub growth, it's not going to work for us. And so the good news is we have enough scale, we believe, to drive price. And we've been able to do that as our deals come up. The same way we had an attack plan to drive a step-up in pricing here in the U.S., we have that outside the U.S. We don't -- we're not executing it everywhere because there were a number of markets we were getting better than double-digit growth just because gestationally, these are -- continue to be higher-growth markets. And in those markets, we'll play the old game where we're continuing to grow share, we're getting our channels carried, distributors are promoting us, and we're getting double-digit growth. In the more mature markets, we are being quite aggressive. Look, in Sweden, we pulled our signal, and we were off for 4 days. And then we went back on. We were able to get better than double-digit increase. Across much of Europe, on renewals, we have been very clear that our scale is up, our investment is up, and we need significant increases. And so you'll see those come in over the next couple of years. One other point, Todd, that I think we could provide that I think is meaningful is that TV Everywhere and SVOD is becoming a big part, particularly TV Everywhere and VOD across those mature markets. And we have a 20-year library in language, and we also have the Olympic IP, and we also have sports IP. And so the ability for us to have a win-win, which is you take our channels, but in addition, we'll give you some more content for TV Everywhere because we have a ton of it, it's a win for them, it's a win for us, and it helps us further substantiate the pricing rather than just deal -- chewed out of deal cake or out."

And even at the numbers that we were seeing in the recent earnings reports, that's better than what we have in our plan. And so we'll just have to see. It's a -- for us, the good news is we're very protected on the bundle. We could have gotten more price and structure deals where there was more flexibility to move some of our channels.

We have a derisked U.S. business model. We have an accelerating cash flow model. I'm extraordinarily comfortable at the seat I'm in that we can sustain this higher level of leverage still being fully committed to maintaining our investment grade and allow ourselves to drive a higher level of return on equity while still being very prudent with our debt and capital structure.

I",902,"Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. A month ago, Discovery hosted our first Investor Day to provide a detailed overview of our global strategy and outlook and introduce you to our corporate and international executive management team. It was great to see so many of you there. 
During that presentation, you heard me talk about where we've come as a global media company, where we're going, what sets us apart and the keys to our continued operational growth and financial success. 
Because of our confidence in our financial performance and our free cash flow outlook, much of which is locked in through long-cycle affiliate deals, today, I'm pleased to announce that we have increased our buyback authorization by $2 billion, and we will be back in the market buying our shares this quarter. Andy will share more information on the buyback authorization increase and take you through the financial details in just a moment. 
First, let me briefly take you through some of this quarter's top line performance highlights. First and foremost, our strong brands and award-winning content in the U.S. market continued to perform remarkably well, generating enduring value. I'm pleased to report our portfolio of U.S. channels again outperformed broadcast and cable peers and commanded an increase of share of our ad-supported cable. 
Discovery Channel had the highest-rated quarter ever for persons 25 to 54 delivery and has been the #1 ad-supported cable channel for men 4 months so far this year alone. 
As we showcased at Investor Day, our ability to reach audiences around the world with great storytelling will be on full display on December 2 when Discovery Channel premieres the landmark documentary, Racing Extinction, a truly global event reaching 1 billion viewers in over 220 countries on one day. Only Discovery can do this. It is our unique advantage. 
Among women, ID was the #1 ad-supported cable channel in total delivery for the month of September; #1 ad-supported cable channel for women in September, really extraordinary. And prime delivery on ID rose 16%. Given our low cost per hour, our ability to top the ranking charts and grow delivery across ad-supported cable is significant for ID. 
Our U.S. ad sales were very strong this quarter, up 6% versus last year due to record scatter volume, strong pricing and improved demand, and we were able to monetize our ratings improvements at key networks like Discovery Channel, ID and Velocity. 
On the affiliate side, revenues rose 12% in the third quarter. We continue to see the benefits of the strong price increases we have secured through the current renewal cycle, of which we are now 80% complete here in the U.S. 
The price escalators are locked in for years to come, and we also are adding revenue from new partners such as Verizon Go90, Hulu and Sony. 
At our Investor Day, I also said that our leading global distribution platform is Discovery's secret sauce. That's once again true in the third quarter. International viewership grew mid-single digit overall, with ID, TLC and Eurosport up double digit or better. Our ability to increase share of viewership internationally helped drive strong organic advertising and affiliate growth. 
Organic ad sales rose 12%, and organic distribution growth also was strong, up 8%. These figures demonstrate our strong international growth profile and best-in-class platform. 
Across Europe, we are continuing to build Eurosport's offering by strategically investing in sports rights and increasing production values to bring local fans closer to the action. As a result, viewership is up 16% this quarter, with some countries like Poland and Germany gaining market share rapidly, where we have added locally popular franchises to our lineup. 
Owning our IP, another key to our performance and growth, is also presenting new possibilities. In a multi-platform world, ownership of our content gives us the ability to tell stories, create brands, build community on new platforms, and we have found that our content does play in multiple ecosystems. 
We have recently seen a dramatic increase in views across Discovery Digital Networks as we nourish audiences with storytelling only we can do across multiple platforms. And we have seen real engagement with our online channels, including TestTube, Seeker and SourceFed, 3 of 90 YouTube channels that we have, which now aggregate to over 200 million views a month, 50 million of them on Facebook alone. 
To better leverage the value of our content across all of these platforms, we have brought Paul Guyardo to our executive team. Paul was a leader working for Barry Diller, and he spent many years at DIRECTV with their marketing and direct-to-consumer business. As Chief Commercial Officer, Paul is hyperfocused on maximizing our powerful brands and programming revenue across all platforms. 
Overall, the combination of Discovery's unique content with our IP ownership position, category leadership and creative and innovative management team ensures we will be one of the leading content creators for years into the future. No other media company owns such great content and IP to exploit against platforms. No other media company has such a broad international distribution platform and brands that resonate so deeply with global audiences and superfans. 
I remain extremely confident and excited about our future and in Discovery's ability to succeed and grow. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Andy for more details on our financial results and plans to return capital to our shareholders."

Discovery continues to execute well on our stated operational and financial goals. And while, as expected, costs were elevated in the quarter mostly due to the timing of content and marketing investments, we are extremely pleased with the solid organic top line growth we generated, both in the U.S. and internationally. All of our key third quarter financial metrics are in line with the numbers I presented at our September Investor Day. 
On a reported basis, total company third quarter revenues decreased 1%, and adjusted OIBDA was down 9%. Excluding currencies, revenues were up 8%, and adjusted OIBDA was down 1%. 
On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the impact of Eurosport, Discovery Family and the June 30 sale of SBS Radio, total company revenues increased 7%, and adjusted OIBDA declined 1%. 
As we had anticipated and have previously discussed, after 2 quarters of strong cost control, we saw a significant uptick in costs, both domestically and internationally, given this year's cadence of content and marketing investments, which are weighted towards the second half of the year and peaked in the third quarter. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $279 million was relatively flat versus last year's third quarter net income of $280 million as the lower operating performance was offset by a positive swing in our mark-to-market stock-based compensation as well as lower income taxes. 
Our third quarter tax rate decreased by 400 basis points versus last year to 31% due to some discrete onetime tax settlements during the quarter. We still expect our effective tax rate to be 33% for full year 2015 and to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017. Our declining tax rate will continue to drive sustained net income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth over time. 
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $0.43, and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.47. Excluding currency impacts both above and below the line, adjusted EPS was up 25% for the third quarter and up 11% for the last 12 months. 
Free cash flow in the third quarter decreased to $234 million after being up 55% in the second quarter, primarily due to the timing of working capital and content spend. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low single digits versus 2014 and expect it to accelerate nicely in 2016. 
Turning now to the operating units. Despite all the talk about domestic secular concerns, our U.S. Networks grew revenues an impressive 8% this quarter as we benefited from another quarter of strong distribution growth, up 12%, and a significant acceleration in advertising growth to up 6% year-over-year. 
We are extremely pleased with our third quarter ad sales performance. As David mentioned, our ratings outperformed the industry, and this outperformance helped us benefit from robust scatter pricing and volume as well as stronger overall demand. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, did accelerate from the second quarter and were up 7% this quarter. We again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as some contributions from our new Hulu deal, which started January 1 of this year. 
Discovery Family will be fully lapped starting in the fourth quarter, so our 4Q reported and organic growth rates will be the same, and then looking ahead, our favorable Comcast renewal will go into effect on January 1 of 2016. 
Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 14% on a reported basis and were up 11% excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. 
Excluding Family, cost of revenues were up 8% due to the timing of content spend, and SG&A was up 15% as we ramped up marketing spend after 2 quarters of declines. This led to a 200 basis point decline in reported and organic margins to 57% versus the prior year. 
Moving on to our international operations. Our international division saw an impressive organic ad and distribution growth in the third quarter. On a reported basis, revenues declined 9%, and reported OIBDA declined 21%. But excluding currency, revenues increased 6%, and adjusted OIBDA decreased 4%. 
Changes in FX rates reduced our revenue growth rates by 15% and our adjusted OIBDA growth rate by 17% as the stronger dollar versus last year, especially versus the Brazilian real, which fell another 21% during the quarter, remained a major headwind. 
On an organic basis, so excluding currency impacts as well as Eurosport and the recent sale of SBS Radio, revenues were up 9%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments refer to our organic results only, so exclude the impacts of Eurosport, SBS Radio and foreign exchange. 
The 9% third quarter revenue growth was led by 12% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Added growth is led by extremely strong 30-plus percent growth from Latin America, led by higher volumes and pricing in Brazil as well as strong trends in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. 
Southern Europe also grew ad revenues over 30%, led by higher volumes, pricing and ratings in Italy and solid double-digit growth in Spain. 
Excluding Russia, CEEMEA, led by Germany, also continued to grow nicely, with advertising revenues up 15%. 
Distribution revenues grew 8%, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rates and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, and to a lesser extent, increases in subscribers in Central and Eastern Europe. These country-level results reflects the strong long-term opportunity for our international markets that you heard about from JB Perrette last month. 
With just 1 quarter remaining, we are confident that full year international organic advertising growth will be in the low double-digit range, and we can now firmly say that organic affiliate growth for the full year will be in the high single-digit range. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 13% in the quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we continue to focus on localizing our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 4%, and international organic margins were down 200 basis points to 36% versus the prior year. 
Eurosport's stand-alone margin in the third quarter was 6%, and we still expect margins to be in the high single-digit range for the full year. As we've stated, the benefit of increased investments in sports is expected to double Eurosport's ad revenue from 2015 to 2020 and will help Discovery's entire European business to sustain strong top line growth for years to come. 
Now moving on to our Education and Other segment, which reported a small operating loss for the quarter. Given our strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content from our in-house owned production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in Education's digital textbooks to drive the long-term value of this industry-disrupting business, this segment is expected to report a small loss in the fourth quarter as well. 
So now taking a look at our overall company financial position. In the third quarter, we only repurchased $52 million worth of preferred shares. But as David mentioned, we will resume our common share repurchases this quarter and intend to buy back approximately $1.5 billion worth of our stock over the next 12 months. 
Given this, the Board has increased our share repurchase authorization by another $2 billion. Our previous authorization only has $450 million remaining and expires in February of next year, while this additional authorization does not expire until October of 2017. 
On our last earnings call, we stated that we were unlikely to repurchase additional shares through the end of 2015 in an effort to retain capital allocation flexibility for strategic transactions as well as to pay down debt to lower our leverage ratios. But given our solid and better-than-expected third quarter revenues and bottom line results, the successful Comcast renewal, our significant higher level of confidence in our ability to drive accelerating free cash flow, our high and growing cash flow-to-total debt yield, the continued favorable interest rate environment and finally, that we find the return of buying our shares at these levels to be extremely attractive, we have adjusted our view on leverage. After very careful consideration, we are now comfortable with increasing our gross debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio to the 3.25 to 3.4x range versus the 2.75x target we previously outlined, all while being highly committed to remaining an investment-grade debt issuer. 
As we stated during our Investor Day and our previous earnings calls, our capital allocation priorities remain the same: first, to invest in driving organic growth; second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP; and third, to repurchase our stock. 
We had been active buyers of our stock since inception of our buyback program in 2010 and, to date, have repurchased over $6.2 billion of our stock and have reduced our outstanding share count by over 30%. 
Turning now to our full year guidance for 2015, which we updated at our September Investor Day. We are still confident in our ability to achieve every metric that we laid out at the beginning of this year. To reiterate our constant-currency guidance I gave in September, we expect revenues to grow at 9% to 10%, adjusted OIBDA to grow in the mid-single-digit range and adjusted EPS to grow in the low double-digit range. These guidance ranges still include the recent sale of the noncore SBS Radio assets as well as the just over $50 million negative non-FX-related impact from Russia. 
We are also today updating our full year foreign exchange impacts versus last year's reported results. At current spot rates, FX is still expected to reduce our constant-currency guided revenue for the year by $460 million or roughly 7%, adjusted OIBDA by $180 million, also roughly 7%, while adjusted EPS is now expected to be reduced by $0.26 to $0.31, assuming no further below-the-line currency adjustments. 
Longer term, as we outlined at our Investor Day, we conservatively expect our constant-currency adjusted EPS and reported free cash flow to both grow at a low double-digit CAGR from 2015 to 2018. 
In conclusion, while there is currently much uncertainty in the marketplace, I remain extremely bullish on our global market positioning, our; long-term strategic outlook and our continued ability to achieve our stated financial goals. 
Now we'll open the line for questions."

The direct-to-consumer business is something we're just getting started with, but we have invested over the last 1.5 years, primarily through our Eurosport partnership and in Northern Europe with the Eurosport app and with Dplay. We're learning a lot. It's -- both of those platforms are growing meaningfully. We do have a target in place, which we're calling March to a Million. We have a couple of hundred thousand subscribers now. And if we can get to 1 million at the $6 to $8 a month, we could generate close to $100 million in revenue, which I think gets our whole company's attention in terms of culture. The exciting thing about the Eurosport app is that we're growing our direct-to-consumer business, but it's not coming at the expense of the linear channel. In fact, the linear channel grew more than 15% in the past quarter. So people are signing up for the U.S. Open, and they're watching maybe a choice of 18 courts. Most of it is when they're outside the home. And then when they're in the home, they're watching one of the 3 Eurosport channels in most cases. So we're finding that it's additive. We're learning a lot. The good news for us is we've improved our IP. So we did a lot of deals for Eurosport that were in the low single-digit increase for rights, where we stayed away from the big soccer. We've acquired a lot of kids' rights, where we're a leader in Kids in Latin America and now in Asia. And we own all of our content on Discovery, on TLC, where we've kind of really focused more on being on brand, with stronger, bigger content. And so we have a lot of optionality. I think it's just -- it's early days, but we do have a lot of flexibility here in the U.S. to make a move if we want to. And we're looking at it, we're looking at it."

We don't see right now anything that gives us a sense that things are better or worse. We -- the only thing that we see that's attractive is the advertising market in the third and fourth has been consistent and is better than it was in fourth, first and second. On the Eurosport side, we've been quite aggressive about going out and doing deals. And so far, we've learned a couple of things. We've learned that we can grow viewership significantly without buying big-time soccer. We've also watched just big-time soccer has grown in terms of rates across Europe 60%, 70%, 80%, 100% in terms of fees. And in many cases, it's big distributors that are fighting for that, and in many cases, there has to be more than one distributor that gets it. And so it's created kind of a feeding frenzy around that content. The good thing for us is we've kind of ducked our heads on that. And because so much economics has gone to soccer and because we're the only player that can offer a Pan-European platform, we've been able to sweep in 60-plus deals of very compelling rights, whether it's speedskating, ski jumping, most of Winter Sports, summer track and field, more cycling, more tennis at mid-single digit. And we're even having discussions with some players that bought soccer and that are looking to pick up some extra economics by selling some of these niche sports. And for us, those niche sports are looking like those are the drivers that are quite attractive for the Eurosport app. Those are the superfan groups that love -- that want to see all the speedskating or want to see all the cycling. And so right now, I think we're quite comfortable that we already committed that Eurosport will not go upside down, it will be profitable. We took the profitability margins down from in the 20s to single digits. And we think over time that we can -- we should be able to not only be profitable, but we should start to get some of the benefit of the app, which is all incremental and the viewership gains that we're getting now, which we'll get the benefit. And we've seen in some markets already that when you put Eurosport together with our 10 traditional channels, we get benefit. And by selling Eurosport locally, we're getting benefit. So I'd say so far, so good."

The other thing is that our channels are on brand, so Discovery has never been stronger, and the ability to get aligned with the #1 network for men, and now we have ID, which was the #1 network for women. ID is still meaningfully underpriced. And when you look at the CPM differential between broadcast and cable in general, it's still over 30%. And we can deliver with Gold Rush. We could be #1 for men and beat the broadcasters, and ID's length of view was so high. We have superfan groups around Oprah and Tyler and Science. So I think that being on brand has really helped us. And we have a good momentum story by having gone back to brand and the fact that we -- our share is growing. And so we're just going to have to see. I think right now, Joe Abruzzese and his team are doing a very good job, and so are our programming teams in the aggregate here in the U.S. And so we're going to continue to ride this out and hope that the advertising market stays. We'll see."

First, the cycle internationally in general tends to be more like 3 years versus 5 or 6 or 7 years here in the U.S. That's first. And this won't surprise most of you, but there really is a difference historically in pricing of distribution deals. The way that it's worked historically is that you get your extra pricing by growth. So price has been relatively flat over the last 10 years for most of us in the content business, and it's because distribution was growing pretty aggressively almost around the world. We still see aggressive growth, meaningful growth in Latin America, particularly Brazil and Mexico, although Brazil has slowed down a little bit with the economy. And India was seeing meaningful growth and Eastern Europe. There are a lot of other markets that are more mature now, like Western Europe and a number of the markets in Japan. What we've been able to do, or our strategy, which is starting to come through and will take a shorter time than it did here in the U.S. where the cycle is longer, is we have been scaling up in Europe over the last 4 or 5 years. And with the Olympics, with Eurosport, but more importantly, just with the overall scale expansion, because we've been growing our market share double digit for the last 6 consecutive years in Europe and Latin America, we now sit with distributors. And we started about 1.5 years ago where -- in Western Europe that -- since there's very modest sub growth, it's not going to work for us. And so the good news is we have enough scale, we believe, to drive price. And we've been able to do that as our deals come up. The same way we had an attack plan to drive a step-up in pricing here in the U.S., we have that outside the U.S. We don't -- we're not executing it everywhere because there are a number of markets we we're getting better than double-digit growth just because gestationally, these are -- continue to be higher-growth markets. And in those markets, we'll play the old game, where we're continuing to grow share, we're getting our channels carried, distributors are promoting us, and we're getting double-digit growth. In the more mature markets, we are being quite aggressive. Look, in Sweden, we pulled our signal, and we were off for 4 days. And then when we went back on, we were able to get better than double-digit increase. Across much of Europe, on renewals, we have been very clear that our scale is up, our investment is up, and we need significant increases. And so you'll see those come in over the next couple of years. 
One other point, Todd, that I think we could provide that I think is meaningful is that TV Everywhere and SVOD is becoming a big part, particularly TV Everywhere and VOD, across those mature markets. And we have a 20-year library in language, and we also have the Olympic IP, and we also have sports IP. And so the ability for us to have a win-win, which is you take our channels, but in addition, we'll give you some more content for TV Everywhere because we have a ton of it. It's a win for them, it's a win for us, and it helps us further substantiate the pricing rather than just the old shootout at the OK Corral."

It's a -- for us, the good news is we're very protected on the bundle. We could have gotten more price and structured deals where there was more flexibility to move some of our channels.

We have a derisked U.S. business model. We have an accelerating cash flow model. I'm extraordinarily comfortable with the seat I'm in that we can sustain this higher level of leverage still being fully committed to maintaining our investment grade and allow ourselves to drive a higher level of return on equity while still being very prudent with our debt and capital structure.

I",902,"Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. A month ago, Discovery hosted our first Investor Day to provide a detailed overview of our global strategy and outlook and introduce you to our corporate and international executive management team. It was great to see so many of you there. 
During that presentation, you heard me talk about where we've come as a global media company, where we're going, what sets us apart and the keys to our continued operational growth and financial success. 
Because of our confidence in our financial performance and our free cash flow outlook, much of which is locked in through long-cycle affiliate deals, today, I'm pleased to announce that we have increased our buyback authorization by $2 billion, and we will be back in the market buying our shares this quarter. Andy will share more information on the buyback authorization increase and take you through the financial details in just a moment. 
First, let me briefly take you through some of this quarter's top line performance highlights. First and foremost, our strong brands and award-winning content in the U.S. market continued to perform remarkably well, generating enduring value. I'm pleased to report our portfolio of U.S. channels again outperformed broadcast and cable peers and commanded an increase of share of our ad-supported cable. 
Discovery Channel had the highest-rated quarter ever for persons 25 to 54 delivery and has been the #1 ad-supported cable channel for men 4 months so far this year alone. 
As we showcased at Investor Day, our ability to reach audiences around the world with great storytelling will be on full display on December 2 when Discovery Channel premieres the landmark documentary, Racing Extinction, a truly global event reaching 1 billion viewers in over 220 countries on one day. Only Discovery can do this. It is our unique advantage. 
Among women, ID was the #1 ad-supported cable channel in total delivery for the month of September; #1 ad-supported cable channel for women in September, really extraordinary. And prime delivery on ID rose 16%. Given our low cost per hour, our ability to top the ranking charts and grow delivery across ad-supported cable is significant for ID. 
Our U.S. ad sales were very strong this quarter, up 6% versus last year due to record scatter volume, strong pricing and improved demand, and we were able to monetize our ratings improvements at key networks like Discovery Channel, ID and Velocity. 
On the affiliate side, revenues rose 12% in the third quarter. We continue to see the benefits of the strong price increases we have secured through the current renewal cycle, of which we are now 80% complete here in the U.S. 
The price escalators are locked in for years to come, and we also are adding revenue from new partners such as Verizon Go90, Hulu and Sony. 
At our Investor Day, I also said that our leading global distribution platform is Discovery's secret sauce. That's once again true in the third quarter. International viewership grew mid-single digit overall, with ID, TLC and Eurosport up double digit or better. Our ability to increase share of viewership internationally helped drive strong organic advertising and affiliate growth. 
Organic ad sales rose 12%, and organic distribution growth also was strong, up 8%. These figures demonstrate our strong international growth profile and best-in-class platform. 
Across Europe, we are continuing to build Eurosport's offering by strategically investing in sports rights and increasing production values to bring local fans closer to the action. As a result, viewership is up 16% this quarter, with some countries like Poland and Germany gaining market share rapidly, where we have added locally popular franchises to our lineup. 
Owning our IP, another key to our performance and growth, is also presenting new possibilities. In a multi-platform world, ownership of our content gives us the ability to tell stories, create brands, build community on new platforms, and we have found that our content does play in multiple ecosystems. 
We have recently seen a dramatic increase in views across Discovery Digital Networks as we nourish audiences with storytelling only we can do across multiple platforms. And we have seen real engagement with our online channels, including TestTube, Seeker and SourceFed, 3 of 90 YouTube channels that we have, which now aggregate to over 200 million views a month, 50 million of them on Facebook alone. 
To better leverage the value of our content across all of these platforms, we have brought Paul Guyardo to our executive team. Paul was a leader working for Barry Diller, and he spent many years at DIRECTV with their marketing and direct-to-consumer business. As Chief Commercial Officer, Paul is hyperfocused on maximizing our powerful brands and programming revenue across all platforms. 
Overall, the combination of Discovery's unique content with our IP ownership position, category leadership and creative and innovative management team ensures we will be one of the leading content creators for years into the future. No other media company owns such great content and IP to exploit against platforms. No other media company has such a broad international distribution platform and brands that resonate so deeply with global audiences and superfans. 
I remain extremely confident and excited about our future and in Discovery's ability to succeed and grow. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Andy for more details on our financial results and plans to return capital to our shareholders."
22666093,310568730,890861,"Discovery Communications, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros.

And while, as expected, costs were elevated in the quarter mostly due to the timing of content and marketing",1767,"Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
Discovery continues to execute well on our stated operational and financial goals. And while, as expected, costs were elevated in the quarter mostly due to the timing of content and marketing investments, we are extremely pleased with the solid organic top line growth we generated, both in the U.S. and internationally. All of our key third quarter financial metrics are in line with the numbers I presented at our September Investor Day. 
On a reported basis, total company third quarter revenues decreased 1%, and adjusted OIBDA was down 9%. Excluding currencies, revenues were up 8%, and adjusted OIBDA was down 1%. 
On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the impact of Eurosport, Discovery Family and the June 30 sale of SBS Radio, total company revenues increased 7%, and adjusted OIBDA declined 1%. 
As we had anticipated and have previously discussed, after 2 quarters of strong cost control, we saw a significant uptick in costs, both domestically and internationally, given this year's cadence of content and marketing investments, which are weighted towards the second half of the year and peaked in the third quarter. 
Net income available to Discovery Communications of $279 million was relatively flat versus last year's third quarter net income of $280 million as the lower operating performance was offset by a positive swing in our mark-to-market stock-based compensation as well as lower income taxes. 
Our third quarter tax rate decreased by 400 basis points versus last year to 31% due to some discrete onetime tax settlements during the quarter. We still expect our effective tax rate to be 33% for full year 2015 and to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017. Our declining tax rate will continue to drive sustained net income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth over time. 
Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $0.43, and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.47. Excluding currency impacts both above and below the line, adjusted EPS was up 25% for the third quarter and up 11% for the last 12 months. 
Free cash flow in the third quarter decreased to $234 million after being up 55% in the second quarter, primarily due to the timing of working capital and content spend. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low single digits versus 2014 and expect it to accelerate nicely in 2016. 
Turning now to the operating units. Despite all the talk about domestic secular concerns, our U.S. Networks grew revenues an impressive 8% this quarter as we benefited from another quarter of strong distribution growth, up 12%, and a significant acceleration in advertising growth to up 6% year-over-year. 
We are extremely pleased with our third quarter ad sales performance. As David mentioned, our ratings outperformed the industry, and this outperformance helped us benefit from robust scatter pricing and volume as well as stronger overall demand. 
Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, did accelerate from the second quarter and were up 7% this quarter. We again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 as well as some contributions from our new Hulu deal, which started January 1 of this year. 
Discovery Family will be fully lapped starting in the fourth quarter, so our 4Q reported and organic growth rates will be the same, and then looking ahead, our favorable Comcast renewal will go into effect on January 1 of 2016. 
Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 14% on a reported basis and were up 11% excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. 
Excluding Family, cost of revenues were up 8% due to the timing of content spend, and SG&A was up 15% as we ramped up marketing spend after 2 quarters of declines. This led to a 200 basis point decline in reported and organic margins to 57% versus the prior year. 
Moving on to our international operations. Our international division saw an impressive organic ad and distribution growth in the third quarter. On a reported basis, revenues declined 9%, and reported OIBDA declined 21%. But excluding currency, revenues increased 6%, and adjusted OIBDA decreased 4%. 
Changes in FX rates reduced our revenue growth rates by 15% and our adjusted OIBDA growth rate by 17% as the stronger dollar versus last year, especially versus the Brazilian real, which fell another 21% during the quarter, remained a major headwind. 
On an organic basis, so excluding currency impacts as well as Eurosport and the recent sale of SBS Radio, revenues were up 9%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments refer to our organic results only, so exclude the impacts of Eurosport, SBS Radio and foreign exchange. 
The 9% third quarter revenue growth was led by 12% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Added growth is led by extremely strong 30-plus percent growth from Latin America, led by higher volumes and pricing in Brazil as well as strong trends in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. 
Southern Europe also grew ad revenues over 30%, led by higher volumes, pricing and ratings in Italy and solid double-digit growth in Spain. 
Excluding Russia, CEEMEA, led by Germany, also continued to grow nicely, with advertising revenues up 15%. 
Distribution revenues grew 8%, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rates and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, and to a lesser extent, increases in subscribers in Central and Eastern Europe. These country-level results reflects the strong long-term opportunity for our international markets that you heard about from JB Perrette last month. 
With just 1 quarter remaining, we are confident that full year international organic advertising growth will be in the low double-digit range, and we can now firmly say that organic affiliate growth for the full year will be in the high single-digit range. 
Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 13% in the quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we continue to focus on localizing our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 4%, and international organic margins were down 200 basis points to 36% versus the prior year. 
Eurosport's stand-alone margin in the third quarter was 6%, and we still expect margins to be in the high single-digit range for the full year. As we've stated, the benefit of increased investments in sports is expected to double Eurosport's ad revenue from 2015 to 2020 and will help Discovery's entire European business to sustain strong top line growth for years to come. 
Now moving on to our Education and Other segment, which reported a small operating loss for the quarter. Given our strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content from our in-house owned production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in Education's digital textbooks to drive the long-term value of this industry-disrupting business, this segment is expected to report a small loss in the fourth quarter as well. 
So now taking a look at our overall company financial position. In the third quarter, we only repurchased $52 million worth of preferred shares. But as David mentioned, we will resume our common share repurchases this quarter and intend to buy back approximately $1.5 billion worth of our stock over the next 12 months. 
Given this, the board has increased our share repurchase authorization by another $2 billion. Our previous authorization only has $450 million remaining and expires in February of next year, while this additional authorization does not expire until October of 2017. 
On our last earnings call, we stated that we were unlikely to repurchase additional shares through the end of 2015 in an effort to retain capital allocation flexibility for strategic transactions as well as to pay down debt to lower our leverage ratios. But given our solid and better-than-expected third quarter revenues and bottom line results, the successful Comcast renewal, our significant higher level of confidence in our ability to drive accelerating free cash flow, our high and growing cash flow-to-total debt yield, the continued favorable interest rate environment and finally, that we find the return of buying our shares at these levels to be extremely attractive, we have adjusted our view on leverage. After very careful consideration, we are now comfortable with increasing our gross debt-to-adjusted OIBDA ratio to the 3.25 to 3.4x range versus the 2.75x target we previously outlined, all while being highly committed to remaining an investment-grade debt issuer. 
As we stated during our Investor Day and our previous earnings calls, our capital allocation priorities remain the same: first, to invest in driving organic growth; second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP; and third, to repurchase our stock. 
We had been active buyers of our stock since inception of our buyback program in 2010 and, to date, have repurchased over $6.2 billion of our stock and have reduced our outstanding share count by over 30%. 
Turning now to our full year guidance for 2015, which we updated at our September Investor Day. We are still confident in our ability to achieve every metric that we laid out at the beginning of this year. To reiterate our constant-currency guidance I gave in September, we expect revenues to grow at 9% to 10%, adjusted OIBDA to grow in the mid-single-digit range and adjusted EPS to grow in the low double-digit range. These guidance ranges still include the recent sale of the noncore SBS Radio assets as well as the just over $50 million negative non-FX-related impact from Russia. 
We are also today updating our full year foreign exchange impacts versus last year's reported results. At current spot rates, FX is still expected to reduce our constant-currency guided revenue for the year by $460 million or roughly 7%, adjusted OIBDA by $180 million, also roughly 7%, while adjusted EPS is now expected to be reduced by $0.26 to $0.31, assuming no further below-the-line currency adjustments. 
Longer term, as we outlined at our Investor Day, we conservatively expect our constant-currency adjusted EPS and reported free cash flow to both grow at a low double-digit CAGR from 2015 to 2018. 
In conclusion, while there is currently much uncertainty in the marketplace, I remain extremely bullish on our global market positioning, our; long-term strategic outlook and our continued ability to achieve our stated financial goals. 
Now we'll open the line for questions."

The direct-to-consumer business is something we're just getting started with, but we have invested over the last 1.5 years, primarily through our Eurosport partnership and in Northern Europe with the Eurosport app and with Dplay. We're learning a lot. It's -- both of those platforms are growing meaningfully. We do have a target in place, which we're calling March to a Million. We have a couple of hundred thousand subscribers now. And if we can get to 1 million at the $6 to $8 a month, we could generate close to $100 million in revenue, which I think gets our whole company's attention in terms of culture. The exciting thing about the Eurosport app is that we're growing our direct-to-consumer business, but it's not coming at the expense of the linear channel. In fact, the linear channel grew more than 15% in the past quarter. So people are signing up for the U.S. Open, and they're watching maybe a choice of 18 courts. Most of it is when they're outside the home. And then when they're in the home, they're watching 1 of the 3 Eurosport channels in most cases. So we're finding that it's additive. We're learning a lot. The good news for us is we've improved our IP. So we did a lot of deals for Eurosport that were in the low single-digit increase for rights, where we stayed away from the big soccer. We've acquired a lot of kids' rights, where we're a leader in Kids in Latin America and now in Asia. And we own all of our content on Discovery, on TLC, where we've kind of really focused more on being on brand, with stronger, bigger content. And so we have a lot of optionality. I think it's just -- it's early days, but we do have a lot of flexibility here in the U.S. to make a move if we want to. And we're looking at it, we're looking at it."

We don't see right now anything that gives us a sense that things are better or worse. We -- the only thing that we see that's attractive is the advertising market in the third and fourth has been consistent and is better than it was in fourth, first and second. On the Eurosport side, we've been quite aggressive about going out and doing deals. And so far, we've learned a couple of things. We've learned that we can grow viewership significantly without buying big-time soccer. We've also watched just big-time soccer has grown in terms of rates across Europe 60%, 70%, 80%, 100% in terms of fees. And in many cases, it's big distributors that are fighting for that, and in many cases, there has to be more than one distributor that gets it. And so it's created kind of a feeding frenzy around that content. The good thing for us is we've kind of ducked our heads on that. And because so much economics has gone to soccer and because we're the only player that can offer a Pan-European platform, we've been able to sweep in 60-plus deals of very compelling rights, whether it's speedskating, ski jumping, most of Winter Sports, summer track and field, more cycling, more tennis at mid-single digit. And we're even having discussions with some players that bought soccer and that are looking to pick up some extra economics by selling some of these niche sports. And for us, those niche sports are looking like those are the drivers that are quite attractive for the Eurosport app. Those are the superfan groups that love -- that want to see all the speedskating or want to see all the cycling. And so right now, I think we're quite comfortable that we already committed that Eurosport will not go upside down, it will be profitable. We took the profitability margins down from in the 20s to single digits. And we think over time that we can -- we should be able to not only be profitable, but we should start to get some of the benefit of the app, which is all incremental and the viewership gains that we're getting now, which we'll get the benefit. And we've seen in some markets already that when you put Eurosport together with our 10 traditional channels, we get benefit. And by selling Eurosport locally, we're getting benefit. So I'd say so far, so good."

It moved away quickly in the fourth quarter. We didn't quite know why. It flattened out, and now there's no question that volume has been much stronger and pricing has been good. A piece of that, candidly, is that we're outperforming. There are a number of players in the industry that are -- that have -- ratings have dropped significantly. And so there's been a meaningful ADU issue in the marketplace. And so if you want to put money to work, the fact that our ratings are up and our -- more importantly, our share is up, we didn't have that issue. So we had -- we were open for business. The other thing is that our channels are on brand, so Discovery has never been stronger, and the ability to get aligned with the #1 network for men, and now we have ID, which was the #1 network for women. ID is still meaningfully underpriced. And when you look at the CPM differential between broadcast and cable in general, it's still over 30%. And we can deliver with Gold Rush. We could be #1 for men and beat the broadcasters, and ID's length of view was so high. We have superfan groups around Oprah and Tyler and Science. So I think that being on brand has really helped us.

So we still sit here today and say our stock is cheap, it's a smart allocation of capital, and we still have an enormous amount of capital available beyond that for some opportunistic either buying of IP or investing in scale. So it certainly is not one or the other. And the good news is -- it may be surprising for investors, is that we can still achieve both, given what we see as our cash profile and given the slightly increased level of leverage."

I just -- I'd love to explore international, particularly the affiliate fees a little bit with you, if you don't mind. And just the world is a big place, but when we think about how to get confidence going forward, anything you could do to decompose the sources of growth there? A lot of your press release talked about subscriber growth in the emerging markets. How much is that as a sort of percentage of your growth going forward as opposed to, say, more stable parts in the world like Western Europe, where you think about pricing cadence and deal renewals and Eurosport and new additions like that? Anything that you could share on sort of the mix of how that goes, and in the Western Europe part of the world, if there's anything you could say in terms of pace of renewals, pricing expectation on renewals, I know we all would find that very helpful."

First, the cycle internationally in general tends to be more like 3 years versus 5 or 6 or 7 years here in the U.S. That's first. And this won't surprise most of you, but there really is a difference historically in pricing of distribution deals. The way that it's worked historically is that you get your extra pricing by growth. So price has been relatively flat over the last 10 years for most of us in the content business, and it's because distribution was growing pretty aggressively almost around the world. We still see aggressive growth, meaningful growth in Latin America, particularly Brazil and Mexico, although Brazil has slowed down a little bit with the economy. And India was seeing meaningful growth and Eastern Europe. There are a lot of other markets that are more mature now, like Western Europe and a number of the markets in Japan. What we've been able to do, or our strategy, which is starting to come through and will take a shorter time than it did here in the U.S. where the cycle is longer, is we have been scaling up in Europe over the last 4 or 5 years. And with the Olympics, with Eurosport, but more importantly, just with the overall scale expansion, because we've been growing our market share double digit for the last 6 consecutive years in Europe and Latin America, we now sit with distributors. And we started about 1.5 years ago where -- in Western Europe that -- since there's very modest sub growth, it's not going to work for us. And so the good news is we have enough scale, we believe, to drive price. And we've been able to do that as our deals come up. The same way we had an attack plan to drive a step-up in pricing here in the U.S., we have that outside the U.S. We don't -- we're not executing it everywhere because there are a number of markets we we're getting better than double-digit growth just because gestationally, these are -- continue to be higher-growth markets. And in those markets, we'll play the old game, where we're continuing to grow share, we're getting our channels carried, distributors are promoting us, and we're getting double-digit growth. In the more mature markets, we are being quite aggressive. Look, in Sweden, we pulled our signal, and we were off for 4 days. And then when we went back on, we were able to get better than double-digit increase. Across much of Europe, on renewals, we have been very clear that our scale is up, our investment is up, and we need significant increases. And so you'll see those come in over the next couple of years. One other point, Todd, that I think we could provide that I think is meaningful is that TV Everywhere and SVOD is becoming a big part, particularly TV Everywhere and VOD, across those mature markets. And we have a 20-year library in language, and we also have the Olympic IP, and we also have sports IP. And so the ability for us to have a win-win, which is you take our channels, but in addition, we'll give you some more content for TV Everywhere because we have a ton of it. It's a win for them, it's a win for us, and it helps us further substantiate the pricing rather than just the old shootout at the OK Corral."

As you know, from our Investor Day, we assumed, as the industry started to show very slight decline that, that was going to continue. There is a lag, because we tend to get paid 2 to 3 months later, but looking at the earnings reports from the distributors, I think it was very encouraging. Some of them have gained subs. Others are declining at much lower rates. If that flows through, that'll be meaningful upside for us to what our plan is because we've assumed that there'll be slight decline. And even at the numbers that we were seeing in the recent earnings reports, that's better than what we have in our plan. And so we'll just have to see. It's a -- for us, the good news is we're very protected on the bundle. We could have gotten more price and structured deals where there was more flexibility to move some of our channels. We opted to have the maximum security for our channels and get price. And so we will track pretty closely what the universe estimates are because we did build into our deals over the last 4 years less flexibility to play -- to move around our channels."

We talked about the third quarter -- or the second quarter being a bit of an anomaly, so us being back in the double-digit range is where we should be. Look, for me, I continue to think that's where we're going to stay for a while. We just have so much growth potential and opportunity across so many of our key markets and regions. And so I think the third quarter trend not only is encouraging, but I think indicative of a lot of the kind of core ad sales metrics we've seen across our international markets."

Kannan, look, this is something that we've thought about and debated the merits of for quite some time, quite frankly. We had one of our board meetings in October, and look, when we look at our portfolio, we look at our free cash flow growth, we look at the fact that 80% of our U.S. affiliate deals are done, with tremendous-rate CAGRs. When we look at our cash tax rate and what we're doing there to drive that down, when we compare ourselves not only those operating metrics but then we compare ourselves to our peers around, as I mentioned I think before, our interest coverage ratios, our free cash flow-to-debt yield, look, it's the right capital structure for us. We have a derisked U.S. business model. We have an accelerating cash flow model. I'm extraordinarily comfortable with the seat I'm in that we can sustain this higher level of leverage still being fully committed to maintaining our investment grade and allow ourselves to drive a higher level of return on equity while still being very prudent with our debt and capital structure. So it just was very much kind of the timing of not only board discussions but then, just operationally, how confident I feel now about our growth profile."
