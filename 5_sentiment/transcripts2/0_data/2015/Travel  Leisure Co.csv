As you saw from the release, we closed the year with another great quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 23% in the quarter and 18% for the full year with growth driven primarily by stronger operating performance and supported by share repurchases.
Quarterly performance was particularly strong in the Wyndham Hotel Group, with adjusted EBITDA up 23%. The summer momentum continued in our European Vacation Rental business into the last quarter of the year, resulting in 14% adjusted EBITDA growth at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals excluding foreign currency. And Wyndham Vacation Ownership achieved a significant sequential improvement in VPG as they applied the learnings from this summer to their new sales processes.
2014 was a great year, as each of our business units grew at or above their target rates, supported by initiatives such as our umbrella marketing campaign in the Hotel Group, dynamic pricing in Exchange & Rentals and better consumer portfolio performance as well as enhanced timeshare inventory acquisition models in Vacation Ownership. While we're proud of our accomplishments, we're focused on the future and excited about the opportunities ahead.
As you are aware, every U.S. company with even moderate foreign exchange exposure is experiencing headwinds from the significant strengthening of the dollar and we are no exception. While operating momentum in our European businesses remain strong, FX translation has negatively affected the EBITDA guidance we gave you just 3 months ago by $25 million. However, in response, we are adjusting our EBITDA range downward only by $15 million. We expect to deliver the remaining $10 million through strong operating performance at our businesses and tight cost controls. 
Tom will walk you through the guidance in detail, but I'll also note that there are -- that despite the reduction in EBITDA guidance, we are raising our EPS guidance to reflect primarily the full year impact of our fourth quarter 2014 share repurchases.
The energy and momentum in our company remains strong, and this is reflected in our board's decision to raise our quarterly dividend by 20% and our decision to raise our free cash flow target to $800 million in 2015. So now let's talk about some of the initiatives that are going to fuel our growth over the coming years.
I'll begin with our Hotel Group, which had a great year in 2014, growing adjusted EBITDA close to 15% and margins over 200 basis points. Our efforts in the Hotel Group are focused on 2 important areas: Increasing our reservation contribution to our franchisees; and improving the quality and awareness of our brands. 
One very important initiative to support these goals last year was our multi-brand umbrella marketing campaign. The campaign ultimately drove over 1.8 billion impressions. Bookings in our central channels increased 10% and enrollments in our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program grew 52%. This is great progress toward our goal of establishing the best-in-class loyalty program in our primary economy and midscale market segments which we expect will significantly drive reservation contribution to our franchisees. Stay tuned for some exciting developments with our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program this year.
Of course, maintaining category-leading brands begins with the quality of the hotels in our system which is a significant area of concentration for us. In 2014, terminations for properties below our system standards accounted for nearly 90% of the total properties terminated from our domestic system, helping to ensure that guest experience with our brands isn't tainted by a small fraction of hotels that fail to meet our standards. 
Following the recession, the vast majority of the properties were terminated from our system due to monetary defaults. As termination for quality defaults are now leading the way, we are also focused on adding properties that will improve the overall quality of the system. As a result, properties added to the system in 2014 had an average TripAdvisor rating that was 24 basis points higher than our system average. In addition, new construction openings were up 11% last year and new construction hotels are immediately accretive to brand quality.
You may remember from the earlier call that we were working on a process of launching new prototypes for many of our brands. We have plenty of opportunity to put these new prototypes into development ensuring high-quality for our guests and strong financial returns for our franchisees. Prototype redesigns and a compelling brand portfolio have helped us achieve a 17% increase in our new construction pipeline over the past 3 years. And we continue to add to the breadth and depth of our portfolio with our recent acquisition of Dolce Hotels and Resorts. Dolce's hotels and conference centers enhance our portfolio with a significantly larger presence in the group and meeting segment as well as the upper upscale and lifestyle segments. Its 4,000 employees worldwide will add depth and experience and expertise to our already well-established hotel management team. 
The managed business is a great growth platform opportunity for us. We've taken that business from just 24 properties 3 years ago to 84 properties today. Our managed portfolio across the globe achieved 2014 RevPAR growth of over 10% or 16% in North America, a testament to the strength of our brands and our effective hotel management capabilities.
Now let's move to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, which grew adjusted EBITDA in 2014 in our targeted range and improved their margins. They consistently do a great job of managing in difficult operating environments through innovation and tight expense management. As you know, Wyndham Exchange & Rentals is the world's largest vacation exchange network with 3.8 million members and is the world's largest professional manager of Vacation Rental properties with 103,000 properties. We match a portfolio of unique, nontraditional lodging accommodations through trusted well-established brands with the demand of leisure travelers, many of whom have vacationed with us for -- with our brands for generations. Our scale and global marketing expertise enable us to enhance demand and drive occupancy across our portfolio.
Last quarter, I spoke about how Exchange & Rentals business is increasingly leveraging analytics to transform the customer experience and improve yield. Today, I would like to spend a few minutes on some important initiatives to increase cross-selling amongst our brands. Recently, we launched inventory cross-selling between Novasol, our Denmark-based Vacation Rental business, and Cottages For You in Hoseason, each based in the U.K. Cottages For You hotel -- excuse me, Cottages For You holiday homes and Hoseasons boating holidays are now accessible across the Novasol websites, giving customers better visibility into approximately 15,000 private cottages and over 1,000 boating holidays in the U.K. and Ireland and making it easier to book vacations.
By integrating this U.K. and Irish product into its homepage, Novasol can better serve and help its Danish and German customers who want to travel to the U.K. and Ireland. While filling the demand for inventory with Cottages For You and Hoseasons product. Cottages For You and Novasol are offering a similar holiday home product, making it a natural fit from a customer desirability perspective. This builds on the recent introduction of cross-selling of over 3,000 French units between these brands. We believe that this is a start of an exciting opportunity to maximize cross market penetration through each of our brands in Europe and the U.S. 
Another example of sharing inventory across brands is the Wyndham Home Exchange Program. This program provides our Vacation Rental property owners with the ability to deposit up to 5 weeks per property annually in exchange for comparable intervals from within RCI's portfolio of affiliated Vacation Ownership results. It allows exchange members the opportunity to access a wider variety of vacation properties while also providing outstanding value to the Vacation Rental property owner. Cross-selling supports our strategy to offer more choices to the customers while driving better utilization of nontraditional leisure and inventory across our many brands.
Now let's move to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had a great year, coming in at the top of their original guidance range while instituting new sales and marketing processes that will ensure our ongoing success in years to come. More immediately, we've made good progress since the third quarter in refining our marketing and sales approach as evidenced by the sequential improvement in VPG, which was close to flat in constant currency in the fourth quarter.
We further refined our approach on the Specialist Presenter model and our outreach to owner operators. We remain committed to ensuring that our sales process is effective and in tune with the needs and preferences of existing and potential owners. 
Previously, we focused our discussion on the sales process but it's important to remember that a large part of this process is targeting the right consumers. We are always developing new analytical models that allow us to approach the right prospects with the right offer, including financing terms. This is a carefully orchestrated effort among the finance, sales and marketing teams. We worked hard on this area over the past 5 years, dramatically improving our FICO scores and down payments. In 2014, we further refined our underwriting standards, focusing on the size of loans. While this action negatively affected our VPG on gross sales, it also drove lower-than-expected charge-offs from those sales, enabling us to achieve net sales growth of 8% for the year.
Our provision for loan loss is near a record low and we're continuing to look for improvement. This reflects fundamental operating changes we made to the business but also supported by improving U.S. economy. And remember that a lower provision means that we are seeing lower charge-offs and higher collections, which improves cash flow.
Of course, nowhere are the changes in our timeshare business more transformative than how we source inventory. Since 2009, we've increasingly moved from capital intensive to capital efficient inventory sources. As a reminder, our capital efficient inventory sources include our Wyndham Asset Affiliation and Just in Time models, as well as recovered inventory we received primarily through homeowners associations and directly from our owners.
We've formalized the process on recovered inventory last year and we are excited about the benefits we received. As we've not only more capital efficient but it sees -- it is seeing positively both homeowners and homeowners associations.
Going forward, we expect to source of 60% to 70% of our inventory needs through capital efficient models. It's a significant reason why we're confident raising our free cash flow target. Capital efficient inventory sources provide significant ROIC and cash flow benefits to us. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter results."
31063165,281808076,758157,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2015",2015-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter results which is topped off another year of solid adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share growth. Let me review the financial performance of eac",1828,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter results which is topped off another year of solid adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share growth. 
Let me review the financial performance of each of our business units and then discuss our expectations for 2015. In the Hotel Group, revenues were up 9% and adjusted EBITDA increased 23% for the quarter, reflecting higher RevPAR and the favorable timing of loyalty and marketing expense, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. Domestic RevPAR increased 8.6%, led by strength in our economy and upscale brands. System-wide RevPAR increased 3%, reflecting both currency headwinds and higher growth in lower RevPAR markets, specifically China. Now if we were to exclude China and bring it to constant currency, global RevPAR grew 5.9% and international RevPAR was flat. Just In Size increased 2.4% for the year and the pipeline at year-end stood at approximately 960 hotels and 117,000 rooms. 
Our Exchange & Rentals segment generated solid operating results in what is traditionally its slowest quarter of the year. On a currency neutral basis, revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA was up 14%, reflecting revenue increases and effective cost management. On the exchange side of the business, revenues were up 2% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.2%, reflecting member growth in the Americas attributable to higher retention rates and new member growth, while exchange revenue per member was flat.
For Vacation Rentals, revenues were up $15 million or 11% for the quarter in constant currency, reflecting a 7.3% increase in transaction volume and a 3.3% increase in average net price per rental, primarily driven by growth and higher yield at our Landal GreenParks business based in Holland, where we are seeing the tangible benefits of our enhanced pricing tools.
We're coming off a strong year in Europe for our Vacation Rentals business. And our early booking experience indicates a continuation of this trend in 2015. Our bookings thus far are up compared to prior year. 
Let's keep in mind the nature of what we sell in our rental business in Europe. Primarily domestic vacations in Europe sold to Continental European or British consumers. So our product in Continental Europe for euro currency consumers is still a great value for those domestic market consumers and now an even better value for our U.K. customers due to the relative strength of the British pound.
Consumer confidence in our major European markets has remained steady. Our customers really value their vacations and the product offerings we provide. Near the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of Canvas Holidays, a provider of European camping holidays, resulting in a $20 million noncash loss. This segment of the leisure industry in Europe had experienced significant consolidation over the past 12 months. After careful assessment, we determined that we would need to make significant capital investments to maintain a relatively small position with limited growth prospects, and therefore, we decided to exit the business.
In our Vacation Ownership business, we wrapped up another strong year with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues were up 2% and EBITDA was flat year-over-year. Net VOI sales were flat, reflecting flat VPG in constant currency and a 2.1% decline in tour flow, offset by a lower provision for loan loss.
Similar to last quarter, tour flow decreases reflect lower upgrade tours as we transition to our new Specialist Presenter marketing program. While fewer existing owners are touring, our close rate for those owners who are touring is higher, providing promising signs for the Specialist Presenter model. Overall, VPG was still affected by the resulting mix shift to new owners. However, as Steve noted, we're pleased with the sequential progress we've made on VPG in the fourth quarter.
The provision for loan loss was $60 million, down 18% from a year ago. As Steve noted, the refinements we've made to our credit standards and other operational steps have resulted in provision rates that are near all-time lows.
Turning to some company-wide figures. Free cash flow for the year was $749 million or $5.90 per share, comfortably in our neighborhood target of $750 million. Inventory on the balance sheet increased approximately $140 million. Now this primarily reflects late 2014 inventory purchases and some noncash items. We repurchased 2.1 million shares for $171 million during the quarter, decreasing our weighted average diluted share count by 5% year-over-year. For the full year, we repurchased 8.6 million shares for $662 million. Including the $179 million we paid in dividends, we returned about $825 million to shareholders in 2014.
So now let's turn to our 2015 outlook and guidance. As a reminder, we'll post full guidance details to our Investor Relations website following the call. As Steve mentioned, we have adjusted our earlier guidance levels due to significant strengthening of the dollar. Recall that we noted a $9 million foreign exchange impact, 2015 versus 2014, when we issued our guidance in October. Well, since then, the currency has impacted adjusted EBITDA by another $25 million, resulting in total year-over-year foreign exchange headwinds of $34 million.
While we are lowering EBITDA guidance for 2015, we have refined our revenue assumptions and are increasing our revenue guidance by $50 million. The new range is $5,450,000,000 to $5,550,000,000. Note the negative FX impact is being primarily offset by the acquisition of Dolce.
Our new adjusted EBITDA guidance will come down just $15 million to $1,285,000,000 to $1,315,000,000. This guidance range reflects FX rates on January 30, 2015. We may update our views as we progress into the year should the value of the dollar change meaningfully.
Let me take a brief moment to explain to you why the company is experiencing this FX translation effect. Our hedging activity for earnings translation exposure is done on a quarterly basis. So while the P&L is somewhat protected from FX fluctuations in the short term, exposure beyond a given quarter remains unprotected. In large part, our hedging practices around translation are guided by consideration of hedge accounting implications.
Hedging of non-economic activities such as earnings translations in our business does not receive favorable accounting treatment, which could result in P&L volatility. Therefore, we hedge within a quarter to avoid the optics of P&L volatility.
As it relates to how we see these FX movements impacting our business, our ongoing philosophy has been to evaluate the performance of our international businesses, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Our operating teams are responsible for the commercial momentum of our businesses and we believe the best way to judge the momentum of our underlying businesses is on a local currency basis. Therefore, we will disclose our results in 2015 with and without the impact of foreign currency effects.
On a currency neutral basis, our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2015 implies growth of 6% to 9%, which is consistent with our targeted business growth rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2015 moves to $4.75 to $4.90, reflecting share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the net effect of foreign exchange. We expect the diluted share count of approximately 123 million shares, which per our standard guidance practice, assumes no share buybacks in 2015.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units, starting with the Hotel Group. We expect another strong year. We expect revenues of $1,270,000,000 to $1,320,000,000. We expect RevPAR growth of 4% to 6% and room growth of 3% to 5%. And constant currency, however, RevPAR growth will be 5% to 7%. Note that the Hotel Group revenues assume approximately $100 million of pass-through reimbursable revenues from the Dolce acquisition. Pass-through reimbursable revenues contribute no EBITDA and will result in a full year margin detriment of about 250 basis points for the Wyndham Hotel Group in 2015. Hotel Group EBITDA will be $360 million to $375 million. 
At Exchange & Rentals, while the operating results of Candace were immaterial to our full year results, the sale of the business will impact our driver growth rates and also have a significant seasonality impact on EBITDA and EPS. In 2014, Candace generated losses in the first, second and fourth quarters, but produced $18 million of EBITDA during the third quarter. We will mention these effects in future quarters. Reflecting January 30, 2015, FX rates in the sale of Candace, we expect revenues of $1,500,000,000 to $1,560,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $364 million to $377 million for WER. On a currency neutral basis and excluding the effect of the Candace sale, growth would be 3% to 6% for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
We expect the average number of exchange members to grow 1% to 3%, and exchange revenue per member to be down 1% to 3%. However, on a constant currency basis, at the midpoint, exchange revenue per member would be flat.
We expect Vacation Rental transactions to grow 2% to 4%. We expect average net price per rental to decrease 9% to 11%, primarily reflecting foreign exchange. On a currency neutral basis, average net price per rentals would be flat. Adjusting Candace results out of 2014 drivers, the growth rate in Rental transactions and average net price per transaction would be approximately 200 basis points higher. 
For Vacation Ownership, we expect revenues of 2.66 -- $2,660,000,000 to $2,725,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $680 million to $700 million. We expect tour and VPG growth of 1% to 3%. Excluding foreign exchange effects, EBITDA growth would be 4% to 7%. 
Company wide, we expect corporate expenses of $130 million to $135 million, down from 2014 due to lower employee expenses and legal fees. We expect depreciation and amortization to be between $242 million and $245 million. We expect interest expense of $112 million to $114 million, which assumes no debt issuances in 2015.
I'm also very happy to say that our free cash flow target will move to $800 million for 2015. That equates to $6.50 per share. Remember that we managed to a neighborhood target when it comes to cash flow. But overall, we expect free cash flow to grow in 2015. We will post our cash flow representative model with our cash flow assumptions for the year to our website following the call.
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.91 to $0.94. Year-over-year, 2015 first quarter comparisons will benefit from the absence of approximately a $6.5 million loss from Candace in 2014.
Remember that our interest expense is always a little lower the first quarter than our annual run rate due to the timing of VAT credits, and we would also remind you that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance assumptions. To close, we were very pleased with the performance of 2014 and are looking forward to another terrific year in 2015. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

Well, thanks, Steve, I'll take the questions and Tom will weigh in as he sees fit. On the VPG question, which I do understand there were a lot of questions in the third quarter, if you look at the history of our VPG, it has not been straight line. It has been a little bumpy, a little volatile. And that's the nature of this sales and marketing business like this. We set long-term goals and we achieve those goals, and that's what we've done continually. But it doesn't mean for 1 quarter we may not be up or down. As France, so you mentioned, runs that business said the other day, we start the year we run the marathon. Our splits may not be exactly what we want them to be, but we know that we can sprint a little harder and reach the goal at the end of the day. And that is part of the art of how he runs that business and they do a phenomenal of running the business down there in Orlando. Specifically what they did was they -- as we talked about in the last call, they had a pretty good idea of what was impacting the VPG downturn. They adjusted for that. Some of the things they did was they changed the kind of timing and rhythm of our tours for our in-house guests. So people staying at the resort coming in to take a tour, we were a little bit too rigid and structured about when those tours are going to be. So we moved back to a little more flexible model but still using our Specialist Presenter program, the new way of positioning the product. That had a very big impact on the success rate of generating those in-house tours. And as you know, VPG on in-house tours are higher than the front line tours. So just that mix can have a bit of a change to it. And that's really -- I mean, there's no more really to the secret sauce than that. That is what we did. We look at basically our marketing methodology and we adjusted it and we'll continue to adjust it. And again, I'll say this, we've said it in the past, don't expect VPG to be straight-line every quarter. We work to maximize our profitability in the business. As we commented, our gross VOI was kind of flattish and down a little bit in the third and fourth quarter. But our net VOI, when you take into account who we're selling to and what our loss profile is, was actually growing by 8%. So there's give and takes in that business. It's one of the wonderful flexibilities of that business and I don't know if there's any group that manages it better than our group down in Orlando. As for Dolce, thank you for the comment of finding that deal. M&A is kind of part of our DNA here, and we have a terrific M&A group. It's not huge but it's a great group that are constantly turning over rocks and looking for deals. We've looked at Dolce for a while. We were doing other things and had our focus in other areas, but once we turned our laser focus to it, we're able to complete that deal relatively quickly and we think it'll be a great addition to our hotel portfolio. As I said, not only adding more group and meeting business capability to us from an inventory standpoint, but also from the sales standpoint, they have a great reputation in the meetings business for group meetings. And now we can apply that same group salespeople to also driving more business to our Wyndham and other meeting and banquet hotels. So we feel like this is a terrific opportunity for us, a great fit. It's a New Jersey-based company, so it's kind of easy. We hope to keep all those key players involved and so we're very much looking forward to the integration of that business."

But we haven't seen over the years where there's been ups and downs in consumer confidence in some of the countries in Europe as well as volatility in the currency that it's had all that much of an impact on our business. And again, as I said, we see starting the year strong over there. So we don't see anything to indicate that even though the euros weigh down that it's impacting. Now could it be because people aren't planning their international trips? That could be interesting topic. But my intuition would tell me it's probably not having that large of an impact. If anything within Europe, I think it may increase the flow of trips to Continental Europe because there is a nice arbitrage of the pound to the euro.

But remember that the inventory on our balance sheet is comprised of a number of different components. So those components aren't going to necessarily go away. So I think in the past, we've talked about the number getting south of $1 billion, maybe $800 million or $900 million at its optimal. But that is -- we wouldn't see it going much beyond that because again, with the components that are sort of fixed components. And I'll remind you, that one of the components is the expected return of inventory that we get from our loan loss provision and so I think that's worth about $250 million in and of itself.

But we, again, have to be flexible and opportunistic about what the market is presenting. We rolled out several new prototypes this year and are rolling them out at our conference in March to the franchisees that we think will engender even greater support from the franchisees. And those brands that we're rolling out are Baymont, Days Inn, Super 8, there were 5 of them, I'm not remembering all of them. I think Hawthorn is another one. So those will have a fresh prototype that'll be available for franchisees, either new construction or conversion. So that -- those are brands that we would like to see grow because we think the prospects exist for quick growth. A lot of our growth is coming internationally. So when you look at our international markets, most of our brands are represented in most markets but not all. This year, we opened properties in some South American markets where we never had those brands before and they now represent new growth prospects. So we don't go into the year saying we want to see X number of Wyndham's, X number of Howard Johnson, X number of Super 8s. We go in with a targeted growth rate and then the sales -- the development team then targets very, very tightly regionally what's available, what fits best into a market. So I'm not answering your question probably the way you'd like that answer with some specific number for Knights Inn or Days Inn or Super 8. But we really don't manage the business that way.

As you saw from the release, we closed the year with another great quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 23% in the quarter and 18% for the full year, with growth driven primarily by stronger operating performance and supported by share repurchases.
Quarterly performance was particularly strong in the Wyndham Hotel Group, with adjusted EBITDA up 23%. The summer momentum continued in our European Vacation Rental business into the last quarter of the year, resulting in 14% adjusted EBITDA growth at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, excluding foreign currency. And Wyndham Vacation Ownership achieved a significant sequential improvement in VPG as they applied the learnings from this summer to their new sales processes.
2014 was a great year as each of our business units grew at or above their target rates, supported by initiatives such as our umbrella marketing campaign in the Hotel Group, dynamic pricing in Exchange & Rentals and better consumer portfolio performance as well as enhanced timeshare inventory acquisition models in Vacation Ownership. While we're proud of our accomplishments, we're focused on the future and excited about the opportunities ahead.
As you are aware, every U.S. company has -- with even moderate foreign exchange exposure is experiencing headwinds from the significant strengthening of the dollar, and we are no exception. While operating momentum in our European businesses remained strong, FX translation has negatively affected the EBITDA guidance we gave you just 3 months ago by $25 million. However, in response, we are adjusting our EBITDA range downward only by $15 million. We expect to deliver the remaining $10 million through strong operating performance at our businesses and tight cost controls. 
Tom will walk you through the guidance in detail, but I'll also note that there are -- that despite the reduction in EBITDA guidance, we are raising our EPS guidance to reflect primarily the full year impact of our fourth quarter 2014 share repurchases.
The energy and momentum in our company remained strong, and this is reflected in our board's decision to raise our quarterly dividend by 20% and our decision to raise our free cash flow target to $800 million in 2015. So now let's talk some -- about some of the initiatives that are going to fuel our growth over the coming years.
I'll begin with our Hotel Group, which had a great year in 2014, growing adjusted EBITDA close to 15% and margins over 200 basis points. Our efforts in the Hotel Group are focused on 2 important areas: increasing our reservation contribution to our franchisees; and improving the quality and awareness of our brands. 
One very important initiative to support these goals last year was our multi-brand umbrella marketing campaign. The campaign ultimately drove over 1.8 billion impressions. Bookings in our central channels increased 10%, and enrollments in our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program grew 52%. This is great progress toward our goal of establishing the best-in-class loyalty program in our primary economy and mid-scale market segments, which we expect will significantly drive reservation contribution to our franchisees. Stay tuned for some exciting developments with our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program this year.
Of course, maintaining category-leading brands begins with the quality of the hotels in our system, which is a significant area of concentration for us. In 2014, terminations for properties below our system standards accounted for nearly 90% of the total properties terminated from our domestic system, helping to ensure that guest experience with our brands isn't tainted by a small fraction of hotels that fail to meet our standards. 
Following the recession, the vast majority of the properties were terminated from our system due to monetary defaults. As termination for quality defaults are now leading the way, we are also focused on adding properties that will improve the overall quality of the system. As a result, properties added to the system in 2014 had an average TripAdvisor rating that was 24 basis points higher than our system average. In addition, new construction openings were up 11% last year, and new construction hotels are immediately accretive to brand quality.
You may remember from the earlier call that we were working on a process of launching new prototypes for many of our brands. We have plenty of opportunity to put these new prototypes into development, ensuring high quality for our guests and strong financial returns for our franchisees. Prototype redesigns and a compelling brand portfolio have helped us achieve a 17% increase in our new construction pipeline over the past 3 years. And we continue to add to the breadth and depth of our portfolio with our recent acquisition of Dolce Hotels and Resorts. Dolce's hotels and conference centers enhance our portfolio with a significantly larger presence in the group and meeting segment as well as the upper upscale and lifestyle segments. Its 4,000 employees worldwide will add depth in experience and expertise to our already well-established hotel management team. 
The managed business is a great growth platform opportunity for us. We've taken that business from just 24 properties 3 years ago to 84 properties today. Our managed portfolio across the globe achieved 2014 RevPAR growth of over 10% or 16% in North America, a testament to the strength of our brands and our effective hotel management capabilities.
Now let's move to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, which grew adjusted EBITDA in 2014 in our targeted range and improved their margins. They consistently do a great job of managing in difficult operating environments through innovation and tight expense management. As you know, Wyndham Exchange & Rentals is the world's largest vacation exchange network with 3.8 million members and is the world's largest professional manager of Vacation Rental properties with 103,000 properties. 
We match a portfolio of unique, nontraditional lodging accommodations through trusted well-established brands with the demand of leisure travelers, many of whom have vacationed with us for -- with our brands for generations. Our scale and global marketing expertise enable us to enhance demand and drive occupancy across our portfolio.
Last quarter, I spoke about how Exchange & Rentals -- our Exchange & Rentals business is increasingly leveraging analytics to transform the customer experience and improve yield. Today, I would like to spend a few minutes on some important initiatives to increase cross-selling amongst our brands. 
Recently, we launched inventory cross-selling between Novasol, our Denmark-based Vacation Rental business, and Cottages 4 You in Hoseason, each based in the U.K. Cottages 4 You hotel -- excuse me, Cottages 4 You holiday homes and Hoseasons boating holidays are now accessible across the Novasol websites, giving customers better visibility into approximately 15,000 private cottages and over 1,000 boating holidays in the U.K. and Ireland and making it easier to book vacations. By integrating this U.K. and Irish product into its homepage, Novasol can better serve and help its Danish and German customers who want to travel to the U.K. and Ireland while filling the demand for inventory with Cottages 4 You and Hoseasons product. Cottages 4 You and Novasol offer a similar holiday home product, making it a natural fit from a customer desirability perspective. 
This builds on the recent introduction of cross-selling of over 3,000 French units between these brands. We believe that this is the start of an exciting opportunity to maximize cross-penetration -- cross-market penetration through each of our brands in Europe and the U.S. 
Another example of sharing inventory across brands is the Wyndham Home Exchange program. This program provides our Vacation Rental property owners with the ability to deposit up to 5 weeks per property annually in exchange for comparable intervals from within RCI's portfolio of affiliated Vacation Ownership resorts. It allows exchange members the opportunity to access a wider variety of vacation properties while also providing outstanding value to the Vacation Rental property owner. Cross-selling supports our strategy to offer more choices to the customers while driving better utilization of nontraditional leisure and inventory across our many brands.
Now let's move to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had a great year, coming in at the top of their original guidance range while instituting new sales and marketing processes that will ensure our ongoing success in years to come. More immediately, we've made good progress since the third quarter in refining our marketing and sales approach as evidenced by the sequential improvement in VPG, which was close to flat in constant currency in the fourth quarter.
We further refined our approach on the Specialist Presenter model and our outreach to owner upgrades. We remain committed to ensuring that our sales process is effective and in tune with the needs and preferences of existing and potential owners. 
Previously, we focused our discussion on the sales process, but it's important to remember that a large part of this process is targeting the right consumers. We are always developing new analytical models that allow us to approach the right prospects with the right offer, including financing terms. This is a carefully orchestrated effort among the finance, sales and marketing teams. 
We've worked hard on this area over the past 5 years, dramatically improving our FICO scores and down payments. In 2014, we further refined our underwriting standards, focusing on the size of loans. While this action negatively affected our VPG on gross sales, it also drove lower-than-expected charge-offs from those sales, enabling us to achieve net sales growth of 8% for the year.
Our provision for loan loss is near a record low, and we're continuing to look for improvement. This reflects fundamental operating changes we made to the business but also supported by improving U.S. economy. And remember that a lower provision means that we are seeing lower charge-offs and higher collections, which improves cash flow.
Of course, nowhere in the -- are the changes in our timeshare business more transformative than how we source inventory. Since 2009, we've increasingly moved from capital-intensive to capital-efficient inventory sources. As a reminder, our capital-efficient inventory sources include our Wyndham Asset Affiliation and Just-in-Time models, as well as recovered inventory we received primarily through homeowners' associations and directly from our owners.
We've formalized the process on recovered inventory last year, and we are excited about the benefits we receive. As we've not only more capital-efficient, but it sees -- it is seen positively by homeowners and homeowners' associations.
Going forward, we expect to source 60% to 70% of our inventory needs through capital-efficient models. It's a significant reason why we're confident raising our free cash flow target. Capital-efficient inventory sources provide significant ROIC and cash flow benefits to us. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter results."
31063165,281808076,758384,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2015",2015-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which topped off another year of solid adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share growth. Let me review the financial performance of each o",1822,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which topped off another year of solid adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share growth. Let me review the financial performance of each of our business units and then discuss our expectations for 2015. 
In the Hotel Group, revenues were up 9%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 23% for the quarter, reflecting higher RevPAR and the favorable timing of loyalty and marketing expense, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. Domestic RevPAR increased 8.6%, led by strength in our economy and upscale brands. Systemwide RevPAR increased 3%, reflecting both currency headwinds and higher growth in lower-RevPAR markets, specifically China. Now if we were to exclude China and bring it to constant currency, global RevPAR grew 5.9%, and international RevPAR was flat. System size increased 2.4% for the year, and the pipeline at year-end stood at approximately 960 hotels and 117,000 rooms. 
Our Exchange & Rentals segment generated solid operating results in what is traditionally its slowest quarter of the year. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues increased 6%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 14%, reflecting revenue increases and effective cost management. On the exchange side of the business, revenues were up 2% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.2%, reflecting member growth in the Americas attributable to higher retention rates and new member growth, while exchange revenue per member was flat.
For Vacation Rentals, revenues were up $15 million or 11% for the quarter in constant currency, reflecting a 7.3% increase in transaction volume and a 3.3% increase in average net price per rental, primarily driven by growth and higher yield at our Landal GreenParks business based in Holland, where we are seeing the tangible benefits of our enhanced pricing tools. We're coming off a strong year in Europe for our Vacation Rentals business. And our early booking experience indicates a continuation of this trend in 2015. Our bookings thus far are up compared to prior year. 
Let's keep in mind the nature of what we sell in our rental business in Europe, primarily domestic vacations in Europe sold to Continental European or British consumers. So our product in Continental Europe for euro currency consumers is still a great value for those domestic market consumers and now an even better value for our U.K. customers due to the relative strength of the British pound.
Consumer confidence in our major European markets has remained steady. Our customers really value their vacations and the product offerings we provide. Near the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of Canvas Holidays, a provider of European camping holidays, resulting in a $20 million noncash loss. This segment of the leisure industry in Europe had experienced significant consolidation over the past 12 months. After careful assessment, we determined that we would need to make significant capital investments to maintain a relatively small position with limited growth prospects, and therefore, we decided to exit the business.
In our Vacation Ownership business, we wrapped up another strong year with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues were up 2%, and EBITDA was flat year-over-year. Net VOI sales were flat, reflecting flat VPG in constant currency and a 2.1% decline in tour flow, offset by a lower provision for loan loss.
Similar to last quarter, tour flow decreases reflect lower upgrade tours as we transition to our new Specialist Presenter marketing program. While fewer existing owners are touring, our close rate for those owners who are touring is higher, providing promising signs for the Specialist Presenter model. Overall, VPG was still affected by the resulting mix shift to new owners. However, as Steve noted, we're pleased with the sequential progress we made on VPG in the fourth quarter.
The provision for loan loss was $60 million, down 18% from a year ago. As Steve noted, the refinements we've made to our credit standards and other operational steps have resulted in provision rates that are near all-time lows.
Turning to some companywide figures. Free cash flow for the year was $749 million or $5.90 per share, comfortably in our neighborhood target of $750 million. Inventory on the balance sheet increased approximately $140 million. Now this primarily reflects late 2014 inventory purchases and some noncash items. We repurchased 2.1 million shares for $171 million during the quarter, decreasing our weighted average diluted share count by 5% year-over-year. For the full year, we repurchased 8.6 million shares for $662 million. Including the $179 million we paid in dividends, we returned about $825 million to shareholders in 2014.
So now let's turn to our 2015 outlook and guidance. As a reminder, we'll post full guidance details to our Investor Relations website following the call. As Steve mentioned, we have adjusted our earlier guidance levels due to the significant strengthening of the dollar. Recall that we noted a $9 million foreign exchange impact, 2015 versus 2014, when we issued our guidance in October. Well, since then, the currency has impacted adjusted EBITDA by another $25 million, resulting in total year-over-year foreign exchange headwinds of $34 million.
While we are lowering EBITDA guidance for 2015, we have refined our revenue assumptions and are increasing our revenue guidance by $50 million. The new range is $5,450,000,000 to $5,550,000,000. Note the negative FX impact is being primarily offset by the acquisition of Dolce.
Our new adjusted EBITDA guidance will come down just $15 million to $1,285,000,000 to $1,315,000,000. This guidance range reflects FX rates on January 30, 2015. We may update our views as we progress into the year should the value of the dollar change meaningfully.
Let me take a brief moment to explain to you why the company is experiencing this FX translation effect. Our hedging activity for earnings translation exposure is done on a quarterly basis. So while the P&L is somewhat protected from FX fluctuations in the short term, exposure beyond a given quarter remains unprotected. In large part, our hedging practices around translation are guided by consideration of hedge accounting implications.
Hedging of noneconomic activities such as earnings translations in our business does not receive favorable accounting treatment, which could result in P&L volatility. Therefore, we hedge within a quarter to avoid the upticks of P&L volatility.
As it relates to how we see these FX movements impacting our business, our ongoing philosophy has been to evaluate the performance of our international businesses, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Our operating teams are responsible for the commercial momentum of our businesses, and we believe the best way to judge the momentum of our underlying businesses is on a local currency basis. Therefore, we will disclose our results in 2015 with and without the impact of foreign currency effects.
On a currency-neutral basis, our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2015 implies growth of 6% to 9%, which is consistent with our targeted business growth rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2015 moves to $4.75 to $4.90, reflecting share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the net effect of foreign exchange. We expect a diluted share count of approximately 123 million shares, which, per our standard guidance practice, assumes no share buybacks in 2015.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units, starting with the Hotel Group. We expect another strong year. We expect revenues of $1,270,000,000 to $1,320,000,000. We expect RevPAR growth of 4% to 6% and room growth of 3% to 5%. In constant currency, however, RevPAR growth will be 5% to 7%. Note that the Hotel Group revenues assume approximately $100 million of pass-through reimbursable revenues from the Dolce acquisition. Pass-through reimbursable revenues contribute no EBITDA and will result in a full year margin detriment of about 250 basis points for the Wyndham Hotel Group in 2015. Hotel Group EBITDA will be $360 million to $375 million. 
At Exchange & Rentals, while the operating results of Canvas were immaterial to our full year results, the sale of the business will impact our driver growth rates and also have a significant seasonality impact on EBITDA and EPS. In 2014, Canvas generated losses in the first, second and fourth quarters, but produced $18 million of EBITDA during the third quarter. We will mention these effects in future quarters. Reflecting January 30, 2015, FX rates in the sale of Canvas, we expect revenues of $1,500,000,000 to $1,560,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $364 million to $377 million for WER. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding the effect of the Canvas sale, growth would be 3% to 6% for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
We expect the average number of exchange members to grow 1% to 3% and exchange revenue per member to be down 1% to 3%. However, on a constant currency basis, at the midpoint, exchange revenue per member would be flat.
We expect Vacation Rental transactions to grow 2% to 4%. We expect average net price per rental to decrease 9% to 11%, primarily reflecting foreign exchange. On a currency-neutral basis, average net price per rentals would be flat. Adjusting Canvas results out of 2014 drivers, the growth rate in rental transactions and average net price per transaction would be approximately 200 basis points higher. 
For Vacation Ownership, we expect revenues of 2.66 -- $2,660,000,000 to $2,725,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $680 million to $700 million. We expect tour and VPG growth of 1% to 3%. Excluding foreign exchange effects, EBITDA growth would be 4% to 7%. 
Companywide, we expect corporate expenses of $130 million to $135 million, down from 2014 due to lower employee expenses and legal fees. We expect depreciation and amortization to be between $242 million and $245 million. We expect interest expense of $112 million to $114 million, which assumes no debt issuances in 2015.
I'm also very happy to say that our free cash flow target will move to $800 million for 2015. That equates to $6.50 per share. Remember that we manage to a neighborhood target when it comes to cash flow. But overall, we expect free cash flow to grow in 2015. We will post our cash flow representative model with our cash flow assumptions for the year to our website following the call.
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.91 to $0.94. Year-over-year, 2015 first quarter comparisons will benefit from the absence of approximately a $6.5 million loss from Canvas in 2014.
Remember that our interest expense is always a little lower the first quarter than our annual run rate due to the timing of VAT credits, and we would also remind you that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance assumptions. To close, we were very pleased with the performance of 2014 and are looking forward to another terrific year in 2015. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

We had a strong quarter to cap off a great year across our businesses. We have outstanding people collaborating in a culture of performance and continuous improvement. Our commitment to value-creating capital allocation is unwavering, all of which positions Wyndham very well to continue to deliver for our shareholders.
The positive momentum of our business is allowing us to increase our free cash flow target and also increase our dividend by 20%. In addition, despite FX pressure, which is impacting our EBITDA guidance by just over 1%, we are raising our EPS guidance for 2015. And while we're very proud of what we've accomplished so far, we remain firmly focused on achieving success in the future by continuing to execute across our businesses, generating significant free cash flow and deploying our shareholders' capital to drive superior value.
With that, Wendy, we can open the line for questions."

We expect EBITDA growth, I think, foreign exchange-impacted EBITDA growth of around 5% or so. There are a couple of things. As it relates to product investment, we ended up investing a little more in inventory in 2014, and so we don't expect any incremental spend on inventory in 2015, so that's a neutral factor. On the cash tax side, we've actually identified some opportunities that were taking what was a headwind in the past and adding that as a positive to our overall free cash flow contribution. So we feel pretty good that, that $800 million number is achievable for the year and sustainable into the future."

Well, first of all, every company is different with their situation and circumstances and what they view as critical to their kind of ongoing success. Our timeshare business is roughly half of our overall company and has a great track record for proven growth and delivery of innovation. We're also very happy with our collection of businesses. It's -- we've got great businesses with fantastic talented associates, and everybody's proven to be very adaptable and resilient. So we've gone through some periods of downturn where other companies have seen more pain, and we haven't seen as much in part because of the resilient nature of the way the business is built. So in any particular cycle, it could look like a great idea or not a good idea and have all the businesses together. But we feel really good about the collection of businesses that we have. Having said that, as we've said continually since we listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we understand our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders, and we will look at all options and all opportunities. We've looked at all options and all opportunities, and we have now what we feel is the proper collection of businesses. But we continue to look at that, and that's not foretelling of anything. It's just foretelling of the fact that we're also always mindful of looking at what our options are out there. So we really think there is great connectivity with our businesses. We are continually looking at how we can cross-fertilize and cross-market the businesses, and we really feel like we have a terrific collection of very resilient and very strong leading businesses in each one of their sectors."

I'll take the questions, and Tom will weigh in as he sees fit. On the VPG question, which I do understand there were a lot of questions in the third quarter, if you look at the history of our VPG, it has not been straight line. It has been a little bumpy, a little volatile. And that's the nature of this sales and marketing business like this. We set long-term goals, and we achieve those goals, and that's what we've done continually. But it doesn't mean for 1 quarter, we may not be up or down. As Franz, who you mentioned runs that business, said the other day, we start the year, we run a marathon. Our splits may not be exactly what we want them to be, but we know that we can sprint a little harder and reach the goal at the end of the day. And that is part of the art of how he runs that business, and they do a phenomenal job of running the business down there in Orlando. Specifically what they did was they -- as we talked about in the last call, they had a pretty good idea of what was impacting the VPG downturn. They adjusted for that. Some of the things they did was they changed the kind of timing and rhythm of our tours for our in-house guests. So people staying at the resort, coming in to take a tour, we were a little bit too rigid and structured about when those tours are going to be. So we moved back to a little more flexible model but still using our Specialist Presenter program, the new way of positioning the product. That had a very big impact on the success rate of generating those in-house tours. And as you know, VPG on in-house tours are higher than the frontline tours. So just that mix can have a bit of a change to it. And that's really -- I mean, there's no more really to the secret sauce than that. That is what we did. We looked at basically our marketing methodology, and we adjusted it, and we'll continue to adjust it. And again, I'll say this, we've said it in the past, don't expect VPG to be straight line every quarter. We work to maximize our profitability in the business. As we commented, our gross VOI was kind of flattish and down a little bit in the third and fourth quarter. But our net VOI, when you take into account who we're selling to and what our loss profile is, was actually growing by 8%. So there's give and takes in that business. It's one of the wonderful flexibilities to that business, and I don't know that there's any group that manages it better than our group down in Orlando. As for Dolce, thank you for the comment of finding that deal. M&A is kind of part of our DNA here, and we have a terrific M&A group. It's not huge, but it's a great group that are constantly turning over rocks and looking for deals. We've looked at Dolce for a while. We were doing other things and had our focus in other areas, but once we turned our laser focus to it, we were able to complete that deal relatively quickly, and we think it'll be a great addition to our hotel portfolio. As I said, not only adding more group and meeting business capability to us from an inventory standpoint, but also from the sales standpoint, they have a great reputation in the meetings business for group meetings. And now we can apply that same group salespeople to also driving more business to our Wyndham and other meeting and banquet hotels. So we feel like this is a terrific opportunity for us, a great fit. It's a New Jersey-based company, so it's kind of easy. We hope to keep a lot of those key players involved, and so we're very much looking forward to the integration of that business."

Now could it be because people aren't planning their international trips? That could be an interesting thought. But I -- my intuition would tell me it's probably not having that large of an impact.

But remember that our -- the inventory on our balance sheet is comprised of a number of different components. And so those components aren't going to necessarily go away. So I think in the past, we've talked about the number getting south of $1 billion, maybe $800 million or $900 million at its optimal. But that -- we wouldn't see it going much beyond that because, again, of the components that are sort of fixed components. And I'll remind you that one of the components is the expected return of inventory that we get from our loan loss provision. And so I think that's worth about $250 million in and of itself. So we think that it will get, if we're running the business optimally, a couple of notches below $1 billion, and that's where we would settle."

So I think that if anything, you'd probably see a lower VPG growth in the first quarter, maybe a little bit higher in the second quarter then better in the third quarter, and in the fourth quarter, probably about the equivalent.

There's -- Dolce is a great brand with a great product. It's a global brand. There's quite a few properties in Europe as well as what we have in the U.S., but it has been a brand that has been somewhat starved for growth just because of the capital structure that the business was living in before. And we feel like we have the opportunity to kind of bring our capabilities to bear, including using capital to help grow the business more quickly, as we do in all of our upscale managed property environment with our development advanced notes or key money. So we have the ability to open doors that maybe weren't open before with the limitations that Dolce had. And on top of that, we have a true -- they have a terrific group sales marketing business, as I said before. That's both an advantage to us in our Wyndham properties but also advantage to the existing Dolce properties because we have ourselves a good group sales business. So we can kind of expand the group sales effort we have to deliver more for the owners of the Dolce hotels as well as for the owners of the Wyndham hotels. And so it's really a win-win on both sides. Both the teams are going to come together, and we're going to be in a position to drive a lot more value. The more value proposition we can build, the more people will sign up to become part of the Dolce system. And that is part of the kind of the secret sauce of how we grow our brands when we bring them together, is that the combined whole is more powerful than the individual pieces."

But we, again, have to be flexible and opportunistic about what the market is presenting. We rolled out several new prototypes this year and are rolling them out at our conference in March to the franchisees that we think will engender even greater support from the franchisees. And those brands that we're rolling out are Baymont, Days Inn, Super 8. There were 5 of them. I'm not remembering all of them. I think Hawthorn is another one. So those will have a fresh prototype that will be available for franchisees, either new construction or conversion. So that that's -- those are brands that we would like to see grow because we think the prospects exist for quick growth. A lot of our growth is coming internationally. So when you look at our international markets, most of our brands are represented in most markets but not all. This year, we opened properties in some South American markets where we never had those brands before, and they now represent new growth prospects. So we don't go into the year saying we want to see X number of Wyndhams, X number of Howard Johnsons, X number of Super 8s. We go in with a targeted growth rate, and then the sales -- the development team then targets very, very tightly regionally what's available, what fits best into a market. So I'm not answering your question probably the way you'd like I would answer with some specific number for Knights Inn or Days Inn or Super 8. But we really don't manage the business that way. We manage the business to maximize growth and manage the business to grow with the brands that present themselves with the best opportunities in specific markets."

Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. As you saw from the release, we closed the year with another great quarter.

As you saw from the release, we closed the year with another great quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 23% in the quarter and 18% for the full year, with growth driven primarily by stronger operating performance and supported by share repurchases.
Quarterly performance was particularly strong in the Wyndham Hotel Group, with adjusted EBITDA up 23%. The summer momentum continued in our European Vacation Rental business into the last quarter of the year, resulting in 14% adjusted EBITDA growth at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, excluding foreign currency. And Wyndham Vacation Ownership achieved a significant sequential improvement in VPG as they applied the learnings from this summer to their new sales processes.
2014 was a great year as each of our business units grew at or above their target rates, supported by initiatives such as our umbrella marketing campaign in the Hotel Group, dynamic pricing in Exchange & Rentals and better consumer portfolio performance as well as enhanced timeshare inventory acquisition models in Vacation Ownership. While we're proud of our accomplishments, we're focused on the future and excited about the opportunities ahead.
As you are aware, every U.S. company has -- with even moderate foreign exchange exposure is experiencing headwinds from the significant strengthening of the dollar, and we are no exception. While operating momentum in our European businesses remained strong, FX translation has negatively affected the EBITDA guidance we gave you just 3 months ago by $25 million. However, in response, we are adjusting our EBITDA range downward only by $15 million. We expect to deliver the remaining $10 million through strong operating performance at our businesses and tight cost controls. 
Tom will walk you through the guidance in detail, but I'll also note that there are -- that despite the reduction in EBITDA guidance, we are raising our EPS guidance to reflect primarily the full year impact of our fourth quarter 2014 share repurchases.
The energy and momentum in our company remained strong, and this is reflected in our board's decision to raise our quarterly dividend by 20% and our decision to raise our free cash flow target to $800 million in 2015. So now let's talk some -- about some of the initiatives that are going to fuel our growth over the coming years.
I'll begin with our Hotel Group, which had a great year in 2014, growing adjusted EBITDA close to 15% and margins over 200 basis points. Our efforts in the Hotel Group are focused on 2 important areas: increasing our reservation contribution to our franchisees; and improving the quality and awareness of our brands. 
One very important initiative to support these goals last year was our multi-brand umbrella marketing campaign. The campaign ultimately drove over 1.8 billion impressions. Bookings in our central channels increased 10%, and enrollments in our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program grew 52%. This is great progress toward our goal of establishing the best-in-class loyalty program in our primary economy and mid-scale market segments, which we expect will significantly drive reservation contribution to our franchisees. Stay tuned for some exciting developments with our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program this year.
Of course, maintaining category-leading brands begins with the quality of the hotels in our system, which is a significant area of concentration for us. In 2014, terminations for properties below our system standards accounted for nearly 90% of the total properties terminated from our domestic system, helping to ensure that guest experience with our brands isn't tainted by a small fraction of hotels that fail to meet our standards. 
Following the recession, the vast majority of the properties were terminated from our system due to monetary defaults. As termination for quality defaults are now leading the way, we are also focused on adding properties that will improve the overall quality of the system. As a result, properties added to the system in 2014 had an average TripAdvisor rating that was 24 basis points higher than our system average. In addition, new construction openings were up 11% last year, and new construction hotels are immediately accretive to brand quality.
You may remember from the earlier call that we were working on a process of launching new prototypes for many of our brands. We have plenty of opportunity to put these new prototypes into development, ensuring high quality for our guests and strong financial returns for our franchisees. Prototype redesigns and a compelling brand portfolio have helped us achieve a 17% increase in our new construction pipeline over the past 3 years. And we continue to add to the breadth and depth of our portfolio with our recent acquisition of Dolce Hotels and Resorts. Dolce's hotels and conference centers enhance our portfolio with a significantly larger presence in the group and meeting segment as well as the upper upscale and lifestyle segments. Its 4,000 employees worldwide will add depth in experience and expertise to our already well-established hotel management team. 
The managed business is a great growth platform opportunity for us. We've taken that business from just 24 properties 3 years ago to 84 properties today. Our managed portfolio across the globe achieved 2014 RevPAR growth of over 10% or 16% in North America, a testament to the strength of our brands and our effective hotel management capabilities.
Now let's move to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, which grew adjusted EBITDA in 2014 in our targeted range and improved their margins. They consistently do a great job of managing in difficult operating environments through innovation and tight expense management. As you know, Wyndham Exchange & Rentals is the world's largest vacation exchange network with 3.8 million members and is the world's largest professional manager of Vacation Rental properties with 103,000 properties. 
We match a portfolio of unique, nontraditional lodging accommodations through trusted well-established brands with the demand of leisure travelers, many of whom have vacationed with us for -- with our brands for generations. Our scale and global marketing expertise enable us to enhance demand and drive occupancy across our portfolio.
Last quarter, I spoke about how Exchange & Rentals -- our Exchange & Rentals business is increasingly leveraging analytics to transform the customer experience and improve yield. Today, I would like to spend a few minutes on some important initiatives to increase cross-selling amongst our brands. 
Recently, we launched inventory cross-selling between Novasol, our Denmark-based Vacation Rental business, and Cottages 4 You in Hoseason, each based in the U.K. Cottages 4 You hotel -- excuse me, Cottages 4 You holiday homes and Hoseasons boating holidays are now accessible across the Novasol websites, giving customers better visibility into approximately 15,000 private cottages and over 1,000 boating holidays in the U.K. and Ireland and making it easier to book vacations. By integrating this U.K. and Irish product into its homepage, Novasol can better serve and help its Danish and German customers who want to travel to the U.K. and Ireland while filling the demand for inventory with Cottages 4 You and Hoseasons product. Cottages 4 You and Novasol offer a similar holiday home product, making it a natural fit from a customer desirability perspective. 
This builds on the recent introduction of cross-selling of over 3,000 French units between these brands. We believe that this is the start of an exciting opportunity to maximize cross-penetration -- cross-market penetration through each of our brands in Europe and the U.S. 
Another example of sharing inventory across brands is the Wyndham Home Exchange program. This program provides our Vacation Rental property owners with the ability to deposit up to 5 weeks per property annually in exchange for comparable intervals from within RCI's portfolio of affiliated Vacation Ownership resorts. It allows exchange members the opportunity to access a wider variety of vacation properties while also providing outstanding value to the Vacation Rental property owner. Cross-selling supports our strategy to offer more choices to the customers while driving better utilization of nontraditional leisure in inventory across our many brands.
Now let's move to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had a great year, coming in at the top of their original guidance range while instituting new sales and marketing processes that will ensure our ongoing success in years to come. More immediately, we've made good progress since the third quarter in refining our marketing and sales approach as evidenced by the sequential improvement in VPG, which was close to flat in constant currency in the fourth quarter.
We further refined our approach on the Specialist Presenter model and our outreach to owner upgrades. We remain committed to ensuring that our sales process is effective and in tune with the needs and preferences of existing and potential owners. 
Previously, we focused our discussion on the sales process, but it's important to remember that a large part of this process is targeting the right consumers. We are always developing new analytical models that allow us to approach the right prospects with the right offer, including financing terms. This is a carefully orchestrated effort among the finance, sales and marketing teams. 
We've worked hard on this area over the past 5 years, dramatically improving our FICO scores and down payments. In 2014, we further refined our underwriting standards, focusing on the size of loans. While this action negatively affected our VPG and gross sales, it also drove lower-than-expected charge-offs from those sales, enabling us to achieve net sales growth of 8% for the year.
Our provision for loan loss is near a record low, and we're continuing to look for improvement. This reflects fundamental operating changes we made to the business but also supported by improving U.S. economy. And remember that a lower provision means that we are seeing lower charge-offs and higher collections, which improves cash flow.
Of course, nowhere in the -- are the changes in our timeshare business more transformative than how we source inventory. Since 2009, we've increasingly moved from capital-intensive to capital-efficient inventory sources. As a reminder, our capital-efficient inventory sources include our Wyndham Asset Affiliation and Just-in-Time models, as well as recovered inventory we received primarily through homeowners' associations and directly from our owners.
We've formalized the process on recovered inventory last year, and we are excited about the benefits we receive. As we've not only more capital-efficient, but it sees -- it is seen positively by homeowners and homeowners' associations.
Going forward, we expect to source 60% to 70% of our inventory needs through capital-efficient models. It's a significant reason why we're confident raising our free cash flow target. Capital-efficient inventory sources provide significant ROIC and cash flow benefits to us. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter results."
31063165,281808076,758512,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2015",2015-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which topped off another year of solid adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share growth. Let me review the financial performance of each o",1822,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which topped off another year of solid adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share growth. Let me review the financial performance of each of our business units and then discuss our expectations for 2015. 
In the Hotel Group, revenues were up 9%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 23% for the quarter, reflecting higher RevPAR and the favorable timing of loyalty and marketing expense, compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. Domestic RevPAR increased 8.6%, led by strength in our economy and upscale brands. Systemwide RevPAR increased 3%, reflecting both currency headwinds and higher growth in lower-RevPAR markets, specifically China. Now if we were to exclude China and bring it to constant currency, global RevPAR grew 5.9%, and international RevPAR was flat. System size increased 2.4% for the year, and the pipeline at year-end stood at approximately 960 hotels and 117,000 rooms. 
Our Exchange & Rentals segment generated solid operating results in what is traditionally its slowest quarter of the year. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues increased 6%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 14%, reflecting revenue increases and effective cost management. On the exchange side of the business, revenues were up 2% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.2%, reflecting member growth in the Americas attributable to higher retention rates and new member growth, while exchange revenue per member was flat.
For Vacation Rentals, revenues were up $15 million or 11% for the quarter in constant currency, reflecting a 7.3% increase in transaction volume and a 3.3% increase in average net price per rental, primarily driven by growth and higher yield at our Landal GreenParks business based in Holland, where we are seeing the tangible benefits of our enhanced pricing tools. We're coming off a strong year in Europe for our Vacation Rentals business. And our early booking experience indicates a continuation of this trend in 2015. Our bookings thus far are up compared to prior year. 
Let's keep in mind the nature of what we sell in our rental business in Europe, primarily domestic vacations in Europe sold to Continental European or British consumers. So our product in Continental Europe for euro currency consumers is still a great value for those domestic market consumers and now an even better value for our U.K. customers due to the relative strength of the British pound.
Consumer confidence in our major European markets has remained steady. Our customers really value their vacations and the product offerings we provide. Near the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of Canvas Holidays, a provider of European camping holidays, resulting in a $20 million noncash loss. This segment of the leisure industry in Europe had experienced significant consolidation over the past 12 months. After careful assessment, we determined that we would need to make significant capital investments to maintain a relatively small position with limited growth prospects, and therefore, we decided to exit the business.
In our Vacation Ownership business, we wrapped up another strong year with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues were up 2%, and EBITDA was flat year-over-year. Net VOI sales were flat, reflecting flat VPG in constant currency and a 2.1% decline in tour flow, offset by a lower provision for loan loss.
Similar to last quarter, tour flow decreases reflect lower upgrade tours as we transition to our new Specialist Presenter marketing program. While fewer existing owners are touring, our close rate for those owners who are touring is higher, providing promising signs for the Specialist Presenter model. Overall, VPG was still affected by the resulting mix shift to new owners. However, as Steve noted, we're pleased with the sequential progress we made on VPG in the fourth quarter.
The provision for loan loss was $60 million, down 18% from a year ago. As Steve noted, the refinements we've made to our credit standards and other operational steps have resulted in provision rates that are near all-time lows.
Turning to some companywide figures. Free cash flow for the year was $749 million or $5.90 per share, comfortably in our neighborhood target of $750 million. Inventory on the balance sheet increased approximately $140 million. Now this primarily reflects late 2014 inventory purchases and some noncash items. We repurchased 2.1 million shares for $171 million during the quarter, decreasing our weighted average diluted share count by 5% year-over-year. For the full year, we repurchased 8.6 million shares for $662 million. Including the $179 million we paid in dividends, we returned about $825 million to shareholders in 2014.
So now let's turn to our 2015 outlook and guidance. As a reminder, we'll post full guidance details to our Investor Relations website following the call. As Steve mentioned, we have adjusted our earlier guidance levels due to the significant strengthening of the dollar. Recall that we noted a $9 million foreign exchange impact, 2015 versus 2014, when we issued our guidance in October. Well, since then, the currency has impacted adjusted EBITDA by another $25 million, resulting in total year-over-year foreign exchange headwinds of $34 million.
While we are lowering EBITDA guidance for 2015, we have refined our revenue assumptions and are increasing our revenue guidance by $50 million. The new range is $5,450,000,000 to $5,550,000,000. Note the negative FX impact is being primarily offset by the acquisition of Dolce.
Our new adjusted EBITDA guidance will come down just $15 million to $1,285,000,000 to $1,315,000,000. This guidance range reflects FX rates on January 30, 2015. We may update our views as we progress into the year should the value of the dollar change meaningfully.
Let me take a brief moment to explain to you why the company is experiencing this FX translation effect. Our hedging activity for earnings translation exposure is done on a quarterly basis. So while the P&L is somewhat protected from FX fluctuations in the short term, exposure beyond a given quarter remains unprotected. In large part, our hedging practices around translation are guided by consideration of hedge accounting implications.
Hedging of noneconomic activities such as earnings translations in our business does not receive favorable accounting treatment, which could result in P&L volatility. Therefore, we hedge within a quarter to avoid the upticks of P&L volatility.
As it relates to how we see these FX movements impacting our business, our ongoing philosophy has been to evaluate the performance of our international businesses, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Our operating teams are responsible for the commercial momentum of our businesses, and we believe the best way to judge the momentum of our underlying businesses is on a local currency basis. Therefore, we will disclose our results in 2015 with and without the impact of foreign currency effects.
On a currency-neutral basis, our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2015 implies growth of 6% to 9%, which is consistent with our targeted business growth rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2015 moves to $4.75 to $4.90, reflecting share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the net effect of foreign exchange. We expect a diluted share count of approximately 123 million shares, which, per our standard guidance practice, assumes no share buybacks in 2015.
Now let's take a quick look at guidance for each of our business units, starting with the Hotel Group. We expect another strong year. We expect revenues of $1,270,000,000 to $1,320,000,000. We expect RevPAR growth of 4% to 6% and room growth of 3% to 5%. In constant currency, however, RevPAR growth will be 5% to 7%. Note that the Hotel Group revenues assume approximately $100 million of pass-through reimbursable revenues from the Dolce acquisition. Pass-through reimbursable revenues contribute no EBITDA and will result in a full year margin detriment of about 250 basis points for the Wyndham Hotel Group in 2015. Hotel Group EBITDA will be $360 million to $375 million. 
At Exchange & Rentals, while the operating results of Canvas were immaterial to our full year results, the sale of the business will impact our driver growth rates and also have a significant seasonality impact on EBITDA and EPS. In 2014, Canvas generated losses in the first, second and fourth quarters, but produced $18 million of EBITDA during the third quarter. We will mention these effects in future quarters. Reflecting January 30, 2015, FX rates in the sale of Canvas, we expect revenues of $1,500,000,000 to $1,560,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $364 million to $377 million for WER. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding the effect of the Canvas sale, growth would be 3% to 6% for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
We expect the average number of exchange members to grow 1% to 3% and exchange revenue per member to be down 1% to 3%. However, on a constant currency basis, at the midpoint, exchange revenue per member would be flat.
We expect Vacation Rental transactions to grow 2% to 4%. We expect average net price per rental to decrease 9% to 11%, primarily reflecting foreign exchange. On a currency-neutral basis, average net price per rentals would be flat. Adjusting Canvas results out of 2014 drivers, the growth rate in rental transactions and average net price per transaction would be approximately 200 basis points higher. 
For Vacation Ownership, we expect revenues of 2.66 -- $2,660,000,000 to $2,725,000,000 and adjusted EBITDA of $680 million to $700 million. We expect tour and VPG growth of 1% to 3%. Excluding foreign exchange effects, EBITDA growth would be 4% to 7%. 
Companywide, we expect corporate expenses of $130 million to $135 million, down from 2014 due to lower employee expenses and legal fees. We expect depreciation and amortization to be between $242 million and $245 million. We expect interest expense of $112 million to $114 million, which assumes no debt issuances in 2015.
I'm also very happy to say that our free cash flow target will move to $800 million for 2015. That equates to $6.50 per share. Remember that we manage to a neighborhood target when it comes to cash flow. But overall, we expect free cash flow to grow in 2015. We will post our cash flow representative model with our cash flow assumptions for the year to our website following the call.
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.91 to $0.94. Year-over-year, 2015 first quarter comparisons will benefit from the absence of approximately a $6.5 million loss from Canvas in 2014.
Remember that our interest expense is always a little lower the first quarter than our annual run rate due to the timing of VAT credits, and we would also remind you that we don't budget repurchases into our guidance assumptions. To close, we were very pleased with the performance of 2014 and are looking forward to another terrific year in 2015. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

We had a strong quarter to cap off a great year across our businesses. We have outstanding people collaborating in a culture of performance and continuous improvement. Our commitment to value-creating capital allocation is unwavering, all of which positions Wyndham very well to continue to deliver for our shareholders.
The positive momentum of our business is allowing us to increase our free cash flow target and also increase our dividend by 20%. In addition, despite FX pressure, which is impacting our EBITDA guidance by just over 1%, we are raising our EPS guidance for 2015. And while we're very proud of what we've accomplished so far, we remain firmly focused on achieving success in the future by continuing to execute across our businesses, generating significant free cash flow and deploying our shareholders' capital to drive superior value.
With that, Wendy, we can open the line for questions."

We expect EBITDA growth, I think, foreign exchange-impacted EBITDA growth of around 5% or so. There are a couple of things. As it relates to product investment, we ended up investing a little more in inventory in 2014, and so we don't expect any incremental spend on inventory in 2015, so that's a neutral factor. On the cash tax side, we've actually identified some opportunities that were taking what was a headwind in the past and adding that as a positive to our overall free cash flow contribution.

It's -- we've got great businesses with fantastic talented associates, and everybody's proven to be very adaptable and resilient. So we've gone through some periods of downturn where other companies have seen more pain, and we haven't seen as much in part because of the resilient nature of the way the business is built. So in any particular cycle, it could look like a great idea or not a good idea and have all the businesses together. But we feel really good about the collection of businesses that we have. Having said that, as we've said continually since we listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we understand our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders, and we will look at all options and all opportunities. We've looked at all options and all opportunities, and we have now what we feel is the proper collection of businesses. But we continue to look at that, and that's not foretelling of anything. It's just foretelling of the fact that we're also always mindful of looking at what our options are out there. So we really think there is great connectivity with our businesses. We are continually looking at how we can cross-fertilize and cross-market the businesses, and we really feel like we have a terrific collection of very resilient and very strong leading businesses in each one of their sectors."

I'll take the questions, and Tom will weigh in as he sees fit. On the VPG question, which I do understand there were a lot of questions in the third quarter, if you look at the history of our VPG, it has not been straight line. It has been a little bumpy, a little volatile. And that's the nature of this sales and marketing business like this. We set long-term goals, and we achieve those goals, and that's what we've done continually. But it doesn't mean for 1 quarter, we may not be up or down. As Franz, who you mentioned runs that business, said the other day, we start the year, we run a marathon. Our splits may not be exactly what we want them to be, but we know that we can sprint a little harder and reach the goal at the end of the day. And that is part of the art of how he runs that business, and they do a phenomenal job of running the business down there in Orlando. Specifically what they did was they -- as we talked about in the last call, they had a pretty good idea of what was impacting the VPG downturn. They adjusted for that. Some of the things they did was they changed the kind of timing and rhythm of our tours for our in-house guests. So people staying at the resort, coming in to take a tour, we were a little bit too rigid and structured about when those tours are going to be. So we moved back to a little more flexible model but still using our Specialist Presenter program, the new way of positioning the product. That had a very big impact on the success rate of generating those in-house tours. And as you know, VPG on in-house tours are higher than the frontline tours. So just that mix can have a bit of a change to it. And that's really -- I mean, there's no more really to the secret sauce than that. That is what we did. We looked at basically our marketing methodology, and we adjusted it, and we'll continue to adjust it. And again, I'll say this, we've said it in the past, don't expect VPG to be straight line every quarter. We work to maximize our profitability in the business. As we commented, our gross VOI was kind of flattish and down a little bit in the third and fourth quarter. But our net VOI, when you take into account who we're selling to and what our loss profile is, was actually growing by 8%. So there's give and takes in that business. It's one of the wonderful flexibilities to that business, and I don't know that there's any group that manages it better than our group down in Orlando. As for Dolce, thank you for the compliment of finding that deal. M&A is kind of part of our DNA here, and we have a terrific M&A group. It's not huge, but it's a great group that are constantly turning over rocks and looking for deals. We've looked at Dolce for a while. We were doing other things and had our focus in other areas, but once we turned our laser focus to it, we were able to complete that deal relatively quickly, and we think it'll be a great addition to our hotel portfolio. As I said, not only adding more group and meeting business capability to us from an inventory standpoint, but also from the sales standpoint, they have a great reputation in the meetings business for group meetings. And now we can apply that same group salespeople to also driving more business to our Wyndham and other meeting and banquet hotels. So we feel like this is a terrific opportunity for us, a great fit. It's a New Jersey-based company, so it's kind of easy. We hope to keep a lot of those key players involved, and so we're very much looking forward to the integration of that business."

Now could it be because people aren't planning their international trips? That could be an interesting thought. But I -- my intuition would tell me it's probably not having that large of an impact.

So I think in the past, we've talked about the number getting south of $1 billion, maybe $800 million or $900 million at its optimal. But that -- we wouldn't see it going much beyond that because, again, of the components that are sort of fixed components. And I'll remind you that one of the components is the expected return of inventory that we get from our loan loss provision. And so I think that's worth about $250 million in and of itself. So we think that it will get, if we're running the business optimally, a couple of notches below $1 billion, and that's where we would settle."

There's -- Dolce is a great brand with a great product. It's a global brand. There's quite a few properties in Europe as well as what we have in the U.S., but it has been a brand that has been somewhat starved for growth just because of the capital structure that the business was living in before. And we feel like we have the opportunity to kind of bring our capabilities to bear, including using capital to help grow the business more quickly, as we do in all of our upscale managed property environment with our development advanced notes or key money. So we have the ability to open doors that maybe weren't open before with the limitations that Dolce had. And on top of that, we have a true -- they have a terrific group sales marketing business, as I said before. That's both an advantage to us in our Wyndham properties but also advantage to the existing Dolce properties because we have ourselves a good group sales business. So we can kind of expand the group sales effort we have to deliver more for the owners of the Dolce hotels as well as for the owners of the Wyndham hotels. And so it's really a win-win on both sides. Both the teams are going to come together, and we're going to be in a position to drive a lot more value. The more value proposition we can build, the more people will sign up to become part of the Dolce system.

And those brands that we're rolling out are Baymont, Days Inn, Super 8. There were 5 of them. I'm not remembering all of them. I think Hawthorn is another one. So those will have a fresh prototype that will be available for franchisees, either new construction or conversion. So that that's -- those are brands that we would like to see grow because we think the prospects exist for quick growth. A lot of our growth is coming internationally. So when you look at our international markets, most of our brands are represented in most markets but not all. This year, we opened properties in some South American markets where we never had those brands before, and they now represent new growth prospects. So we don't go into the year saying we want to see X number of Wyndhams, X number of Howard Johnsons, X number of Super 8s. We go in with a targeted growth rate, and then the sales -- the development team then targets very, very tightly regionally what's available, what fits best into a market. So I'm not answering your question probably the way you'd like I would answer with some specific number for Knights Inn or Days Inn or Super 8. But we really don't manage the business that way.

As you saw from the release, we started the year with a strong quarter, with 32% growth in adjusted diluted EPS and a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA. All of this was accomplished despite a dollar that continued to strengthen during the quarter. Tom will walk you through our financial results in more detail. My comments will focus on a number of exciting initiatives underway across our businesses to drive growth and strengthen our competitive position. 
Let me start with Wyndham Hotel Group, which has been undergoing significant transformation and has established robust momentum. The team has a strong plan for sustainable growth and has recruited world-class talent to make it happen. We recently unveiled our plans at the Wyndham Hotel Group Global Conference, the largest gathering of hotel owners and operators in the world, with over 6,000 attendees. We shared great news and I have never seen our franchisees more excited and engaged. 
First, we continue to evolve our brands and offerings to meet the changing needs and demands of today's travelers. We announced transformational changes to our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. It bucks the recent hotel underlying trends that have made rewards programs overly complicated and frustrating. No other loyalty program makes it easier for customers to earn their stays in Wyndham rewards. Wyndham Rewards is poised to be a game changer within our industry. To introduce the new program, we are launching a new umbrella marketing campaign. The TV, digital and radio ads feature actor, Christopher [indiscernible], best known for HBO's Game of Thrones as a new character created just for Wyndham Rewards. Our launch commences with commercials beginning May 11. 
The new Wyndham Rewards and umbrella marketing campaign generated more excitement at the conference -- but much excitement at the conference, but we're making other down breaking back office changes in the business as well. Enhanced technology tools to book guests and support our franchise operators are essential components of our value proposition. 
We recently announced an important global agreement to migrate our central reservation systems to Corporation, which will make them our exclusive global CRS provider. We are already working with Sabre on a new cloud-based property management system that incorporates an easy-to-use, automated revenue management tool for our smaller hotels, which is being provided through a partnership with [indiscernible]. Once these systems are implemented, hotels within our portfolio will be able to more effectively manage their pricing and inventory, connect to wider range of global distribution partners, utilize a broad array of currency and language capabilities and have access to a fully integrated customer profile that is tied into our Wyndham Rewards program. This creates a strong competitive advantage for our economy in mid-scale brands. 
Our new model of partnering with world-class providers such as Sabre will keep us at the leading-edge technology we need to support our business. At the same time, it will allow us to focus on what we do best, delivering great service and value to our franchisees and guests. We're only beginning to deliver on new exciting opportunities we see in our hotel business. I look forward to sharing more details and results with you throughout the coming year. 
Now let's move to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, which had a terrific quarter. We were especially pleased with Rental revenue. In constant currency, this increased 8% year-over-year. Our industry-leading brands continue to earn accolades with RCI recently winning 6 awards and Landal GreenParks winning 2 prestigious awards, which is a pinnacle of achievement of customers in the Dutch holiday market. 
We have many initiatives underway such as our yield management program. I've discussed this program on prior calls. It allows us to effectively position and price our managed rental inventory. Now we are taking the data we use for portfolio yield management even further and using it as a sales tool to recruit new properties. Historically, our field agents had to rely on their local knowledge to find the most desirable and present our value proposition to the homeowner. Estimating property pricing, occupancy, commission rates and potential owner income was a manual process requiring multiple visits with the homeowner. We are now live at our U.K. Cottage brands with a mobile, tablet-based application that enables a sales representative to easily identify and demonstrate the potential of a new property based on its unique features, location and seasonal price curve. We expect this approach to improve the effectiveness of our initial visits with property owners, resulting in increased conversion rates. 
As importantly, we expect to improve our overall property mix. We look forward to expanding the application to other rental brands within our portfolio in the future. 
Technology also continues to present great opportunities to broaden Vacation Rental distribution. By way of background, there are 2 distinct business models in the rental industry, the rent by owner model, which is self-explanatory; and the professionally managed model, where we're the largest player. Supporting both of these models are third-party distribution channels such as home away, Airbnb and online travel agencies. 
To capture this opportunity, we are expanding our third-party distribution channels. We recently signed a global agreement with Home Away, and we are in active dialogue with others. We are leveraging our global scale to benefit our brands and property owners. 
While we have great proprietary websites across our rental brands, third-party distribution often provides an effective marketing alternative. To optimize utilization, we augment our property booking channels by listing certain properties at certain times with third-party providers. The benefit is higher consumer awareness and the ability to generate additional bookings, especially beyond our primary customer markets in the peak season. 
While we're in the early stages, we're already seeing benefits and we will manage the process closely to continue to drive incremental bookings. 
Now let's move to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, where we continue to reap the benefits of the changes we have instituted over the last couple of years. Changes in our underwriting standards have led to a higher quality portfolio, which has benefited our provision for loan loss, while our innovative methods for sourcing inventory continue to reflect positively in the cost of goods sold. 
Over the past few quarters, I've talked about our commitment to evolve the business to drive improved customer engagement and future growth. I said that this would be a long-term process with some bumps along the way, but we believe this was essential to the ongoing health and growth of the business. 
In the first quarter, we experienced some of this variability as evidenced by VPG, which was lower than our expectations. While we saw strength in some markets such as Williamsburg, Ocean Side, California, and Myrtle Beach, certain key markets such as Waikiki, South Florida and Gatlinburg were weak. Much of this underperformance was linked to the evolving owner outreach relating to our Specialist Presenter model. We will continue to fine tune our approach, including a hybrid model for marketing to enhance our outreach. 
We're working to improve customer engagement and other ways as well. For example, in what I believe is the first in the timeshare industry, we are proactively enabling long-time owners to gracefully exit their ownership while allowing us to efficiently acquire inventory. We broadly call this program Ovation by Wyndham. It is how we applaud owners who have experienced years of great travel memories but whose needs and circumstances have changed. Ovation provides owners who have fulfilled their loan obligation with options that include referral to a verified seller. In certain instances, we offered to acquire their inventory. Owners who have participated thus far have been highly satisfied. We receive low-cost inventory, but more importantly, help ensure we have a highly satisfied former owner to spread the word about the benefits of Wyndham Vacation ownership. 
Finally, I want to share a glimpse into a concept that is the early trial phase. Although we already have international locations such as Australia and New Zealand, we have remained largely focused in the U.S. The U.S. will continue to be a great market for us, but there are countries with emerging economies and a strong emphasis on family and vacations that are virtually untapped. Brazil is one example, and w are launching a small trial program there over the next couple of months. We found that a notable portion of our sales in Orlando are to Brazilians. They love the product, love to travel and many are gaining wealth. This trial program is another Capital Light concept which could be our best model yet. 
I'm especially excited that it involves all of our business units. We're selling a 10- to 15-year term product using inventory that we're leasing from current or future Wyndham flag mixed-use projects and the club operations will be run by RCI. Again, it's a small trial and we won't have any visible impact on our results. But we're excited by its long-term potential. We believe there's a strong market for this product, which can be adapted for other regions across the globe, with parts of Asia being our next likely target. 
Now let me turn the call over Tom for details on the quarter results."

As Steve noted, we're off to a great start with our first quarter results with a 32% growth in adjusted diluted EPS and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Year-over-year, FX in the quarter had a top line negative imp",1243,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, we're off to a great start with our first quarter results with a 32% growth in adjusted diluted EPS and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Year-over-year, FX in the quarter had a top line negative impact of $38 million and a $10 million impact on EBITDA. We were $0.09 above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting better-than-expected operating results and the favorable timing of expenses at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, favorable depreciation and amortization timing, a VAT-related reserve reversal and the effect of share repurchases. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $197 million, down from the $269 million in the first quarter of 2014, slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. This year-over-year comparison reflects the timing of inventory purchases, which are more front weighted this year and the impact of foreign currency movement. 
I want to point out that we expect year-over-year free cash flow comparisons may be negative until the fourth quarter. While FX movements have created a $28 million headwind to our year-over-year free cash flow assumptions, we remain committed to hit our annual neighborhood target of $800 million. 
In addition, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $150 million during the quarter, contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count. 
Now let's take a look at the financial performance of each of our business units. Starting with our Hotel Group, which enjoyed a very strong quarter with revenues up 23% and adjusted EBITDA up 16% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the Dolce Hotels and Resorts acquisition, and revenues associated with our global franchisee conference, revenues were up 11% in constant currency. Both Dolce and the global conference fees, featured incremental revenues with no impact on adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA reflected higher domestic RevPAR and global room growth, along with an increase in the licensing fee rate the Hotel Group charges our timeshare business for the use of the Wyndham brand. We last suggested this rate in early 2012 shortly after the Myriad vacation ownership spinoff. A subsequent review of market-based these pricing led us to further increase to rate this past quarter. 
The impact on first quarter Hotel Group revenues and adjusted EBITDA was an increase of $3 million, with a corresponding negative EBITDA effect on our timeshare business. 
Domestic RevPAR increased 7.7%, while systemwide RevPAR increased 1.7%, reflecting both currency headwinds and higher unit growth and lower RevPAR markets especially China. Now if we're to exclude the China effect and in constant currency, global RevPAR actually, grew 5.5%. 
Our Exchange & Rentals segment generated strong operating results in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, reflecting solid year-over-year operating results. The absence of a $7 million loss in the first quarter of 2014 associated with Candace, which we sold late last year, and a $4 million reserve reversal of value-added taxes. Excluding the Candace loss and value-added tax adjustment, currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. 
On the Exchange side of the business, revenues were up 2% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.5% attributable to new member growth in the Americas, while Exchange revenue per member was relatively flat. 
For Vacation Rentals, revenues were up $14 million or 8% for the quarter in constant currency, reflecting a 7% increase in transaction volume and a 1% increase in the average net price per rental. 
Growth across all our major brands was highlighted by strength in our Denmark-based Novasol business, our Netherlands-based Landal GreenParks and our Wyndham North America business. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, adjusted EBITDA grew 13% even after the $3 million increase in licensing fees paid to our Hotel Group. EBITDA growth was primarily driven by higher net VOI sales, reflecting a lower provision for loan loss and improved cost of goods sold as we implement new inventory acquisition models. Total revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, which did include $13 million from the recognition of deferred revenue related to Margaritaville in St. Thomas. Net VOI sales were up 11% or 12% in constant currency, reflecting a lower loan loss provision, partially offset by a 3.1% decline in VPG, net of currency, and a 1.2% decline in tour flow. 
Now Steve discussed in VPG performance continues to be impacted by steps we are taking to improve the customer experience with our sales process. While VPG may vary from quarter-to-quarter, we believe these steps are necessary to enhance the business for the longer term. 
The provision for loan loss was $46 million, down 23% from a year ago. The decision to raise the FICO profile of our buyers made a number of years ago, coupled with the decision to require more cash on sale and other operational steps, have continued to result in provision rates that are at all-time lows. 
Now let's turn to some company-wide figures. In the first quarter, we completed 2 significant capital markets transactions. First, we locked in the current low interest rates and enhanced our liquidity by renewing our 5-year, $1.5 billion revolving credit line agreement to 2020, July 2020. Second, we issued our first ABS term note transaction of the year, the $350 million CRO 2015-1 transaction which had a 2.54% weighted average coupon and a 90% advance rate. 
Finally, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance $0.06 for the full year and diluted share count goes to 121.4 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our Quarter 1 repurchases. In addition, we're updating adjusted EBITDA guidance for the Hotel and Vacation Ownership businesses to reflect the previously discussed increase in rate on the intersegment licensing fee for the use of the Wyndham brand. We estimate that this will have a favorable $13 million EBITDA and revenue impact on the Hotel Group and an equal and opposite EBITDA impact on the Vacation Ownership business for the full year. That is the only change in our assumptions on the business units. We'll post updated guidance sheet to the website following the call. 
During the quarter, foreign exchange rates continue to move against us as the U.S. dollar further strengthened against our most relevant foreign currencies. We noted a $34 million FX headwind to full year EBITDA guidance on our February 10 call. Based on exchange rates as of March 31, which is the basis for our current guidance, we now have a year-over-year EBITDA FX headwind of $42 million. 
As a reminder, we said in October that we would be at the midpoint of our guidance range based on currency headwinds. We are not inclined to change guidance at this time, but we will continue to closely track the effect of currency movements. And as always, we will keep you appropriately updated. 
For the second quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.24 to $1.27. We expect the tax rate in the second quarter of approximately 35.5%. But our annual guidance rate range remains unchanged at 36.75%. Remember that we don't assume share repurchases in our guidance -- future share repurchases, that is. 
Year-over-year, 2015 second quarter comparisons reflect unfavorable currency movement. To close, we're pleased with our strong start and are looking forward to continued progress in the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"

Before we open the line for questions, I'd like to summarize our comments on the quarter. It was a great start to the year despite FX headwinds. The quarter was highlighted by strong domestic RevPAR growth in our Hotel Group, lower inventory cost and continued improvement in credit performance at Vacation Ownership and strong growth in our Rental business. 
Our focus continues to be to deliver strong results, generate growing free cash flow, allocate capital to drive shareholder value and innovate to build an even stronger competitive position going forward. 
Before we open the line for questions, I'd like to close with a few comments about our culture, which is the foundation that supports all we do. Last week, we were named among the top 50 companies for diversity by DiversityInc, one of the most widely respected, thought leading organizations on the diversity. This was our third consecutive year on the list and we are on the top 10 for our supplier diversity, global diversity and diversity council programs. 
We're also recently named one of the worlds most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute an named to corporate magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list. Based on our core values of integrity, respect, opportunity and supporting our community, our culture is focused on providing the best possible environment to deliver results, including the value we create for shareholders, the experience we provide our customers and the quality of the communities where we live and work. 
I believe that the culture we have created is distinctive and remains an important driver of the growth of us as a public company, and we are gratified that as a young company, we're achieving this recognition. 
With that, Richard, we can open the line for comments."

But I think it's a said in your conference last year, philosophically, because we're selling to a higher credit customer and we're selling more cash down when we make the sale, we should see improvements of our loan loss. And theoretically, we should see improvements beyond what was our higher low watermark before the downturn, where we've kind of gotten back to that point now. So, again, this is theoretical and Tom may have comments on the specific numbers, but theoretically, we should continue to see improvement there. I don't know how quickly we'll see it. I thought that we should see the improvement frankly before we've seen it now, but this takes time and loss curves need to kind of work their way through. So I understand the process that we go through with Deloitte in order to come up with it.

There are some markets that have performed better and some markets that didn't perform as well. And that's actually, in my eye, is an encouraging sign. There's not a systemic problem with the program. It's the execution on the ground of that program. And it really is in the marketing side. It's not on the sale side. It's on the marketing side. And it's on how do we encourage our customers who are visiting the resorts to come in and learn more about their ownership and see if they'd like to expand their ownership by buying more. And it's that consumer engagement that we think we probably could have done a better job with, which is why we are changing the program. We just recently, I think it was last week, we had a very large Homeowners' Conference down Orlando. And we surveyed and talked to the owners about how that they like the new Specialist Presenter marketing and sales approach, and it was overwhelmingly positive. So we're on the right track here. We just have to fine tune it and get it to be right. You have some questions about trending of VPG. I think that was also in there. You asked bunch of questions, Joe. But I think on the trending question, I would expect the second quarter to be better than the first quarter. And I would expect the second half of the year to be better than the first half of the year. More than that, I don't know that it makes sense to try to be fine point on it. The fact is the team is on it. This is a team that is extraordinarily good at execution. The slips that we've had are uncharacteristic, frankly. And some of it is are people related and some of it is just location related and how well they adopted the new marketing programs."

And most of that strength was transactional strength as opposed to pricing strength. But there was strong uptake in the first quarter. We don't do a lot of U.S. to U.K. or U.S. to Europe bookings, so that would not have a significant impact on it. I don't believe -- I've not heard our team over there say that they're seeing a larger influx of U.S. customers. I think what you're really seeing is just our -- some of our programs for yield management over there by taking effect. And we're seeing a better utilization of our weeks. We're pricing them properly. We're maintaining the same price at this point and filling more of the units. It's a whole lot different than don't tell where the more units, the more courage you have to raise prices. So that would be the next logical step in this that we'll see some price improvement. But we're not projecting. Again, that's philosophically what you'd expect to see. But yes, the fact effect is that we're seeing a lot of very good transaction activity in Europe. And for the most part, the activity is here in the country or within Europe. On the new owner side, actually, we're seeing good performance with our new owners at the sales table. Our close rate was actually up a little bit for new owners in the first quarter. And yet, we didn't see a huge influx of more tours for new owners. So we are focused on increasing the tours. That's just a function of the marketing programs that we have in place. We've just added a couple of new marketing programs that will drive new tours in. So we feel good about the new tour generation. We would expect to see some increase in new tours, an increase in new owner sales over time. That is something that we've been increasing. We're up to, I think, 31,000 estimated for this year. That's about a 4%, 5% increase over last year. We'd expect to continue to see at least that level of increase in new owners looking forward. And we might increase it depending on how well some of our marketing programs perform. Split between new and existing, I'm not sure."

We're pushing hard to continue to grow in China and we're seeing a lot of growth with Super 8. We're also adding Wyndham Hotels. We're adding a mix of hotels in China right now. That, obviously, does put some pressure on our international RevPAR growth because the Chinese market does not price as well as the European markets do or some of the other markets were large. And I think that's just the nature of the beast and that's a result of growth in that market. We're not going to deemphasize growth there.

So when we use the term sort of alternative inventory acquisition models, it really reflects 2 distinct approaches. One is, as Steve described, Ovation is where to go to our existing owners who use the product and had a lifetime of enjoyment with the product. And they're exhibiting use patterns. Let's say, they're not using reaching out to people and offering them on alternative to be able to sell their product, either through a referral, through a reseller or to us directly as sort of a graceful way to exit the product. And in certain instances, continued use the product for a period of time. And that is an area that we've been pursuing for a number of months now. I think it's still relatively new information and the effort continues in a more formal way as we speak. The other avenue that we approach is to go to homers associations to whom inventory has been defaulted. And we go to homeowners' associations and offer that we'll pay the ongoing maintenance fee and we'll also resell the inventory. And so we're able to acquire inventory for very economic cost through that channel as well. So those 2 factors are the factors that have driven the lower cost of goods trend. And I'd say we continue to expect that we'll see more of that as we go forward. So I wouldn't describe it as one time. But I would describe them as opportunistic in a sense that these are sources of inventory acquisition that haven't been fully utilized that we're now utilizing probably more formally and with more determination than we have in the past. I think we've quoted in the past that we expect 60% to 70% of our inventory -- I think it's around 60% of our inventory spending in a given year to be earmarked to what we consider to be capital efficient sources. And they would be the 2 sources that I just described to you, Ovation, direct to owner or direct to homeowners association. And then our asset affiliation model, which we are in full swing of implementing. So I think that's the best we can do at quantifying our commitment to this type of inventory acquisition. But I think everyone should expect to see us continue to do that well into the future. And if I could, Chris, I just wanted to respond to the question that came up earlier about the amount of inventory spend in the first quarter. The number was around $60 million."

As you saw from the release, we started the year with a strong quarter, with 32% growth in adjusted diluted EPS and a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA. All of this was accomplished despite a dollar that continued to strengthen during the quarter. Tom will walk you through our financial results in more detail. My comments will focus on a number of important and exciting initiatives underway across our businesses to drive growth and strengthen our competitive position. 
Let me start with Wyndham Hotel Group, which has been undergoing significant transformation, and has established robust momentum. The team has a strong plan for sustainable growth, and has recruited world-class talent to make it happen. We recently unveiled our plans at the Wyndham Hotel Group Global Conference, the largest gathering of hotel owners and operators in the world, with over 6,000 attendees. We shared great news, and I have never seen our franchisees more excited and engaged. 
First, we continue to evolve our brands and offerings to meet the changing needs and demands of today's travelers. We announced transformational changes to our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. It bucks the recent hotel and airline trends that have made rewards programs overly complicated and frustrating. No other loyalty program makes it easier and faster for customers to earn their stays in Wyndham rewards. Wyndham Rewards is poised to be a game changer within our industry. To introduce the new program, we are launching a new umbrella marketing campaign. The TV, digital and radio ads feature actor, Kristofer Hivju, best known for HBO's Game of Thrones, as the new character created just for Wyndham Rewards. Our launch commences with commercials, beginning May 11. The new Wyndham Rewards and umbrella marketing campaign generated more excitement at the conference -- much excitement at the conference, but we're making other groundbreaking back office changes in the business as well. Enhanced technology tools to book guests and support our franchise operators are essential components of our value proposition. 
We recently announced an important global agreement to migrate our central reservation systems to Sabre Corporation, which will make them our exclusive global CRS provider. We are already working with Sabre on a new cloud-based property management system that incorporates an easy-to-us, automated revenue management Tool for our smaller hotels, which is being provided through a partnership with Infor. Once these systems are implemented, hotels within our portfolio will be able to more effectively manage their pricing and inventory, connect to wider range of global distribution partners, utilize a broad array of currency and language capabilities and have access to a fully integrated customer profile that is tied into our Wyndham Rewards program. This creates a strong competitive advantage for our economy and mid-scale brands. Our new model of partnering with world-class providers, such as Sabre, will keep us at the leading edge of the technology we need to support our business. At the same time, it will allow us to focus on what we do best, delivering great service and value to our franchisees and guests. We're only beginning to deliver on new exciting opportunities we see in our hotel business. I look forward to sharing more details and results with you throughout the coming year. 
Now let's move to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, which had a terrific quarter. We were especially pleased with rental revenue. In constant currency, this increased 8% year-over-year. Our industry-leading brands continue to earn accolades, with RCI recently winning 6 ARDA awards, and Landal GreenParks winning 2 prestigious Zoover Awards, which is the pinnacle of achievement from customers in the Dutch holiday market.
We have many initiatives underway such as our yield management program. I've discussed this program on prior calls. It allows us to effectively position and price our managed rental inventory. Now we are taking the data we use for portfolio yield management even further, and using it as a sales tool to recruit new properties. Historically, our field agents had to rely on their local knowledge to find the most desirable properties and present our value proposition to the homeowner. Estimating property pricing, occupancy, commission rates and potential owner income was a manual process, requiring multiple visits with the homeowner. We are now live at our U.K. Cottage brands with the mobile, tablet-based application that enables our sales representative to easily identify and demonstrate the potential of a new property based on its unique features, location and seasonal price curve. We expect this approach to improve the effectiveness of our initial visits with property owners, resulting in increased conversion rates. 
As importantly, we expect to improve our overall property mix. We look forward to expanding the application to other rental brands within our portfolio in the future. Technology also continues to present great opportunities to broaden Vacation Rental distribution. By way of background, there are 2 distinct business models in the rental industry, the rent by owner model, which is self-explanatory; and the professionally managed model, where we're the largest player. Supporting both of these models are third-party distribution channels, such as HomeAway, Airbnb and online travel agencies. To capture this opportunity, we are expanding our third-party distribution channels. We recently signed a global agreement with HomeAway, and we are in active dialogue with others. We are leveraging our global scale to benefit our brands and property owners. 
While we have great proprietary websites across our rental brands, third-party distribution often provides an effective marketing alternative. To optimize utilization, we augment our property booking channels by listing certain properties at certain times with third-party providers. The benefit is higher consumer awareness and the ability to generate additional bookings, especially beyond our primary customer markets in the peak season. While we're in the early stages, we're already seeing benefits, and we will manage the process closely to continue to drive incremental bookings. 
Now let's move to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, where we continue to reap the benefits of the changes we have instituted over the last couple of years. Changes in our underwriting standards have led to a higher quality portfolio, which has benefited our provision for loan loss, while our innovative methods for sourcing inventory continue to reflect positively in the cost of goods sold. Over the past few quarters, I've talked about our commitment to evolve the business to drive improved customer engagement and future growth. I said that this would be a long-term process with some bumps along the way, but we believe this was essential to the ongoing health and growth of the business. 
In the first quarter, we experienced some of this variability as evidenced by VPG, lower than our expectations. While we saw strength in some markets such as Williamsburg, Oceanside, California, and Myrtle Beach, certain key markets, such as Waikiki, South Florida and Gatlinburg were weak. Much of this underperformance was linked to the evolving owner outreach related to our Specialist Presenter model. We will continue to fine-tune our approach, including a hybrid model for marketing to enhance our outreach. 
We're working to improve customer engagement and other ways as well. For example, in what I believe is the first in the timeshare industry, we are proactively enabling long-time owners to gracefully exit their ownership, while allowing us to efficiently acquire inventory. We broadly call this program Ovation by Wyndham. It is how we applaud owners who have experienced years of great travel memories, but whose needs and circumstances have changed. Ovation provides owners who have fulfilled their loan obligation with options that include referral to a verified seller. In certain instances, we'll offer to acquire their inventory. Owners who have participated, thus far, have been highly satisfied. We receive low-cost inventory, but more importantly, help ensure we have a highly satisfied former owner to spread the word about the benefits of Wyndham Vacation ownership. 
Finally, I want to share a glimpse into a concept that is the early trial phase. Although we already have international locations, such as Australia and New Zealand, we have remained largely focused in the U.S. The U.S. will continue to be a great market for us, but there are countries with emerging economies and a strong emphasis on family and vacations that are virtually untapped. Brazil is one example, and we're launching a small trial program there over the next couple of months. We found that a notable portion of our sales in Orlando are to Brazilians. They love the product, love to travel and many are gaining wealth. This trial program is another capital light concept, which could be our best model yet. I'm especially excited that it involves all of our business units. We're selling a 10- to 15-year term product, using inventory that we're leasing from current or future Wyndham flag mixed-use projects, and the club operations will be run by RCI. Again, it's a small trial, and we won't have any visible impact on our results, but we're excited by its long-term potential. We believe there's a strong market for this product, which can be adapted for other regions across the globe, with parts of Asia being our next likely target. 
Now let me turn the call over Tom for details on the quarter results."

As Steve noted, we're off to a great start with our first quarter results with 32% growth in adjusted diluted EPS and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Year-over-year, FX in the quarter had a top line negative impac",1241,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, we're off to a great start with our first quarter results with 32% growth in adjusted diluted EPS and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Year-over-year, FX in the quarter had a top line negative impact of $38 million and a $10 million impact on EBITDA. We were $0.09 above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting better-than-expected operating results and the favorable timing of expenses at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, favorable depreciation and amortization timing, a VAT-related reserve reversal and the effect of share repurchases. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $197 million, down from the $269 million in the first quarter of 2014, slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. This year-over-year comparison reflects the timing of inventory purchases, which are more front-weighted this year and the impact of foreign currency movement. I want to point out that we expect year-over-year free cash flow comparisons may be negative until the fourth quarter. While FX movements have created a $28 million headwind to our year-over-year free cash flow assumptions, we remain committed to hit our annual neighborhood target of $800 million. In addition, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $150 million during the quarter, contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count. 
Now let's take a look at the financial performance of each of our business units, starting with our Hotel Group, which enjoyed a very strong quarter with revenues up 23% and adjusted EBITDA up 16% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the Dolce Hotels and Resorts acquisition, and revenues associated with our global franchisee conference, revenues were up 11% in constant currency. Both Dolce and the global conference fees featured incremental revenues, with no impact on adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA reflected higher domestic RevPAR and global room growth, along with an increase in the licensing fee rate the Hotel Group charges our timeshare business for the use of the Wyndham brand. We last suggested this rate in early 2012 shortly after the myriad vacation ownership spinoff. A subsequent review of market-based pricing led us to further increase the rate this past quarter. The impact on first quarter Hotel Group revenues and adjusted EBITDA was an increase of $3 million, with a corresponding negative EBITDA effect on our timeshare business. 
Domestic RevPAR increased 7.7%, while systemwide RevPAR increased 1.7%, reflecting both currency headwinds and higher unit growth in lower RevPAR markets, especially China. Now if we're to exclude the China effect and in constant currency, global RevPAR actually grew 5.5%. Our Exchange & Rentals segment generated strong operating results in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, reflecting solid year-over-year operating results, the absence of a $7 million loss in the first quarter of 2014 associated with Canvas, which we sold late last year, and a $4 million reserve reversal of value-added taxes. Excluding the Canvas loss and value-added tax adjustment, currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. 
On the Exchange side of the business, revenues were up 2% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.5% attributable to new member growth in the Americas, while Exchange revenue per member was relatively flat. For Vacation Rentals, revenues were up $14 million or 8% for the quarter in constant currency, reflecting a 7% increase in transaction volume and a 1% increase in the average net price per rental. Growth across all our major brands was highlighted by strength in our Denmark-based Novasol business, our Netherlands-based Landal GreenParks business and our Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America business. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, adjusted EBITDA grew 13% even after the $3 million increase in licensing fees paid to our Hotel Group. EBITDA growth was primarily driven by higher net VOI sales, reflecting a lower provision for loan loss, and improved cost of goods sold as we implement new inventory acquisition models. Total revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, which did include $13 million from the recognition of deferred revenue related to Margaritaville in St. Thomas. Net VOI sales were up 11% or 12% in constant currency, reflecting a lower loan loss provision, partially offset by a 3.1% decline in VPG, net of currency, and a 1.2% decline in tour flow. 
Now Steve discussed VPG performance continues to be impacted by steps we are taking to improve the customer experience with our sales process. While VPG may vary from quarter-to-quarter, we believe these steps are necessary to enhance the business for the longer term. The provision for loan loss was $46 million, down 23% from a year ago. The decision to raise the FICO profile of our buyers made a number of years ago, coupled with the decision to require more cash on sale and other operational steps, have continued to result in provision rates that are at all-time lows. 
Now let's turn to some company-wide figures. In the first quarter, we completed 2 significant capital markets transactions. First, we locked in the current low interest rates and enhanced our liquidity by renewing our 5-year, $1.5 billion revolving credit line agreement to 2020 -- July 2020. Second, we issued our first ABS term note transaction of the year, the $350 million Sierra 2015-1 transaction, which had a 2.54% weighted average coupon and a 90% advance rate. 
Finally, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance $0.06 for the full year, and diluted share count goes to 121.4 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our quarter 1 repurchases. In addition, we're updating adjusted EBITDA guidance for the Hotel and Vacation Ownership businesses to reflect the previously discussed increase in rate on the intersegment licensing fee for the use of the Wyndham brand. We estimate that this will have a favorable $13 million EBITDA and revenue impact on the Hotel Group, and an equal and opposite EBITDA impact on the Vacation Ownership business for the full year. That is the only change in our assumptions on the business units. We'll post updated guidance sheet to the website following the call. 
During the quarter, foreign exchange rates continue to move against us, as the U.S. dollar further strengthened against our most relevant foreign currencies. We noted a $34 million FX headwind to full year EBITDA guidance on our February 10 call. Based on exchange rates as of March 31, which is the basis for our current guidance, we now have a year-over-year EBITDA FX headwind of $42 million. As a reminder, we said in October that we would be at the midpoint of our guidance range based on currency headwinds. We are not inclined to change guidance at this time, but we will continue to closely track the effect of currency movements, and as always, we will keep you appropriately updated. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.24 to $1.27. We expect the tax rate in the second quarter of approximately 35.5%, but our annual guidance rate remains unchanged at 36.75%. Remember that we don't assume share repurchases in our guidance, future share repurchases, that is. 
Year-over-year, 2015 second quarter comparisons reflect unfavorable currency movement. To close, we're pleased with our strong start, and are looking forward to continued progress in the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"

Before we open the line for questions, I'd like to summarize our comments on the quarter. It was a great start to the year despite FX headwinds. The quarter was highlighted by strong domestic RevPAR growth in our Hotel Group, lower inventory cost, and continued improvement in credit performance at Vacation Ownership, and strong growth in our Rental business. Our focus continues to be to deliver strong results, generate growing free cash flow, allocate capital to drive shareholder value, and innovate to build an even stronger competitive position going forward. 
Before we open the line for questions, I'd like to close with a few comments about our culture, which is the foundation that supports all we do. Last week, we were named among the top 50 companies for diversity by DiversityInc, one of the most widely respected, thought leading organizations on diversity. This was our third consecutive year on the list, and we are on the top 10 for our supplier diversity, global diversity and diversity council programs. 
We were also recently named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute, and named to Corporate Responsibility Magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizen’s List. Based on our core values of integrity, respect, opportunity and supporting our community, our culture is focused on providing the best possible environment to deliver results, including the value we create for shareholders, the experience we provide our customers, and the quality of the communities where we live and work. I believe the culture we have created is distinctive, and remains an important driver of the growth of us as a public company, and we are gratified that as a young company, we are achieving this recognition. 
With that, Richard, we can open the line for comments."

We're -- we've kind of gotten back to that point now. So again, this is theoretical, and Tom may have comments on the specific numbers, but theoretically, we should continue to see improvement there. I don't know how quickly we'll see it. I thought that we should see the improvement frankly before we've seen it now, but this takes time and the loss curves need to kind of work their way through. So I understand the process that we go through with Deloitte in order to come up with it.

There are some markets that have performed better and some markets that didn't perform as well, and that's actually, in my eye, is an encouraging sign. There's not a systemic problem with the program. It's the execution on the ground of that program, and it really is in the marketing side. It's not on the sale side. It's on the marketing side, and it's on how do we encourage the -- our customers who are visiting the resorts to come in and learn more about their ownership and see if they'd like to expand their ownership by buying more, and it's that consumer engagement that we think we probably could have done a better job with, which is why we are changing the program. We just recently, I think, it was last week, we had a very large Homeowners' Conference down in Orlando, and we were -- we surveyed and talked to the owners about how do they like the new -- the Specialist Presenter marketing and sales approach, and it was overwhelmingly positive. So we're on the right track here. We just have to fine-tune it and get it to be right. You have some questions about trending of VPG. I think that was also in there. You ask a bunch of questions, Joe. But I think on the trending question, I would expect the second quarter to be better than the first quarter. And I would expect the second half of the year to be better than the first half of the year. More than that, I don't know that it makes sense to try to be -- put such as fine point on it. The fact is the team is on it. This is a team that is extraordinarily good at execution. The slips that we've had are uncharacteristic, frankly, and some of it is people-related and some of it is just location related and how well they adopted the new marketing programs."

For the Rental businesses, you're right, we did see strength, and most of that strength was transactional strength as opposed to pricing strength, but there was strong uptake in the first quarter. We don't do a lot of U.S. to U.K. or U.S. to Europe bookings, so that would not have a significant impact on it. I don't believe -- I've not heard our team over there say that they're seeing a larger influx of U.S. customers. I think what you're really seeing is just our -- some of our programs for yield management over there are taking effect, and we're seeing a better utilization of our weeks. We're pricing them properly. We're maintaining the same price at this point, and filling more of the units. It's not a whole lot different than a hotel, where the more units that are filled, the more courage you have to raise prices. So that would be the next logical step in this, is that we'll see some price improvement, but we're not projecting that. We're just saying that, that -- again, that's philosophically what you'd expect to see. But yes, the fact effect is we are seeing a lot of very good transaction activity in Europe. And for the most part, the activity is either in country or within Europe. On the new owner side, actually, we're seeing good performance with our new owners in the -- at the sales table. Our close rate was actually up a little bit for new owners in the first quarter, and yet, we didn't see a huge influx of more tours for new owners. So we are focused on increasing the tours. That's just a function of the marketing programs that we have in place. We've just added a couple of new marketing programs that will drive new tours in. So we feel good about the new tour generation. We would expect to see some increase in new tours, an increase in new owner sales over time. That is something that we've been increasing. We're up to, I think, 31,000 estimated for this year. Now that's about a 4%, 5% increase over last year. We'd expect to continue to see, at least, that level of increase in new owners looking forward, and we might increase it depending on how well some of our marketing programs perform.

We're pushing hard to continue to grow in China, and we're seeing a lot of growth with Super 8. We're also adding Wyndham Hotels. We're adding a mix of hotels in China right now. That, obviously, does put some pressure on our international RevPAR growth because the Chinese market does not price as well as the European markets do or some of the other markets were large, and I think that's just the nature of the beast and that's a result of growth in that market. We're not going to deemphasize growth there.

So when we use the term sort of alternative inventory acquisition models, it really reflects 2 distinct approaches. One is, as Steve described, Ovation is where we go to our existing owners who use the product and had a lifetime of enjoyment with the product, and they're exhibiting use patterns. Let's say, they're not it with as much frequency, we're reaching out to people and offering them an alternative to be able to sell their product either through a referral, through a reseller or to us directly as sort of a graceful way to exit the product, and in certain instances, continue to use the product for a period of time, and that is an area that we've been pursuing for a number of months now. I think it's still relatively new information, and the effort continues in a more formal way as we speak. The other avenue that we approach is to go to homeowner's associations to whom inventory has been defaulted, and we go to homeowner's associations, and offer that we'll pay the ongoing maintenance fee and we'll also resell the inventory, and so we're able to acquire inventory for very economic cost through that channel as well. So those 2 factors are the factors that have driven the lower cost of goods trend, and I'd say we continue to expect that we'll see more of that as we go forward. So I wouldn't describe them as one time, but I would describe them as opportunistic in a sense that these are sources of inventory acquisition that haven't been fully utilized that we're now utilizing probably more formally and with more determination than we have in the past. I think we've quoted in the past that we expect 60% to 70% of our inventory -- I think it's around 60% of our inventory spending in a given year to be earmarked to what we consider to be capital efficient sources. And they would be the 2 sources that I just described to you, Ovation, direct to owner or direct to homeowners association, and then our asset affiliation model, which we are in full swing of implementing. So I think that's the best we can do at quantifying our commitment to this type of inventory acquisition, but I think everyone should expect to see us continue to do that well into the future. And if I could, Chris, I just want to respond to the question that came up earlier about the amount of inventory spend in the first quarter. The number was around $60 million."

As you saw from the release, we started the year with a strong quarter, with 32% growth in adjusted diluted EPS and a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA. All of this was accomplished despite a dollar that continued to strengthen during the quarter. Tom will walk you through our financial results in more detail. My comments will focus on a number of important and exciting initiatives underway across our businesses to drive growth and strengthen our competitive position. 
Let me start with Wyndham Hotel Group, which has been undergoing significant transformation, and has established robust momentum. The team has a strong plan for sustainable growth, and has recruited world-class talent to make it happen. We recently unveiled our plans at the Wyndham Hotel Group Global Conference, the largest gathering of hotel owners and operators in the world, with over 6,000 attendees. We shared great news, and I have never seen our franchisees more excited and engaged. 
First, we continue to evolve our brands and offerings to meet the changing needs and demands of today's travelers. We announced transformational changes to our Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. It bucks the recent hotel and airline trends that have made rewards programs overly complicated and frustrating. No other loyalty program makes it easier and faster for customers to earn their stays than Wyndham rewards. Wyndham Rewards is poised to be a game changer within our industry. To introduce the new program, we are launching a new umbrella marketing campaign. The TV, digital and radio ads feature actor, Kristofer Hivju, best known for HBO's Game of Thrones, as the new character created just for Wyndham Rewards. Our launch commences with commercials, beginning May 11. The new Wyndham Rewards and umbrella marketing campaign generated more excitement at the conference -- much excitement at the conference, but we're making other groundbreaking back office changes in the business as well. Enhanced technology tools to book guests and support our franchise operators are essential components of our value proposition. 
We recently announced an important global agreement to migrate our central reservation systems to Sabre Corporation, which will make them our exclusive global CRS provider. We are already working with Sabre on a new cloud-based property management system that incorporates an easy-to-use, automated revenue management Tool for our smaller hotels, which is being provided through a partnership with Infor. Once these systems are implemented, hotels within our portfolio will be able to more effectively manage their pricing and inventory, connect to wider range of global distribution partners, utilize a broad array of currency and language capabilities and have access to a fully integrated customer profile that is tied into our Wyndham Rewards program. This creates a strong competitive advantage for our economy and mid-scale brands. Our new model of partnering with world-class providers, such as Sabre, will keep us at the leading edge of the technology we need to support our business. At the same time, it will allow us to focus on what we do best, delivering great service and value to our franchisees and guests. We're only beginning to deliver on new exciting opportunities we see in our hotel business. I look forward to sharing more details and results with you throughout the coming year. 
Now let's move to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, which had a terrific quarter. We were especially pleased with rental revenue. In constant currency, this increased 8% year-over-year. Our industry-leading brands continue to earn accolades, with RCI recently winning 6 ARDA awards, and Landal GreenParks winning 2 prestigious Zoover Awards, which is the pinnacle of achievement from customers in the Dutch holiday market.
We have many initiatives underway such as our yield management program. I've discussed this program on prior calls. It allows us to effectively position and price our managed rental inventory. Now we are taking the data we use for portfolio yield management even further, and using it as a sales tool to recruit new properties. Historically, our field agents had to rely on their local knowledge to find the most desirable properties and present our value proposition to the homeowner. Estimating property pricing, occupancy, commission rates and potential owner income was a manual process, requiring multiple visits with the homeowner. We are now live at our U.K. Cottage brands with the mobile, tablet-based application that enables our sales representative to easily identify and demonstrate the potential of a new property based on its unique features, location and seasonal price curve. We expect this approach to improve the effectiveness of our initial visits with property owners, resulting in increased conversion rates. 
As importantly, we expect to improve our overall property mix. We look forward to expanding the application to other rental brands within our portfolio in the future. Technology also continues to present great opportunities to broaden Vacation Rental distribution. By way of background, there are 2 distinct business models in the rental industry, the rent by owner model, which is self-explanatory; and the professionally managed model, where we're the largest player. Supporting both of these models are third-party distribution channels, such as HomeAway, Airbnb and online travel agencies. To capture this opportunity, we are expanding our third-party distribution channels. We recently signed a global agreement with HomeAway, and we are in active dialogue with others. We are leveraging our global scale to benefit our brands and property owners. 
While we have great proprietary websites across our rental brands, third-party distribution often provides an effective marketing alternative. To optimize utilization, we augment our property booking channels by listing certain properties at certain times with third-party providers. The benefit is higher consumer awareness and the ability to generate additional bookings, especially beyond our primary customer markets in the peak season. While we're in the early stages, we're already seeing benefits, and we will manage the process closely to continue to drive incremental bookings. 
Now let's move to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, where we continue to reap the benefits of the changes we have instituted over the last couple of years. Changes in our underwriting standards have led to a higher quality portfolio, which has benefited our provision for loan loss, while our innovative methods for sourcing inventory continue to reflect positively in the cost of goods sold. Over the past few quarters, I've talked about our commitment to evolve the business to drive improved customer engagement and future growth. I said that this would be a long-term process with some bumps along the way, but we believe this was essential to the ongoing health and growth of the business. 
In the first quarter, we experienced some of this variability as evidenced by VPG, which was lower than our expectations. While we saw strength in some markets such as Williamsburg, Oceanside, California, and Myrtle Beach, certain key markets, such as Waikiki, South Florida and Gatlinburg were weak. Much of this underperformance was linked to the evolving owner outreach related to our Specialist Presenter model. We will continue to fine-tune our approach, including a hybrid model for marketing to enhance our outreach. 
We're working to improve customer engagement and other ways as well. For example, in what I believe is the first in the timeshare industry, we are proactively enabling long-time owners to gracefully exit their ownership, while allowing us to efficiently acquire inventory. We broadly call this program Ovation by Wyndham. It is how we applaud owners who have experienced years of great travel memories, but whose needs and circumstances have changed. Ovation provides owners who have fulfilled their loan obligation with options that include referral to a verified seller. In certain instances, we'll offer to acquire their inventory. Owners who have participated, thus far, have been highly satisfied. We receive low-cost inventory, but more importantly, help ensure we have a highly satisfied former owner to spread the word about the benefits of Wyndham Vacation ownership. 
Finally, I want to share a glimpse into a concept that is the early trial phase. Although we already have international locations, such as Australia and New Zealand, we have remained largely focused in the U.S. The U.S. will continue to be a great market for us, but there are countries with emerging economies and a strong emphasis on family and vacations that are virtually untapped. Brazil is one example, and we're launching a small trial program there over the next couple of months. We found that a notable portion of our sales in Orlando are to Brazilians. They love the product, love to travel and many are gaining wealth. This trial program is another capital light concept, which could be our best model yet. I'm especially excited that it involves all of our business units. We're selling a 10- to 15-year term product, using inventory that we're leasing from current or future Wyndham flag mixed-use projects, and the club operations will be run by RCI. Again, it's a small trial, and we won't have any visible impact on our results, but we're excited by its long-term potential. We believe there's a strong market for this product, which can be adapted for other regions across the globe, with parts of Asia being our next likely target. 
Now let me turn the call over Tom for details on the quarter results."

As Steve noted, we're off to a great start with our first quarter results with 32% growth in adjusted diluted EPS and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Year-over-year, FX in the quarter had a top line negative impac",1241,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve noted, we're off to a great start with our first quarter results with 32% growth in adjusted diluted EPS and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Year-over-year, FX in the quarter had a top line negative impact of $38 million and a $10 million impact on EBITDA. We were $0.09 above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting better-than-expected operating results and the favorable timing of expenses at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, favorable depreciation and amortization timing, a VAT-related reserve reversal and the effect of share repurchases. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $197 million, down from the $269 million in the first quarter of 2014, slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. This year-over-year comparison reflects the timing of inventory purchases, which are more front-weighted this year than the impact of foreign currency movement. I want to point out that we expect year-over-year free cash flow comparisons may be negative until the fourth quarter. While FX movements have created a $28 million headwind to our year-over-year free cash flow assumptions, we remain committed to hit our annual neighborhood target of $800 million. In addition, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $150 million during the quarter, contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count. 
Now let's take a look at the financial performance of each of our business units, starting with our Hotel Group, which enjoyed a very strong quarter with revenues up 23% and adjusted EBITDA up 16% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the Dolce Hotels and Resorts acquisition, and revenues associated with our global franchisee conference, revenues were up 11% in constant currency. Both Dolce and the global conference fees featured incremental revenues, with no impact on adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA reflected higher domestic RevPAR and global room growth, along with an increase in the licensing fee rate the Hotel Group charges our timeshare business for the use of the Wyndham brand. We last adjusted this rate in early 2012 shortly after the Marriott vacation ownership spinoff. A subsequent review of market-based pricing led us to further increase the rate this past quarter. The impact on first quarter Hotel Group revenues and adjusted EBITDA was an increase of $3 million, with a corresponding negative EBITDA effect on our timeshare business. 
Domestic RevPAR increased 7.7%, while systemwide RevPAR increased 1.7%, reflecting both currency headwinds and higher unit growth in lower RevPAR markets, especially China. Now if we're to exclude the China effect and in constant currency, global RevPAR actually grew 5.5%. Our Exchange & Rentals segment generated strong operating results in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 17%, reflecting solid year-over-year operating results, the absence of a $7 million loss in the first quarter of 2014 associated with Canvas, which we sold late last year, and a $4 million reserve reversal of value-added taxes. Excluding the Canvas loss and value-added tax adjustment, currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. 
On the Exchange side of the business, revenues were up 2% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.5% attributable to new member growth in the Americas, while Exchange revenue per member was relatively flat. For Vacation Rentals, revenues were up $14 million or 8% for the quarter in constant currency, reflecting a 7% increase in transaction volume and a 1% increase in the average net price per rental. Growth across all our major brands was highlighted by strength in our Denmark-based Novasol business, our Netherlands-based Landal GreenParks business and our Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America business. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, adjusted EBITDA grew 13% even after the $3 million increase in licensing fees paid to our Hotel Group. EBITDA growth was primarily driven by higher net VOI sales, reflecting a lower provision for loan loss, and improved cost of goods sold as we implement new inventory acquisition models. Total revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, which did include $13 million from the recognition of deferred revenue related to Margaritaville in St. Thomas. Net VOI sales were up 11% or 12% in constant currency, reflecting a lower loan loss provision, partially offset by a 3.1% decline in VPG, net of currency, and a 1.2% decline in tour flow. 
Now Steve discussed VPG performance continues to be impacted by steps we are taking to improve the customer experience with our sales process. While VPG may vary from quarter-to-quarter, we believe these steps are necessary to enhance the business for the longer term. The provision for loan loss was $46 million, down 23% from a year ago. The decision to raise the FICO profile of our buyers made a number of years ago, coupled with the decision to require more cash on sale and other operational steps, have continued to result in provision rates that are at all-time lows. 
Now let's turn to some company-wide figures. In the first quarter, we completed 2 significant capital markets transactions. First, we locked in the current low interest rates and enhanced our liquidity by renewing our 5-year, $1.5 billion revolving credit line agreement to 2020 -- July 2020. Second, we issued our first ABS term note transaction of the year, the $350 million Sierra 2015-1 transaction, which had a 2.54% weighted average coupon and a 90% advance rate. 
Finally, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance $0.06 for the full year, and diluted share count goes to 121.4 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our quarter 1 repurchases. In addition, we're updating adjusted EBITDA guidance for the Hotel and Vacation Ownership businesses to reflect the previously discussed increase in rate on the intersegment licensing fee for the use of the Wyndham brand. We estimate that this will have a favorable $13 million EBITDA and revenue impact on the Hotel Group, and an equal and opposite EBITDA impact on the Vacation Ownership business for the full year. That is the only change in our assumptions on the business units. We'll post updated guidance sheet to the website following the call. 
During the quarter, foreign exchange rates continue to move against us, as the U.S. dollar further strengthened against our most relevant foreign currencies. We noted a $34 million FX headwind to full year EBITDA guidance on our February 10 call. Based on exchange rates as of March 31, which is the basis for our current guidance, we now have a year-over-year EBITDA FX headwind of $42 million. As a reminder, we said in October that we would be at the midpoint of our guidance range based on currency headwinds. We are not inclined to change guidance at this time, but we will continue to closely track the effect of currency movements, and as always, we will keep you appropriately updated. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.24 to $1.27. We expect the tax rate in the second quarter of approximately 35.5%, but our annual guidance rate remains unchanged at 36.75%. Remember that we don't assume share repurchases in our guidance, future share repurchases, that is. 
Year-over-year, 2015 second quarter comparisons reflect unfavorable currency movement. To close, we're pleased with our strong start, and are looking forward to continued progress in the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve?"

Before we open the line for questions, I'd like to summarize our comments on the quarter. It was a great start to the year despite FX headwinds. The quarter was highlighted by strong domestic RevPAR growth in our Hotel Group, lower inventory cost, and continued improvement in credit performance at Vacation Ownership, and strong growth in our Rental business.

We're -- we've kind of gotten back to that point now. So again, this is theoretical, and Tom may have comments on the specific numbers, but theoretically, we should continue to see improvement there. I don't know how quickly we'll see it. I thought that we should see the improvement frankly before we've seen it now, but this takes time and the loss curves need to kind of work their way through. So I understand the process that we go through with Deloitte in order to come up with it.

There are some markets that have performed better and some markets that didn't perform as well, and that's actually, in my eye, is an encouraging sign. There's not a systemic problem with the program. It's the execution on the ground of that program, and it really is in the marketing side. It's not on the sale side. It's on the marketing side, and it's on how do we encourage the -- our customers who are visiting the resorts to come in and learn more about their ownership and see if they'd like to expand their ownership by buying more, and it's that consumer engagement that we think we probably could have done a better job with, which is why we are changing the program. We just recently, I think, it was last week, we had a very large Homeowners' Conference down in Orlando, and we were -- we surveyed and talked to the owners about how do they like the new -- the Specialist Presenter marketing and sales approach, and it was overwhelmingly positive. So we're on the right track here. We just have to fine-tune it and get it to be right. You have some questions about trending of VPG. I think that was also in there. You ask a bunch of questions, Joe. But I think on the trending question, I would expect the second quarter to be better than the first quarter. And I would expect the second half of the year to be better than the first half of the year. More than that, I don't know that it makes sense to try to be -- put such as fine point on it. The fact is the team is on it. This is a team that is extraordinarily good at execution. The slips that we've had are uncharacteristic, frankly, and some of it is people-related and some of it is just location related and how well they adopted the new marketing programs."

For the Rental businesses, you're right, we did see strength, and most of that strength was transactional strength as opposed to pricing strength, but there was strong uptake in the first quarter. We don't do a lot of U.S. to U.K. or U.S. to Europe bookings, so that would not have a significant impact on it. I don't believe -- I've not heard our team over there say that they're seeing a larger influx of U.S. customers. I think what you're really seeing is just our -- some of our programs for yield management over there are taking effect, and we're seeing a better utilization of our weeks. We're pricing them properly. We're maintaining the same price at this point, and filling more of the units. It's not a whole lot different than a hotel, where the more units that are filled, the more courage you have to raise prices. So that would be the next logical step in this, is that we'll see some price improvement, but we're not projecting that. We're just saying that, that -- again, that's philosophically what you'd expect to see. But yes, the fact is we are seeing a lot of very good transaction activity in Europe. And for the most part, the activity is either in our country or within Europe. On the new owner side, actually, we're seeing good performance with our new owners in the -- at the sales table. Our close rate was actually up a little bit for new owners in the first quarter, and yet, we didn't see a huge influx of more tours for new owners. So we are focused on increasing the tours. That's just a function of the marketing programs that we have in place. We've just added a couple of new marketing programs that will drive new tours in. So we feel good about the new tour generation. We would expect to see some increase in new tours, an increase in new owner sales over time. That is something that we've been increasing. We're up to, I think, 31,000 estimated for this year. Now that's about a 4%, 5% increase over last year. We'd expect to continue to see, at least, that level of increase in new owners looking forward, and we might increase it depending on how well some of our marketing programs perform.

We're pushing hard to continue to grow in China, and we're seeing a lot of growth with Super 8. We're also adding Wyndham Hotels. We're adding a mix of hotels in China right now. That, obviously, does put some pressure on our international RevPAR growth because the Chinese market does not price as well as the European markets do or some of the other markets where we're large, and I think that's just the nature of the beast and that's a result of growth in that market. We're not going to deemphasize growth there.

So when we use the term sort of alternative inventory acquisition models, it really reflects 2 distinct approaches. One is, as Steve described, Ovation is where we go to our existing owners who use the product and had a lifetime of enjoyment with the product, and they're exhibiting use patterns. Let's say, they're not it with as much frequency, we're reaching out to people and offering them an alternative to be able to sell their product either through a referral, through a reseller or to us directly as sort of a graceful way to exit the product, and in certain instances, continue to use the product for a period of time, and that is an area that we've been pursuing for a number of months now. I think it's still relatively new information, and the effort continues in a more formal way as we speak. The other avenue that we approach is to go to homeowner's associations to whom inventory has been defaulted, and we go to homeowner's associations, and offer that we'll pay the ongoing maintenance fee and we'll also resell the inventory, and so we're able to acquire inventory for very economic cost through that channel as well. So those 2 factors are the factors that have driven the lower cost of goods trend, and I'd say we continue to expect that we'll see more of that as we go forward. So I wouldn't describe them as one time, but I would describe them as opportunistic in a sense that these are sources of inventory acquisition that haven't been fully utilized that we're now utilizing probably more formally and with more determination than we have in the past. I think we've quoted in the past that we expect 60% to 70% of our inventory -- I think it's around 60% of our inventory spending in a given year to be earmarked to what we consider to be capital efficient sources. And they would be the 2 sources that I just described to you, Ovation, direct to owner or direct to homeowners association, and then our asset affiliation model, which we are in full swing of implementing. So I think that's the best we can do at quantifying our commitment to this type of inventory acquisition, but I think everyone should expect to see us continue to do that well into the future. And if I could, Chris, I just want to respond to the question that came up earlier about the amount of inventory spend in the first quarter. The number was around $60 million."

Good morning and welcome to our second quarter call. We had another strong quarter with currency neutral adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 17%, reflecting sustained operating momentum in each of our businesses and continued benefit from share repurchases. 
Our Hotel Group achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter. In our Exchange & Rentals business, we are seeing continued strong growth in rental transaction volume, which is building for the summer. In a Vacation Ownership, we grew gross VOI by 3% in constant currency. 
Finally as you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance based on the progress of our business, which is neutralizing continued FX headwinds and share buybacks to support future EPS growth. 
I'll spend a few minutes discussing our operations, then I'll turn the call over to Tom for the financial details on the quarter. Let me highlight a few initiatives from our annual strategic planning process that will contribute to our momentum and help us continue to enhance value in the future. 
Beginning with the Hotel Group. In addition to the technology and marketing initiatives we discussed last quarter, our strategic plan is strongly focused on our brand standards. These efforts have led to growth in our new construction pipeline. Specifically, we have seen strong growth in our Wingate by Wyndham brand, which is recently ranked as the highest in guest satisfaction with the midscale segment by J.D. Power, right up alongside our Microtel brand, which retained its leadership position in the economy/budget segment.
On the technology front as we discussed last quarter, we are moving away from building in-house systems. Instead, we are partnering with best-in-class providers to help ensure our franchisees around the world are utilizing the most technologically advanced systems now and into the future. We are progressing on our plans to migrate over 4,500 of our North American franchisees on to Sabre's cloud-based property management system.
As part of the property management migration, our economy and midscale franchisees will also enjoy the benefit of an integrated revenue management system developed and installed by industry leader in for. This easy-to-use tool is designed for owners who may have limited revenue management capabilities that allows these owners to efficiently and effectively analyze booking information, trends and patterns specific to each hotel on a daily basis. The owner will receive recommendations that can be used to optimize rates based on demand. 
This level of insight and pricing capability will provide unprecedented value to our franchisees and boost their bottom line. 
We currently have 21 hotels piloting the property management system, which is proceeding as planned. Later this year, we will start adding up the 100 hotels per month, accelerating to about 400 hotels per month until we reach our target. We expect full implementation by late 2016. 
And on the marketing front, we are seeking to drive growth in our loyalty program. Our 2015 summer umbrella marketing campaign is off to a terrific start. It is linked to the recent relaunch of our Wyndham Rewards program, which is designed to leverage the scale of our overall system through a very simple and generous earning and redeeming proposition. 
While still early in the campaign, initial results showed a 7% increase in loyalty bookings over the same period last year. Award redemptions are up approximately 60%, a great indicator that consumers are not only aware, but engaged more than ever with our program. 
Marketing analysts are calling Wyndham Rewards the most simple and rewarding loyalty program of its kind. We see great potential for our revised loyalty program in the future. 
Now moving to Exchange & Rentals. Vacation rentals in the sharing economy have been getting a lot of press lately, so I'd like to remind you of our value proposition and what sets us apart. Wyndham Exchange & Rentals is the largest provider of professionally managed unique vacation accommodations in the world and our mission is to send people on the vacations of their dreams. We do this by providing the right inventory to the right traveler at the right time. Our inventory spans the globe and includes virtually every non-hotel vacation option, literally from houseboats to castles to timeshare. 
In addition, we provide a wide array of value-added services, not just to guests, but also to homeowners in our B2B partners. Our strategic priorities at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals are to leverage our strength across all of our brands, including our technology and analytics expertise, the breadth of our inventory and our distribution capabilities. I spoke on our last call about enhancing our distribution channels through the use of online booking services, such as HomeAway and we have often spoken about analytics and yield management. 
Equally important to us are analytics around our customers preferences. We have been very successful at RCI in customizing member interaction to drive satisfaction and increased member retention.  Now we are leveraging these best practices within our rental brands. In doing so, we have the opportunity to drive higher inventory utilization based on large samples of consumer data. For example, we'll often work with homeowners across our rental brands on how to tailor their home to achieve maximum occupancy and yield, using our unique knowledge of the individual traveling consumer. 
We may work with homeowners on how best to remodel their property for rental. But just as important on a more modest level, we may also help them determine what amenities to offer or whether to allow pets. We are also able to work with business partners on a larger scale on product development. For example, in our host seasons Holiday Park brand in the U.K., we have launched several exclusive niche subbrands. We package and market resorts under these brands to individual travelers based on their personalized preferences. We also work with the developers on a weekly basis exchanging ideas, expertise and pricing data to drive performance. The result is an all-around win with highly satisfied developers and consumers and higher revenues for us. This is another great example of how the strength of our European rental brands combined with analytical has allowed our businesses to thrive through a choppy European travel market. 
Now turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. Our strategic plan focuses extensively on how to enhance the customer experience and create even more loyal owners. Along those lines, we are pleased with our progress on sales in the second quarter. In addition to making some management changes in key markets, we fine-tuned our sales outreach to owners with a hybrid model that allows for both the traditional and the Specialist Presenter approaches that we launched last year. These -- this resulted in growth in VOI sales and in adjusted owner tour mix, which supported higher VPG. We believe we've had the right tour balance for now between Specialist Presenter and traditional owner sales with approximately 60% of tours currently in the Specialist Presenter or group format. 
Remember that our move to Specialist Presenter is part of a comprehensive initiative to increase and enhance consumer engagement across our brand, beginning with how we sell our products to both potential new owners as well as existing owners. We are doing this now, because we want to keep our owners engaged and as importantly keep potential owners eager to engage. We want to ensure we're positioned to capturing the next generation of timeshare buyers. 
Recent surveys by ARDA have shown that the industry's youngest timeshare owners, those in the millennial and younger Gen X Demographics are highly enthused about the timeshare product. More importantly, the millennial generation is planning on taking significantly greater number of vacations and traveling to destinations, where we have an abundance of timeshare product. To support future growth, we will open 6 new sales centers this year in great locations, such as New York City, St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Las Vegas. Many of these sales centers will be largely committed to driving new owner growth, enabling us to reach potential new timeshare owners of all generations in more locations. We see tremendous upside in the timeshare business. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter's profit."
31063165,304767179,840150,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2015",2015-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everybody. After getting the year off to a good start in the first quarter with strong financial performance, we sustained that momentum in the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and 17% growth in adjusted EPS on",1343,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everybody. After getting the year off to a good start in the first quarter with strong financial performance, we sustained that momentum in the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and 17% growth in adjusted EPS on a currency neutral basis. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, foreign exchange reduced revenues by $48 million and adjusted EBITDA by $12 million company-wide. We exceeded our EPS guidance reflecting better-than-expected operating results, particularly at Vacation Ownership, expense timing and share repurchases. We repurchased 1.9 million shares for $165 million during the quarter contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count.  Free cash flow for the second quarter was $428 million, flat compared with the second quarter of 2014.
Now I want to reiterate my comment from the previous call that we expect free cash flow to be lower through the first 9 months of the year versus 2014, reflecting the timing of inventory purchases and adverse foreign currency comparisons. While FX movements are currently projected to create a $25 million headwind to our year-over-year free cash flow assumptions, we remain committed to our annual neighborhood target of $800 million.
Now let's take a look at the financial performance of each of our business units starting with our Hotel Group. We achieved another strong quarter with revenues up 18% and adjusted EBITDA up 11% year-over-year. On a currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of the $4 million benefit from the increase in licensing fee rate, the Hotel Group charges our timeshare business and the Dolce Hotels and Resorts acquisition, revenues were up 6%, adjusted EBITDA up 9% and margins were up approximately 100 basis points. Results primarily reflected higher royalties and franchise fees. Now recall that we adjusted the Wyndham brand licensing rate last quarter based on an updated review of market-based pricing.
Domestic RevPAR continued to perform well increasing 5% on a same-store basis. Strong overall performance particularly in the Pacific and South Atlantic regions, where our franchisees have been able to put through rate increases, was somewhat offset by weaker occupancy performance of our hotels in oil-producing regions. A particular bright spot was the performance of our managed property business. Same-store managed North America RevPAR increased double-digit compared with the same period last year.
While our managed portfolio is relatively small, this performance highlights our improved capabilities in this important growth area. Systemwide RevPAR was flat largely due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange and the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China. Excluding the China effect and in constant currency, global RevPAR grew almost 4%. Our exchange in Rental segment continue to perform well. On a currency neutral basis, revenues increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up 6%. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2014 included a $3 million loss associated with Canvas Holiday, which we sold in 2014. On a currency neutral basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions and the Canvas divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 3%, reflecting tighter cost management in our RCI brand and growth in Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America.
On the exchange side of the business, revenues were flat in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.2% attributable to new member growth in the Americas. Exchange revenue per member declined 2.7% as a large portion of member growth was from large timeshare clubs, whose members generate lower revenue. Vacation rentals revenue for the quarter were up $17 million or 8% in constant currency, and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divesture. This increase reflects a 6.1% increase in volume -- transaction volume and a 1.7% increase in the average net price per rental. Transaction growth across all major brands was highlighted by the strength of our Denmark-based Novasol business, our U.K. cottage and parks business and our Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America business.
Results were strong in our Vacation Ownership business as well. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% and gross VOI sales increased 3%. EBITDA was flat on a currency neutral basis and includes a $4 million increase in the licensing fee rate paid to the Wyndham Hotel Group.  Now, excluding this fee increase, currency neutral EBITDA would have increased by 2% as improvements in gross VOI sales and the provision rate were partially offset by higher sales related costs.
Net VOI sales were up 9% or 11% in constant currency, reflecting a lower loan-loss provision and a 4.4% increase in VPG net of currency, partially offset by a 1% decline in tour flow. Sales and VPG benefited from a favorable product mix resulting in higher yields and from transaction side, in addition to the points that Steve mentioned earlier. The provision for loan loss was $60 million, while write-offs were also $60 million, maintaining our reserve balance on gross receivables at around 17.5%. You may also note that WAAM fee-for-service commissions declined on year-over-year basis in the second quarter. Now this is part of our continued plan to shift WAAM development to the just-in-time model, which increases total revenues and EBITDA by allowing us to finance the consumer loan receivables and benefit from the great spread that we earn on our portfolio. We expect this trend to continue consistent with our plans.
In addition, the ABS market remains robust. We just completed our second ABS term note transaction of the year on July 15. The $275 million Sierra 2015-2 transaction had a 2.56% weighted average coupon and a 90% advance rate.
So finally let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website of the the call. As you saw from the press release, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance $0.07 for the full year and diluted share count goes to 120.2 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our second quarter repurchases and a 25 basis point reduction in our full year tax rate to 36.5%. Total company as well as business unit revenues and adjusted EBITDA guidance remain all unchanged. However, we are fine tuning our driver guidance as follows: 2015 RevPAR guidance is now 2% to 4%, down from 4% to 6%. Now this reflects an approximate 200 basis point change in foreign exchange from our original guidance assumptions. At this time, we believe we'll be at the lower end of that range due largely to the loss of the Center City Hotel that was purchased by Hilton. The hotel had an outsized impact on RevPAR, but produced insignificant royalties relative to our overall system.
Remember that 100 basis point change in RevPAR in general only impacts our EBITDA by $2.5 million to $3.5 million for the full year. For WBO, we believe we'll at the lower end of the 1% to 3% tour flow range. We'll post an updated guidance schedule to the website following the call.
For the third quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.68. In Exchange & Rentals note that the now divested Canvas Holidays brand had an $18 million in EBITDA contribution in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, our Hotel Group benefited from the signing of a co-branded credit card agreement with a third-party, amounting to $4 million of additional EBITDA in quarter 3 -- 2014. We expect interest expense in the third quarter of approximate $32 million, slightly higher than our current run rate reflecting the early termination of interest rate swaps in the second quarter.
For now, our full year interest expense guidance remains unchanged, but please be aware that depending on market conditions, we may decide the issue some date later in the year. If that's the case, we'll update guidance accordingly at that time. Finally, remember that we don't assume future repurchases in our EPS guidance. In addition, year-over-year 2015 third quarter EBITDA comparisons reflect projected unfavorable currency headwind of $13 million. To close, we're pleased with our first half and are looking forward to continued progress for the remainder of the year. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

Before opening the call to questions, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our performance since that time. Our strong operating results, execution and growth have driven significant increases in EBITDA, revenues, EPS and free cash flow. Between dividend and share repurchases, we have returned $5 billion to our shareholders. To put that in perspective, our market cap at the time of our IPO was $6 billion. Our total shareholder return since listing, including dividends, is more than double that of the S&P 500, and we still have a tremendous -- we have tremendous potential ahead of us. We see great opportunities to generate growth and value across all of our businesses and we remain keenly focused on capitalizing on those opportunities. We recently completed our eighth strategic planning process since we launched as a public company and this latest was filled with more opportunity than any I have seen before. I'm proud of what we've accomplished, but more importantly I'm really excited about what lies ahead. And now, Shirley will open the line for questions."

But having said that, yes -- just to be clear, the hybrid model is a hybrid between the way we previously marketed for our in-house guests, which are our existing owners and this new Specialist Presenter model. So it really -- the doesn't -- this new Specialist Presenter model doesn't really touch the new owners as much as it does the old owners. We still do group presentations for new owners, so it's not just similar, but when we talk about specialist presenter and the marketing impact it has, we're really talking about the impact it has for our in-house customers, people staying in our resorts. That's what we were trying to solve for is a better approach to the customer, a better experience for the consumer, who already owns timeshare and is staying at our resort. And that's where we've made the changes. Relative to how many are left to do, we're basically done. We think we have at about a 60% rate of specialist presenter now for our in-house guests. We think that's about the right balance. We'll probably stay there and see how things track. We could go up, could go down a little bit, but we like what we're getting out of that model right now.

As for the consumer finance protection board, they are -- I know that they came out with something that said in October, they will be providing more guidance on consumer lending and included in that is timeshare, but we have not heard anything specifically about that. We think that everything we're doing and we believe and we're constantly looking at this from a regulatory standpoint is absolutely straight up the middle of the fairway. And -- so we don't see any impact from that, but we haven't seen -- if they're coming out with something new, it would be news to us. And we don't think -- are you also asked, do we see any other regulators coming in and creating issues. No, we don't.

In fact some of our brands like I mentioned, Microtel and Wingate are getting J. D. Powers awards for best appreciated by consumers. So I don't think we're at the point of hitting a reset like we did with Ramada frankly many years ago. We are however, very, very focused on enforcing our brand standards. We did during the downturn, we did show flexibility with our franchisees and we are not as diligent possibly or as aggressive in terminating properties that fell below standards. We gave them more time to fix the problem just out of the fact that we knew that their cash flow wasn't as strong, so it takes money to fix fiscal problems. So we were more flexible. We are much less flexible now. And I would say that we will be continued to be much less flexible going forward. We think now is the time when the industry is doing well that people should be reinvesting in their properties and we see that happening. I went down to a, what we call a franchise advisory council, which was for all of our brands recently and they were probably 150, 200 people in the room franchisees who were the franchise leaders for each one of the brand. And the thing I heard most strongly from our franchisees was make sure you keep on the quality of their fellow franchisees and so that is something that we had dedicated ourselves to and which we are reinforcing it. And so I think we can get a lift just from the sheer fact that we are going to remove some of the weaker players in the market, and that is something that we're very, very focused on. As for RevPAR compared to industry, I don't know that we're much different than the economy sector. If you're looking at the luxury or upper upscale segment, yes, we won't go down as much. We probably will go up as much as they do. So we're probably a more stable play there, but we feel that we are performing well and we track our RevPAR indexes. And as Tom said on the managed properties, we saw a great uptick -- double-digit uptick in RevPAR at the managed properties. So we're feeling pretty good about where we are and how our brands are performing. We think that the loyalty program will give a great lift to this, but it's going to take little time for that to build. So it's probably 2016 and beyond impact period."

I think that -- I wouldn't attribute anything to our RevPAR guidance to the consumer, because those 2 factors as Tom mentioned, that are impacting it are simply the FX and the fact that we lost this hotel in San Francisco. And believe it or not, it's large enough and big enough that it does have -- it does move the needle on RevPAR. That I don't think at all, obviously that doesn't move in the consumer's direction at all. The tour flow is really a reaction to how we're staffed and how many tours we want to take. One of the things our review showed during this last few months is that we may have been providing too many tours to our salespeople and that might sound counterintuitive. But if you provide too many tours then the natural reaction of the salesperson is well the next guy is going to be more likely to buy than the one I have right now, so let me move on to the next one. And that's understandable, it's a natural reaction and -- but it's not necessarily the right reaction, because if we go through the process with an individual, we should see the close rate be about what we historically have experienced. Now going to the health of the consumer while we're talking about close rate, we actually saw an improvement in the close rate in timeshare and that is something it's another metric that we track and it works its way into VPG. But that kind of gives an indication of how this consumer is feeling. And so if anything as you're going to feel stronger in the second half of the year, I don't know we felt pretty strong in the second quarter to us. Is it going to be stronger, I'm not sure. It's a great question. It's a difficult one to answer, because my crystal ball is only so good."

The one thing that I would point to is and we're not going to get granular with what July looks like as we're only 27 days into it. But in both that timeshare and the hotel world, we are seeing pretty good reaction from the consumer. So again, just trying to give you a glimpse, so now we don't have to wait 3 months, you'll only have to wait 2 months. I'm telling you July is looking like consumer is relatively strong and the same is also true in Europe with our rental businesses."

Good morning and welcome to our second quarter call. We had another strong quarter, with currency neutral adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 17%, reflecting sustained operating momentum in each of our businesses and continued benefit from share repurchases.
Our Hotel Group achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter. In our Exchange & Rentals business, we are seeing continued strong growth in rental transaction volume, which is building for the summer. In the Vacation Ownership, we grew gross VOI by 3% in constant currency.
Finally, as you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance based on the progress of our business, which is neutralizing continued FX headwinds and share buyback that support future EPS growth.
I'll spend a few minutes discussing our operations, then I'll turn the call over to Tom for the financial details on the quarter. Let me highlight a few initiatives from our annual strategic planning process that will contribute to our momentum and help us continue to enhance value in the future. 
Beginning with the Hotel Group. In addition to the technology and marketing initiatives we discussed last quarter, our strategic plan is strongly focused on our brand standard. These efforts have led to growth in our new construction pipeline. Specifically, we have seen strong growth in our Wingate by Wyndham brand, which is recently ranked as the highest in guest satisfaction within the midscale segment by J.D. Power, right up alongside our Microtel brand, which retained its leadership position in the economy/budget segment.
On the technology front, as we discussed last quarter, we're moving away from building in-house systems. Instead, we are partnering with best-in-class providers to help ensure our franchisees around the world are utilizing the most technologically advanced systems now and into the future. We are progressing on our plans to migrate over 4,500 of our North American franchisees onto Sabre's cloud-based Property Management System.
As part of the Property Management migration, our economy and midscale franchisees will also enjoy the benefit of an integrated revenue management system developed and installed by industry leader Infor. This easy-to-use tool is designed for owners who may have limited revenue management capabilities that allows these owners to efficiently and effectively analyze booking information, trends and patterns specific to each hotel on a daily basis. The owner will receive recommendations that can be used to optimize rates based on demand. This level of insight and pricing capability will provide unprecedented value to our franchisees and boost their bottom line.
We currently have 21 hotels piloting the Property Management System, which is proceeding as planned. Later this year, we'll start adding roughly 100 hotels per month, accelerating to about 400 hotels per month until we reach our target. We expect full implementation by late 2016.
And on the marketing front, we are seeking to drive growth in our loyalty program. Our 2015 summer umbrella marketing campaign is off to a terrific start. It is linked to the recent relaunch of our Wyndham Rewards program, which is designed to leverage the scale of our overall system through a very simple and generous earning and redeeming proposition. While still early in the campaign, initial results showed a 7% increase in loyalty bookings over the same period last year. Reward redemptions are up approximately 60%, a great indicator that consumers are not only aware, but engaged more than ever with our program. Marketing analysts are calling Wyndham Rewards the most simple and rewarding loyalty program of its kind. We see great potential for our revised loyalty program in the future.
Now moving to Exchange & Rentals. Vacation rentals and the sharing economy have been getting a lot of press lately, so I'd like to remind you of our value proposition and what sets us apart. Wyndham Exchange & Rentals is the largest provider of professionally-managed, unique vacation accommodations in the world, and our mission is to send people on the vacations of their dream. We do this by providing the right inventory to the right traveler at the right time. Our inventory spans the globe and includes virtually every non-hotel vacation option, literally from houseboats to castles to timeshare.
In addition, we provide a wide array of value added services, not just to guests, but also to homeowners in our B2B partners. Our strategic priorities at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals are to leverage our strength across all of our brands, including our technology and analytics expertise, the breadth of our inventory and our distribution capabilities. I spoke on our last call about enhancing our distribution channels through the use of online booking services such as HomeAway, and we have often spoken about analytics and yield management. Equally important to us are analytics around our customers' preferences. We have been very successful at RCI in customizing member interaction to drive satisfaction and increase member retention. 
Now we are leveraging these best practices within our rental brands. In doing so, we have the opportunity to drive higher inventory utilization based on large samples of consumer data. For example, we'll often work with homeowners across our rental brands on how to tailor their home to achieve maximum occupancy and yield, using our unique knowledge of the individual traveling consumer. We may work with homeowners on how best to remodel their property for rental. But just as important, on a more modest level, we may also help them determine what amenities to offer or whether to allow pets. 
We are also able to work with business partners on a larger scale on product development. For example, in our Hoseasons Holiday Park brand in the U.K., we have launched several exclusive niche sub-brands. We package and market resorts under these brands to individual travelers based on their personalized preferences. We also work with the developers on a weekly basis exchanging ideas, expertise and pricing data to drive performance. The result is an all-around win, with highly satisfied developers and consumers and higher revenues for us. This is another great example of how the strength of our European rental brand, combined with analytic, has allowed our businesses to thrive through a choppy European travel market.
Now turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. Our strategic plan focuses extensively on how to enhance the customer experience and create even more loyal owners. Along those lines, we are pleased with our progress on sales in the second quarter. In addition to making some management changes in key markets, we fine-tuned our sales outreach to owners with a hybrid model that allows for both the traditional and the Specialist Presenter approaches that we launched last year. These -- this resulted in growth in VOI sales in an adjusted owner tour mix, which supported higher VPG. We believe we've hit the right tour balance for now between Specialist Presenter and traditional owner sales, with approximately 60% of tours currently in the Specialist Presenter or group format.
Remember that our move to Specialist Presenter is part of a comprehensive initiative to increase and enhance consumer engagement across our brand, beginning with how we sell our products to both potential new owners as well as existing owners. We are doing this now because we want to keep our owners engaged and, as importantly, keep potential owners eager to engage. We want to ensure our -- we are positioned to capture the next generation of timeshare buyers.
Recent surveys by ARDA have shown that the industry's youngest timeshare owners, those in the millennial and younger Gen X demographics, are highly enthused about the timeshare product. More importantly, the millennial generation is planning on taking significantly greater number of vacations and traveling to destinations where we have an abundance of timeshare product. 
To support future growth, we will open 6 new sales centers this year in great locations such as New York City, St. Thomas in Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Las Vegas. Many of these sales centers will be largely committed to driving new owner growth, enabling us to reach potential new timeshare owners of all generations in more locations. We see tremendous upside in the timeshare business.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter's profit."
31063165,304767179,840366,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2015",2015-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everybody. After getting the year off to a good start in the first quarter with strong financial performance, we sustained that momentum in the second quarter, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and 17% growth in adjusted EPS o",1350,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everybody. After getting the year off to a good start in the first quarter with strong financial performance, we sustained that momentum in the second quarter, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and 17% growth in adjusted EPS on a currency neutral basis. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, foreign exchange reduced revenues by $48 million and adjusted EBITDA by $12 million company-wide. 
We exceeded our EPS guidance reflecting better than expected operating results, particularly at Vacation Ownership, expense timing and share repurchases. We repurchased 1.9 million shares for $165 million during the quarter, contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count. 
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $428 million, flat compared with the second quarter of 2014. Now I want to reiterate my comment from the previous call that we expect free cash flow to be lower through the first 9 months of the year versus 2014, reflecting the timing of inventory purchases and adverse foreign currency comparisons. While FX movements are currently projected to create a $25 million headwind to our year-over-year free cash flow assumptions, we remain committed to our annual neighborhood target of $800 million.
Now let's take a look at the financial performance of each of our business units starting with our Hotel Group. We achieved another strong quarter with revenues up 18% and adjusted EBITDA up 11% year-over-year. On a currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of the $4 million benefit from the increase in licensing fee rate the Hotel Group charges our timeshare business and the Dolce Hotels and Resorts acquisition, revenues were up 6%, adjusted EBITDA up 9% and margins were up approximately 100 basis points. Results primarily reflected higher royalties and franchise fees. Now recall that we adjusted the Wyndham brand licensing rate last quarter based on an updated review of market-based pricing.
Domestic RevPAR continued to perform well, increasing 5% on a same-store basis. Strong overall performance, particularly in the Pacific and South Atlantic regions where our franchisees have been able to put through rate increases, was somewhat offset by weaker occupancy performance of our hotels in oil-producing regions. A particular bright spot was the performance of our managed property business. Same-store managed North America RevPAR increased double-digit compared with the same period last year. While our managed portfolio is relatively small, this performance highlights our improved capabilities in this important growth area. 
Systemwide RevPAR was flat largely due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange and the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China. Excluding the China effect and in constant currency, global RevPAR grew almost 4%. 
Our Exchange & Rentals segment continue to perform well. On a currency neutral basis, revenues increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up 6%. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2014 included a $3 million loss associated with Canvas Holiday, which we sold in 2014. On a currency neutral basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions and the Canvas divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 3%, reflecting tighter cost management in our RCI brand and growth in Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America.
On the Exchange side of the business, revenues were flat in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.2% attributable to new member growth in the Americas. Exchange revenue per member declined 2.7% as a large portion of member growth was from large timeshare clubs whose members generate lower revenue. 
Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up $17 million or 8% in constant currency, and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divesture. This increase reflects a 6.1% increase in volume -- transaction volume and a 1.7% increase in the average net price per rental. 
Transaction growth across all major brands was highlighted by the strength of our Denmark-based Novasol business, our U.K. Cottage and Parks business and our Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America business.
Results were strong in our Vacation Ownership business as well. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% and gross VOI sales increased 3%. EBITDA was flat on a currency neutral basis and includes a $4 million increase in the licensing fee rate paid to the Wyndham Hotel Group. Now excluding this fee increase, currency neutral EBITDA would have increased by 2% as improvements in gross VOI sales and the provision rate were partially offset by higher sales-related costs.
Net VOI sales were up 9% or 11% in constant currency, reflecting a lower loan loss provision, and a 4.4% increase in VPG net of currency partially offset by a 1% decline in tour flow. Sales and VPG benefited from a favorable product mix resulting in higher yields and from transactions side, in addition to the points that Steve mentioned earlier. The provision for loan loss was $60 million while write-offs were also $60 million, maintaining our reserved balance on gross receivables at around 17.5%. 
You may also note that WAAM fee-for-service commissions declined on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. Now this is part of our continued plan to shift WAAM development to the just-in-time model, which increases total revenues and EBITDA by allowing us to finance the consumer loan receivable and benefit from the great spread that we earn on our portfolio. We expect this trend to continue consistent with our plans.
In addition, the ABS market remains robust. We just completed our second ABS term note transaction of the year on July 15. The $275 million Sierra 2015-2 transaction had a 2.56% weighted average coupon and a 90% advance rate.
So finally, let's turn to guidance which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance $0.07 for the full year and diluted share count goes to 120.2 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our second quarter repurchases and a 25 basis point reduction in our full year tax rate to 36.5%. 
Total company as well as business unit revenues and adjusted EBITDA guidance remain all unchanged. However, we are fine tuning our driver guidance as follows: 2015 RevPAR guidance is now 2% to 4%, down from 4% to 6%. Now this reflects an approximate 200 basis point change in foreign exchange from our original guidance assumptions. At this time, we believe we'll be at the lower end of that range due largely to the loss of the Center City Hotel that was purchased by Hilton. The hotel had an outsized impact on RevPAR, but produced insignificant royalties relative to our overall system. Remember that a 100 basis point change in RevPAR in general only impacts our EBITDA by $2.5 million to $3.5 million for the full year. 
For WVO, we believe we'll be at the lower end of the 1% to 3% tour flow range. We'll post an updated guidance schedule to the website following the call.
For the third quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.68. In Exchange & Rentals, note that the now divested Canvas Holidays brand had an $18 million EBITDA contribution in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, our Hotel Group benefited from the signing of a co-branded credit card agreement with a third-party, amounting to $4 million of additional EBITDA in quarter 3 -- excuse me, 2014. 
We expect interest expense in the third quarter of approximately $32 million, slightly higher than our current run rate, reflecting the early termination of the interest rate swaps in the second quarter. For now, our full year interest expense guidance remains unchanged. But please be aware that depending on market conditions, we may decide to issue some debt later in the year. If that's the case, we'll update guidance accordingly at that time. 
Finally, remember that we don't assume future repurchases in our EPS guidance. In addition, year-over-year 2015 third quarter EBITDA comparisons reflect projected unfavorable currency headwind of $13 million. 
To close, we're pleased with our first half and are looking forward to continued progress for the remainder of the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

Before opening the call to questions, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our performance since that time. 
Our strong operating results, execution and growth have driven significant increases in EBITDA, revenues, EPS and free cash flow. Between dividend and share repurchases, we have returned $5 billion to our shareholders. To put that in perspective, our market cap at the time of our IPO was $6 billion. Our total shareholder return since listing, including dividends, is more than double that of the S&P 500, and we still have a tremendous -- we have tremendous potential ahead of us. We see great opportunities to generate growth and value across all of our businesses, and we remain keenly focused on capitalizing on those opportunities. We recently completed our eighth strategic planning process since we launched as a public company, and this latest was filled with more opportunity than any I have seen before. I'm proud of what we've accomplished, but more importantly, I'm really excited about what lies ahead.

Well, first of all, VPG is a heavily talked about metric, but as we've said multiple times, it is not a consistent metric. It does move around. So we've had quarters where it's been up dramatically, down dramatically. We think, for the full year, it will pace on what we think it will be. But again, we don't -- we -- just so we're consistent, even when we have an up quarter, we don't put too much -- we don't want to put too much stock in that one particular metric without looking at everything else. 
But having said that, yes, the -- just to be clear, the hybrid model is a hybrid between the way we've previously marketed for our in-house guests, which are our existing owners, and this new Specialist Presenter model. So it really -- that doesn't -- this new Specialist Presenter model doesn't really touch the new owners as much as it does the old owners. We still do group presentations for new owners, so it's not dissimilar, but when we talk about Specialist Presenter and the marketing impact it has, we're really talking about the impact it has for our in-house customers, people staying in our resorts. That's what we were trying to solve for is a better approach to the customer, a better experience for the consumer who already owns timeshare and is staying on our resort. And that's where we've made the changes. 
Relative to how many are left to do, we're basically done. We think we're at about a 60% rate of Specialist Presenter now for our in-house guests. We think that's about the right balance. We'll probably stay there and see how things track. We could go up, could go down a little bit, but we like what we're getting out of that model right now. So we really don't have a lot more to roll out on that side."

We do expect VPG to be positive going forward, and we appreciate the lack of comfort with the movements in VPG. I just will remind everyone and, again, we have said this before, we are constantly changing our marketing programs. We're moving our sales incentives around because we have a very large global sales force that's selling timeshare that we're constantly trying to make as -- to optimize as best we can. So there will be some volatility in there, it's just the nature of the beast, and we shouldn't be surprised by that. We may not like it, but we shouldn't be surprised by it.
As for the Consumer Finance Protection Board, they are -- I know that they came out with something that said that in October, they will be providing more guidance on consumer lending and included in that is timeshare, but we have not heard anything specifically about that. We think that everything we're doing and we believe in -- we're constantly looking at this from a regulatory standpoint is absolutely straight up the middle of the fairway. And so we don't see any impact from that. But we haven't seen -- if they're coming out with something new, it would be news to us. 
And we don't see -- and you also asked, do we see any other regulatory -- regulators coming in and creating issues. No, we don't. We're happy and pleased to see some of the prosecution effort against people who are bad players in the timeshare industry. We used to talk about the cease and desist issue that we had. The guy who was leading that cease and desist effort was recently found guilty and was sentenced. His sentencing was, I think, 20 -- 25 years. So that is a big time deterrent, we believe, to people who want to play badly in our industry."

In fact, some of our brands like I mentioned Microtel and Wingate are getting J.D. Powers awards for best appreciated by consumers. So I don't think we are in -- at the point of hitting a reset like we did with Ramada frankly many years ago. 
We are, however, very, very focused on enforcing our brand standards. We did -- during the downturn, we did show flexibility with our franchisees and we're not as diligent possibly or as aggressive in terminating properties that fell below standards. We gave them more time to fix the problem just out of the fact that we knew that their cash flow wasn't as strong, so it takes money to fix fiscal problems. So we were more flexible. We are much less flexible now. And I would say that we will be -- continue to be much less flexible going forward. 
We think now is the time when the industry is doing well that people should be reinvesting in their properties, and we see that happening. I went down to a what we call a franchise advisory council which was for all of our brands recently and there were probably 150, 200 people in the room, franchisees who were franchise leaders for each one of the brands. And the thing I heard most strongly from our franchisees was make sure you keep on the quality of their fellow franchisees. And so that is something that we had dedicated ourselves to and which we are reinforcing. And so I think we can get a lift just from the sheer fact that we are going to remove some of the weaker players in the market, and that is something that we're very, very focused on. 
As for RevPAR compared to industry, I don't know that we're much different than the economy sector. If you're looking at the luxury or upper upscale segment, yes, we won't go down as much. We probably won't go up as much as they do, so we're probably a more stable play there. But we feel that we are performing well and we track our RevPAR indexes. And as Tom said on the managed properties, we saw a great uptick, double-digit uptick in RevPAR at the managed properties. So we're feeling pretty good about where we are and how our brands are performing. We think that the loyalty program will give a great lift to this, but it's going to take little time for that to build. So it's probably a 2016 and beyond impact period."

I think that -- I wouldn't attribute anything to our RevPAR guidance to the consumer because those 2 factors, as Tom mentioned, that are impacting it are simply the FX and the fact that we lost this hotel in San Francisco. And believe it or not, it's large enough and big enough that it does have -- it does move the needle on RevPAR. That I don't think at all. Obviously, that doesn't move in the consumer's direction at all. 
The tour flow is really a reaction to how we're staffed and how many tours we want to take. One of the things our review showed during this last few months is that we may have been providing too many tours to our sales people. And that might sound counterintuitive, but if you provide too many tours, then the natural reaction of the sales person is, well, the next guy is going to be more likely to buy than the one I have right now, so let me move on to the next one. And that's understandable, it's a natural reaction and -- but it's not necessarily the right reaction because if we go through the process with an individual, we should see the close rate be about what we historically have experienced. 
Now going to the health of the consumer, while we're talking about close rate, we actually saw an improvement in the close rate in timeshare, and that is something -- it's another metric that we track and it works its way into VPG, but that kind of gives an indication of how this consumer is feeling. And so, if anything, is he going to feel stronger in the second half of the year? I don't know. He felt pretty strong in the second quarter to us. Is he going to feel stronger? I'm not sure. It's a great question. It's a difficult one to answer because my crystal ball is only so good."

I would probably say more of them have development advances than don't, but that's kind of the standard for this -- that segment in the upper upscale, upscale level where we're doing the management of properties. 
But yes, the results that we're seeing are in part the fact that I think we're doing a good job managing. We also have flipped properties into our brands and the brands are bringing good RevPAR lift. And again, we're watching all of these versus the kind of the index versus the market in which they're competing in, which is really when you look at it, how you judge our property -- an individual property is doing. 
But does -- just going back on your question about the health of the consumer. The one thing that I would point to is -- and we're not going to get granular with what July looks like because we're only 27 days into it. But in both the timeshare and the hotel world, we're seeing pretty good reaction from the consumer. So again, just trying to give you a glimpse, so now you don't have to wait 3 months, you'll only have to wait 2 months because I'm telling you July is looking like the consumer is relatively strong and the same is also true in Europe with our Rental businesses."

Good morning and welcome to our second quarter call. We had another strong quarter, with currency neutral adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 17%, reflecting sustained operating momentum in each of our businesses and continued benefit from share repurchases.
Our Hotel Group achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter. In our Exchange & Rentals business, we are seeing continued strong growth in rental transaction volume, which is building for the summer. In the Vacation Ownership, we grew gross VOI by 3% in constant currency.
Finally, as you saw from the press release, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance based on the progress of our business, which is neutralizing continued FX headwinds and share buyback that support future EPS growth.
I'll spend a few minutes discussing our operations, then I'll turn the call over to Tom for the financial details on the quarter. Let me highlight a few initiatives from our annual strategic planning process that will contribute to our momentum and help us continue to enhance value in the future. 
Beginning with the Hotel Group. In addition to the technology and marketing initiatives we discussed last quarter, our strategic plan is strongly focused on our brand standard. These efforts have led to growth in our new construction pipeline. Specifically, we have seen strong growth in our Wingate by Wyndham brand, which is recently ranked as the highest in guest satisfaction within the midscale segment by J.D. Power, right up alongside our Microtel brand, which retained its leadership position in the economy/budget segment.
On the technology front, as we discussed last quarter, we're moving away from building in-house systems. Instead, we are partnering with best-in-class providers to help ensure our franchisees around the world are utilizing the most technologically advanced systems now and into the future. We are progressing on our plans to migrate over 4,500 of our North American franchisees onto Sabre's cloud-based Property Management System.
As part of the Property Management migration, our economy and midscale franchisees will also enjoy the benefit of an integrated revenue management system developed and installed by industry leader Infor. This easy-to-use tool is designed for owners who may have limited revenue management capabilities that allows these owners to efficiently and effectively analyze booking information, trends and patterns specific to each hotel on a daily basis. The owner will receive recommendations that can be used to optimize rates based on demand. This level of insight and pricing capability will provide unprecedented value to our franchisees and boost their bottom line.
We currently have 21 hotels piloting the Property Management System, which is proceeding as planned. Later this year, we'll start adding roughly 100 hotels per month, accelerating to about 400 hotels per month until we reach our target. We expect full implementation by late 2016.
And on the marketing front, we are seeking to drive growth in our loyalty program. Our 2015 summer umbrella marketing campaign is off to a terrific start. It is linked to the recent relaunch of our Wyndham Rewards program, which is designed to leverage the scale of our overall system through a very simple and generous earning and redeeming proposition. While still early in the campaign, initial results show a 7% increase in loyalty bookings over the same period last year. Reward redemptions are up approximately 60%, a great indicator that consumers are not only aware, but engaged more than ever with our program. Marketing analysts are calling Wyndham Rewards the most simple and rewarding loyalty program of its kind. We see great potential for our revised loyalty program in the future.
Now moving to Exchange & Rentals. Vacation rentals and the sharing economy have been getting a lot of press lately, so I'd like to remind you of our value proposition and what sets us apart. Wyndham Exchange & Rentals is the largest provider of professionally-managed, unique vacation accommodations in the world, and our mission is to send people on the vacations of their dream. We do this by providing the right inventory to the right traveler at the right time. Our inventory spans the globe and includes virtually every non-hotel vacation option, literally from houseboats to castles to timeshare.
In addition, we provide a wide array of value added services, not just to guests, but also to homeowners in our B2B partners. Our strategic priorities at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals are to leverage our strength across all of our brands, including our technology and analytics expertise, the breadth of our inventory and our distribution capabilities. I spoke on our last call about enhancing our distribution channels through the use of online booking services such as HomeAway, and we have often spoken about analytics and yield management. Equally important to us are analytics around our customers' preferences. We have been very successful at RCI in customizing member interaction to drive satisfaction and increase member retention. 
Now we are leveraging these best practices within our rental brands. In doing so, we have the opportunity to drive higher inventory utilization based on large samples of consumer data. For example, we'll often work with homeowners across our rental brands on how to tailor their home to achieve maximum occupancy and yield, using our unique knowledge of the individual traveling consumer. We may work with homeowners on how best to remodel their property for rental. But just as important, on a more modest level, we may also help them determine what amenities to offer or whether to allow pets. 
We are also able to work with business partners on a larger scale on product development. For example, in our Hoseasons Holiday Park brand in the U.K., we have launched several exclusive niche sub-brands. We package and market resorts under these brands to individual travelers based on their personalized preferences. We also work with the developers on a weekly basis exchanging ideas, expertise and pricing data to drive performance. The result is an all-around win, with highly satisfied developers and consumers and higher revenues for us. This is another great example of how the strength of our European rental brand, combined with analytic, has allowed our businesses to thrive through a choppy European travel market.
Now turning to Wyndham Vacation Ownership. Our strategic plan focuses extensively on how to enhance the customer experience and create even more loyal owners. Along those lines, we are pleased with our progress on sales in the second quarter. In addition to making some management changes in key markets, we fine-tuned our sales outreach to owners with a hybrid model that allows for both the traditional and the Specialist Presenter approaches that we launched last year. These -- this resulted in growth in VOI sales in an adjusted owner tour mix, which supported higher VPG. We believe we've hit the right tour balance for now between Specialist Presenter and traditional owner sales, with approximately 60% of tours currently in the Specialist Presenter or group format.
Remember that our move to Specialist Presenter is part of a comprehensive initiative to increase and enhance consumer engagement across our brand, beginning with how we sell our products to both potential new owners as well as existing owners. We are doing this now because we want to keep our owners engaged and, as importantly, keep potential owners eager to engage. We want to ensure our -- we are positioned to capture the next generation of timeshare buyers.
Recent surveys by ARDA have shown that the industry's youngest timeshare owners, those in the millennial and younger Gen X demographics, are highly enthused about the timeshare product. More importantly, the millennial generation is planning on taking significantly greater number of vacations and traveling to destinations where we have an abundance of timeshare product. 
To support future growth, we will open 6 new sales centers this year in great locations such as New York City, St. Thomas in Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Las Vegas. Many of these sales centers will be largely committed to driving new owner growth, enabling us to reach potential new timeshare owners of all generations in more locations. We see tremendous upside in the timeshare business.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for details on the quarter's profit."
31063165,304767179,840632,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2015",2015-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everybody. After getting the year off to a good start in the first quarter with strong financial performance, we sustained that momentum in the second quarter, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and 17% growth in adjusted EPS o",1350,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everybody. After getting the year off to a good start in the first quarter with strong financial performance, we sustained that momentum in the second quarter, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and 17% growth in adjusted EPS on a currency neutral basis. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, foreign exchange reduced revenues by $48 million and adjusted EBITDA by $12 million company-wide. 
We exceeded our EPS guidance reflecting better than expected operating results, particularly at Vacation Ownership, expense timing and share repurchases. We repurchased 1.9 million shares for $165 million during the quarter, contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count. 
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $428 million, flat compared with the second quarter of 2014. Now I want to reiterate my comment from the previous call that we expect free cash flow to be lower through the first 9 months of the year versus 2014, reflecting the timing of inventory purchases and adverse foreign currency comparisons. While FX movements are currently projected to create a $25 million headwind to our year-over-year free cash flow assumptions, we remain committed to our annual neighborhood target of $800 million.
Now let's take a look at the financial performance of each of our business units starting with our Hotel Group. We achieved another strong quarter with revenues up 18% and adjusted EBITDA up 11% year-over-year. On a currency neutral basis, excluding the impact of the $4 million benefit from the increase in licensing fee rate the Hotel Group charges our timeshare business and the Dolce Hotels and Resorts acquisition, revenues were up 6%, adjusted EBITDA up 9% and margins were up approximately 100 basis points. Results primarily reflected higher royalties and franchise fees. Now recall that we adjusted the Wyndham brand licensing rate last quarter based on an updated review of market-based pricing.
Domestic RevPAR continued to perform well, increasing 5% on a same-store basis. Strong overall performance, particularly in the Pacific and South Atlantic regions where our franchisees have been able to put through rate increases, was somewhat offset by weaker occupancy performance of our hotels in oil-producing regions. A particular bright spot was the performance of our managed property business. Same-store managed North America RevPAR increased double-digit compared with the same period last year. While our managed portfolio is relatively small, this performance highlights our improved capabilities in this important growth area. 
Systemwide RevPAR was flat largely due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange and the continued unit growth of lower RevPAR hotels in China. Excluding the China effect and in constant currency, global RevPAR grew almost 4%. 
Our Exchange & Rentals segment continue to perform well. On a currency neutral basis, revenues increased 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up 6%. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2014 included a $3 million loss associated with Canvas Holiday, which we sold in 2014. On a currency neutral basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions and the Canvas divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 3%, reflecting tighter cost management in our RCI brand and growth in Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America.
On the Exchange side of the business, revenues were flat in constant currency. The average number of members increased 2.2% attributable to new member growth in the Americas. Exchange revenue per member declined 2.7% as a large portion of member growth was from large timeshare clubs whose members generate lower revenue. 
Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up $17 million or 8% in constant currency, and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divesture. This increase reflects a 6.1% increase in volume -- transaction volume and a 1.7% increase in the average net price per rental. 
Transaction growth across all major brands was highlighted by the strength of our Denmark-based Novasol business, our U.K. Cottage and Parks business and our Wyndham Vacation Rentals North America business.
Results were strong in our Vacation Ownership business as well. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% and gross VOI sales increased 3%. EBITDA was flat on a currency neutral basis and includes a $4 million increase in the licensing fee rate paid to the Wyndham Hotel Group. Now excluding this fee increase, currency neutral EBITDA would have increased by 2% as improvements in gross VOI sales and the provision rate were partially offset by higher sales-related costs.
Net VOI sales were up 9% or 11% in constant currency, reflecting a lower loan loss provision, and a 4.4% increase in VPG net of currency partially offset by a 1% decline in tour flow. Sales and VPG benefited from a favorable product mix resulting in higher yields and from transactions side, in addition to the points that Steve mentioned earlier. The provision for loan loss was $60 million while write-offs were also $60 million, maintaining our reserved balance on gross receivables at around 17.5%. 
You may also note that WAAM fee-for-service commissions declined on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. Now this is part of our continued plan to shift WAAM development to the just-in-time model, which increases total revenues and EBITDA by allowing us to finance the consumer loan receivable and benefit from the great spread that we earn on our portfolio. We expect this trend to continue consistent with our plans.
In addition, the ABS market remains robust. We just completed our second ABS term note transaction of the year on July 15. The $275 million Sierra 2015-2 transaction had a 2.56% weighted average coupon and a 90% advance rate.
So finally, let's turn to guidance which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance $0.07 for the full year and diluted share count goes to 120.2 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our second quarter repurchases and a 25 basis point reduction in our full year tax rate to 36.5%. 
Total company as well as business unit revenues and adjusted EBITDA guidance remain all unchanged. However, we are fine tuning our driver guidance as follows: 2015 RevPAR guidance is now 2% to 4%, down from 4% to 6%. Now this reflects an approximate 200 basis point change in foreign exchange from our original guidance assumptions. At this time, we believe we'll be at the lower end of that range due largely to the loss of the Center City Hotel that was purchased by Hilton. The hotel had an outsized impact on RevPAR, but produced insignificant royalties relative to our overall system. Remember that a 100 basis point change in RevPAR in general only impacts our EBITDA by $2.5 million to $3.5 million for the full year. 
For WVO, we believe we'll be at the lower end of the 1% to 3% tour flow range. We'll post an updated guidance schedule to the website following the call.
For the third quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.68. In Exchange & Rentals, note that the now divested Canvas Holidays brand had an $18 million EBITDA contribution in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, our Hotel Group benefited from the signing of a co-branded credit card agreement with a third-party, amounting to $4 million of additional EBITDA in quarter 3 -- excuse me, 2014. 
We expect interest expense in the third quarter of approximately $32 million, slightly higher than our current run rate, reflecting the early termination of the interest rate swaps in the second quarter. For now, our full year interest expense guidance remains unchanged. But please be aware that depending on market conditions, we may decide to issue some debt later in the year. If that's the case, we'll update guidance accordingly at that time. 
Finally, remember that we don't assume future repurchases in our EPS guidance. In addition, year-over-year 2015 third quarter EBITDA comparisons reflect projected unfavorable currency headwind of $13 million. 
To close, we're pleased with our first half and are looking forward to continued progress for the remainder of the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Steve. Steve?"

Before opening the call to questions, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our performance since that time. 
Our strong operating results, execution and growth have driven significant increases in EBITDA, revenues, EPS and free cash flow. Between dividend and share repurchases, we have returned $5 billion to our shareholders. To put that in perspective, our market cap at the time of our IPO was $6 billion. Our total shareholder return since listing, including dividends, is more than double that of the S&P 500, and we still have a tremendous -- we have tremendous potential ahead of us. We see great opportunities to generate growth and value across all of our businesses, and we remain keenly focused on capitalizing on those opportunities. We recently completed our eighth strategic planning process since we launched as a public company, and this latest was filled with more opportunity than any I have seen before. I'm proud of what we've accomplished, but more importantly, I'm really excited about what lies ahead.

Well, first of all, VPG is a heavily talked about metric, but as we've said multiple times, it is not a consistent metric. It does move around. So we've had quarters where it's been up dramatically, down dramatically. We think, for the full year, it will pace on what we think it will be. But again, we don't -- we -- just so we're consistent, even when we have an up quarter, we don't put too much -- we don't want to put too much stock in that one particular metric without looking at everything else. 
But having said that, yes, the -- just to be clear, the hybrid model is a hybrid between the way we've previously marketed for our in-house guests, which are our existing owners, and this new Specialist Presenter model. So it really -- that doesn't -- this new Specialist Presenter model doesn't really touch the new owners as much as it does the old owners. We still do group presentations for new owners, so it's not dissimilar, but when we talk about Specialist Presenter and the marketing impact it has, we're really talking about the impact it has for our in-house customers, people staying at our resorts. That's what we were trying to solve for is a better approach to the customer, a better experience for the consumer who already owns timeshare and is staying on our resort. And that's where we've made the changes. 
Relative to how many are left to do, we're basically done. We think we're at about a 60% rate of Specialist Presenter now for our in-house guests. We think that's about the right balance. We'll probably stay there and see how things track. We could go up, could go down a little bit, but we like what we're getting out of that model right now. So we really don't have a lot more to roll out on that side."

We do expect VPG to be positive going forward, and we appreciate the lack of comfort with the movements in VPG. I just will remind everyone and, again, we have said this before, we are constantly changing our marketing programs. We're moving our sales incentives around because we have a very large global sales force that's selling timeshare that we're constantly trying to make as -- to optimize as best we can. So there will be some volatility in there, it's just the nature of the beast, and we shouldn't be surprised by that. We may not like it, but we shouldn't be surprised by it.
As for the Consumer Finance Protection Board, they are -- I know that they came out with something that said that in October, they will be providing more guidance on consumer lending and included in that is timeshare, but we have not heard anything specifically about that. We think that everything we're doing and we believe in -- we're constantly looking at this from a regulatory standpoint is absolutely straight up the middle of the fairway. And so we don't see any impact from that. But we haven't seen -- if they're coming out with something new, it would be news to us. 
And we don't see -- and you also asked, do we see any other regulatory -- regulators coming in and creating issues. No, we don't. We're happy and pleased to see some of the prosecution effort against people who are bad players in the timeshare industry. We used to talk about the cease and desist issue that we had. The guy who was leading that cease and desist effort was recently found guilty and was sentenced. His sentencing was, I think, 20 -- 25 years. So that is a big time deterrent, we believe, to people who want to play badly in our industry."

In fact, some of our brands like I mentioned Microtel and Wingate are getting J.D. Powers awards for best appreciated by consumers. So I don't think we are in -- at the point of hitting a reset like we did with Ramada frankly many years ago. 
We are, however, very, very focused on enforcing our brand standards. We did -- during the downturn, we did show flexibility with our franchisees and we're not as diligent possibly or as aggressive in terminating properties that fell below standards. We gave them more time to fix the problem just out of the fact that we knew that their cash flow wasn't as strong, so it takes money to fix fiscal problems. So we were more flexible. We are much less flexible now. And I would say that we will be -- continue to be much less flexible going forward. 
We think now is the time when the industry is doing well that people should be reinvesting in their properties, and we see that happening. I went down to a what we call a franchise advisory council which was for all of our brands recently and there were probably 150, 200 people in the room, franchisees who were franchise leaders for each one of the brands. And the thing I heard most strongly from our franchisees was make sure you keep on the quality of their fellow franchisees. And so that is something that we had dedicated ourselves to and which we are reinforcing. And so I think we can get a lift just from the sheer fact that we are going to remove some of the weaker players in the market, and that is something that we're very, very focused on. 
As for RevPAR compared to industry, I don't know that we're much different than the economy sector. If you're looking at the luxury or upper upscale segment, yes, we won't go down as much. We probably won't go up as much as they do, so we're probably a more stable play there. But we feel that we are performing well and we track our RevPAR indexes. And as Tom said on the managed properties, we saw a great uptick, double-digit uptick in RevPAR at the managed properties. So we're feeling pretty good about where we are and how our brands are performing. We think that the loyalty program will give a great lift to this, but it's going to take little time for that to build. So it's probably a 2016 and beyond impact period."

I think that -- I wouldn't attribute anything to our RevPAR guidance to the consumer because those 2 factors, as Tom mentioned, that are impacting it are simply the FX and the fact that we lost this hotel in San Francisco. And believe it or not, it's large enough and big enough that it does have -- it does move the needle on RevPAR. That I don't think at all. Obviously, that doesn't move in the consumer's direction at all. 
The tour flow is really a reaction to how we're staffed and how many tours we want to take. One of the things our review showed during this last few months is that we may have been providing too many tours to our sales people. And that might sound counterintuitive, but if you provide too many tours, then the natural reaction of the sales person is, well, the next guy is going to be more likely to buy than the one 1 have right now, so let me move on to the next one. And that's understandable, it's a natural reaction and -- but it's not necessarily the right reaction because if we go through the process with an individual, we should see the close rate be about what we historically have experienced. 
Now going to the health of the consumer, while we're talking about close rate, we actually saw an improvement in the close rate in timeshare, and that is something -- it's another metric that we track and it works its way into VPG, but that kind of gives an indication of how this consumer is feeling. And so, if anything, is he going to feel stronger in the second half of the year? I don't know. He felt pretty strong in the second quarter to us. Is he going to feel stronger? I'm not sure. It's a great question. It's a difficult one to answer because my crystal ball is only so good."

I would probably say more of them have development advances than don't, but that's kind of the standard for this -- that segment in the upper upscale, upscale level where we're doing the management of properties. 
But yes, the results that we're seeing are in part the fact that I think we're doing a good job managing. We also have flipped properties into our brands and the brands are bringing good RevPAR lift. And again, we're watching all of these versus the kind of the index versus the market in which they're competing in, which is really when you look at it, how you judge our property -- an individual property is doing. 
But does -- just going back on your question about the health of the consumer. The one thing that I would point to is -- and we're not going to get granular with what July looks like because we're only 27 days into it.

We delivered strong results in the third quarter with currency neutral adjusted EBITDA and EPS growth of 7% and 17%, respectively. On an apples-to-apples basis excluding acquisitions in our divestiture. These results reflect continued strength and progress across all of our businesses.
In our Hotel Group, results were driven by strong domestic RevPAR with Exchange & Rentals, we had a big increase in rental volume. And in Vacation Ownership, we posted double-digit growth, VOI sales growth.
Capital allocation continue to benefit shareholders as well driving a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average shares outstanding and contributing in to arise in our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year.
Now, let me provide some operating perspective for each of the businesses starting with the Wyndham Hotel Group. Our Umbrella marketing campaign focusing on Wyndham Rewards and featuring the Wyndham Rewards wizards has been a success. The campaign has provided a great boost to our revamped rewards program with members staying up over 7%. We have also added over 2.1 million new members in nearly 0.5 million previously inactive members reactivated and stayed with us again. We have also seen record franchisee engagement with significant increases in on-property enrollments. This is a great start for our long-term strategy to grow our loyalty program.
The new program is earning accolades from guest and industry experts alike. Members are delighted by the ease of the program which allows them to earn and redeem points faster than any other loyalty program. In U.S. News & World Report recently named Wyndham Rewards one of the top programs in the hotel industry. Of course, all of this is driven by the value of our brands, the brand quality remains a primary focus at Wyndham Hotel Group.
We understand the power and reach of our unique portfolio, 13 brands, and see a great opportunity to offer quests and franchise owners a variety of clearly defined and compelling experiences. Not only on our upscale and midscale brand but in our economy brands as well. Most importantly, we -- by clearly defining and differentiating our brands, we can better grow our system by offering owners a clear value proposition that drives higher RevPAR for them.
On the technology front, the upgrade of our Property Management and Central Reservation Systems are well underway. As a reminder, we have partnered with technology best-in-class providers such as Sabre to help ensure our franchisees around the world are utilizing the most technologically advanced systems both now and into the future. This will help to maximize the value proposition of our family of brands. Hotels within our portfolio will be able to manage their pricing and inventory more effectively, connect to a wider range of global distribution partners and access a fully integrated customer profile that is tied into our Wyndham Rewards program.
After successful pilots this summer and spring, we began the rollout of our -- this month of the Property Management System and are well on our way towards achieving full implementation by the end of 2016.
We're also well into the planning for the migration of the Wyndham Hotel Group's 4 central reservation systems into 1 Sabre system and will begin moving our first brand to the new system later this quarter.
As part of our effort to expand our distribution platform, we recently signed a global deal with Trip Advisor instant booking. As one of the first hotel companies to feature their ratings and our brand websites, we've had a long-standing relationship with Trip Advisor. Trip Advisor instant booking will make it even easier for potential customers to reach directly book stays across our brands
Finally, the integration of recently acquired Dolce brand has been highly affected. Feedback from Dolce owners has been great as they have already seeing market share in margin improvements from our global marketing and sourcing leverage. The acquisition outperforming our expectations. As a matter of fact, we have several Dolce prospects in our current pipeline.
Now turning to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals which had a great quarter posting strong rental transaction and organic adjusted EBITDA growth. These great results reflect our leadership positions in managed rental, vacation rental in timeshare exchange. We control the calendar and inventory for over 110,000 vacation properties and provide products and services to over 5 million families around the world. The range and quality of the products and services that we provide to guests, property owners and affiliates sets us apart in the industry.
We have traditionally spoken about this segment in terms of 2 business lines, timeshare exchange and professionally managed vacation rentals. However, us will look at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals and consider to many opportunities that we to share core competencies, business enhancements and inventory across our brands, we are increasingly thinking about this business unit more simply as the worlds largest provider of professionally managed unique vacation accommodations. Anything from cottages to castles to timeshare resorts. To better reflect this perspective and to focus our teams on a cohesive growth strategy that harnesses the power of the extensive inventory available through our network and the core competencies of our teams, we are changing the name of this segment to Wyndham Destination Network effective January 1. There will be no change to our customer experience or consumer facing brands such as RCI, Green Parks, Hoseasons and [indiscernible] many of which have built customer loyalty for decades in their markets. Our team is top to optimally position this business unit for future growth by focusing our strength across our family of brands.
The overarching strategy of Wyndham destination network is to provide the right vacation to the right customer at the right time by leveraging our exclusive access to unique high-quality vacation accommodations. Each of these strategy has strong service commitment. Our expertise in analytics and revenue management, our ability to personalize the consumer experience, our product distribution capabilities and our deep market knowledge.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership which had an outstanding third quarter. Sales were robust across the system and we've never been more excited to be in the timeshare business. I reasoned third-party study showed that the $675 billion leisure travel market is expected to grow and a 4% CAGR over the next 10 years. That's approximately $30 billion of additional spend each year. Millenials and baby boomers represent the largest growth opportunities. Boomers are still traveling frequently representing approximately 80% of the U.S. leisure travel spend with an average of 4 to 5 trips per year. Millenials are rapidly becoming part of travel with approximately 2/3 indicating that it is an important part of their life. A majority of millenials, 6 out of 10, would rather spend money on experiences which we see squarely on the vacation ownership value proposition. These trends create attractive opportunities for us to continue VOI sales growth for many years. And we are well positioned to capture these opportunities. Over the past 12 months, we've open new sales centers and fantastic locations like New York City, Saint Thomas and the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Southern California, Colorado and Las Vegas. Many of these sales centers will be primarily committed to driving new owner growth. Adding new members has been and will continue to be a priority for this business. In addition to the new sales centers, look for us to expand our network of alliance partners. We're exploring nontraditional partnerships that will enable us to reach a new of potential owners. For example, we just signed a new alliance with no wage and cruise line. This will enable our owners to enjoy unique cruise experiences that will give Norwegian passengers the opportunity to experience our resorts. This builds upon a great program we already have in place for potential new owners. Our ""land and sea vacation package""  featuring stay at one of our timeshare resorts along with the cruise on our Norwegian ship. We piloted this program in Southern Florida where we have a number of Wyndham vacation ownership properties in close proximity to Fort Miami. Guests enjoy a 3 to 4 night cruise on a Norwegian sky alongside a 2 to 3 night stay at a nearby WVO resort which includes a sales tour.
Based on positive results, we're exploring a variety of joint marketing efforts in several Norwegian port cities where we too have a presence such as New Orleans, Hawaii and the port area. We're excited about our alliance with Norwegian especially given our long history of successfully  partnering with other hospitality companies for mutual growth. We are also exploring ways to better target new owners who are staying at our resorts, including friends and family of existing owners, renters and non-affiliated owners who have exchanged for one of our intervals. There is no better customer than one who is already enjoying our product.
To conclude, the opportunities across our businesses are robust. Now, let me turn the call over to Tom to -- for details on the quarter's results."
31063165,311922435,882022,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2015",2015-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter is always our most important quarter of the year as it generally produces around 1/3 of our EBITDA. So I'm particularly pleased to report that our business units achieved strong results. Adjuste",1779,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter is always our most important quarter of the year as it generally produces around 1/3 of our EBITDA. So I'm particularly pleased to report that our business units achieved strong results. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS increased 7% and 17%, respectively. On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and the divestiture.
Compared to the third quarter of 2014, FX translation reduced revenues by $58 million and adjusted EBITDA by $17 million companywide. We exceeded our EPS guidance by $0.10, reflecting better-than-expected operating results, particularly at Vacation Ownership, along with anticipated tax rate and share repurchases.
In the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $170 million contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count through the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30, was $660 million compared with $750 million for the first 9 months of 2014, primarily reflecting the timing of inventory spend, CapEx and some working capital.
We expect fourth quarter inventory purchases to be significantly under last year's fourth quarter spent.
We still expect to deliver free cash flow in the neighborhood of $800 million despite $40 million in foreign-exchange headwinds. As you know, there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or even any given year. So we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than a precise figure.
Reported results for the quarter reflected several items excluded from our adjusted measures. We spent $8 million to close 2 call centers and streamline operations in our business units. We expect these moves provide positive financial and operational return in the near future. We recorded a $7 million writeoff of Hotel Group IT projects that are not obsolete as we move to our new Property Management in central reservation systems in the cloud. In addition, we took a $14 million charge associated with the termination of an underperforming contract at our Hotel Group.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. Our Hotel Group had a solid third quarter following a strong first half of the year. On an apples-to-apples basis, which excludes the effective currency, the increased rate on the interest segment licensing fee that the Hotel Group receives, a benefit from resigning a third party co-branded credit card agreement in 2014 and the Dolce acquisition, revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 4%. This is in line with our expectation and reflects higher marketing spend and operating expenses associated with the PMS and CRS implementations. As I mentioned, the business recently streamlined operations and we expect the savings from these moves will largely offset implementation cost starting in the fourth quarter.
Same-store domestic RevPAR continue to perform well increasing 5.1% with industry and days in brand performing in line. Our midscale segment also hosted growth consistent with the industry with the Wingate, Hawthorne and Ramada brands showing growth greater than 7%. All of this despite seeing a drag and our RevPAR growth due to weakness in the oil-producing states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
Now to put this in perspective, RevPAR in the oil-producing states groups around 6% whereas our gene oil-producing states was actually down 3%. We are especially pleased with the performance of our managed portfolio which posted a 14% increase in RevPAR year-over-year on a same-store basis. This [indiscernible] RevPAR was flat due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange, lower demand in oil-producing regions and continued unit growth of lower RevPAR in hotels in China. If we do exclude China effect and the -- and put our results in constant currency, global RevPAR would have actually would have grown 4.4%. Overall system size was up 2.5%. Our development pipeline has increased 5% sequentially, and we're on track to hit our annual growth target of 3% to 5%, albeit at the lower end of the range.
Our exchange in rental segment continued to perform well. Note that adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2014 included an $18 million contribution from Canvas Holidays, a U.K.-based camping brand which we sold late in 2014. Remember that while Canvas historically contributed significant positive EBITDA in the third quarter, this was largely offset by negative EBITDA in other quarters.
On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions in the Canvas holidays divestiture, revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. Results primarily reflect strong peak summer growth and our global vacation rental brands including North America.
At RCI exchange revenue increased 1% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 1.5% attributable to new member growth in the Americas. Exchange revenue per member was flat as the pricing increases offset the growth in lower transacting club members.
Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divestiture. That increase reflects a 5.8% increase in transaction volume and a 1.7% increase in the average net price per rental.
Transaction growth occurred in all significant brands and regions. Both pricing and transaction volume were aided by our dynamic pricing initiatives.
Results were particularly strong in our Vacation Ownership business. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 8%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a currency neutral basis, which includes a $4 million increase in the licensing fee paid to the Hotel Group. Excluding this fee increase, currency neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 11%, primarily reflecting strong improvements in gross VOI sales.
In constant currency, gross VOI sales were up 12% albeit from a low base in the third quarter of 2014, reflecting a 10.6% increase in VPG and a 0.9% increase in tour flow. Sales in VPG benefited from a favorable product mix resulting in higher yields and transaction sizes.
Now, while we're delighted by our VPG results for the quarter, please keep in mind that this metric can move around and should be viewed in the overall context of the business. Our operating focus is to drive topline VOI sales growth which will lead to EBITDA growth. The provision for loan loss was $78 million compared to $70 million in the third quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting higher sales volume in the quarter.
In the quarter, we completed another WAAM just-in-time transaction involving the sale of existing inventory to a third party for completion. While there are different structures to these WAAM deals. In this particular case, we sold land and worked in progress in St. Thomas for $65 million in cash. Our partner will finish the development and deliver the product to us on a just-in-time basis. This type of WAAM deal has affected decelerating cash flow with development by one monetizing inventory in the balance sheet and then reducing the immediate cash outflow for a timeshare development. While the accounting treatment takes it out of the definition of free cash flow as the dollars received run through financing activity rather than cash from operations, it does increase our total of available cash this year.
We closed our third securitization of the year in the $300 million Sierra 2015-3 on October 31, we achieved 2.9% coupon with an 89% advance rate. And from a corporate perspective, we issued a 10-year $350 million bond with a 5.1% coupon on September 10. The funds were used to repay our short-term borrowings. We are once again pleased to access the long-term debt markets at such a favorable rates.
Finally, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.06 to $5.09 for the full year, and diluted share count goes to 119.4 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our third quarter share repurchase activity. We are adjusting our interest expense, G&A and tax rate guidance once again, is posted on the website.
We are also fine-tuning our guidance as follows. In Hotel Group in our expect that 2015 global RevPAR will increase 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis or be flat including the impact of foreign exchange translation.
Domestic RevPAR is expected to be -- to increase 5% to 6%, our new guidance reflects the impact of updated FX translation effects coupled with lower demand in oil-producing regions and higher international growth. As noted earlier, we expect net room growth to be at the low end of our 3% to 5% guidance range as we continue to focus on hotels that meet our quality standards.
We're maintaining our exchange in rentals driver guidance but acknowledged that Vacation Rental transactions may modestly exceed the range and exchange revenue per member may fall slightly below the range due to foreign exchange translation.
For our Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we expected at the high-end if not a slightly above our range and consistent with our update last quarter, we believe we will be at the lower end of the 1% to 3% range.
Total company as well as business unit revenues and adjusted EBITDA guidance all remain unchanged. I'll note that foreign exchange translation created an additional $8 million headwind since our last guidance compared with 2014 results. The total year-over-year translation headwind is now estimated to be $46 million. Given the increased translation headwind, we are currently more comfortable with the adjusted EBITDA estimates slightly below the midpoint of our $1,285,000,000  to $1,315,000,000 range.
For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted diluted share of $0.94 to $0.97. In Exchange and Rentals, note that now divested holidays canvas holidays business had a $6 million EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect interest expense in the fourth quarter to approximately $34 million, reflecting the recent bond offering. And finally, remember that we don't assume future repurchases in our EPS guidance.
As you saw from the press release, we expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth in line with our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8%. While our guidance always excludes prospective share repurchase, it's important to note that we expect the application of our considerable free cash flow either through M&A or share repurchase to result in earnings per share compounded growth in the midteens over the next 5 years. We'll provide full 2016 guidance including company revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow guidance as well as business units, revenue, EBITDA and driver guidance on our February call once we have completed our budgeting process.
To close. We are very pleased with the quarter and are looking forward to continued progress in the remainder of the year. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Steve?"

Joe, with respect to EPG, the -- yes, several questions the mix between owners and upgrade was pretty similar to what we had last quarter, I believe, I don't think there's much change in that. The product mix, we do have new sales offices that have opened, some of which will have the potential to drive a slightly higher VPG. But as you noted in the beginning of the call, the comparisons here were fairly easy comparisons. VPG was down 5% last year in the third quarter, we're up about 10% this year. So really on a -- if you look at it on a normalized basis, we probably would have been up 3% or 4%, which is really still really good and the guys did a fantastic job in the timeshare business adjusting and adapting to some of the changes they've made with their marketing. But I would not expect to see a 10% VPG increase going forward. And also as we noted in our comments, and I'll just make this and I'll let you follow-up with any other questions, really, the key driver, it's not a driver, but the key thing to look at here is gross VOI sales. As VPG can be up or down in any quarter as we've proven over the last couple of years. But the important thing is we drive VOI sales growth and continue to add new members to our base. And those are the 2 things that we're very focused on and the team is positioned to deliver on well."

Would you say that this business is maybe more idiosyncratic than any of your other businesses? Meaning RevPAR vacation rentals can be impacted by industry and macro trends. Admittedly, you guys do a great job on both of those, but they're a little bit more industry and macro linked. While timeshare maybe is more a function of your own product and marketing programs, is that how you think about it? Second question is, how should we start to think about FX. Because it is starting to move the numbers a little bit. Should we start to mark-to-market? Are you going to start to hedge? What currency are you exposed to? And then, the final question just on free cash flow generation. It seems like that -- you desire to maybe not give that answer today but also be a function of some of the opportunities you're seeing out there to do sort of deferred CapEx program. Similar to the one you just discussed this morning where an outside investor is taking over an asset, you've sold some of that inventory to them. Is that part of the discussion? Is that heating up more? Are you seeing more opportunities there? So sorry for the 3 questions, but there they are."

I love your description of the timeshare business because that is something that we've been saying for a long time in different words and I think you just captured it. This business is very much a business that's impacted by good management and it's a business that does not have natural demand drivers. We create the demand through our marketing efforts to bring people in and to learn more about our product and then hopefully, buy timeshares. So yes, it does tend to march to its own drum beat, but it is a very management intensive business from a performance standpoint. It can be affected by good changes. And I think that's what we see over the last year. When we look at the end of the year, you'll see great performance in this business, but for a month -- for quarter, we saw some depth in VPG. We weren't concerned and we told people that there was a lot of noise out there, but the fact is we felt very good with the changes that the team, that the vacation ownership group were making as usual. As they always do, they executed those changes very well and we're beginning to see the benefit of that. So yes, to answer to your first question, the simple answer, the answer is yes. With respect to -- I'll let Tom talk about the FX question, but just jumping to the free cash flow. I don't know that I would say we're seeing a lot of different opportunities. There has always been opportunities. And if you look at what we have lineup right now in these kind of asset-like relationships, we have like 1.5 years more of inventory that is lined up with these transactions and we'll continue to line them up because they're good for the free cash flow basis. That in on itself and the $65 million that Tom spoke to for cash flow that's coming in but it actually doesn't flow through free cash flow, that is not impacting our lack of visibility into 2016 free cash flow. It really is just simply we'd have to go through to budget process, we'd have to go through the process of CapEx request from all the business units, understand what the IRR or ROI is for those opportunities and make decisions because we talk a lot about M&A and buying back stock. But still, if we can invest in the business in a very accretive IOR manner, we will do that. So we encourage our business units to come up with ideas and present them to us and if they hit the mark, we'll invest more in those opportunities. And I'm not saying we have them lined up right now, and I'm just saying that's part of the process as a company, we have to go through. And we don't want to shortcut that process just to be able to say what we think is going to look like a 2016 on this call. So that's the best way I can answer that.

And when we think about our currency exposure, our largest currency exposures are the euro, the Danish kroner, which is kind of linked to the euro and pound sterling and then the Australian dollar is also a very important currency. I think if you were to take those 4 currencies, it's probably worth about 80% of our foreign exchange exposure. And so when the onslaught of 2015 started and the dollar strengthened, we thought, okay, is there anything we can do more on hedging, but these are not economic activities. They are -- the translation effect that we talk about is taking on a piece of paper the amount of money, the amount of euros that you earned and calculating at a specific translation rate, the amount of dollars that that's equivalent to. And so it's not economic, it doesn't allow us to do the type of hedging where we can get to hedge accounting. And so we really looked at it, we really pushed it because we would love nothing more than to mitigate this effect. But we judged, Steve and I judged that the volatility that we would create and not getting hedge accounting was not worth the activity. And we made that the decision at the beginning of the year. So our hope is that the dollar doesn't -- from our seats, our professional seats, that the dollar doesn't strengthen again to the same magnitude as it did in 2015 against those baskets of currencies. But we're not quite sure that it won't. And so our ability to mitigate that, I would say given the accounting rules is pretty limited. So your guess is as good as mine on where the dollar goes against these major currencies, but this year was a historically significant year and the strengthening of the dollar against those currencies and we hope there won't be a recurrence next year."

That number has been relatively consistent the past few quarters. It leads me to believe that thought balance sheet reserve has reached a point, a reasonable point of stability. And that number is expected to materially change in 1 direction or another. So the provision is the additive factor to that reserve. So we'll sit at the end of the quarter and judge where the reserve needs to be and look at where the reserve is, consider what the faults have taken place in the quarter and the provision will be the output of that. And so it's my guess that is if the reserve is going to be relatively stable that the provision should be relatively stable as well because there is no discernible change in credit quality of our buyers. Absolutely not. We're consistent. Our pico target remains consistent. And so because we expected the reserve is going to be relatively constant, we don't expect the fault range to change materially and our credit quality is not changing of our buyers. It's -- I would expect that the provision would be in a period of relatively stable trend because we have reached that point. Should any of those factors change meaning should defaults decrease in our reserve requirement on our balance sheet come down then we could provide for less.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered strong results in the third quarter with currency neutral adjusted EBITDA and EPS growth of 7% and 17%, respectively on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding acquisitions and dives",1522,"Thanks, Margo. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered strong results in the third quarter with currency neutral adjusted EBITDA and EPS growth of 7% and 17%, respectively on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding acquisitions and divestiture. These results reflect continued strength and progress across all of our businesses.
In our Hotel Group, results were driven by strong domestic RevPAR. In Exchange & Rentals, we had a big increase in rental transaction volume. And in Vacation Ownership, we posted double-digit growth, VOI sales growth.
Capital allocation continue to benefit shareholders as well driving a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average shares outstanding and contributing to a rise in our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year.
Now let me provide some operating perspective for each of the businesses starting with the Wyndham Hotel Group. Our umbrella marketing campaign focusing on Wyndham Rewards and featuring the Wyndham Rewards wizard has been a success. The campaign has provided a great boost to our revamped rewards program with members stays up over 7%. We have also added over 2.1 million new members and nearly 0.5 million previously inactive members reactivated and stayed with us again. We have also seen record franchisee engagement with significant increases in on-property enrollments. This is a great start for our long-term strategy to grow our loyalty program.
The new program is earning accolades from guests and industry experts alike. Members are delighted by the ease of the program, which allows them to earn and redeem points faster than any other loyalty program. In U.S. News & World Report recently named Wyndham Rewards one of the top programs in the hotel industry. Of course, all of this is driven by the value of our brands, the brand quality -- and brand quality remains a primary focus at Wyndham Hotel Group.
We understand the power and reach of our unique portfolio of 13 brands and see a great opportunity to offer quests and franchise owners a variety of clearly defined and compelling experiences not only in our upscale and midscale brands but in our economy brands as well. Most importantly, we -- by clearly defining and differentiating our brands, we can better grow our system by offering owners a clear value proposition that drives a higher RevPAR for them.
On the technology front, the upgrade of our property management and central reservation systems are well underway. As a reminder, we have partnered with technology best-in-class providers, such as Sabre to help ensure our franchisees around the world are utilizing the most technologically advanced systems both now and into the future. This will help to maximize the value proposition of our family of brands. Hotels within our portfolio will be able to manage their pricing and inventory more effectively, connect to a wider range of global distribution partners and access a fully integrated customer profile that is tied into our Wyndham Rewards program.
After successful pilots this summer and spring, we began the rollout of our -- this month of the property management system and are well on our way toward achieving full implementation by the end of 2016.
We're also well into the planning for the migration of the Wyndham Hotel Group's 4 central reservation systems into 1 Sabre system and will begin moving our first brand to the new system later this quarter.
As part of our effort to expand our distribution platform, we recently signed a global deal with TripAdvisor instant booking. As one of the first hotel companies to feature their ratings on our brand websites, we've had a long-standing relationship with TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor instant booking will make it even easier for potential customers to reach and directly book stays across our brands.
Finally, the integration of the recently acquired Dolce brand has been highly effective. Feedback from Dolce owners has been great as they have already -- as they are already seeing market share in margin improvements from our global marketing and sourcing leverage. The acquisition is outperforming our expectations. As a matter of fact, we have several Dolce prospects in our current pipeline.
Now turning to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, which had a great quarter posting strong rental transactions and organic adjusted EBITDA growth. These great results reflect our leadership positions in managed rental, vacation rental and timeshare exchange. We control the calendar and inventory for over 110,000 vacation properties and provide products and services to over 5 million families around the world. The range and quality of the products and services that we provide to guests, property owners and affiliates sets us apart in the industry.
We have traditionally spoken about this segment in terms of 2 business lines, timeshare exchange and professionally managed vacation rentals. However, as we look at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals and consider many opportunities we have to share core competencies, business enhancements and inventory across our brands, we are increasingly thinking about this business unit more simply as the world's largest provider of professionally managed unique vacation accommodations, anything from cottages to castles to timeshare resorts. To better reflect this perspective and to focus our teams on a cohesive growth strategy that harnesses the power of the extensive inventory available through our network and the core competencies of our teams, we are changing the name of this segment to Wyndham Destination Network effective January 1. There will be no change to our customer experience or consumer facing brands such as RCI, Landal GreenParks, Hoseasons and Novasol, many of which have built customer loyalty for decades in their markets. We are teamed this up now to optimally position this business unit for future growth by focusing our strength across our family of brands.
The overarching strategy of Wyndham Destination Network is to provide the right vacation to the right customer at the right time by leveraging our exclusive access to unique high-quality vacation accommodations. Each of this strategy has our strong service commitment, our expertise in analytics and revenue management, our ability to personalize the consumer experience, our product distribution capabilities and our deep market knowledge.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had an outstanding third quarter. Sales were robust across the system, and we've never been more excited to be in the timeshare business. A recent third-party study show that the $675 billion U.S.  Leisure travel market is expected to grow at a 4% CAGR over the next 10 years. That's approximately $30 billion of additional spend each year. Millenials and baby boomers represent the largest growth opportunities. Boomers are still traveling frequently, representing approximately 80% of the U.S. leisure travel spend with an average of 4 to 5 trips per year. Millenials are rapidly becoming a force in travel with approximately 2/3 indicating that it is an important part of their life. A majority of millenials, 6 out of 10, would rather spend money on experiences, which we see squarely in the vacation ownership value proposition. These tends --  these trends create attractive opportunities for us to continue VOI sales growth for many years, and we are well positioned to capture these opportunities. Over the past 12 months, we've opened new sales centers in fantastic locations like New York City, St. Thomas in the  Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Southern California, Colorado and Las Vegas. Many of these sales centers will be primarily committed to driving new owner growth. Adding new members has been and will continue to be a priority for this business. In addition to the new sales centers, look for us to expand our network of alliance partners. We're exploring nontraditional partnerships that will enable us to reach a swath of potential owners. For example, we just signed a new alliance with Norwegian Cruise Line. This will enable our owners to enjoy unique cruise experiences and will give Norwegian's passengers the opportunity to experience our resorts. This builds upon a great program we already have in place for potential new owners. Our ""land and sea vacation package""  features a stay at one of our timeshare resorts along with the cruise on Norwegian ship. We piloted this program in Southern Florida, where we have a number of Wyndham vacation ownership properties in close proximity to Fort Miami. Guests enjoy a 3- to 4-night cruise on the Norwegian sky alongside a 2- to 3-night stay at a nearby WVO resort, which includes a sales tour.
Based on positive results, we're exploring a variety of joint marketing efforts in several Norwegian port cities, where we too have a presence, such as New Orleans, Hawaii and the port Canaveral area. We're excited about our alliance with Norwegian, especially given our long history of successfully  partnering with other hospitality companies for mutual growth. We are also exploring ways to better target new owners who are staying at our resorts, including friends and family of existing owners, renters and nonaffiliated owners who will exchange for one of our intervals. There is no better customer than one who is already enjoying our product.
To conclude, the opportunities across our businesses are robust. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to -- for details on the quarter results."
31063165,311922435,882262,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2015",2015-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter is always our most important quarter of the year as it generally produces around 1/3 of our EBITDA. So I'm particularly pleased to report that our business units achieved strong results. Adjuste",1797,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter is always our most important quarter of the year as it generally produces around 1/3 of our EBITDA. So I'm particularly pleased to report that our business units achieved strong results. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS increased 7% and 17%, respectively on a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and divestiture.
Compared to the third quarter of 2014, FX translation reduced revenues by $58 million and adjusted EBITDA by $17 million company wide. We exceeded our EPS guidance by $0.10, reflecting better-than-expected operating results, particularly at Vacation Ownership, a lower-than-anticipated tax rate and share repurchases.
In the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $170 million contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count through the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30 was $660 million compared with $750 million for the first 9 months of 2014, primarily reflecting the timing of inventory spend, CapEx and some working capital.
We expect fourth quarter inventory purchases to be significantly under last year's fourth quarter spend.
We still expect to deliver free cash flow in the neighborhood of $800 million despite $40 million in foreign exchange headwinds. As you know, there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or even any given year, so we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than a precise figure.
Reported results for the quarter reflected several items excluded from our adjusted measures. We spent $8 million to close 2 call centers and streamline operations in our business units. We expect these moves provide positive financial and operational return in the near future. We recorded a $7 million writeoff of Hotel Group IT projects that are not obsolete as we move to our new property management in central reservation systems in the cloud. In addition, we took a $14 million charge associated with the termination of an underperforming contract at our Hotel Group.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. Our Hotel Group had a solid third quarter following a strong first half of the year. On an apples-to-apples basis, which excludes the effective currency, the increased rate on the interest segment licensing fee that the Hotel Group receives, a benefit from resigning a third-party co-branded credit card agreement in 2014 and the Dolce acquisition, revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased 4%. This is in line with our expectations and reflects higher marketing spend and operating expenses associated with the PMS and CRS implementations. As I mentioned, the business recently streamlined operations, and we expect the savings from these moves will largely offset implementation costs starting in the fourth quarter.
Same-store domestic RevPAR continued to perform well, increasing 5.1% with Super 8 beating the industry and Days Inn brand performing in line. Our midscale segment also posted growth consistent with the industry with the Wingate, Hawthorn and Ramada brands showing growth of greater than 7%. All of this despite seeing a drag on our RevPAR growth due to weakness in the oil-producing states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
Now to put this into perspective, RevPAR in the non-oil-producing states grew around 6%, whereas RevPAR in the oil-producing states was actually down 3%. We are especially pleased with the performance of our managed portfolio, which posted a 14% increase in RevPAR year-over-year on a same-store basis. System-wide RevPAR was flat largely due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange, lower demand in oil-producing regions and continued unit growth of lower RevPAR in hotels in China. If we do exclude China effect and the -- and put our results in constant currency, global RevPAR actually would have grown 4.4%. Overall system size was up 2.5%. Our development pipeline has increased 5% sequentially, and we're on track to hit our annual growth target of 3% to 5%, albeit at the lower end of the range.
Our Exchange & Rental segment continued to perform well. Note that adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2014 included an $18 million contribution from Canvas Holidays, a U.K.-based camping brand, which we sold late in 2014. Remember that while Canvas historically contributed significant positive EBITDA in the third quarter, this was largely offset by negative EBITDA in other quarters.
On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions in the Canvas Holidays divestiture, revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. Results primarily reflect strong peak summer growth in our global Vacation Rental brands including North America.
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 1.5% attributable to new member growth in the Americas. Exchange revenue per member was flat as the pricing increases offset the growth and lower transacting club members.
Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divestiture. That increase reflects a 5.8% increase in transaction volume and a 1.7% increase in the average net price per rental.
Transaction growth occurred in all significant brands and regions. Both pricing and transaction volume were aided by our dynamic pricing initiatives.
Results were particularly strong in our Vacation Ownership business. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 8%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a currency neutral basis, which includes a $4 million increase in the licensing fee paid to the Hotel Group. Excluding this fee increase, currency neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 11%, primarily reflecting strong improvements in gross VOI sales.
In constant currency, gross VOI sales were up 12% albeit from a low base in the third quarter of 2014, reflecting a 10.6% increase in VPG and a 0.9% increase in tour flow. Sales in VPG benefited from a favorable product mix resulting in higher yields and transaction sizes.
Now while we're delighted by our VPG results for the quarter, please keep in mind that this metric can move around and should be viewed in the overall context of the business. Our operating focus is to drive top line VOI sales growth, which will lead to EBITDA growth. The provision for loan loss was $78 million compared to $70 million in the third quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting higher sales volume in the quarter.
In the quarter, we completed another WAAM Just-in-Time transaction involving the sale of existing inventory to a third party for completion. Now there are different structures to these WAAM deals. In this particular case, we sold land and work in progress in St. Thomas for $65 million in cash. Our partner will finish the development and deliver the product to us on a just-in-time basis. This type of WAAM deal has the effect of accelerating the cash flow with timeshare development by one monetizing inventory in the balance sheet and then reducing the immediate cash outflow for a timeshare development. While the accounting treatment takes it out of the definition of free cash flow as the dollars received run through financing activity rather than cash from operations, it does increase our total of available cash this year.
We closed our third securitization of the year the $300 million Sierra 2015-3 on October 31. We achieved 2.69% coupon with an 89% advance rate. And from a corporate perspective, we issued a 10-year $350 million bond with a 5.1% coupon on September 10. The funds were used to repay our short-term borrowings. We are once again pleased to be able to access the long-term debt markets at such favorable rates.
Finally, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.06 to $5.09 for the full year, and diluted share count goes to 119.4 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our third quarter share repurchase activity. We are adjusting our interest expense, D&A and tax rate guidance, which again is posted on the website.
We are also fine-tuning our driver guidance as follows. In the Hotel Group, we now expect that 2015 global RevPAR will increase 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis or be flat, including the impact of foreign exchange translation.
Domestic RevPAR is expected to be -- to increase 5% to 6%.  Our new guidance reflects the impact of updated FX translation effects, coupled with lower demand in the oil-producing regions and higher international growth. As noted earlier, we expect net room growth to be at the low end of our 3% to 5% guidance range as we continue to focus on hotels that meet our quality standards.
We're maintaining our exchange in rentals driver guidance but acknowledged that Vacation Rental transactions may modestly exceed the range and exchange revenue per member may fall slightly below the range due to foreign exchange translation.
For Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we expect to be at the high end if not a slightly above our VPG range and consistent with our update last quarter, we believe we will be at the lower end of the 1% to 3% tour flow range.
Total company as well as business unit revenues and adjusted EBITDA guidance all remain unchanged. And note that foreign exchange translation created an additional $8 million headwind since our last guidance compared with 2014 results. The total year-over-year translation headwind is now estimated to be $46 million. Given the increased translation headwind, we are currently more comfortable with adjusted EBITDA estimates slightly below the midpoint of our $1,285,000,000  to $1,315,000,000 range.
For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earning per share of $0.94 to $0.97. In Exchange & Rentals, note that the now divested Canvas Holidays business had a $6 million EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect interest expense in the fourth quarter of approximately $34 million, reflecting the recent bond offering. And finally, remember that we don't assume future repurchases in our EPS guidance.
As you saw from the press release, we expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth in line with our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8%. While our guidance always excludes prospective share repurchase, it's important to note that we expect the application of our considerable free cash flow either through M&A or share repurchase to result in earnings per share compounded growth in the midteens over the next 5 years. We'll provide full 2016 guidance including company revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow guidance as well as business units, revenue, EBITDA and driver guidance on our February call once we have completed our budgeting process.
To close, we are very pleased with the quarter and are looking forward to continued progress in the remainder of the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Steve?"

Joe, well, with respect to EPG, the -- you asked us several questions the mix between new owners and upgrade was pretty similar to what we had last quarter, I believe. I don't think there's much change in that. The product mix, we do have new sales offices that have opened, some of which will have the potential to drive a slightly higher VPG, but as you noted at the beginning of the call, the comparisons here were fairly easy comparisons. VPG was down 5% last year in the third quarter, we're up about 10% this year. So really on a -- if you look at it on a normalized basis, we probably would have been up 3% or 4%, which is still really good and the guys did a fantastic job in the timeshare business adjusting and adapting to some of the changes they've made with their marketing. But I would not expect to see a 10% VPG increase going forward. And also as we noted in our comments, and I'll just make this and then I'll let you follow up with any other questions, really, the key driver, it's not a driver, but the key thing to look at here is gross VOI sales. As VPG can be up or down in any quarter as we've proven over the last couple of years, but the important thing is we drive VOI sales growth and continue to add new members to our base. And those are 2 things that we're very focused on and the team is positioned to deliver on well."

Just following up on Joe's question on VPG showing significant strength. Would you say that this business is maybe more idiosyncratic than any of your other businesses meaning RevPAR of Vacation Rentals can be impacted by industry and macro trends? Admittedly, you guys do a great job on both of those, but they're a little bit more industry and macro linked. While timeshare maybe is more function of your own product and marketing programs, is that how you think about it? Second question is, how should we start to think about FX? Because it is starting to move the numbers a little bit. Should we start to mark-to-market? Are you going to start to hedge? What currencies are you exposed to? And then, the final question just on free cash flow generation. It seems like that -- you are desired to maybe not give that answer today could also be a function of some of the opportunities you're seeing out there to do sort of deferred CapEx program, similar to the one you just discussed this morning, where an outside investor is taking over an asset, you've sold some of that inventory to them. Is that part of the discussion? Is that heating up more? Are you seeing more opportunities there? So sorry for the 3 questions, but there they are."

I love your description of the timeshare business because that is something that we've been saying for a long time in different words, and I think you just captured it. This business is very much a business that's impacted by good management, and it's a business that does not have natural demand drivers. We create the demand through our marketing efforts to bring people in to learn more about our product and then hopefully buy timeshares. So yes, it does tend to march to its own drum beat, but it is a very management-intensive business from a performance standpoint. It can be affected by good changes, and I think that's what we see over the last year. When you look at the end of the year, you'll see great performance in this business, but for a month -- for a quarter, we saw some dip in VPG. We weren't concerned and we told people that there was a lot of noise out there, but the fact is we felt very good with the changes that the team at the Vacation Ownership group were making as usual. As they always do, they've executed those changes very well, and we're beginning to see the benefit of that. So yes, to answer to your first question with the simple answer, the answer is, yes. With respect to -- I'll let Tom talk about the FX question but just jumping to the free cash flow, I don't know that I would say we're seeing a lot of different opportunities. There have always been opportunities. And if you look at what we have lined up right now in these kind of asset-light relationships, we have like 1.5 years worth or more of inventory that is lined up with these transactions, and we'll continue to line them up because they're good from a free cash flow basis. That is not that end of itself and the $65 million that Tom spoke to for cash flow that's coming in but it actually doesn't flow through free cash flow, that is not impacting our lack of visibility into 2016 free cash flow. It really is just simply we have to go through the budget process, we have to go through the process of CapEx request from all the business units, understand what the IRR or ROI is for those opportunities and make decisions, because we talk a lot about M&A and buying back stock. But still, if we can invest in the business in a very accretive IOR manner, we will do that. And so we encourage our business units to come up with ideas, present them to us and if they hit the mark, we'll invest more in those opportunities. And I'm not saying we have them lined up right now, I'm just saying that's part of the process, as a company, we have to go through. And we don't want to shortcut that process just to be able to say what we think it's going to look like in 2016 on this call. So that's the way I can answer that. And Tom, you want to talk about currencies [ph]?"

And when we think about our currency exposure, our largest currency exposures are the euro, the Danish kroner, which is kind of linked to the euro and pound sterling and then the Australian dollar is also a very important currency. I think if you were to take those 4 currencies, it's probably worth about 80% of our foreign exchange exposure. And so, we -- when the onslaught of 2015 started and the dollar strengthened, we thought, okay, is there anything we can do more on hedging but -- and these are not economic activities. They are -- the translation effect that we talk about is taking on a piece of paper the amount of money, the amount of euros that you earned and calculating at a specific translation rate, the amount of dollars that that's equivalent to. And so it's not economic, it doesn't allow us to do the type of hedging where we can get to hedge accounting. And so we really looked at it, we really pushed it because we would love nothing more than to mitigate this effect. But we judged, Steve and I judged that, that volatility that we would create and not getting hedge accounting was not worth the activity. And we made that decision at the beginning of the year. So our hope is that the dollar doesn't -- from our seats, our professional seats, that the dollar doesn't strengthen again to the same magnitude as it did in 2015 against those baskets of currencies. But we're not quite sure that it won't. And so our ability to mitigate that, I would say, given the accounting rules is pretty limited. So your guess is as good as mine on where the dollar goes against these major currencies, but this year was a historically significant year and the strengthening of the dollar against those currencies and we hope there won't be a recurrence next year. Is there anything else [indiscernible]."

So Chris, look -- when -- the provision, as I mentioned in my earlier comments is really a number that gets derived by our evaluation of our balance sheet reserve against outstanding receivables. That number has been relatively consistent in the past few quarters. It leads me to believe that the balance sheet reserve has reached a point -- a reasonable point of stability, and that, that number isn't expected to materially change in one direction or another. So the provision is the additive factor to that reserve. So we'll sit at the end of a quarter and judge where the reserve needs to be and look at where the reserve is, consider what the faults have taken place in the quarter and the provision will be the output of that. And so, it's my guess that is if the reserve is going to be relatively stable that the provision should be relatively stable as well, because there is no discernible change in credit quality of our buyers. Absolutely not. We're consistent. Our FICO target remains consistent. And so, because we expected THAT the reserve is going to be relatively constant, we don't expect the fault range to change materially and our credit quality is not changing of our buyers. It's -- I would expect that the provision would be in a period of relatively stable trend because we have reached that point. Should any of those factors change meaning should defaults decrease in our reserve requirement on our balance sheet come down then we will have -- we could provide for less.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered strong results in the third quarter with currency neutral adjusted EBITDA and EPS growth of 7% and 17%, respectively on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding acquisitions and a divestiture. These results reflect continued strength and progress across all of our businesses.
In our Hotel Group, results were driven by strong domestic RevPAR. In Exchange & Rentals, we had a big increase in rental transaction volume. And in Vacation Ownership, we posted double-digit growth, VOI sales growth.
Capital allocation continue to benefit shareholders as well driving a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average shares outstanding and contributing to a rise in our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year.
Now let me provide some operating perspective for each of the businesses starting with the Wyndham Hotel Group. Our umbrella marketing campaign focusing on Wyndham Rewards and featuring the Wyndham Rewards wizard has been a success. The campaign has provided a great boost to our revamped rewards program with members stays up over 7%. We have also added over 2.1 million new members and nearly 0.5 million previously inactive members reactivated and stayed with us again. We have also seen record franchisee engagement with significant increases in on-property enrollments. This is a great start for our long-term strategy to grow our loyalty program.
The new program is earning accolades from guests and industry experts alike. Members are delighted by the ease of the program, which allows them to earn and redeem points faster than any other loyalty program. In U.S. News & World Report recently named Wyndham Rewards one of the top programs in the hotel industry. Of course, all of this is driven by the value of our brands, the brand quality -- and brand quality remains a primary focus at Wyndham Hotel Group.
We understand the power and reach of our unique portfolio of 13 brands and see a great opportunity to offer quests and franchise owners a variety of clearly defined and compelling experiences not only in our upscale and midscale brands but in our economy brands as well. Most importantly, we -- by clearly defining and differentiating our brands, we can better grow our system by offering owners a clear value proposition that drives a higher RevPAR for them.
On the technology front, the upgrade of our property management and central reservation systems are well underway. As a reminder, we have partnered with technology best-in-class providers, such as Sabre to help ensure our franchisees around the world are utilizing the most technologically advanced systems both now and into the future. This will help to maximize the value proposition of our family of brands. Hotels within our portfolio will be able to manage their pricing and inventory more effectively, connect to a wider range of global distribution partners and access a fully integrated customer profile that is tied into our Wyndham Rewards program.
After successful pilots this summer and spring, we began the rollout of our -- this month of the property management system and are well on our way toward achieving full implementation by the end of 2016.
We're also well into the planning for the migration of the Wyndham Hotel Group's 4 central reservation systems into 1 Sabre system and will begin moving our first brand to the new system later this quarter.
As part of our effort to expand our distribution platform, we recently signed a global deal with TripAdvisor instant booking. As one of the first hotel companies to feature their ratings on our brand websites, we've had a long-standing relationship with TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor instant booking will make it even easier for potential customers to reach and directly book stays across our brands.
Finally, the integration of the recently acquired Dolce brand has been highly effective. Feedback from Dolce owners has been great as they have already -- as they are already seeing market share in margin improvements from our global marketing and sourcing leverage. The acquisition is outperforming our expectations. As a matter of fact, we have several Dolce prospects in our current pipeline.
Now turning to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, which had a great quarter posting strong rental transactions and organic adjusted EBITDA growth. These great results reflect our leadership positions in managed rental, vacation rental and timeshare exchange. We control the calendar and inventory for over 110,000 vacation properties and provide products and services to over 5 million families around the world. The range and quality of the products and services that we provide to guests, property owners and affiliates sets us apart in the industry.
We have traditionally spoken about this segment in terms of 2 business lines, timeshare exchange and professionally managed vacation rentals. However, as we look at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals and consider the many opportunities we have to share core competencies, business enhancements and inventory across our brands, we are increasingly thinking about this business unit more simply as the world's largest provider of professionally managed unique vacation accommodations, anything from cottages to castles to timeshare resorts. To better reflect this perspective and to focus our teams on a cohesive growth strategy that harnesses the power of the extensive inventory available through our network and the core competencies of our teams, we are changing the name of this segment to Wyndham Destination Network effective January 1. There will be no change to our customer experience or consumer facing brands such as RCI, Landal GreenParks, Hoseasons and Novasol, many of which have built customer loyalty for decades in their markets. We are teamed this up now to optimally position this business unit for future growth by focusing our strength across our family of brands.
The overarching strategy of Wyndham Destination Network is to provide the right vacation to the right customer at the right time by leveraging our exclusive access to unique high-quality vacation accommodations. Either this strategy has our strong service commitment, our expertise in analytics and revenue management, our ability to personalize the consumer experience, our product distribution capabilities and our deep market knowledge.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had an outstanding third quarter. Sales were robust across the system, and we've never been more excited to be in the timeshare business. A recent third-party study show that the $675 billion U.S.  Leisure travel market is expected to grow at a 4% CAGR over the next 10 years. That's approximately $30 billion of additional spend each year. Millenials and baby boomers represent the largest growth opportunities. Boomers are still traveling frequently, representing approximately 80% of the U.S. leisure travel spend with an average of 4 to 5 trips per year. Millenials are rapidly becoming a force in travel with approximately 2/3 indicating that it is an important part of their life. A majority of millenials, 6 out of 10, would rather spend money on experiences, which we see squarely in the vacation ownership value proposition. These tends --  these trends create attractive opportunities for us to continue VOI sales growth for many years, and we are well positioned to capture these opportunities. Over the past 12 months, we've opened new sales centers in fantastic locations like New York City, St. Thomas in the  Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Southern California, Colorado and Las Vegas. Many of these sales centers will be primarily committed to driving new owner growth. Adding new members has been and will continue to be a priority for this business. In addition to the new sales centers, look for us to expand our network of alliance partners. We're exploring nontraditional partnerships that will enable us to reach a new swath of potential owners. For example, we just signed a new alliance with Norwegian Cruise Line. This will enable our owners to enjoy unique cruise experiences and will give Norwegian's passengers the opportunity to experience our resorts. This builds upon a great program we already have in place for potential new owners. Our ""land and sea vacation package""  features a stay at one of our timeshare resorts along with the cruise on Norwegian ship. We piloted this program in Southern Florida, where we have a number of Wyndham vacation ownership properties in close proximity to Port Miami. Guests enjoy a 3- to 4-night cruise on the Norwegian sky alongside a 2- to 3-night stay at a nearby WVO resort, which includes a sales tour.
Based on positive results, we're exploring a variety of joint marketing efforts in several Norwegian port cities, where we too have a presence, such as New Orleans, Hawaii and the Port Canaveral area. We're excited about our alliance with Norwegian, especially given our long history of successfully  partnering with other hospitality companies for mutual growth. We are also exploring ways to better target new owners who are staying at our resorts, including friends and family of existing owners, renters and nonaffiliated owners who will exchange for one of our intervals. There is no better customer than one who is already enjoying our product.
To conclude, the opportunities across our businesses are robust. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to -- for details on the quarter results."
31063165,311922435,882394,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2015",2015-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter is always our most important quarter of the year as it generally produces around 1/3 of our EBITDA. So I'm particularly pleased to report that our business units achieved strong results. Adjuste",1796,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter is always our most important quarter of the year as it generally produces around 1/3 of our EBITDA. So I'm particularly pleased to report that our business units achieved strong results. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS increased 7% and 17%, respectively on a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and a divestiture.
Compared to the third quarter of 2014, FX translation reduced revenues by $58 million and adjusted EBITDA by $17 million company wide. We exceeded our EPS guidance by $0.10, reflecting better-than-expected operating results, particularly at Vacation Ownership, a lower-than-anticipated tax rate and share repurchases.
In the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $170 million contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count through the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30 was $660 million compared with $750 million for the first 9 months of 2014, primarily reflecting the timing of inventory spend, CapEx and some working capital.
We expect fourth quarter inventory purchases to be significantly under last year's fourth quarter spend.
We still expect to deliver free cash flow in the neighborhood of $800 million despite $40 million in foreign exchange headwinds. As you know, there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or even any given year, so we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than a precise figure.
Reported results for the quarter reflected several items excluded from our adjusted measures. We spent $8 million to close 2 call centers and streamline operations in our business units. We expect these moves provide positive financial and operational return in the near future. We recorded a $7 million writeoff of Hotel Group IT projects that are now obsolete as we move to our new property management in central reservation systems in the cloud. In addition, we took a $14 million charge associated with the termination of an underperforming contract at our Hotel Group.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. Our Hotel Group had a solid third quarter following a strong first half of the year. On an apples-to-apples basis, which excludes the effective currency, the increased rate on the interest segment licensing fee that the Hotel Group receives, a benefit from resigning a third-party co-branded credit card agreement in 2014 and the Dolce acquisition, revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased 4%. This is in line with our expectations and reflects higher marketing spend and operating expenses associated with the PMS and CRS implementations. As I mentioned, the business recently streamlined operations, and we expect the savings from these moves will largely offset implementation costs starting in the fourth quarter.
Same-store domestic RevPAR continued to perform well, increasing 5.1% with Super 8 beating the industry and Days Inn brand performing in line. Our midscale segment also posted growth consistent with the industry with the Wingate, Hawthorn and Ramada brands showing growth of greater than 7%. All of this despite seeing a drag on our RevPAR growth due to weakness in the oil-producing states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
Now to put this into perspective, RevPAR in the non-oil-producing states grew around 6%, whereas RevPAR in the oil-producing states was actually down 3%. We are especially pleased with the performance of our managed portfolio, which posted a 14% increase in RevPAR year-over-year on a same-store basis. System-wide RevPAR was flat largely due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange, lower demand in oil-producing regions and continued unit growth of lower RevPAR in hotels in China. If we do exclude China effect and the -- and put our results in constant currency, global RevPAR actually would have grown 4.4%. Overall system size was up 2.5%. Our development pipeline has increased 5% sequentially, and we're on track to hit our annual growth target of 3% to 5%, albeit at the lower end of the range.
Our Exchange & Rental segment continued to perform well. Note that adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2014 included an $18 million contribution from Canvas Holidays, a U.K.-based camping brand, which we sold late in 2014. Remember that while Canvas historically contributed significant positive EBITDA in the third quarter, this was largely offset by negative EBITDA in other quarters.
On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions in the Canvas Holidays divestiture, revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. Results primarily reflect strong peak summer growth in our global Vacation Rental brands including North America.
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 1.5% attributable to new member growth in the Americas. Exchange revenue per member was flat as pricing increases offset the growth and lower transacting club members.
Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divestiture. That increase reflects a 5.8% increase in transaction volume and a 1.7% increase in the average net price per rental.
Transaction growth occurred in all significant brands and regions. Both pricing and transaction volume were aided by our dynamic pricing initiatives.
Results were particularly strong in our Vacation Ownership business. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 8%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a currency neutral basis, which includes a $4 million increase in the licensing fee paid to the Hotel Group. Excluding this fee increase, currency neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 11%, primarily reflecting strong improvements in gross VOI sales.
In constant currency, gross VOI sales were up 12% albeit from a low base in the third quarter of 2014, reflecting a 10.6% increase in VPG and a 0.9% increase in tour flow. Sales in VPG benefited from a favorable product mix resulting in higher yields and transaction sizes.
Now while we're delighted by our VPG results for the quarter, please keep in mind that this metric can move around and should be viewed in the overall context of the business. Our operating focus is to drive top line VOI sales growth, which will lead to EBITDA growth. The provision for loan loss was $78 million compared to $70 million in the third quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting higher sales volume in the quarter.
In the quarter, we completed another WAAM Just-in-Time transaction involving the sale of existing inventory to a third party for completion. Now there are different structures to these WAAM deals. In this particular case, we sold land and work in progress in St. Thomas for $65 million in cash. Our partner will finish the development and deliver the product to us on a just-in-time basis. This type of WAAM deal has the effect of accelerating the cash flow with timeshare development by one monetizing inventory in the balance sheet and then reducing the immediate cash outflow for a timeshare development. While the accounting treatment takes it out of the definition of free cash flow as the dollars received run through financing activity rather than cash from operations, it does increase our total of available cash this year.
We closed our third securitization of the year the $300 million Sierra 2015-3 on October 21. We achieved 2.69% coupon with an 89% advance rate. And from a corporate perspective, we issued a 10-year $350 million bond with a 5.1% coupon on September 10. The funds were used to repay our short-term borrowings. We are once again pleased to be able to access the long-term debt markets at such favorable rates.
Finally, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.06 to $5.09 for the full year, and diluted share count goes to 119.4 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our third quarter share repurchase activity. We are adjusting our interest expense, D&A and tax rate guidance, which again is posted on the website.
We are also fine-tuning our driver guidance as follows. In the Hotel Group, we now expect that 2015 global RevPAR will increase 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis or be flat, including the impact of foreign exchange translation.
Domestic RevPAR is expected to be -- to increase 5% to 6%.  Our new guidance reflects the impact of updated FX translation effects, coupled with lower demand in the oil-producing regions and higher international growth. As noted earlier, we expect net room growth to be at the low end of our 3% to 5% guidance range as we continue to focus on hotels that meet our quality standards.
We're maintaining our exchange in rentals driver guidance but acknowledged that Vacation Rental transactions may modestly exceed the range and exchange revenue per member may fall slightly below the range due to foreign exchange translation.
For Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we expect to be at the high end if not slightly above our VPG range and consistent with our update last quarter, we believe we will be at the lower end of the 1% to 3% tour flow range.
Total company as well as business unit revenues and adjusted EBITDA guidance all remain unchanged. And note that foreign exchange translation created an additional $8 million headwind since our last guidance compared with 2014 results. The total year-over-year translation headwind is now estimated to be $46 million. Given the increased translation headwind, we are currently more comfortable with adjusted EBITDA estimates slightly below the midpoint of our $1,285,000,000  to $1,315,000,000 range.
For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earning per share of $0.94 to $0.97. In Exchange & Rentals, note that the now divested Canvas Holidays business had a $6 million EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect interest expense in the fourth quarter of approximately $34 million, reflecting the recent bond offering. And finally, remember that we don't assume future repurchases in our EPS guidance.
As you saw from the press release, we expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth in line with our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8%. While our guidance always excludes prospective share repurchase, it's important to note that we expect the application of our considerable free cash flow either through M&A or share repurchase to result in earnings per share compounded growth in the mid-teens over the next 5 years. We'll provide full 2016 guidance including company revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow guidance as well as business units, revenue, EBITDA and driver guidance on our February call once we have completed our budgeting process.
To close, we are very pleased with the quarter and are looking forward to continued progress in the remainder of the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Steve?"

Joe, well, with respect to EPG, the -- you asked us several questions the mix between new owners and upgrade was pretty similar to what we had last quarter, I believe. I don't think there's much change in that. The product mix, we do have new sales offices that have opened, some of which will have the potential to drive a slightly higher VPG, but as you noted at the beginning of the call, the comparisons here were fairly easy comparisons. VPG was down 5% last year in the third quarter, we're up about 10% this year. So really on a -- if you look at it on a normalized basis, we probably would have been up 3% or 4%, which is still really good and the guys did a fantastic job in the timeshare business adjusting and adapting to some of the changes they've made with their marketing. But I would not expect to see a 10% VPG increase going forward. And also as we noted in our comments, and I'll just make this and then I'll let you follow up with any other questions, really, the key driver, it's not a driver, but the key thing to look at here is gross VOI sales. As VPG can be up or down in any quarter as we've proven over the last couple of years, but the important thing is we drive VOI sales growth and continue to add new members to our base. And those are 2 things that we're very focused on and the team is positioned to deliver on well."

Just following up on Joe's question on VPG showing significant strength. Would you say that this business is maybe more idiosyncratic than any of your other businesses meaning RevPAR of Vacation Rentals can be impacted by industry and macro trends? Admittedly, you guys do a great job on both of those, but they're a little bit more industry and macro linked. While timeshare maybe is more function of your own product and marketing programs, is that how you think about it? Second question is, how should we start to think about FX? Because it is starting to move the numbers a little bit. Should we start to mark-to-market? Are you going to start to hedge? What currencies are you exposed to? And then, the final question just on free cash flow generation. It seems like that -- you are desired to maybe not give that answer today could also be a function of some of the opportunities you're seeing out there to do sort of deferred CapEx program, similar to the one you just discussed this morning, where an outside investor is taking over an asset, you've sold some of that inventory to them. Is that part of the discussion? Is that heating up more? Are you seeing more opportunities there? So sorry for the 3 questions, but there they are."

I love your description of the timeshare business because that is something that we've been saying for a long time in different words, and I think you just captured it. This business is very much a business that's impacted by good management, and it's a business that does not have natural demand drivers. We create the demand through our marketing efforts to bring people in to learn more about our product and then hopefully buy timeshares. So yes, it does tend to march to its own drum beat, but it is a very management-intensive business from a performance standpoint. It can be affected by good changes, and I think that's what we see over the last year. When you look at the end of the year, you'll see great performance in this business, but for a month -- for a quarter, we saw some dip in VPG. We weren't concerned and we told people that there was a lot of noise out there, but the fact is we felt very good with the changes that the team at the Vacation Ownership group were making as usual. As they always do, they've executed those changes very well, and we're beginning to see the benefit of that. So yes, to answer to your first question with the simple answer, the answer is, yes. With respect to -- I'll let Tom talk about the FX question but just jumping to the free cash flow, I don't know that I would say we're seeing a lot of different opportunities. There have always been opportunities. And if you look at what we have lined up right now in these kind of asset-light relationships, we have like 1.5 years worth or more of inventory that is lined up with these transactions, and we'll continue to line them up because they're good from a free cash flow basis. That is not that end of itself and the $65 million that Tom spoke to for cash flow that's coming in but it actually doesn't flow through free cash flow that is not impacting our lack of visibility into 2016 free cash flow. It really is just simply we have to go through the budget process, we have to go through the process of CapEx request from all the business units, understand what the IRR or ROI is for those opportunities and make decisions, because we talk a lot about M&A and buying back stock. But still, if we can invest in the business in a very accretive IOR manner, we will do that. And so we encourage our business units to come up with ideas, present them to us and if they hit the mark, we'll invest more in those opportunities. And I'm not saying we have them lined up right now, I'm just saying that's part of the process, as a company, we have to go through. And we don't want to shortcut that process just to be able to say what we think it's going to look like in 2016 on this call. So that's the way I can answer that. And Tom, you want to talk about currencies [ph]?"

And when we think about our currency exposure, our largest currency exposures are the euro, the Danish kroner, which is kind of linked to the euro and pound sterling and then the Australian dollar is also a very important currency. I think if you were to take those 4 currencies, it's probably worth about 80% of our foreign exchange exposure. And so, we -- when the onslaught of 2015 started and the dollar strengthened, we thought, okay, is there anything we can do more on hedging but -- and these are not economic activities. They are -- the translation effect that we talk about is taking on a piece of paper the amount of money, the amount of euros that you earned and calculating at a specific translation rate, the amount of dollars that that's equivalent to. And so it's not economic, it doesn't allow us to do the type of hedging where we can get to hedge accounting. And so we really looked at it, we really pushed it because we would love nothing more than to mitigate this effect. But we judged, Steve and I judged that, that volatility that we would create and not getting hedge accounting was not worth the activity. And we made that decision at the beginning of the year. So our hope is that the dollar doesn't -- from our seats, our professional seats that the dollar doesn't strengthen again to the same magnitude as it did in 2015 against those baskets of currencies. But we're not quite sure that it won't. And so our ability to mitigate that, I would say, given the accounting rules is pretty limited. So your guess is as good as mine on where the dollar goes against these major currencies, but this year was a historically significant year and the strengthening of the dollar against those currencies and we hope there won't be a recurrence next year. Is there anything else [indiscernible]."

So Chris, look -- when -- the provision, as I mentioned in my earlier comments is really a number that gets derived by our evaluation of our balance sheet reserve against outstanding receivables. That number has been relatively consistent in the past few quarters. It leads me to believe that the balance sheet reserve has reached a point -- a reasonable point of stability, and that, that number isn't expected to materially change in one direction or another. So the provision is the additive factor to that reserve. So we'll sit at the end of a quarter and judge where the reserve needs to be and look at where the reserve is, consider what the faults have taken place in the quarter and the provision will be the output of that. And so, it's my guess that is if the reserve is going to be relatively stable that the provision should be relatively stable as well, because there is no discernible change in credit quality of our buyers. Absolutely not. We're consistent. Our FICO target remains consistent. And so, because we expected THAT the reserve is going to be relatively constant, we don't expect the fault range to change materially and our credit quality is not changing of our buyers. It's -- I would expect that the provision would be in a period of relatively stable trend because we have reached that point. Should any of those factors change meaning should defaults decrease in our reserve requirement on our balance sheet come down then we will have -- we could provide for less.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered strong results in the third quarter with currency neutral adjusted EBITDA and EPS growth of 7% and 17%, respectively on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding acquisitions and a divestiture. These results reflect continued strength and progress across all of our businesses.
In our Hotel Group, results were driven by strong domestic RevPAR. In Exchange & Rentals, we had a big increase in rental transaction volume. And in Vacation Ownership, we posted double-digit growth, VOI sales growth.
Capital allocation continue to benefit shareholders as well driving a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average shares outstanding and contributing to a rise in our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year.
Now let me provide some operating perspective for each of the businesses starting with the Wyndham Hotel Group. Our umbrella marketing campaign focusing on Wyndham Rewards and featuring the Wyndham Rewards wizard has been a success. The campaign has provided a great boost to our revamped rewards program with members stays up over 7%. We have also added over 2.1 million new members and nearly 0.5 million previously inactive members reactivated and stayed with us again. We have also seen record franchisee engagement with significant increases in on-property enrollments. This is a great start for our long-term strategy to grow our loyalty program.
The new program is earning accolades from guests and industry experts alike. Members are delighted by the ease of the program, which allows them to earn and redeem points faster than any other loyalty program. In U.S. News & World Report recently named Wyndham Rewards one of the top programs in the hotel industry. Of course, all of this is driven by the value of our brands, the brand quality -- and brand quality remains a primary focus at Wyndham Hotel Group.
We understand the power and reach of our unique portfolio of 13 brands and see a great opportunity to offer quests and franchise owners a variety of clearly defined and compelling experiences not only in our upscale and midscale brands but in our economy brands as well. Most importantly, we -- by clearly defining and differentiating our brands, we can better grow our system by offering owners a clear value proposition that drives a higher RevPAR for them.
On the technology front, the upgrade of our property management and central reservation systems are well underway. As a reminder, we have partnered with technology best-in-class providers, such as Sabre to help ensure our franchisees around the world are utilizing the most technologically advanced systems both now and into the future. This will help to maximize the value proposition of our family of brands. Hotels within our portfolio will be able to manage their pricing and inventory more effectively, connect to a wider range of global distribution partners and access a fully integrated customer profile that is tied into our Wyndham Rewards program.
After successful pilots this summer and spring, we began the rollout of our -- this month of the property management system and are well on our way toward achieving full implementation by the end of 2016.
We're also well into the planning for the migration of the Wyndham Hotel Group's 4 central reservation systems into 1 Sabre system and will begin moving our first brand to the new system later this quarter.
As part of our effort to expand our distribution platform, we recently signed a global deal with TripAdvisor instant booking. As one of the first hotel companies to feature their ratings on our brand websites, we've had a long-standing relationship with TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor instant booking will make it even easier for potential customers to reach and directly book stays across our brands.
Finally, the integration of the recently acquired Dolce brand has been highly effective. Feedback from Dolce owners has been great as they have already -- as they are already seeing market share in margin improvements from our global marketing and sourcing leverage. The acquisition is outperforming our expectations. As a matter of fact, we have several Dolce prospects in our current pipeline.
Now turning to Wyndham Exchange & Rentals, which had a great quarter posting strong rental transactions and organic adjusted EBITDA growth. These great results reflect our leadership positions in managed rental, vacation rental and timeshare exchange. We control the calendar and inventory for over 110,000 vacation properties and provide products and services to over 5 million families around the world. The range and quality of the products and services that we provide to guests, property owners and affiliates sets us apart in the industry.
We have traditionally spoken about this segment in terms of 2 business lines, timeshare exchange and professionally managed vacation rentals. However, as we look at Wyndham Exchange & Rentals and consider the many opportunities we have to share core competencies, business enhancements and inventory across our brands, we are increasingly thinking about this business unit more simply as the world's largest provider of professionally managed unique vacation accommodations, anything from cottages to castles to timeshare resorts. To better reflect this perspective and to focus our teams on a cohesive growth strategy that harnesses the power of the extensive inventory available through our network and the core competencies of our teams, we are changing the name of this segment to Wyndham Destination Network effective January 1. There will be no change to our customer experience or consumer facing brands such as RCI, Landal GreenParks, Hoseasons and Novasol, many of which have built customer loyalty for decades in their markets. We are teamed this up now to optimally position this business unit for future growth by focusing our strength across our family of brands.
The overarching strategy of Wyndham Destination Network is to provide the right vacation to the right customer at the right time by leveraging our exclusive access to unique high-quality vacation accommodations. Either this strategy has our strong service commitment, our expertise in analytics and revenue management, our ability to personalize the consumer experience, our product distribution capabilities and our deep market knowledge.
Now moving on to Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which had an outstanding third quarter. Sales were robust across the system, and we've never been more excited to be in the timeshare business. A recent third-party study show that the $675 billion U.S.  Leisure travel market is expected to grow at a 4% CAGR over the next 10 years. That's approximately $30 billion of additional spend each year. Millenials and baby boomers represent the largest growth opportunities. Boomers are still traveling frequently, representing approximately 80% of the U.S. leisure travel spend with an average of 4 to 5 trips per year. Millenials are rapidly becoming a force in travel with approximately 2/3 indicating that it is an important part of their life. A majority of millenials, 6 out of 10, would rather spend money on experiences, which we see squarely in the vacation ownership value proposition. These tends --  these trends create attractive opportunities for us to continue VOI sales growth for many years, and we are well positioned to capture these opportunities. Over the past 12 months, we've opened new sales centers in fantastic locations like New York City, St. Thomas in the  Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Southern California, Colorado and Las Vegas. Many of these sales centers will be primarily committed to driving new owner growth. Adding new members has been and will continue to be a priority for this business. In addition to the new sales centers, look for us to expand our network of alliance partners. We're exploring nontraditional partnerships that will enable us to reach a new swath of potential owners. For example, we just signed a new alliance with Norwegian Cruise Line. This will enable our owners to enjoy unique cruise experiences and will give Norwegian's passengers the opportunity to experience our resorts. This builds upon a great program we already have in place for potential new owners. Our ""land and sea vacation package""  features a stay at one of our timeshare resorts along with the cruise on Norwegian ship. We piloted this program in Southern Florida, where we have a number of Wyndham vacation ownership properties in close proximity to Port Miami. Guests enjoy a 3- to 4-night cruise on the Norwegian sky alongside a 2- to 3-night stay at a nearby WVO resort, which includes a sales tour.
Based on positive results, we're exploring a variety of joint marketing efforts in several Norwegian port cities, where we too have a presence, such as New Orleans, Hawaii and the Port Canaveral area. We're excited about our alliance with Norwegian, especially given our long history of successfully  partnering with other hospitality companies for mutual growth. We are also exploring ways to better target new owners who are staying at our resorts, including friends and family of existing owners, renters and nonaffiliated owners who will exchange for one of our intervals. There is no better customer than one who is already enjoying our product.
To conclude, the opportunities across our businesses are robust. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to -- for details on the quarter results."
31063165,311922435,882990,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2015",2015-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Travel + Leisure Co.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter is always our most important quarter of the year as it generally produces around 1/3 of our EBITDA. So I'm particularly pleased to report that our business units achieved strong results. Adjuste",1796,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter is always our most important quarter of the year as it generally produces around 1/3 of our EBITDA. So I'm particularly pleased to report that our business units achieved strong results. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS increased 7% and 17%, respectively on a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and a divestiture.
Compared to the third quarter of 2014, FX translation reduced revenues by $58 million and adjusted EBITDA by $17 million company wide. We exceeded our EPS guidance by $0.10, reflecting better-than-expected operating results, particularly at Vacation Ownership, a lower-than-anticipated tax rate and share repurchases.
In the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $170 million contributing to a 6% year-over-year decrease in our weighted average diluted share count through the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow for the 9 months ended September 30 was $660 million compared with $750 million for the first 9 months of 2014, primarily reflecting the timing of inventory spend, CapEx and some working capital.
We expect fourth quarter inventory purchases to be significantly under last year's fourth quarter spend.
We still expect to deliver free cash flow in the neighborhood of $800 million despite $40 million in foreign exchange headwinds. As you know, there can be variability in cash flow in any given quarter or even any given year, so we view $800 million as a neighborhood target rather than a precise figure.
Reported results for the quarter reflected several items excluded from our adjusted measures. We spent $8 million to close 2 call centers and streamline operations in our business units. We expect these moves provide positive financial and operational return in the near future. We recorded a $7 million writeoff of Hotel Group IT projects that are now obsolete as we move to our new property management in central reservation systems in the cloud. In addition, we took a $14 million charge associated with the termination of an underperforming contract at our Hotel Group.
Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our business units. Our Hotel Group had a solid third quarter following a strong first half of the year. On an apples-to-apples basis, which excludes the effective currency, the increased rate on the interest segment licensing fee that the Hotel Group receives, a benefit from resigning a third-party co-branded credit card agreement in 2014 and the Dolce acquisition, revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased 4%. This is in line with our expectations and reflects higher marketing spend and operating expenses associated with the PMS and CRS implementations. As I mentioned, the business recently streamlined operations, and we expect the savings from these moves will largely offset implementation costs starting in the fourth quarter.
Same-store domestic RevPAR continued to perform well, increasing 5.1% with Super 8 beating the industry and Days Inn brand performing in line. Our midscale segment also posted growth consistent with the industry with the Wingate, Hawthorn and Ramada brands showing growth of greater than 7%. All of this despite seeing a drag on our RevPAR growth due to weakness in the oil-producing states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
Now to put this into perspective, RevPAR in the non-oil-producing states grew around 6%, whereas RevPAR in the oil-producing states was actually down 3%. We are especially pleased with the performance of our managed portfolio, which posted a 14% increase in RevPAR year-over-year on a same-store basis. System-wide RevPAR was flat largely due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange, lower demand in oil-producing regions and continued unit growth of lower RevPAR in hotels in China. If we do exclude China effect and the -- and put our results in constant currency, global RevPAR actually would have grown 4.4%. Overall system size was up 2.5%. Our development pipeline has increased 5% sequentially, and we're on track to hit our annual growth target of 3% to 5%, albeit at the lower end of the range.
Our Exchange & Rental segment continued to perform well. Note that adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2014 included an $18 million contribution from Canvas Holidays, a U.K.-based camping brand, which we sold late in 2014. Remember that while Canvas historically contributed significant positive EBITDA in the third quarter, this was largely offset by negative EBITDA in other quarters.
On a currency neutral basis and excluding acquisitions in the Canvas Holidays divestiture, revenues increased 6% and adjusted EBITDA increased 5%. Results primarily reflect strong peak summer growth in our global Vacation Rental brands including North America.
At RCI, exchange revenues increased 1% in constant currency. The average number of members increased 1.5% attributable to new member growth in the Americas. Exchange revenue per member was flat as pricing increases offset the growth and lower transacting club members.
Vacation Rentals revenue for the quarter were up 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions in the Canvas divestiture. That increase reflects a 5.8% increase in transaction volume and a 1.7% increase in the average net price per rental.
Transaction growth occurred in all significant brands and regions. Both pricing and transaction volume were aided by our dynamic pricing initiatives.
Results were particularly strong in our Vacation Ownership business. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 8%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a currency neutral basis, which includes a $4 million increase in the licensing fee paid to the Hotel Group. Excluding this fee increase, currency neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 11%, primarily reflecting strong improvements in gross VOI sales.
In constant currency, gross VOI sales were up 12% albeit from a low base in the third quarter of 2014, reflecting a 10.6% increase in VPG and a 0.9% increase in tour flow. Sales in VPG benefited from a favorable product mix resulting in higher yields and transaction sizes.
Now while we're delighted by our VPG results for the quarter, please keep in mind that this metric can move around and should be viewed in the overall context of the business. Our operating focus is to drive top line VOI sales growth, which will lead to EBITDA growth. The provision for loan loss was $78 million compared to $70 million in the third quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting higher sales volume in the quarter.
In the quarter, we completed another WAAM Just-in-Time transaction involving the sale of existing inventory to a third party for completion. Now there are different structures to these WAAM deals. In this particular case, we sold land and work in progress in St. Thomas for $65 million in cash. Our partner will finish the development and deliver the product to us on a just-in-time basis. This type of WAAM deal has the effect of accelerating the cash flow with timeshare development by one monetizing inventory in the balance sheet and then reducing the immediate cash outflow for a timeshare development. While the accounting treatment takes it out of the definition of free cash flow as the dollars received run through financing activity rather than cash from operations, it does increase our total of available cash this year.
We closed our third securitization of the year the $300 million Sierra 2015-3 on October 21. We achieved 2.69% coupon with an 89% advance rate. And from a corporate perspective, we issued a 10-year $350 million bond with a 5.1% coupon on September 10. The funds were used to repay our short-term borrowings. We are once again pleased to be able to access the long-term debt markets at such favorable rates.
Finally, let's turn to guidance, which will be posted on the website after the call. As you saw from the press release, we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $5.06 to $5.09 for the full year, and diluted share count goes to 119.4 million shares, reflecting the benefit of our third quarter share repurchase activity. We are adjusting our interest expense, D&A and tax rate guidance, which again is posted on the website.
We are also fine-tuning our driver guidance as follows. In the Hotel Group, we now expect that 2015 global RevPAR will increase 3% to 4% on a constant currency basis or be flat, including the impact of foreign exchange translation.
Domestic RevPAR is expected to be -- to increase 5% to 6%.  Our new guidance reflects the impact of updated FX translation effects, coupled with lower demand in the oil-producing regions and higher international growth. As noted earlier, we expect net room growth to be at the low end of our 3% to 5% guidance range as we continue to focus on hotels that meet our quality standards.
We're maintaining our exchange in rentals driver guidance but acknowledged that Vacation Rental transactions may modestly exceed the range and exchange revenue per member may fall slightly below the range due to foreign exchange translation.
For Wyndham Vacation Ownership, we expect to be at the high end if not slightly above our VPG range and consistent with our update last quarter, we believe we will be at the lower end of the 1% to 3% tour flow range.
Total company as well as business unit revenues and adjusted EBITDA guidance all remain unchanged. And note that foreign exchange translation created an additional $8 million headwind since our last guidance compared with 2014 results. The total year-over-year translation headwind is now estimated to be $46 million. Given the increased translation headwind, we are currently more comfortable with adjusted EBITDA estimates slightly below the midpoint of our $1,285,000,000  to $1,315,000,000 range.
For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted diluted earning per share of $0.94 to $0.97. In Exchange & Rentals, note that the now divested Canvas Holidays business had a $6 million EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect interest expense in the fourth quarter of approximately $34 million, reflecting the recent bond offering. And finally, remember that we don't assume future repurchases in our EPS guidance.
As you saw from the press release, we expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA growth in line with our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8%. While our guidance always excludes prospective share repurchase, it's important to note that we expect the application of our considerable free cash flow either through M&A or share repurchase to result in earnings per share compounded growth in the mid-teens over the next 5 years. We'll provide full 2016 guidance including company revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow guidance as well as business units, revenue, EBITDA and driver guidance on our February call once we have completed our budgeting process.
To close, we are very pleased with the quarter and are looking forward to continued progress in the remainder of the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Steve?"

Joe, well, with respect to EPG, the -- you asked us several questions the mix between new owners and upgrade was pretty similar to what we had last quarter, I believe. I don't think there's much change in that. The product mix, we do have new sales offices that have opened, some of which will have the potential to drive a slightly higher VPG, but as you noted at the beginning of the call, the comparisons here were fairly easy comparisons. VPG was down 5% last year in the third quarter, we're up about 10% this year. So really on a -- if you look at it on a normalized basis, we probably would have been up 3% or 4%, which is still really good and the guys did a fantastic job in the timeshare business adjusting and adapting to some of the changes they've made with their marketing. But I would not expect to see a 10% VPG increase going forward. And also as we noted in our comments, and I'll just make this and then I'll let you follow up with any other questions, really, the key driver, it's not a driver, but the key thing to look at here is gross VOI sales. As VPG can be up or down in any quarter as we've proven over the last couple of years, but the important thing is we drive VOI sales growth and continue to add new members to our base. And those are 2 things that we're very focused on and the team is positioned to deliver on well."

Just following up on Joe's question on VPG showing significant strength. Would you say that this business is maybe more idiosyncratic than any of your other businesses meaning RevPAR of Vacation Rentals can be impacted by industry and macro trends? Admittedly, you guys do a great job on both of those, but they're a little bit more industry and macro linked. While timeshare maybe is more function of your own product and marketing programs, is that how you think about it? Second question is, how should we start to think about FX? Because it is starting to move the numbers a little bit. Should we start to mark-to-market? Are you going to start to hedge? What currencies are you exposed to? And then, the final question just on free cash flow generation. It seems like that -- you are desired to maybe not give that answer today could also be a function of some of the opportunities you're seeing out there to do sort of deferred CapEx program, similar to the one you just discussed this morning, where an outside investor is taking over an asset, you've sold some of that inventory to them. Is that part of the discussion? Is that heating up more? Are you seeing more opportunities there? So sorry for the 3 questions, but there they are."

I love your description of the timeshare business because that is something that we've been saying for a long time in different words, and I think you just captured it. This business is very much a business that's impacted by good management, and it's a business that does not have natural demand drivers. We create the demand through our marketing efforts to bring people in to learn more about our product and then hopefully buy timeshares. So yes, it does tend to march to its own drum beat, but it is a very management-intensive business from a performance standpoint. It can be affected by good changes, and I think that's what we see over the last year. When you look at the end of the year, you'll see great performance in this business, but for a month -- for a quarter, we saw some dip in VPG. We weren't concerned and we told people that there was a lot of noise out there, but the fact is we felt very good with the changes that the team at the Vacation Ownership group were making as usual. As they always do, they've executed those changes very well, and we're beginning to see the benefit of that. So yes, to answer to your first question with the simple answer, the answer is, yes. With respect to -- I'll let Tom talk about the FX question but just jumping to the free cash flow, I don't know that I would say we're seeing a lot of different opportunities. There have always been opportunities. And if you look at what we have lined up right now in these kind of asset-light relationships, we have like 1.5 years worth or more of inventory that is lined up with these transactions, and we'll continue to line them up because they're good from a free cash flow basis. That is not that end of itself and the $65 million that Tom spoke to for cash flow that's coming in but it actually doesn't flow through free cash flow that is not impacting our lack of visibility into 2016 free cash flow. It really is just simply we have to go through the budget process, we have to go through the process of CapEx request from all the business units, understand what the IRR or ROI is for those opportunities and make decisions, because we talk a lot about M&A and buying back stock. But still, if we can invest in the business in a very accretive IOR manner, we will do that. And so we encourage our business units to come up with ideas, present them to us and if they hit the mark, we'll invest more in those opportunities. And I'm not saying we have them lined up right now, I'm just saying that's part of the process, as a company, we have to go through. And we don't want to shortcut that process just to be able to say what we think it's going to look like in 2016 on this call. So that's the way I can answer that. And Tom, you want to talk about currencies [ph]?"

And when we think about our currency exposure, our largest currency exposures are the euro, the Danish kroner, which is kind of linked to the euro and pound sterling and then the Australian dollar is also a very important currency. I think if you were to take those 4 currencies, it's probably worth about 80% of our foreign exchange exposure. And so, we -- when the onslaught of 2015 started and the dollar strengthened, we thought, okay, is there anything we can do more on hedging but -- and these are not economic activities. They are -- the translation effect that we talk about is taking on a piece of paper the amount of money, the amount of euros that you earned and calculating at a specific translation rate, the amount of dollars that that's equivalent to. And so it's not economic, it doesn't allow us to do the type of hedging where we can get to hedge accounting. And so we really looked at it, we really pushed it because we would love nothing more than to mitigate this effect. But we judged, Steve and I judged that, that volatility that we would create and not getting hedge accounting was not worth the activity. And we made that decision at the beginning of the year. So our hope is that the dollar doesn't -- from our seats, our professional seats that the dollar doesn't strengthen again to the same magnitude as it did in 2015 against those baskets of currencies. But we're not quite sure that it won't. And so our ability to mitigate that, I would say, given the accounting rules is pretty limited. So your guess is as good as mine on where the dollar goes against these major currencies, but this year was a historically significant year and the strengthening of the dollar against those currencies and we hope there won't be a recurrence next year. Is there anything else [indiscernible]."

So Chris, look -- when -- the provision, as I mentioned in my earlier comments is really a number that gets derived by our evaluation of our balance sheet reserve against outstanding receivables. That number has been relatively consistent in the past few quarters. It leads me to believe that the balance sheet reserve has reached a point -- a reasonable point of stability, and that, that number isn't expected to materially change in one direction or another. So the provision is the additive factor to that reserve. So we'll sit at the end of a quarter and judge where the reserve needs to be and look at where the reserve is, consider what the faults have taken place in the quarter and the provision will be the output of that. And so, it's my guess that is if the reserve is going to be relatively stable that the provision should be relatively stable as well, because there is no discernible change in credit quality of our buyers. Absolutely not. We're consistent. Our FICO target remains consistent. And so, because we expected THAT the reserve is going to be relatively constant, we don't expect the fault range to change materially and our credit quality is not changing of our buyers. It's -- I would expect that the provision would be in a period of relatively stable trend because we have reached that point. Should any of those factors change meaning should defaults decrease in our reserve requirement on our balance sheet come down then we will have -- we could provide for less.

So basically, in other words, will the actual EBITDA dollar amount be lower than -- potentially lower than the 6% to 8% due to foreign exchange?"

I remember last year when this quarter, we look to next year, we had an $8 million -- I think it was an $8 million EBITDA effect on foreign exchange. And then the next time we chatted with you, it was like $32 million. And so, Patrick, there's really no way of predicting given the volatility. I don't want to affirm with complete certainty only because can you tell me what the magnitude of foreign exchange movement will be in the next 3 months before we sit and take you through guidance of next year. I think that's going to be challenging."

We don't see a downturn in the cycle with what we're seeing right now from our franchisees relative to occupancy trends as well as what we see with rate going through. It may not be increasing at the rate it was a year ago, but we still see strong trending in the hotel sector. As you know, these  the franchise business, we're not necessarily only driven by RevPAR, room growth is very important and as we've seen historically during cycles, frankly, it's sometimes easier to sell franchises during a weak part of the cycle versus strong part of the cycle. But again, I'm not calling a turn to the cycle. Everything we see says that there is still strength in the hotel sector. And I think our results show that, if not for FX, the results would have been very, very positive for the quarter."

We're going to do deals that makes sense like Dolce, like Trip. We've done some great deals over the last few years. They don't have to be huge deals, but they're great deals for us and we're seeing the benefit of that going forward. So yes, we did during the '08 and '09 downturn we looked, we also like everybody else, we're a little shell-shocked by the relative values that were out there but also the instability of the credit market. And weren't looking to issue stock at the time to do deals because our stock was down at a huge low. So we were limited, but we did look."
