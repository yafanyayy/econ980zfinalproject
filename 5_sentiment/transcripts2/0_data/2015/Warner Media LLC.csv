Welcome to Time Warner's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full year, and the other, providing our 2015 full year business outlook. 
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. 
Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
I will now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO; who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for the Q&A session. Jeff?"
24689,281164035,759598,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. 2014 was another year of strong financial performance for our company, with solid revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. That's our sixth straight year of at least high teens adjusted EPS g",2254,"Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. 
2014 was another year of strong financial performance for our company, with solid revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. That's our sixth straight year of at least high teens adjusted EPS growth. And it's consistent with our plan to reach close to $6 in adjusted EPS in 2016 and over $8 in 2018. We also grew free cash flow by 12% to $3.5 billion, and we returned more than $6.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. 
And as we announced this morning, we anticipate another year of very good growth on adjusted EPS in 2015. We are also committed to building on our strong record of providing direct returns to shareholders, which have totaled more than $26 billion since 2008. You can see evidence of this commitment in the 10% increase in our dividend approved by our board. That's also the sixth straight year we've raised the dividend by double digits. So we expect another great year in 2015, and that's in the context of an industry where, like all of you, we see the pace of change accelerating. 
Consumers appetite for high-quality video content is increasing globally. But we're in the midst of a secular shift to on-demand consumption. At the same time, advertisers expectations for data, analytics and targeting are also increasing. These changes create new challenges for our industry, but we think they are also creating big opportunities for the producers of the very best video content. In fact, we have spent the last several years positioning ourselves to take advantage of these trends. 
In 2014, we completed our transformation into a more focused, nimble and collaborative video content company that takes better advantage of our leading brands and our global scale at Warner Bros., Turner and HBO. We also finished the transition to a new generation of CEOs at each of our divisions. And we continue to invest even more in the very best content. In 2014, we invested $14.5 billion in programming, production and marketing. That's up about $3 billion compared to just 5 years earlier. And we expect that to grow to around $19 billion a year over the next several years. That investment is going into increased original programming at HBO and Turner, into high-profile sports like the NBA, NCAA March Madness and Major League Baseball, and also into the biggest film and TV franchises at Warner's. And those investments will continue to pay dividends in the years to come, as the demand for high-quality on-demand video content grows. 
We also continued to invest resources in improving the user experience in order to increase the value we're providing to our distribution partners and to consumers of multichannel television. Last year, we launched CNN GO, the most advanced multiplatform news product on the market. We expanded HBO GO to additional platforms, including Amazon Fire, PS3 and Xbox 1. And we started to make stacking rights available for some of our biggest hits at Turner. 
At the same time, we are increasingly investing outside the traditional TV ecosystem to help ensure that consumers can access our great content wherever, whenever and on whatever device they choose, even if they don't have a conventional multichannel TV subscription. The most notable example is our HBO GP service, which we're on track to launch later this year. We think there is a big opportunity for us to reach broadband-only consumers and to reduce the friction of subscriber to HBO for multichannel subs that don't currently have the service. We look forward to sharing more details about the service closer to launch. 
But HBO's OTT product is only one element of our digital strategy. At Turner, CNN Digital grew both average monthly videos trends and mobile UNIX by more than 30% in 2014. And Turner's Bleacher Report averaged 39 million monthly unique visitors, becoming the #2 digital sports destination in the U.S. 
We have carried that momentum into 2015. All 5 of Turner's most important networks were included in DISH's TV service, making up more than 1/3 of the channels at launch. CNN and Bleacher Report were 2 of Snapshots launch partners for its Discover feature. And last month, Warner's announced that it will be launching an Xbox service in Southeast Asia in partnership with SingTel and Sony Pictures Television. That's another opportunity for Warner's to use new distribution platforms to grow its business in Asia, where it already had a significant stake in Hollywood VIP. That's a rapidly growing SVOD service in China, which recently expanded its content offering to include HBO program. 
You will also see us investing in our advertising business by rolling out advanced products that provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting they're coming to expect. We started that process last year when we began selling based on consumer behavior rather than just the traditional age and gender demographics. This year, we are going to take that 1 step further. For the first time, we will have 1 joint upfront for all of our networks and will provide our best partners the ability to buy behavior-based inventory across all of our networks and digital platforms. We started talking to our partners about this at CES last month and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Combining the reach and quality environment of TV with the analytics and targeting of digital is the Holy Grail for advertisers. And if we do that successfully, we think we can take share back from digital competitors over time. 
So clearly, there is a lot of change occurring in our industry, but we are more confident than ever in our position. That confidence stems from our belief that the very best video content is becoming more valuable to both consumers and to our advertising and distribution partners. We produced more of that great content than anybody, which was evident once again in 2014. 
It's award season, so let's start there. We received 13 Academy Award nominations this year, including a Best Picture nomination for American Sniper. In true Warner Bros. fashion, this film has been both a commercial and a critical success. After opening in select theaters on Christmas Day, it shattered records when it went live last month, including the biggest January opening ever. And last year, we also released The Hobbit, the Battle of the 5 Armies, which was the final installment of the epic trilogy by Peter Jackson. Through last week, the movie have brought in well over $900 million of the global box office, and that brings the total for the Lord of the Rings franchise to close to $6 billion. That gives Warner's 2 of the top 4 global film franchises in history, including the biggest ever in Harry Potter. 
No one manages film franchises better than Warner's and they're at the core of its film strategy going forward. Warner's has laid out the most ambitious slate in its history, which, starting in 2016, will be built around DC Comics, LEGO and The World of Harry Potter. And we couldn't be more excited and confident in the opportunity it has, not only to drive growth at the box office, but also to significantly expand its ancillary business. 
None of that should overshadow Warner's continued leadership in television production. Warner's has more than 60 series airing for the 2014 to '15 season, including the most primetime series on broadcast of any studio for the 11th time in the past 12 seasons. This season was particularly notable for Warner's mining of the DC library, which gave rise to 2 of this year's bona fide new hits: Gotham and The Flash. And The Flash is just one of 3 DC shows on the CW, with their presence helping the CW to broaden its audience and grow its ratings this season. 
DC is also a major driver of our games business, including last year's release of Lego Batman 3. That will continue in 2015 with the highly anticipated release of the final installment of the Batman Arkham Trilogy. Along with the release of Mortal Combat 10 and a new mobile game based on Game of Thrones, that should prevail Warner's games business to a record year in 2015. 
Now going back for a moment to the multiplex. 
Last week, HBO concluded a limited IMAX run for 2 episodes of its monster hit, Game of Thrones. That's HBO's most-watched series ever. It was the first television show that ever screen at an IMAX theater and that's a testament to the anticipation for Thrones upcoming fifth season, as well as to HBO's creative excellence. 
Last year, HBO received 19 primetime Emmys, including 5 , it's most-watched freshman series ever. And HBO's content superiority translated into close to 3 million additional domestic subscribers, that's its highest growth in domestic subs in over 3 decades. 
In 2015, HBO plans to raise its game again with returning heads slide True Detective, Veep, Silicon Valley's, The Leftovers. And Last Week's Tonight with John Oliver, as well as adding several new series like Westworld, which is the second HBO drama produced by Warner Bros., and The Brand, a comedy, and starring Tim Robbins and Jack Black, and followers, starring Dwayne, The Rock, Johnson. 
As we start this year, we also have a lot of momentum at Turner. In 2014, TBS, TNT and Adult Swim planneed 3 of the 10 prime spot in primetime among adults 18 to 49. TBS was the #2 ad-supported cable network in primetime among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. And TNT was home to 6 of the top 15 original series on ad-supported cable. That's more than any other network. And that included 3 new hits in The Last Ship, The Librarians and Murder in the First. That strong evidence that its emphasis on more distinct and original programming is starting to work. 
2014 was also an important year for our sports business, with Turner extending its partnership with the NBA through 2025 and kicking off its new agreement with Major League Baseball. And with water the water with sports internationally by obtaining UEFA Champions League rights in Brazil, which will cement the must-have status of our recently-acquired sports network sports and work. 
Adult Swim continued to attract the largest audiences of young adults, including the top 2 new shows among adults 18 to 34, Attack on Titan and Black Jesus. That's the type of programming that help Adult Swim to be ranked as the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among most adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 34 for the 10th consecutive year, as well as being the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 49. 
And the network it shares a channel with, Cartoon Network, is on an absolute roll. In the year where most kids networks were down double digits, Cartoon grew its audience in kids 6 to 11, and we gained momentum through the year. In the fourth quarter, Cartoon grew ratings in its key demos by solid double digits, and that's a trend that's continued into the first quarter of this year. 
Despite these successes, we know we can do better, in particular, at TBS and TNT. And we are confident that with new leadership in place and a focus on distinctive original programming, we will do better. The success of CNN is a great example of how the right management and the right programming strategy can drive growth even in the face of challenging industry trends. 
In 2014, CNN grew its prime time ratings in adults 25 to 54, while MSNBC registered double-digit declines. And CNN had an average total day monthly reach of almost 77 million total viewers, the largest cumulative audience of any cable news network. CNN took share by going deeper on the biggest stories, revamping key data points like morning and expanding its innovative lineup of original primetime series based around talent like Anthony Bourdain, Morgan Spurlock, Lisa Ling and Mike. Its original programming also helped CNN drop, by far, the youngest medium primetime audience among its cable news rivals and match its youngest on record. CNN's strong performance has continued into 2015, with its ratings in adults 25 to 54 up 70% in January compared to double-digit declines for MSNBC. And CNN will look to build on that success by further expanding its lineup of originals this year. Developing a robust slate of must-have programming is a process that takes time. But that's one of the things our company does best, and we are confident in the team at Turner that the strategy and ability to drive increased viewership across platforms as they execute on the plans they're putting in place. 
Before I turn it over to Howard, I want to emphasize that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute on the ambitious strategy and growth plans we shared with you last October. We are proud of our track record of industry-leading adjusted EPS growth and shareholder returns over the past 5 or 6 years. But 2015 is really our first full year as the new Time Warner, and we're just getting underway. We are mindful of the challenges ahead of us, but we've done a lot of work to get to the right structure, the right management and the right strategy, so that we are positioned to lead the industry and continue to deliver superior value to our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Howard."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results.

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. 
We are pleased with how we ended the year and the progress we're making on a long-term targets we discussed at our Investor Day. As we look out over the next several years, we continued to expect that solid revenue growth, attractive margin expansion and accelerating growth in adjusted OI will, on average, meet the high teens growth in adjusted EPS. 
In 2014, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 18%, our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. That's in line with our updated guidance and exceeded the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, adjusted EPS included a net benefit of $0.10 from the tax matters and programming restructuring and severance charges that we previously discussed with you. Including the additional restructuring and programming charges we took in the fourth quarter and net of intercompany eliminations, we incurred $469 million of restructuring and severance charges and $388 million of programming charges in the second half of 2014. We are expecting the restructuring actions to translate into run rate savings of close to $500 million, most of which will come in 2015. That will free up resources to invest even more in content and position us to accelerate our revenue growth in the coming years, while also continuing to expand margins. Those actions were consistent with our ongoing focus on expense management. 
Excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from both periods, total expenses increased only 3% for the year, despite our continued investments in great content. And about 100 basis points of that growth was due to the international consolidations at HBO and Warner's acquisition of Eyeworks. 
Total SG&A declined slightly for the year. We also had another strong year of cash flow, which was up 12%. Free cash flow per share was up an even more impressive 19%, benefiting from our ongoing share repurchase program. In 2014, we repurchased $5.5 billion of our shares, a significant acceleration from the prior year. Combined with $1.1 billion in dividends, we returned $6.6 billion to shareholders during the year. And as evidenced by the dividend increase we announced this morning, we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders going forward. So we had another good year of financial performance in 2014 and returned a substantial amount of capital to shareholders, while also making great progress in positioning the company for strong growth in the years to come. 
I have 1 additional item to note regarding our 2014 results. One of our equity method investments is currently undergoing an international tax audit. If there are any material developments with this situation prior to the filing of our Form 10-K at the end of the month, we may be required to update our results to reflect their final 2014 earnings. 
Moving on. This morning, we provided our outlook for 2015. 
We anticipate another year of very attractive growth, with adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 a share, which implies mid-teens growth when excluding the $0.10 benefit to 2014 I noted earlier. So we expect good growth despite foreign currency swings that at current rates would result in a year-over-year drag of approximately $0.20 to $0.25. And we'll do that as we continued to invest aggressively in content to position the company to accelerate revenue growth in 2016. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. 
I'll begin at Turner, where we ended 2014 with a record fourth quarter for revenues and adjusted operating income. Just as important, we continued to make progress in positioning Turner to accelerate growth over the next several years and beyond. 
Subscription revenues increased 5% for the quarter and 7% for the year. And that included an FX headwind of close to 200 basis points in the quarter and approximately 100 basis points for the year. Without that, international Subscription revenue would have increased double digits for both periods due to continued positive trends in Latin America. 
Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. But excluding the impact from our dispute with DISH, domestic Subscription revenues would have increased in the high single digits, similar to our growth for the full year. And that reflected the positive impact of our current domestic renewal cycle. We anticipate completing new deals with the remainder of our top 10 affiliates by the end of this year, which should drive very attractive growth in our Subscription revenue over the next several years. 
Largely as a result of timing of those renewals, and as we indicated to you in the past, we will not see the same benefit from domestic renewals in 2015 that we saw in 2014. At current rates, we also expect headwinds of around 300 basis points from foreign currency movements, including the move to the in Venezuela. Taking into account those factors, we anticipate subscription revenue growth will slow materially this year before reaccelerating well into the double digits in 2016 and beyond. 
Moving on. 
Advertising revenues declined 1% in 4Q, similar to our expectations coming into the quarter, but were up 1% for the year. The fourth quarter included a drag of close to 500 basis points as a result of airing fewer major league baseball playoff games, foreign currency movements and the impact from DISH. Absent those, ad revenue would have grown in the quarter. 
Domestic advertising declined modestly in the quarter. And that included a decline in domestic entertainment, including on young adults, which was partly offset by healthy growth at news, where we continued to benefit from positive ratings momentum and very strong trends in our digital business. 
Excluding the impact of FX, international advertising increased in the high single digits, with growth across all regions. 
Looking to 2015, current rates imply about 200 basis point drag on advertising from foreign currency movements, including the move to the SICAD II rate in Venezuela. In the first quarter, we are seeing a modest improvement in the domestic environment. Scatter pricing is pacing up mid- to high single digits over the upfront, while volume remains moderate. Putting all those factors together, we anticipate total advertising revenues to be about flat. 
Excluding programming and restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly in the quarter and 5% for the year. And without those same charges, programming expenses increased 2% in the quarter and 7% for the year. That reflects our ongoing investments in both sports and original programming, which we expect will generate attractive returns over the next several years. 
Looking through the charges I just discussed, we limited total expense growth to 4% in 2014. And that was a result of keeping SG&A costs flat, reflecting our commitment to tightly managing our non-programming expenses in order to direct additional resources to key programming. 
So in 2014, we continued to execute our plan at Turner, and we feel we've laid the groundwork to expand margins and grow the business at a very attractive rates over the next several years. 
Turning to HBO, where we had another year of solid growth in both revenues and adjusted operating income. 
Subscription revenues were up 5% in the quarter and 8% for the year. The consolidations of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributed about 300 basis points to the full year growth. As a reminder, we had fully lapped both consolidations before the start of the fourth quarter. 
Domestically, we had steady subscription revenue growth throughout the year. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO and Cinemax together added over 2.8 million domestic subscribers in 2014. That's the best domestic sub growth in over 3 decades. As we previously discussed, most of these subscriber additions are nonrevenue generating. Still, we saw some improvement in the subscriber mix in 2014, which contributed to a modest acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth. And we expect a further acceleration in that growth over the next few years. 
Turning to content and other revenues, which increased 14% in the quarter and 24% for the year. That was boosted by a record year in home video led by sales at the season 3 of Game of Thrones. HBO's licensing deal with Amazon also contributed to the strong full year results. 
Across HBO's international operations, including unconsolidated JVs, we increased revenues double-digits in 2014. And that included growth in both our licensing and the networks business. International subscriber trends also remains strong, growing double digits across most regions. Sub growth was especially strong in Latin America and Europe in 2014. 
Adjusted operating income declined 5% in the quarter. And that was largely due to the timing of theatrical expenses and investments in original programming, which drove mid-teens growth in programming expenses. 
Marketing expenses were also higher in the quarter, as we continued to invest in the brand. 
For the full year, programming cost were up in the high-single digits when excluding the international consolidations. To help fund that investment, HBO remains focused on constraining non-programming expenses. And excluding the international consolidations, we limited SG&A growth to 1% in 2014. 
Despite the drop in the fourth quarter and higher restructuring charges, adjusted operating income grew 7% for the year. So we had another year of solid growth, and we continued the subscriber momentum we've had over the past few years, both domestically and internationally. 
Given the strong demand for the product globally, we feel very good about our ability to further accelerate growth over the next several years. 
Now on to Warner Bros. We're excluding restructuring and severance charges, 2014 would have been another record year for adjusted operating income, and we achieved that, thanks to continued growth in the TV business and our focus on cost containment. 2014 also benefited from a cut in settlement agreement. 
On the TV side, revenues grew double digits in the fourth quarter, capping out the gray year. Internationally, Warner's continues to benefit from the growing demand for high-quality TV content from both linear and SVOD buyers. We're also seeing growth in local production from Eyeworks, the acquisition we completed earlier in 2014. And domestically, Warner's remained the industry leader in primetime series produced for broadcast networks for the 2014/2015 TV season. So the trends in TV production remained positive, and we're confident we can continue to grow this business over the next several years. 
Theatrically, coming into the year, we knew we had tough comps, especially in the fourth quarter, and that played out as expected, with revenue declining for both the quarter and the year. But we're off to a terrific start in 2015 with the success of American Sniper. And longer term, we think we have the strongest slate in the history of the company. So overall, we feel really good about the outlook for our theatrical business. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 12% for the year, in part, due to a softer slate. That was roughly in line with the overall market, which was down 7%, excluding SVOD. However, we continued to see positive trends in digital across both theatrical and television product, with electronic sell-through revenue up 40% for the year. 
On the expense side, consistent with our company-wide focus on efficiency, Warner continues to tightly manage overhead cost. Excluding restructuring and severance charges from both periods, total expenses increased less than 2% and SG&A was down 4% for the year. 
As we head into 2015, we'll start to see the benefit from the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter, which we expect to contribute to margin expansion over time. 
So on the whole, Warner's had a very good year. And with our slate of franchised films starting in 2016 and a strong secular demand for high-quality TV content, we feel we're in great position to grow Warner's at attractive rates for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to the next slide. 
We had another year of strong free cash flow generation, growing free cash flow 12% to $3.5 billion. As you can see on the slide, we've broken up the programming, restructuring and severance charges incurred in the second half of 2014, which had a significant impact on adjusted operating income. 
Our cash taxes increased, primarily due to lower foreign tax credits. Cash interest increased as a result of the additional debt we issued during the year. And the improvement in working capital was primarily due to lower participations at Warner Bros. 
Looking to 2015, keep in mind that we will have approximately $300 million of severance payments related to the restructuring actions we took this past year. In addition, we expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash, primarily due to the large syndication sales at Warner's. All that aside, we still anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation. And we expect to continue converting a very high percentage of our earning into free cash flow in the years to come. 
Looking at our balance sheet. 
We ended 2014 with $19.9 billion of net debt, up $1.6 billion compared to the end of 2013. That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, during 2014, we repurchased $5.5 billion in shares, and combined with our dividend, returned $6.6 billion in total to shareholders. 
During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2 billion of long-term debt at very favorable rates. 
On the M&A front, we invested just under $1 billion in 2014. The majority of that was directed towards our financing arrangements with CME and our acquisition of EyeWorks international television operations. Due to the programming restructuring and severance charges in the second half of the year, our net leverage ratio was around 3x at the end of 2014. However, excluding those charges, our net leverage ratio would have been 2.7x, slightly below our target level. 
One item to keep in mind in terms of our use of capital during the next few years will be the cash payments related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. The majority of these payments will be recognized in investing activities, including a few hundred million dollars in 2015. On balance, I'm pleased with how we executed on our capital plan in 2014. And as we look ahead, neither our philosophy nor our processes around capital allocation have changed, so you can expect us to remain very disciplined and balanced in our approach to capital allocation. 
We remain committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade credit ratings and are comfortable with our net leverage target of 2.75x. We continued to believe that target provides us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, engage in strategic M&A and provide direct returns to shareholders, while at the same time, optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios. 
With that, let's move onto the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. 
In 2015, we expect to deliver really attractive growth in adjusted operating income and another year of solid double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And we expect that will be as a result of strong growth across all of our divisions. Before getting into the details, please note that my comments will be based on 2014 results, excluding the programming, restructuring and severance charges taken in the second half of the year. 
At Turner, we'll benefit from around $200 million in savings from the restructuring efforts and more modest programming expense growth, as our NASCAR deal ended in 2014. Those factors should translate into healthy margin expansion. While we continued to see positive underlying trends internationally, the strong dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela will provide headwinds. Nonetheless, we anticipate a return to very healthy adjusted operating income growth, which is evidence of our continued ability to manage our cost structure to drive attractive growth even in years with more modest top line trends. 
At HBO, we continued to see strong demand for our services globally and that should result in continued solid subscription revenue growth. And along with disciplined expense management, we anticipate that we will drive a significant acceleration in adjusted operating income growth in 2015. As we previously discussed, we plan to launch an over-the-top service domestically this year and will provide more color on those plans as we get closer to launching. 
At Warner Bros., we anticipate revenue growth to be led by our TV syndication slate, which includes 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest. We also have a robust slate of videogames anchored by key franchise releases, Batman Arkham and Mortal Kombat. So we expect strong revenue growth, combined with cost savings from restructuring, to translate into very attractive adjusted operating income growth and another record year at Warner's. 
So looking across all 3 segments, we're set up for a very good year from an operating perspective. And that's despite an expected drag on adjusted operating income of approximately $250 million to $300 million as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela. That impact will primarily sharpen at Turner and Warner's Brothers and equates to approximately $0.20 to $0.25 at the adjusted EPS level, which we have factored into our outlook. 
It's also worth noting that intercompany eliminations will be a material drag this year due to increased content sales from Warner Bros. to HBO and Turner, including the syndication sale of 2 Broke Girls. 
In addition, we started to recognize 100% of CME's losses in our equity income in the fourth quarter as a result of our accumulated net loss is exceeding the book value of our common stock investments. For context, in 2014, this change would have resulted in an additional $0.05 negative impact to adjusted EPS. 
In terms of cadence, we expect 2015 adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, given the timing of both syndication availabilities and this year's theatrical slate at Warner Bros. 
Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2015, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted of $4.60 to $4.70 or mid-teens growth when excluding the second half restructuring, and programming charges and tax matters we noted earlier. And that's despite the negative impact of foreign exchange that I just noted. At the same time, our continued investments in high-quality video content and our industry-leading brands will position us for accelerating revenue growth in 2016. So we continued to expect high teens adjusted EPS growth, on average, through 2018 and remain on track to the financial targets we shared with you at our Investor Day in October. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

And let me go into some of the reasons, and then John and Howard will pick up from there. We did see some sub declines last year in the basic cable universe, and we have planned for modest declines to continue. And I think, as everyone knows, ad growth has been very muted, but we still see very strong consumer demand for multichannel TV and increasing viewing across all the platforms. And we think that TV and video remains best platform for reaching a mass audience for advertisers. We also see that multichannel revenue are also still growing at a healthy clip, so we think there is pretty good opportunity for continued growth. We are working closely with all our distributors to improve the consumer value proposition. That means more and more vibrant VOD offerings from all the networks. It means providing stacking rights for original series, and that would be another example where I think we -- HBO, as all series up pretty much. Turner has all of its series up. And we think more SVOD -- I mean, more VOD and more and better user interface is going to make a difference in all of the retention basically at multichannel TV. We're also moving aggressively to provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting that they're coming to expect. And we think that as we do that more successfully, we're going to take that share from digital competitors over time. Beyond the traditional system, we think there's a lot of opportunity for companies like ours with specialize in high-quality content, not just in the U.S., but also globally. But if you just go back to the United States, Sling TV is one example of increased value and opportunity from networks like ours. HBO over-the-top is another examples, so on the whole, we think the value of the content and of our networks is growing. And we think some of the changes that all of us are beginning to see in having more flexible consumer offerings are going to support the value of the best networks and the strongest brands. That's basically why we see ourselves on track for are on target in '16 and '18. And John and Howard, I think you have something to say."

With regard to the rhythm of our affiliate contracts, we've got 7 of the top 10 affiliates closed, and we enter in both remaining deals this year. As we reported in the past, everything is going exactly in accordance with the plan. We are achieving the rate increases and the terms that we've been seeking. And this year, in the multi-year, overall cycle, we fully anticipated, and we've communicated before, that there'll be somewhat of a moderation in subscriber revenue growth, but that's going to pick back up beyond '15. I think it's important though when you look at the longer-term trends that multichannel in the U.S. to understand that the evidence that we see clearly indicates that the main reason why people are leaving the multi-channel universe, let's call them cord cutters is because they either can't afford it or they don't think there's enough value in the offerings that are currently being provided for them by the MVPDs. We also believe that a portion of that community would like to sign back up for multichannel TV if their offerings were comprised of more affordable and greater flexibility. I think Sling, as Jeff said, it's a great example, but I think it's important to understand that it's the first example. A lot of the economy that the MVPDs are current offering are based more on whether the contracts allow for them and they're based more on cost and they're offered as retention tools as opposed to proactive marketing opportunities. I think that's going to change over time. And we've been saying for a long time that there is too many channels in existence today, and the approach that Time Warner and Turner have taken over the years of investing heavily in the core group of channels we think is going to really pay handsome dividends in the future as we have 2 of the top 5, 3 of the top 10 networks, and 85% of our affiliates are comprised in the top 4. And we're pleased to be in the Sling initial offering, so we're quite optimistic about how things are going to continue to evolve over time, and we're quite optimistic about the hand that we have in terms of the value of the networks."

This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full year and the other providing our 2015 full year business outlook. 
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. 
Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
I will now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO; who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin; Richard Plepler; and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for a Q&A session. Jeff?"
24689,281164035,759985,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. 2014 was another year of strong financial performance for our company, with solid revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. That's our sixth straight year of at least high teens adjusted EPS g",2261,"Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. 
2014 was another year of strong financial performance for our company, with solid revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. That's our sixth straight year of at least high teens adjusted EPS growth. And it's consistent with our plan to reach close to $6 in adjusted EPS in 2016 and over $8 in 2018. We also grew free cash flow by 12% to $3.5 billion, and we returned more than $6.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. 
And as we announced this morning, we anticipate another year of very good growth in adjusted EPS in 2015. We are also committed to building on our strong record of providing direct returns to shareholders, which have totaled more than $26 billion since 2008. You can see evidence of this commitment in the 10% increase in our dividend approved by our board. That's also the sixth straight year we've raised the dividend by double digits. So we expect another great year in 2015, and that's in the context of an industry where, like all of you, we see the pace of change accelerating. 
Consumers' appetite for high-quality video content is increasing globally. But we're in the midst of a secular shift to on-demand consumption. At the same time, advertisers' expectations for data, analytics and targeting are also increasing. These changes create new challenges for our industry, but we think they are also creating big opportunities for the producers of the very best video content. In fact, we have spent the last several years positioning ourselves to take advantage of these trends. 
In 2014, we completed our transformation into a more focused, nimble and collaborative video content company that takes better advantage of our leading brands and our global scale at Warner Bros., Turner and HBO. We also finished the transition to a new generation of CEOs at each of our divisions. And we continue to invest even more in the very best content. In 2014, we invested $14.5 billion in programming, production and marketing. That's up about $3 billion compared to just 5 years earlier. And we expect that to grow to around $19 billion a year over the next several years. That investment is going into increased original programming at HBO and Turner, into high-profile sports like the NBA, NCAA March Madness and Major League Baseball and also into the biggest film and TV franchises at Warner's. And those investments will continue to pay dividends in the years to come as the demand for high-quality on-demand video content grows. 
We also continued to invest resources in improving the user experience in order to increase the value we're providing to our distribution partners and to consumers of multichannel television. Last year, we launched CNN Go, the most advanced multiplatform news product on the market. We expanded HBO GO to additional platforms, including Amazon Fire, PS3 and Xbox One. And we started to make stacking rights available for some of our biggest hits at Turner. 
At the same time, we're increasingly investing outside the traditional TV ecosystem to help ensure that consumers can access our great content wherever, whenever and on whatever device they choose, even if they don't have a conventional multichannel TV subscription. The most notable example is our HBO OTT service, which we're on track to launch later this year. We think there is a big opportunity for us to reach broadband-only consumers and to reduce the friction of subscribing to HBO for multichannel subs that don't currently have the service. We look forward to sharing more details about the service closer to launch. 
But HBO's OTT product is only one element of our digital strategy. At Turner, CNN Digital grew both average monthly video streams and mobile uniques by more than 30% in 2014. And Turner's Bleacher Report averaged 39 million monthly unique visitors, becoming the #2 digital sports destination in the U.S. 
We have carried that momentum into 2015. All 5 of Turner's most important networks were included in DISH's Sling TV service, making up more than 1/3 of the channels at launch. CNN and Bleacher Report were 2 of Snapchat's launch partners for its Discover feature. And last month, Warner's announced that it will be launching an SVOD service in Southeast Asia in partnership with Singtel and Sony Pictures Television. That's another opportunity for Warner's to use new distribution platforms to grow its business in Asia, where it already has a significant stake in Hollywood VIP. That's a rapidly growing SVOD service in China, which recently expanded its content offering to include HBO programming. 
You will also see us investing in our advertising business by rolling out advanced products that provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting they're coming to expect. We started that process last year when we began selling based on consumer behavior rather than just the traditional age and gender demographics. This year, we're going to take that one step further. For the first time, we will have 1 joint upfront for all of our networks and will provide our best partners the ability to buy behavior-based inventory across all of our networks and digital platforms. We started talking to our partners about this at CES last month, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Combining the reach and quality environment of TV with the analytics and targeting of digital is the Holy Grail for advertisers. And if we do that successfully, we think we can take share back from digital competitors over time. 
So clearly, there is a lot of change occurring in our industry, but we're more confident than ever in our position. That confidence stems from our belief that the very best video content is becoming more valuable to both consumers and to our advertising and distribution partners. We produced more of that great content than anybody, which was evident once again in 2014. 
It's award season, so let's start there. We received 13 Academy Award nominations this year, including a Best Picture nomination for American Sniper. In true Warner Bros. fashion, this film has been both a commercial and a critical success. After opening in select theaters on Christmas Day, it shattered records when it went live last month, including the biggest January opening ever. And last year, we also released The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, which was the final installment of the epic trilogy by Peter Jackson. Through last week, the movie had brought in well over $900 million at the global box office, and that brings the total for the Lord of the Rings franchise to close to $6 billion. That gives Warner's 2 of the top 4 global film franchises in history, including the biggest ever in Harry Potter. 
No one manages film franchises better than Warner's, and they're at the core of its film strategy going forward. Warner's has laid out the most ambitious slate in its history, which starting in 2016 will be built around DC Comics, LEGO and the world of Harry Potter. And we couldn't be more excited and confident in the opportunity it has, not only to drive growth at the box office, but also to significantly expand its ancillary business. 
None of that should overshadow Warner's continued leadership in television production. Warner's has more than 60 series airing for the 2014 to '15 season, including the most prime time series on broadcast of any studio for the 11th time in the past 12 seasons. This season was particularly notable for Warner's mining of the DC library, which gave rise to 2 of this year's bona fide new hits: Gotham and The Flash. And The Flash is just one of 3 DC shows on the CW, with their presence helping the CW to broaden its audience and grow its ratings this season. 
DC is also a major driver of our games business, including last year's release of LEGO Batman 3. That will continue in 2015 with the highly anticipated release of the final installment of the Batman Arkham Trilogy. Along with the release of Mortal Kombat X and a new mobile game based on Game of Thrones, that should prevail Warner's game business to a record year in 2015. 
Now going back for a moment to the multiplex. Last week, HBO concluded a limited IMAX run for 2 episodes of its monster hit, Game of Thrones. That's HBO's most-watched series ever. It was the first television show to ever screen at an IMAX theater and that's a testament to the anticipation for Thrones' upcoming fifth season as well as to HBO's creative excellence. 
Last year, HBO received 19 Primetime Emmys, including 5 for True Detective, its most-watched freshman series ever. And HBO's content superiority translated into close to 3 million additional domestic subscribers. That's its highest growth in domestic subs in over 3 decades. 
In 2015, HBO plans to raise its game again with returning hits like True Detective, Veep, Silicon Valley, The Leftovers and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver as well as adding several new series like Westworld, which is the second HBO drama produced by Warner Bros., and The Brink, a comedy series starring Tim Robbins and Jack Black, and Ballers, starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. 
As we start this year, we also have a lot of momentum at Turner. In 2014, TBS, TNT and Adult Swim claimed 3 of the top 10 spots in prime time among adults 18 to 49. TBS was the #2 ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. And TNT was home to 6 of the top 15 original series on ad-supported cable. That's more than any other network. And that included 3 new hits in The Last Ship, The Librarians and Murder in the First. That's strong evidence that its emphasis on more distinct and original programming is starting to work. 
2014 was also an important year for our sports business, with Turner extending its partnership with the NBA through 2025 and kicking off its new agreement with Major League Baseball. And with we dipped our toe into the water with sports internationally by obtaining the UEFA Champions League rights in Brazil, which will cement the must-have status of our recently acquired sports network, Esporte Interativo. 
Adult Swim continued to attract the largest audiences of young adults, including the top 2 new shows among adults 18 to 34, Attack on Titan and Black Jesus. That's the type of programming that helped Adult Swim to be ranked as the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 34 for the 10th consecutive year as well as being the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 49. 
And the network it shares a channel with, Cartoon Network, is on an absolute roll. In the year where most kids networks were down double digits, Cartoon grew its audience in kids 6 to 11, and we gained momentum through the year. In the fourth quarter, Cartoon grew ratings in its key demos by solid double digits, and that's a trend that's continued into the first quarter of this year. 
Despite these successes, we know we can do better, in particular, at TBS and TNT. And we're confident that with new leadership in place and a focus on distinctive original programming, we will do better. The success of CNN is a great example of how the right management and the right programming strategy can drive growth even in the face of challenging industry trends. 
In 2014, CNN grew its prime time ratings in adults 25 to 54, while MSNBC registered double-digit declines. And CNN had an average total day monthly reach of almost 77 million total viewers, the largest cumulative audience of any cable news network. CNN took share by going deeper on the biggest stories, revamping key data points like morning and expanding its innovative lineup of original prime time series based around talent like Anthony Bourdain, Morgan Spurlock, Lisa Ling and Mike Rowe. Its original programming also helped CNN draw, by far, the youngest medium prime time audience among its cable news rivals and match its youngest on record. CNN's strong performance has continued into 2015, with its ratings in adults 25 to 54 up 70% in January compared to double-digit declines for MSNBC. And CNN will look to build on that success by further expanding its lineup of originals this year. Developing a robust slate of must-have programming is a process that takes time. But that's one of the things our company does best, and we're confident in the team at Turner with their strategy and their ability to drive increased viewership across platforms as they execute on the plans they're putting in place. 
Before I turn it over to Howard, I want to emphasize that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute on the ambitious strategy and growth plans we shared with you last October. We're proud of our track record of industry-leading adjusted EPS growth and shareholder returns over the past 5 or 6 years. But 2015 is really our first full year as the new Time Warner, and we're just getting under way. We're mindful of the challenges ahead of us, but we've done a lot of work to get to the right structure, the right management and the right strategy so that we're positioned to lead the industry and continue to deliver superior value to our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Howard."
24689,281164035,759985,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with how we ended the year and the progress we're making on the long",3178,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with how we ended the year and the progress we're making on the long-term targets we discussed at our Investor Day. As we look out over the next several years, we continue to expect that solid revenue growth, attractive margin expansion and accelerating growth in adjusted OI will, on average, be at the high teens growth in adjusted EPS. 
In 2014, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 18%, our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. That's in line with our updated guidance and exceeded the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, adjusted EPS included a net benefit of $0.10 from the tax matters and programming restructuring and severance charges that we previously discussed with you. Including the additional restructuring and programming charges we took in the fourth quarter and net of intercompany eliminations, we incurred $469 million of restructuring and severance charges and $388 million of programming charges in the second half of 2014. We're expecting the restructuring actions to translate into run rate savings of close to $500 million, most of which will come in 2015. That will free up resources to invest even more in content and position us to accelerate our revenue growth in the coming years while also continuing to expand margins. Those actions were consistent with our ongoing focus on expense management. 
Excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from both periods, total expenses increased only 3% for the year, despite our continued investments in great content. And about 100 basis points of that growth was due to the international consolidations at HBO and Warner's acquisition of Eyeworks. 
Total SG&A declined slightly for the year. We also had another strong year of cash flow, which was up 12%. Free cash flow per share was up an even more impressive 19%, benefiting from our ongoing share repurchase program. In 2014, we repurchased $5.5 billion of our shares, a significant acceleration from the prior year. Combined with $1.1 billion in dividends, we returned $6.6 billion to shareholders during the year. And as evidenced by the dividend increase we announced this morning, we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders going forward. So we had another good year of financial performance in 2014 and returned a substantial amount of capital to shareholders while also making great progress in positioning the company for strong growth in the years to come. 
I have 1 additional item to note regarding our 2014 results. One of our equity method investments is currently undergoing an international tax audit. If there are any material developments with this situation prior to the filing of our Form 10-K at the end of the month, we may be required to update our results to reflect their final 2014 earnings. 
Moving on. This morning, we provided our outlook for 2015. We anticipate another year of very attractive growth, with adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 a share, which implies mid-teens growth when excluding the $0.10 benefit to 2014 I noted earlier. So we expect good growth despite foreign currency swings that at current rates would result in a year-over-year drag of approximately $0.20 to $0.25. And we'll do that as we continue to invest aggressively in content to position the company to accelerate revenue growth in 2016. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we ended 2014 with a record fourth quarter for revenues and adjusted operating income. Just as important, we continued to make progress in positioning Turner to accelerate growth over the next several years and beyond. 
Subscription revenues increased 5% for the quarter and 7% for the year. And that included an FX headwind of close to 200 basis points in the quarter and approximately 100 basis points for the year. Without that, international Subscription revenue would have increased double digits for both periods due to continued positive trends in Latin America. 
Domestic Subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. But excluding the impact from our dispute with DISH, domestic Subscription revenues would have increased in the high single digits, similar to our growth for the full year. And that reflected the positive impact of our current domestic renewal cycle. We anticipate completing new deals with the remainder of our top 10 affiliates by the end of this year, and which should drive very attractive growth in our Subscription revenue over the next several years. 
Largely as a result of timing of those renewals, and as we indicated to you in the past, we will not see the same benefit from domestic renewals in 2015 that we saw in 2014. At current rates, we also expect headwinds of around 300 basis points from foreign currency movements, including the move to the Sicad 2 rate in Venezuela. Taking into account those factors, we anticipate Subscription revenue growth will slow materially this year before reaccelerating well into the double digits in 2016 and beyond. 
Moving on. Advertising revenues declined 1% in 4Q, similar to our expectations coming into the quarter, but were up 1% for the year. The fourth quarter included a drag of close to 500 basis points as a result of airing fewer Major League Baseball playoff games, foreign currency movements and the impact from DISH. Absent those, ad revenue would have grown in the quarter. 
Domestic advertising declined modestly in the quarter. And that included a decline in domestic entertainment, including on young adults, which was partly offset by healthy growth at news, where we continued to benefit from positive ratings momentum and very strong trends in our digital business. 
Excluding the impact of FX, international advertising increased in the high single digits, with growth across all regions. 
Looking to 2015, current rates imply about a 200 basis point drag on advertising from foreign currency movements, including the move to the Sicad 2 rate in Venezuela. In the first quarter, we are seeing a modest improvement in the domestic environment. Scatter pricing is pacing up mid- to high single digits over the upfront, while volume remains moderate. Putting all those factors together, we anticipate total advertising revenues to be about flat. 
Excluding programming and restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly in the quarter and 5% for the year. And without those same charges, programming expenses increased 2% in the quarter and 7% for the year. That reflects our ongoing investments in both sports and original programming, which we expect will generate attractive returns over the next several years. 
Looking through the charges I just discussed, we limited total expense growth to 4% in 2014. And that was a result of keeping SG&A costs flat, reflecting our commitment to tightly managing our nonprogramming expenses in order to direct additional resources to key programming. 
So in 2014, we continued to execute our plan at Turner and we feel we've laid the groundwork to expand margins and grow the business at very attractive rates over the next several years. 
Turning to HBO, where we had another year of solid growth in both revenues and adjusted operating income. 
Subscription revenues were up 5% in the quarter and 8% for the year. The consolidations of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributed about 300 basis points to the full year growth. As a reminder, we had fully lapped both consolidations before the start of the fourth quarter. 
Domestically, we had steady Subscription revenue growth throughout the year. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO and Cinemax together added over 2.8 million domestic subscribers in 2014. That's the best domestic sub growth in over 3 decades. As we've previously discussed, most of these subscriber additions are nonrevenue-generating. Still, we saw some improvement in the subscriber mix in 2014, which contributed to a modest acceleration in domestic Subscription revenue growth. And we expect a further acceleration in that growth over the next few years. 
Turning to content and other revenues, which increased 14% in the quarter and 24% for the year. That was boosted by a record year in home video led by sales of the season 3 of Game of Thrones. HBO's licensing deal with Amazon also contributed to the strong full year results. 
Across HBO's international operations, including unconsolidated JVs, we increased revenues double digits in 2014. And that included growth in both our licensing and Networks business. International subscriber trends also remained strong, growing double digits across most regions. Sub growth was especially strong in Latin America and Europe in 2014. 
Adjusted operating income declined 5% in the quarter. And that was largely due to the timing of theatrical expenses and investments in original programming, which drove mid-teens growth in programming expenses. 
Marketing expenses were also higher in the quarter as we continued to invest in the brand. 
For the full year, programming costs were up in the high single digits when excluding the international consolidations. To help fund that investment, HBO remains focused on constraining nonprogramming expenses. And excluding the international consolidations, we limited SG&A growth to 1% in 2014. 
Despite the drop in the fourth quarter and higher restructuring charges, adjusted operating income grew 7% for the year. So we had another year of solid growth and we continued the subscriber momentum we've had over the past few years, both domestically and internationally. 
Given the strong demand for the product globally, we feel very good about our ability to further accelerate growth over the next several years. 
Now on to Warner Bros. If we're excluding restructuring and severance charges, 2014 would have been another record year for adjusted operating income. And we achieved that, thanks to continued growth in the TV business and our focus on cost containment. 2014 also benefited from a patent license and settlement agreement. 
On the TV side, revenues grew double digits in the fourth quarter, capping off a great year. Internationally, Warner's continues to benefit from the growing demand for high-quality TV content from both linear and SVOD buyers. We're also seeing growth in local production from Eyeworks, the acquisition we completed earlier in 2014. And domestically, Warner's remained the industry leader in prime time series produced for broadcast networks for the 2014/2015 TV season. So the trends in TV production remained positive, and we're confident we can continue to grow this business over the next several years. 
Theatrically, coming into the year, we knew we had tough comps, especially in the fourth quarter, and that played out as expected with revenue declining for both the quarter and the year. But we're off to a terrific start in 2015 with the success of American Sniper. And longer term, we think we have the strongest slate in the history of the company. So overall, we feel really good about the outlook for our theatrical business. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 12% for the year, in part, due to a softer slate. That was roughly in line with the overall market, which was down 7%, excluding SVOD. However, we continued to see positive trends in digital across both theatrical and television product, with electronic sell-through revenue up 40% for the year. 
On the expense side, consistent with our company-wide focus on efficiency, Warner continues to tightly manage overhead costs. Excluding restructuring and severance charges from both periods, total expenses increased less than 2% and SG&A was down 4% for the year. 
As we head into 2015, we'll start to see the benefit from the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter, which we expect to contribute to margin expansion over time. 
So on the whole, Warner's had a very good year. And with our slate of franchised films starting in 2016 and the strong secular demand for high-quality TV content, we feel we're in great position to grow Warner's at attractive rates for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to the next slide. We had another year of strong free cash flow generation, growing free cash flow 12% to $3.5 billion. As you can see on the slide, we've broken up the programming, restructuring and severance charges incurred in the second half of 2014, which had a significant impact on adjusted operating income. 
Our cash taxes increased primarily due to lower foreign tax credits. Cash interest increased as a result of the additional debt we issued during the year. And the improvement in working capital was primarily due to lower participations at Warner Bros. 
Looking to 2015, keep in mind that we will have approximately $300 million of severance payments related to the restructuring actions we took this past year. In addition, we expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash primarily due to the large syndication sale at Warner's. All that aside, we still anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation. And we expect to continue converting a very high percentage of our earning into free cash flow in the years to come. 
Looking at our balance sheet. We ended 2014 with $19.9 billion of net debt, up $1.6 billion compared to the end of 2013. That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, during 2014, we repurchased $5.5 billion in shares and combined with our dividend, returned $6.6 billion in total to shareholders. 
During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2 billion of long-term debt at very favorable rates. 
On the M&A front, we invested just under $1 billion in 2014. The majority of that was directed towards our financing arrangements with CME and our acquisition of Eyeworks' international television operations. Due to the programming restructuring and severance charges in the second half of the year, our net leverage ratio was around 3x at the end of 2014. However, excluding those charges, our net leverage ratio would have been 2.7x, slightly below our target level. 
One item to keep in mind in terms of our use of capital during the next few years will be the cash payments related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. The majority of these payments will be recognized in investing activities, including a few hundred million dollars in 2015. On balance, I'm pleased with how we executed on our capital plan in 2014. And as we look ahead, neither our philosophy nor our processes around capital allocation have changed, so you can expect us to remain very disciplined and balanced in our approach to capital allocation. 
We remain committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade credit ratings and are comfortable with our net leverage target of 2.75x. We continue to believe that target provides us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, engage in strategic M&A and provide direct returns to shareholders, while at the same time, optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. 
In 2015, we expect to deliver really attractive growth in adjusted operating income and another year of solid double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And we expect that will be as a result of strong growth across all of our divisions. Before getting into the details, please note that my comments will be based on 2014 results, excluding the programming, restructuring and severance charges taken in the second half of the year. 
At Turner, we'll benefit from around $200 million in savings from the restructuring efforts and more modest programming expense growth as our NASCAR deal ended in 2014. Those factors should translate into healthy margin expansion. While we continue to see positive underlying trends internationally, the strong dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela will provide headwinds. Nonetheless, we anticipate a return to very healthy adjusted operating income growth, which is evidence of our continued ability to manage our cost structure to drive attractive growth even in years with more modest top line trends. 
At HBO, we continue to see strong demand for our services globally and that should result in continued solid Subscription revenue growth. And along with disciplined expense management, we anticipate that we will drive a significant acceleration in adjusted operating income growth in 2015. As we've previously discussed, we plan to launch an ""over-the-top"" service domestically this year and will provide more color on those plans as we get closer to launching. 
At Warner Bros., we anticipate revenue growth to be led by our TV syndication slate, which includes 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest. We also have a robust slate of videogames anchored by key franchise releases, Batman Arkham and Mortal Kombat. So we expect strong revenue growth combined with cost savings from the restructurings to translate into very attractive adjusted operating income growth and another record year at Warner's. 
So looking across all 3 segments, we're set-up for a very good year from an operating perspective. And that's despite an expected drag on adjusted operating income of approximately $250 million to $300 million as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela. That impact will primarily show up at Turner and Warner Bros. and equates to approximately $0.20 to $0.25 at the adjusted EPS level, which we have factored in to our outlook. 
It's also worth noting that intercompany eliminations will be a material drag this year due to increased content sales from Warner Bros. to HBO and Turner, including the syndication sale of 2 Broke Girls. 
In addition, we started to recognize 100% of CME's losses in our equity income in the fourth quarter as a result of our accumulated net losses exceeding the book value of our common stock investments. For context, in 2014, this change would have resulted in an additional $0.05 negative impact to adjusted EPS. 
In terms of cadence, we expect 2015 adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, given the timing of both syndication availabilities and this year's theatrical slate at Warner Bros. 
Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2015, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 or mid-teens growth when excluding the second half restructuring and programming charges and tax matters we noted earlier. And that's despite the negative impact of foreign exchange that I just noted. At the same time, our continued investments in high-quality video content and our industry-leading brands will position us for accelerating revenue growth in 2016. So we continue to expect high teens adjusted EPS growth, on average, through 2018 and remain on track to hit the financial targets we shared with you at our Investor Day in October. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

There has been a lot of focus on affiliate revenue growth for Turner Networks. So I was hoping first that, Howard or John, you would let us know whether Turner domestic affiliate revenue is on track towards your initial budgets for pricing and subscriber levels or if those budgets have been shifting around as you saw 4Q results. And are you able to be more specific regarding the year-over-year domestic drivers for 4Q, the DISH impact and subscriber changes versus core pricing? And for Jeff, you expressed a lot of confidence in achieving 2016 EPS guidance. But I think some investors are still uncertain with all the cross-currents right now for affiliate revenue. You've got Sling TV and cord-cutting, cord-shaving, the DISH outage in October. So I'm just curious how many of the top 10 renewals are left to be completed? And what drives your confidence in hitting your 2016 and beyond affiliate revenue goals?"

And let me go into some of the reasons, and then John and Howard will pick up from there. We did see some sub declines last year in the basic cable universe, and we have planned for modest declines to continue. And I think, as everyone knows, ad growth has been very muted, but we still see very strong consumer demand for multichannel TV and increasing viewing across all the platforms. And we think that TV and video remains the best platform for reaching a mass audience for advertisers. We also see that multichannel revenues are also still growing at a healthy clip. So we think there is pretty good opportunity for continued growth. We're working closely with all our distributors to improve the consumer value proposition. That means more and more vibrant VOD offerings from all the networks. It means providing stacking rights for original series, and that would be another example where I think we -- HBO has all its series up pretty much. Turner has all of its series up. And we think more SVOD -- I mean, more VOD and more and better user interfaces are going to make a difference in all of the retention basically of multichannel TV. We're also moving aggressively to provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting that they're coming to expect. And we think that as we do that more successfully, we're going to take that share from digital competitors over time. Beyond the traditional ecosystem, we think there's a lot of opportunity for companies like ours that specialize in high-quality content, not just in the U.S., but also globally. But if you just go back to the United States, Sling TV is one example of increased value and opportunity from networks like ours. HBO ""over-the-top"" is another example. So on the whole, we think the value of that content and of our networks is growing. And we think some of the changes that all of us are beginning to see in having more flexible consumer offerings are going to support the value of the best networks and the strongest brands. That's basically why we see ourselves on track for our targets in '16 and '18. And John and Howard, I think you have a few things to add."

With regard to the rhythm of our affiliate contracts, we've got 7 of the top 10 affiliates closed, and we intend to close the remaining deals this year. As we reported in the past, everything is going exactly in accordance with plan. We are achieving the rate increases and the terms that we've been seeking. And this year, in the multiyear overall cycle, we fully anticipated and we've communicated before that there will be somewhat of a moderation in Subscriber revenue growth but then it's going to pick back up beyond '15. I think it's important though when you look at the longer-term trends of multichannel in the U.S. to understand that the evidence that we see clearly indicates that the main reason why people are leaving the multichannel universe, let's call them cord-cutters, is because they either can't afford it or they don't think there's enough value in the offerings that are currently being provided to them by the MVPDs. We also believe that a portion of that community would like to sign back up for multichannel TV if their offerings were comprised of more affordable and greater flexibility. I think Sling, as Jeff said, is a great example, but I think it's important to understand that it's the first example. A lot of the economy packs that the MVPDs are currently offering are based more on whether the contracts allow for them and they're based more on cost and they're offered as retention tools as opposed to proactive marketing opportunities. I think that's going to change over time. And we've been saying for a long time that there's too many channels in existence today, and the approach that Time Warner and Turner have taken over the years of investing heavily in a core group of channels we think is going to really pay handsome dividends in the future as we have 2 of the top 5, 3 of the top 10 networks, and 85% of our affiliate fees are comprised in the top 4. And we're pleased to be in the Sling initial offering. So we're quite optimistic about how things are going to continue to evolve over time, and we're quite optimistic about the hand that we have in terms of the value of the networks."

Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. 
Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
I will now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO; who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for a Q&A session. Jeff?"
24689,281164035,760170,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. 2014 was another year of strong financial performance for our company, with solid revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. That's our sixth straight year of at least high teens adjusted EPS g",2257,"Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. 
2014 was another year of strong financial performance for our company, with solid revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. That's our sixth straight year of at least high teens adjusted EPS growth, and it's consistent with our plan to reach close to $6 in adjusted EPS in 2016 and over $8 in 2018. We also grew free cash flow by 12% to $3.5 billion, and we returned more than $6.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. 
And, as we announced this morning, we anticipate another year of very good growth in adjusted EPS in 2015. We are also committed to building on our strong record of providing direct returns to shareholders, which have totaled more than $26 billion since 2008. You can see evidence of this commitment in the 10% increase in our dividend approved by our board. That's also the sixth straight year we've raised the dividend by double digits. So we expect another great year in 2015, and that's in the context of an industry where, like all of you, we see the pace of change accelerating. 
Consumers' appetite for high-quality video content is increasing globally, but we're in the midst of a secular shift to on-demand consumption. At the same time, advertisers' expectations for data, analytics and targeting are also increasing. These changes create new challenges for our industry, but we think they are also creating big opportunities for the producers of the very best video content. In fact, we have spent the last several years positioning ourselves to take advantage of these trends. 
In 2014, we completed our transformation into a more focused, nimble and collaborative video content company that takes better advantage of our leading brands and our global scale at Warner Bros., Turner and HBO. We also finished the transition to a new generation of CEOs at each of our divisions. And we continue to invest even more in the very best content. In 2014, we invested $14.5 billion in programming, production and marketing. That's up about $3 billion compared to just 5 years earlier. And we expect that to grow to around $19 billion a year over the next several years. That investment is going into increased original programming at HBO and Turner; into high-profile sports like the NBA, NCAA March Madness and Major League Baseball; and also into the biggest film and TV franchises at Warner's. And those investments will continue to pay dividends in the years to come as the demand for high-quality on-demand video content grows. 
We also continue to invest resources in improving the user experience in order to increase the value we're providing to our distribution partners and to consumers of multichannel television. Last year, we launched CNN Go, the most advanced multiplatform news product on the market. We expanded HBO GO to additional platforms, including Amazon Fire, PS3 and Xbox One. And we started to make stacking rights available for some of our biggest hits at Turner. 
At the same time, we're increasingly investing outside the traditional TV ecosystem to help ensure that consumers can access our great content wherever, whenever and on whatever device they choose, even if they don't have a conventional multichannel TV subscription. The most notable example is our HBO OTT service, which we're on track to launch later this year. We think there is a big opportunity for us to reach broadband-only consumers and to reduce the friction of subscribing to HBO for multichannel subs that don't currently have the service. We look forward to sharing more details about the service closer to launch. 
But HBO's OTT product is only one element of our digital strategy. At Turner, CNN Digital grew both average monthly video streams and mobile uniques by more than 30% in 2014. And Turner's Bleacher Report averaged 39 million monthly unique visitors, becoming the #2 digital sports destination in the U.S. 
We have carried that momentum into 2015. All 5 of Turner's most important networks were included in DISH's Sling TV service, making up more than 1/3 of the channels at launch. CNN and Bleacher Report were 2 of Snapchat's launch partners for its Discover feature. And last month, Warner's announced that it will be launching an SVOD service in Southeast Asia in partnership with Singtel and Sony Pictures Television. That's another opportunity for Warner's to use new distribution platforms to grow its business in Asia, where it already has a significant stake in Hollywood VIP. That's a rapidly growing SVOD service in China, which recently expanded its content offering to include HBO programming. 
You will also see us investing in our advertising business by rolling out advanced products that provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting they're coming to expect. We started that process last year when we began selling based on consumer behavior rather than just the traditional age and gender demographics. This year, we're going to take that one step further. For the first time, we will have one joint upfront for all of our networks and will provide our best partners the ability to buy behavior-based inventory across all of our networks and digital platforms. We started talking to our partners about this at CES last month, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Combining the reach and quality environment of TV with the analytics and targeting of digital is the Holy Grail for advertisers. And if we do that successfully, we think we can take share back from digital competitors over time. 
So clearly, there is a lot of change occurring in our industry, but we're more confident than ever in our position. That confidence stems from our belief that the very best video content is becoming more valuable to both consumers and to our advertising and distribution partners. We produce more of that great content than anybody, which was evident once again in 2014. 
It's award season, so let's start there. We received 13 Academy Award nominations this year, including a Best Picture nomination for American Sniper. In true Warner Bros. fashion, this film has been both a commercial and a critical success. After opening in select theaters on Christmas Day, it shattered records when it went live last month, including the biggest January opening ever. And last year, we also released The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, which was the final installment of the epic trilogy by Peter Jackson. Through last week, the movie had brought in well over $900 million at the global box office, and that brings the total for The Lord of the Rings franchise to close to $6 billion. That gives Warner's 2 of the top 4 global film franchises in history, including the biggest ever in Harry Potter. 
No one manages film franchises better than Warner's, and they're at the core of its film strategy going forward. Warner's has laid out the most ambitious slate in its history, which, starting in 2016, will be built around DC Comics, LEGO and the world of Harry Potter. And we couldn't be more excited and confident in the opportunity it has, not only to drive growth at the box office, but also to significantly expand its ancillary business. 
None of that should overshadow Warner's continued leadership in television production. Warner's has more than 60 series airing for the 2014 to '15 season, including the most prime time series on broadcast of any studio for the 11th time in the past 12 seasons. This season was particularly notable for Warner's' mining of the DC library, which gave rise to 2 of this year's bona fide new hits: Gotham and The Flash. And The Flash is just 1 of 3 DC shows on the CW, with their presence helping the CW to broaden its audience and grow its ratings this season. 
DC is also a major driver of our games business, including last year's release of LEGO Batman 3. That will continue in 2015 with the highly anticipated release of the final installment of the Batman Arkham Trilogy. Along with the release of Mortal Kombat X and a new mobile game based on Game of Thrones, that should propel Warner's' game business to a record year in 2015. 
Now going back for a moment to the multiplex. Last week, HBO concluded a limited IMAX run for 2 episodes of its monster hit, Game of Thrones. That's HBO's most-watched series ever. It was the first television show to ever screen at an IMAX theater, and that's a testament to the anticipation for Thrones' upcoming fifth season, as well as to HBO's creative excellence. 
Last year, HBO received 19 Primetime Emmys, including 5 for True Detective, its most-watched freshman series ever. And HBO's content superiority translated into close to 3 million additional domestic subscribers. That's its highest growth in domestic subs in over 3 decades. 
In 2015, HBO plans to raise its game again with returning hits like True Detective, Veep, Silicon Valley, The Leftovers and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, as well as adding several new series like Westworld, which is the second HBO drama produced by Warner Bros.; and The Brink, a comedy series starring Tim Robbins and Jack Black; and Ballers, starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. 
As we start this year, we also have a lot of momentum at Turner. In 2014, TBS, TNT and Adult Swim claimed 3 of the top 10 spots in prime time among adults 18 to 49. TBS was the #2 ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. And TNT was home to 6 of the top 15 original series on ad-supported cable. That's more than any other network. And that included 3 new hits in The Last Ship, The Librarians and Murder in the First. That's strong evidence that its emphasis on more distinctive original programming is starting to work. 
2014 was also an important year for our sports business with Turner extending its partnership with the NBA through 2025 and kicking off its new agreement with Major League Baseball. And we dipped our toe into the water with sports internationally by obtaining the UEFA Champions League rights in Brazil, which will cement the must-have status of our recently acquired sports network, Esporte Interativo. 
Adult Swim continued to attract the largest audiences of young adults, including the top 2 new shows among adults 18 to 34, Attack on Titan and Black Jesus. That's the type of programming that helped Adult Swim to be ranked as the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 34 for the 10th consecutive year, as well as being the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 49. 
And the network it shares a channel with, Cartoon Network, is on an absolute roll. In a year where most kids' networks were down double digits, Cartoon grew its audience in kids 6 to 11, and we gained momentum through the year. In the fourth quarter, Cartoon grew ratings in its key demos by solid double digits, and that's a trend that's continued into the first quarter of this year. 
Despite these successes, we know we can do better, in particular, at TBS and TNT. And we're confident that with new leadership in place and a focus on distinctive original programming, we will do better. The success of CNN is a great example of how the right management and the right programming strategy can drive growth even in the face of challenging industry trends. 
In 2014, CNN grew its prime time ratings in adults 25 to 54, while MSNBC registered double-digit declines. And CNN had an average total day monthly reach of almost 77 million total viewers, the largest cumulative audience of any cable news network. CNN took share by going deeper on the biggest stories, revamping key data points like morning and expanding its innovative lineup of original prime time series based around talent like Anthony Bourdain, Morgan Spurlock, Lisa Ling and Mike Rowe. Its original programming also helped CNN draw, by far, the youngest medium prime time audience among its cable news rivals and match its youngest on record. CNN's strong performance has continued into 2015, with its ratings in adults 25 to 54 up 70% in January compared to double-digit declines for MSNBC. And CNN will look to build on that success by further expanding its lineup of originals this year. Developing a robust slate of must-have programming is a process that takes time, but that's one of the things our company does best, and we're confident in the team at Turner, their strategy and their ability to drive increased viewership across platforms as they execute on the plans they're putting in place. 
Before I turn it over to Howard, I want to emphasize that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute on the ambitious strategy and growth plans we shared with you last October. We're proud of our track record of industry-leading adjusted EPS growth and shareholder returns over the past 5 or 6 years. But 2015 is really our first full year as the new Time Warner, and we're just getting underway. We're mindful of the challenges ahead of us, but we've done a lot of work to get to the right structure, the right management and the right strategy so that we're positioned to lead the industry and continue to deliver superior value to our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Howard."
24689,281164035,760170,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with how we ended the year and the progress we're making on the long",3179,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with how we ended the year and the progress we're making on the long-term targets we discussed at our Investor Day. As we look out over the next several years, we continue to expect that solid revenue growth, attractive margin expansion and accelerating growth in adjusted OI will, on average, lead to high teens growth in adjusted EPS. 
In 2014, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 18%, our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. That's in line with our updated guidance and exceeded the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, adjusted EPS included a net benefit of $0.10 from the tax matters and programming, restructuring and severance charges that we previously discussed with you. Including the additional restructuring and programming charges we took in the fourth quarter and net of intercompany eliminations, we incurred $469 million of restructuring and severance charges and $388 million of programming charges in the second half of 2014. We're expecting the restructuring actions to translate into run rate savings of close to $500 million, most of which will come in 2015. That will free up resources to invest even more in content and position us to accelerate our revenue growth in the coming years while also continuing to expand margins. Those actions were consistent with our ongoing focus on expense management. 
Excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from both periods, total expenses increased only 3% for the year, despite our continued investments in great content. And about 100 basis points of that growth was due to the international consolidations at HBO and Warner's' acquisition of Eyeworks. 
Total SG&A declined slightly for the year. We also had another strong year of cash flow, which was up 12%. Free cash flow per share was up an even more impressive 19%, benefiting from our ongoing share repurchase program. In 2014, we repurchased $5.5 billion of our shares, a significant acceleration from the prior year. Combined with $1.1 billion in dividends, we returned $6.6 billion to shareholders during the year. And as evidenced by the dividend increase we announced this morning, we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders going forward. So we had another good year of financial performance in 2014 and returned a substantial amount of capital to shareholders while also making great progress in positioning the company for strong growth in the years to come. 
I have one additional item to note regarding our 2014 results. One of our equity method investments is currently undergoing an international tax audit. If there are any material developments with this situation prior to the filing of our Form 10-K at the end of the month, we may be required to update our results to reflect their final 2014 earnings. 
Moving on. This morning, we provided our outlook for 2015. We anticipate another year of very attractive growth with adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 a share, which implies mid-teens growth when excluding the $0.10 benefit to 2014 I noted earlier. So we expect good growth despite foreign currency swings that, at current rates, would result in a year-over-year drag of approximately $0.20 to $0.25. And we'll do that as we continue to invest aggressively in content to position the company to accelerate revenue growth in 2016. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we ended 2014 with a record fourth quarter for revenues and adjusted operating income. Just as important, we continued to make progress in positioning Turner to accelerate growth over the next several years and beyond. 
Subscription revenues increased 5% for the quarter and 7% for the year. And that included an FX headwind of close to 200 basis points in the quarter and approximately 100 basis points for the year. Without that, international Subscription revenue would have increased double digits for both periods due to continued positive trends in Latin America. 
Domestic Subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. But excluding the impact from our dispute with DISH, domestic Subscription revenues would have increased in the high single digits, similar to our growth for the full year. And that reflected the positive impact of our current domestic renewal cycle. We anticipate completing new deals with the remainder of our top 10 affiliates by the end of this year and -- which should drive very attractive growth in our Subscription revenue over the next several years. 
Largely as a result of timing of those renewals, and as we indicated to you in the past, we will not see the same benefit from domestic renewals in 2015 that we saw in 2014. At current rates, we also expect headwinds of around 300 basis points from foreign currency movements, including the move to the Sicad 2 rate in Venezuela. Taking into account those factors, we anticipate Subscription revenue growth will slow materially this year before reaccelerating well into the double digits in 2016 and beyond. 
Moving on. Advertising revenues declined 1% in 4Q, similar to our expectations coming into the quarter, but were up 1% for the year. The fourth quarter included a drag of close to 500 basis points as a result of airing fewer Major League Baseball playoff games, foreign currency movements and the impact from DISH. Absent those, ad revenue would have grown in the quarter. 
Domestic advertising declined modestly in the quarter. And that included a decline in domestic entertainment, including young adults, which was partly offset by healthy growth at news, where we continued to benefit from positive ratings momentum and very strong trends in our digital business. 
Excluding the impact of FX, international advertising increased in the high single digits with growth across all regions. 
Looking to 2015, current rates imply about a 200 basis point drag on advertising from foreign currency movements, including the move to the Sicad 2 rate in Venezuela. In the first quarter, we are seeing a modest improvement in the domestic environment. Scatter pricing is pacing up mid- to high single digits over the upfront, while volume remains moderate. Putting all those factors together, we anticipate total advertising revenues to be about flat. 
Excluding programming and restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly in the quarter and 5% for the year. And without those same charges, programming expenses increased 2% in the quarter and 7% for the year. That reflects our ongoing investments in both sports and original programming, which we expect will generate attractive returns over the next several years. 
Looking through the charges I just discussed, we limited total expense growth to 4% in 2014. And that was a result of keeping SG&A costs flat, reflecting our commitment to tightly managing our nonprogramming expenses in order to direct additional resources to key programming. 
So in 2014, we continued to execute our plan at Turner, and we feel we've laid the groundwork to expand margins and grow the business at very attractive rates over the next several years. 
Turning to HBO, where we had another year of solid growth in both revenues and adjusted operating income. 
Subscription revenues were up 5% in the quarter and 8% for the year. The consolidations of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributed about 300 basis points to the full year growth. As a reminder, we had fully lapped both consolidations before the start of the fourth quarter. 
Domestically, we had steady Subscription revenue growth throughout the year. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO and Cinemax together added over 2.8 million domestic subscribers in 2014. That's the best domestic sub growth in over 3 decades. As we've previously discussed, most of these subscriber additions are nonrevenue-generating. Still, we saw some improvement in the subscriber mix in 2014, which contributed to a modest acceleration in domestic Subscription revenue growth. And we expect a further acceleration in that growth over the next few years. 
Turning to content and other revenues, which increased 14% in the quarter and 24% for the year. That was boosted by a record year in home video, led by sales of season 3 of Game of Thrones. HBO's licensing deal with Amazon also contributed to the strong full year results. 
Across HBO's international operations, including unconsolidated JVs, we increased revenues double digits in 2014. And that included growth in both our licensing and Networks business. International subscriber trends also remained strong, growing double digits across most regions. Sub growth was especially strong in Latin America and Europe in 2014. 
Adjusted operating income declined 5% in the quarter. And that was largely due to the timing of theatrical expenses and investments in original programming, which drove mid-teens growth in programming expenses. 
Marketing expenses were also higher in the quarter as we continued to invest in the brand. 
For the full year, programming costs were up in the high single digits when excluding the international consolidations. To help fund that investment, HBO remains focused on constraining nonprogramming expenses. And excluding the international consolidations, we limited SG&A growth to 1% in 2014. 
Despite the drop in the fourth quarter and higher restructuring charges, adjusted operating income grew 7% for the year. So we had another year of solid growth, and we continued the subscriber momentum we've had over the past few years, both domestically and internationally. 
Given the strong demand for the product globally, we feel very good about our ability to further accelerate growth over the next several years. 
Now on to Warner Bros. If we're excluding restructuring and severance charges, 2014 would have been another record year for adjusted operating income. And we achieved that thanks to continued growth in the TV business and our focus on cost containment. 2014 also benefited from a patent license and settlement agreement. 
On the TV side, revenues grew double digits in the fourth quarter, capping off a great year. Internationally, Warner's continues to benefit from the growing demand for high-quality TV content from both linear and SVOD buyers. We're also seeing growth in local production from Eyeworks, the acquisition we completed earlier in 2014. And domestically, Warner's remains the industry leader in prime time series produced for broadcast networks for the 2014, 2015 TV season. So the trends in TV production remain positive, and we're confident we can continue to grow this business over the next several years. 
Theatrically, coming into the year, we knew we had tough comps, especially in the fourth quarter, and that played out as expected with revenue declining for both the quarter and the year. But we're off to a terrific start in 2015 with the success of American Sniper. And longer term, we think we have the strongest slate in the history of the company. So overall, we feel really good about the outlook for our theatrical business. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 12% for the year, in part due to a softer slate. That was roughly in line with the overall market, which was down 7%, excluding SVOD. However, we continue to see positive trends in digital across both theatrical and television product, with electronic sell-through revenue up 40% for the year. 
On the expense side, consistent with our company-wide focus on efficiency, Warner continues to tightly manage overhead costs. Excluding restructuring and severance charges for both periods, total expenses increased less than 2%, and SG&A was down 4% for the year. 
As we head into 2015, we'll start to see the benefit from the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter, which we expect to contribute to margin expansion over time. 
So on the whole, Warner's had a very good year. And with our slate of franchised films starting in 2016 and the strong secular demand for high-quality TV content, we feel we're in great position to grow Warner's at attractive rates for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to the next slide. We had another year of strong free cash flow generation, growing free cash flow 12% to $3.5 billion. As you can see on this slide, we've broken out the programming, restructuring and severance charges incurred in the second half of 2014, which had a significant impact on adjusted operating income 
Our cash taxes increased primarily due to lower foreign tax credits. Cash interest increased as a result of the additional debt we issued during the year. And the improvement in working capital was primarily due to lower participations at Warner Bros. 
Looking to 2015, keep in mind that we will have approximately $300 million of severance payments related to the restructuring actions we took this past year. In addition, we expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash, primarily due to the large syndication sale at Warner's. All that aside, we still anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation. And we expect to continue converting a very high percentage of our earning into free cash flow in the years to come. 
Looking at our balance sheet. We ended 2014 with $19.9 billion of net debt, up $1.6 billion compared to the end of 2013. That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, during 2014, we repurchased $5.5 billion in shares and, combined with our dividend, returned $6.6 billion in total to shareholders. 
During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2 billion of long-term debt at very favorable rates. 
On the M&A front, we invested just under $1 billion in 2014. The majority of that was directed towards our financing arrangements with CME and our acquisition of Eyeworks' international television operations. Due to the programming, restructuring and severance charges in the second half of the year, our net leverage ratio was around 3x at the end of 2014. However, excluding those charges, our net leverage ratio would have been 2.7x, slightly below our target level. 
One item to keep in mind in terms of our use of capital during the next few years will be the cash payments related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. The majority of these payments will be recognized in investing activities, including a few hundred million dollars in 2015. On balance, I'm pleased with how we executed on our capital plan in 2014. And as we look ahead, neither our philosophy nor our processes around capital allocation have changed, so you can expect us to remain very disciplined and balanced in our approach to capital allocation. 
We remain committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade credit ratings and are comfortable with our net leverage target of 2.75x. We continue to believe that target provides us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, engage in strategic M&A and provide direct returns to shareholders, while at the same time optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. 
In 2015, we expect to deliver really attractive growth in adjusted operating income and another year of solid double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And we expect that will be as a result of strong growth across all of our divisions. Before getting into the details, please note that my comments will be based on 2014 results, excluding the programming, restructuring and severance charges taken in the second half of the year. 
At Turner, we'll benefit from around $200 million in savings from the restructuring efforts and more modest programming expense growth, as our NASCAR deal ended in 2014. Those factors should translate into healthy margin expansion. While we continue to see positive underlying trends internationally, the strong dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela will provide headwinds. Nonetheless, we anticipate a return to very healthy adjusted operating income growth, which is evidence of our continued ability to manage our cost structure to drive attractive growth even in years with more modest top line trends. 
At HBO, we continue to see strong demand for our services globally, and that should result in continued solid Subscription revenue growth. And along with disciplined expense management, we anticipate that we will drive a significant acceleration in adjusted operating income growth in 2015. As we've previously discussed, we plan to launch an ""over-the-top"" service domestically this year and will provide more color on those plans as we get closer to launching. 
At Warner Bros., we anticipate revenue growth to be led by our TV syndication slate, which includes 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest. We also have a robust slate of videogames anchored by key franchise releases, Batman Arkham and Mortal Kombat. So we expect strong revenue growth combined with cost savings from the restructurings to translate into very attractive adjusted operating income growth and another record year at Warner's. 
So looking across all 3 segments, we're set up for a very good year from an operating perspective. And that's despite an expected drag on adjusted operating income of approximately $250 million to $300 million as a result of the strength in the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela. That impact will primarily show up at Turner and Warner Bros. and equates to approximately $0.20 to $0.25 at the adjusted EPS level, which we have factored into our outlook. 
It's also worth noting that intercompany eliminations will be a material drag this year due to increased content sales from Warner Bros. to HBO and Turner, including the syndication sale of 2 Broke Girls. 
In addition, we started to recognize 100% of CME's losses in our equity income in the fourth quarter as a result of our accumulated net losses exceeding the book value of our common stock investments. For context, in 2014, this change would have resulted in an additional $0.05 negative impact to adjusted EPS. 
In terms of cadence, we expect 2015 adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, given the timing of both syndication availabilities and this year's theatrical slate at Warner Bros. 
Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2015, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 or mid-teens growth when excluding the second half restructuring and programming charges and tax matters we noted earlier. And that's despite the negative impact of foreign exchange that I just noted. At the same time, our continued investments in high-quality video content and our industry-leading brands will position us for accelerating revenue growth in 2016, so we continue to expect high teens adjusted EPS growth, on average, through 2018 and remain on track to hit the financial targets we shared with you at our Investor Day in October. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

There has been a lot of focus on affiliate revenue growth for Turner Networks.

And for Jeff, you expressed a lot of confidence in achieving 2016 EPS guidance. But I think some investors are still uncertain with all the cross-currents right now for affiliate revenue. You've got Sling TV and cord-cutting, cord-shaving, the DISH outage in October. So I'm just curious, how many of the top 10 renewals are left to be completed? And what drives your confidence in hitting your 2016 and beyond affiliate revenue goals?"

And let me go into some of the reasons, and then John and Howard will pick up from there. We did see some sub declines last year in the basic cable universe, and we have planned for modest declines to continue. And I think, as everyone knows, ad growth has been very muted, but we still see very strong consumer demand for multichannel TV and increasing viewing across all the platforms. And we think that TV and video remains the best platform for reaching a mass audience for advertisers. We also see that multichannel revenues are also still growing at a healthy clip, so we think there is pretty good opportunity for continued growth. We're working closely with all our distributors to improve the consumer value proposition. That means more and more vibrant VOD offerings from all the networks. It means providing stacking rights for original series, and that would be another example where I think we -- HBO has all its series up, pretty much. Turner has all of its series up. And we think more SVOD -- I mean, more VOD and more and better user interfaces are going to make a difference in all of the retention, basically, of multichannel TV. We're also moving aggressively to provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting that they're coming to expect. And we think that, as we do that more successfully, we're going to take that share from digital competitors over time. Beyond the traditional ecosystem, we think there's a lot of opportunity for companies like ours that specialize in high-quality content, not just in the U.S., but also globally. But if you just go back to the United States, Sling TV is one example of increased value and opportunity for networks like ours. HBO ""over-the-top"" is another example. So on the whole, we think the value of that content and of our networks is growing. And we think some of the changes that all of us are beginning to see in having more flexible consumer offerings are going to support the value of the best networks and the strongest brands. That's basically why we see ourselves on track for our targets in '16 and '18. And John and Howard, I think you have a few things to add."

With regard to the rhythm of our affiliate contracts, we've got 7 of the top 10 affiliates closed, and we intend to close the remaining deals this year. As we've reported in the past, everything is going exactly in accordance with plan. We are achieving the rate increases and the terms that we've been seeking. And this year, in the multiyear overall cycle, we fully anticipated and we've communicated before that there will be somewhat of a moderation in Subscriber revenue growth, but then it's going to pick back up beyond '15. I think it's important, though, when you look at the longer-term trends of multichannel in the U.S. to understand that the evidence that we see clearly indicates that the main reason why people are leaving the multichannel universe, let's call them cord-cutters, is because they either can't afford it or they don't think there's enough value in the offerings that are currently being provided to them by the MVPDs. We also believe that a portion of that community would like to sign back up for multichannel TV if their offerings were comprised of more affordable and greater flexibility. I think Sling, as Jeff said, is a great example, but I think it's important to understand that it's the first example. A lot of the economy packs that the MVPDs are currently offering are based more on whether the contracts allow for them, and they're based more on cost, and they're offered as retention tools as opposed to proactive marketing opportunities. I think that's going to change over time. And we've been saying for a long time that there's too many channels in existence today, and the approach that Time Warner and Turner have taken over the years of investing heavily in a core group of channels, we think, is going to really pay handsome dividends in the future, as we have 2 of the top 5, 3 of the top 10 networks, and 85% of our affiliate fees are comprised in the top 4. And we're pleased to be in the Sling initial offering. So we're quite optimistic about how things are going to continue to evolve over time, and we're quite optimistic about the hand that we have in terms of the value of the networks."

First of all, the performance on Prime and everything we've heard from our friends in Amazon has exceeded even their expectations in terms of usage and customer satisfaction. We said at the beginning that, in addition to helping us monetize some of our library -- remember, it's windowed at 3 years, we thought it was a wonderful opportunity to have some of the 70 million non-HBO homes have a chance to sample some of our best programming. We think that only has the catalytic effect of driving people back to the network. And listen, we had the biggest sub growth last year any time in 30 years, and I think there's a lot of factors that contributed to that. But Amazon, I think, might have been one of them because people have an opportunity to see what they previously haven't seen. So it's been a tremendously positive relationship for us, which we expect to continue."

Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. 
Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

24689,281164035,763586,"Time Warner Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. 2014 was another year of strong financial performance for our company, with solid revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. That's our sixth straight year of at least high teens adjusted EPS g",2257,"Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. 
2014 was another year of strong financial performance for our company, with solid revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. That's our sixth straight year of at least high teens adjusted EPS growth, and it's consistent with our plan to reach close to $6 in adjusted EPS in 2016 and over $8 in 2018. We also grew free cash flow by 12% to $3.5 billion, and we returned more than $6.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. 
And as we announced this morning, we anticipate another year of very good growth in adjusted EPS in 2015. We are also committed to building on our strong record of providing direct returns to shareholders, which have totaled more than $26 billion since 2008. You can see evidence of this commitment in the 10% increase in our dividend approved by our board. That's also the sixth straight year we've raised the dividend by double digits. So we expect another great year in 2015, and that's in the context of an industry where, like all of you, we see the pace of change accelerating. 
Consumers' appetite for high-quality video content is increasing globally, but we're in the midst of a secular shift to on-demand consumption. At the same time, advertisers' expectations for data, analytics and targeting are also increasing. These changes create new challenges for our industry, but we think they are also creating big opportunities for the producers of the very best video content. In fact, we have spent the last several years positioning ourselves to take advantage of these trends. 
In 2014, we completed our transformation into a more focused, nimble and collaborative video content company that takes better advantage of our leading brands and our global scale at Warner Bros., Turner and HBO. We also finished the transition to a new generation of CEOs at each of our divisions. And we continue to invest even more in the very best content. In 2014, we invested $14.5 billion in programming, production and marketing. That's up about $3 billion compared to just 5 years earlier. And we expect that to grow to around $19 billion a year over the next several years. That investment is going into increased original programming at HBO and Turner; into high-profile sports like the NBA, NCAA March Madness and Major League Baseball; and also into the biggest film and TV franchises at Warner's. And those investments will continue to pay dividends in the years to come as the demand for high-quality on-demand video content grows. 
We also continue to invest resources in improving the user experience in order to increase the value we're providing to our distribution partners and to consumers of multichannel television. Last year, we launched CNN Go, the most advanced multiplatform news product on the market. We expanded HBO GO to additional platforms, including Amazon Fire, PS3 and Xbox One. And we started to make stacking rights available for some of our biggest hits at Turner. 
At the same time, we're increasingly investing outside the traditional TV ecosystem to help ensure that consumers can access our great content wherever, whenever and on whatever device they choose, even if they don't have a conventional multichannel TV subscription. The most notable example is our HBO OTT service, which we're on track to launch later this year. We think there is a big opportunity for us to reach broadband-only consumers and to reduce the friction of subscribing to HBO for multichannel subs that don't currently have the service. We look forward to sharing more details about the service closer to launch. 
But HBO's OTT product is only one element of our digital strategy. At Turner, CNN Digital grew both average monthly video streams and mobile uniques by more than 30% in 2014. And Turner's Bleacher Report averaged 39 million monthly unique visitors, becoming the #2 digital sports destination in the U.S. 
We have carried that momentum into 2015. All 5 of Turner's most important networks were included in DISH's Sling TV service, making up more than 1/3 of the channels at launch. CNN and Bleacher Report were 2 of Snapchat's launch partners for its Discover feature. And last month, Warner's announced that it will be launching an SVOD service in Southeast Asia in partnership with Singtel and Sony Pictures Television. That's another opportunity for Warner's to use new distribution platforms to grow its business in Asia, where it already has a significant stake in Hollywood VIP. That's a rapidly growing SVOD service in China, which recently expanded its content offering to include HBO programming. 
You will also see us investing in our advertising business by rolling out advanced products that provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting they're coming to expect. We started that process last year when we began selling based on consumer behavior rather than just the traditional age and gender demographics. This year, we're going to take that one step further. For the first time, we will have one joint upfront for all of our networks and will provide our best partners the ability to buy behavior-based inventory across all of our networks and digital platforms. We started talking to our partners about this at CES last month, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Combining the reach and quality environment of TV with the analytics and targeting of digital is the Holy Grail for advertisers. And if we do that successfully, we think we can take share back from digital competitors over time. 
So clearly, there is a lot of change occurring in our industry, but we're more confident than ever in our position. That confidence stems from our belief that the very best video content is becoming more valuable to both consumers and to our advertising and distribution partners. We produce more of that great content than anybody, which was evident once again in 2014. 
It's award season, so let's start there. We received 13 Academy Award nominations this year, including a Best Picture nomination for American Sniper. In true Warner Bros. fashion, this film has been both a commercial and a critical success. After opening in select theaters on Christmas Day, it shattered records when it went live last month, including the biggest January opening ever. And last year, we also released The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, which was the final installment of the epic trilogy by Peter Jackson. Through last week, the movie had brought in well over $900 million at the global box office, and that brings the total for The Lord of the Rings franchise to close to $6 billion. That gives Warner's 2 of the top 4 global film franchises in history, including the biggest ever in Harry Potter. 
No one manages film franchises better than Warner's, and they're at the core of its film strategy going forward. Warner's has laid out the most ambitious slate in its history, which, starting in 2016, will be built around DC Comics, LEGO and the world of Harry Potter. And we couldn't be more excited and confident in the opportunity it has, not only to drive growth at the box office, but also to significantly expand its ancillary business. 
None of that should overshadow Warner's continued leadership in television production. Warner's has more than 60 series airing for the 2014 to '15 season, including the most prime time series on broadcast of any studio for the 11th time in the past 12 seasons. This season was particularly notable for Warner's' mining of the DC library, which gave rise to 2 of this year's bona fide new hits: Gotham and The Flash. And The Flash is just 1 of 3 DC shows on the CW, with their presence helping the CW to broaden its audience and grow its ratings this season. 
DC is also a major driver of our games business, including last year's release of LEGO Batman 3. That will continue in 2015 with the highly anticipated release of the final installment of the Batman Arkham Trilogy. Along with the release of Mortal Kombat X and a new mobile game based on Game of Thrones, that should propel Warner's' game business to a record year in 2015. 
Now going back for a moment to the multiplex. Last week, HBO concluded a limited IMAX run for 2 episodes of its monster hit, Game of Thrones. That's HBO's most-watched series ever. It was the first television show to ever screen at an IMAX theater, and that's a testament to the anticipation for Thrones' upcoming fifth season as well as to HBO's creative excellence. 
Last year, HBO received 19 Primetime Emmys, including 5 for True Detective, its most-watched freshman series ever. And HBO's content superiority translated into close to 3 million additional domestic subscribers. That's its highest growth in domestic subs in over 3 decades. 
In 2015, HBO plans to raise its game again with returning hits like True Detective, Veep, Silicon Valley, The Leftovers and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver as well as adding several new series like Westworld, which is the second HBO drama produced by Warner Bros.; and The Brink, a comedy series starring Tim Robbins and Jack Black; and Ballers, starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. 
As we start this year, we also have a lot of momentum at Turner. In 2014, TBS, TNT and Adult Swim claimed 3 of the top 10 spots in prime time among adults 18 to 49. TBS was the #2 ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. And TNT was home to 6 of the top 15 original series on ad-supported cable. That's more than any other network. And that included 3 new hits in The Last Ship, The Librarians and Murder in the First. That's strong evidence that its emphasis on more distinctive original programming is starting to work. 
2014 was also an important year for our sports business with Turner extending its partnership with the NBA through 2025 and kicking off its new agreement with Major League Baseball. And we dipped our toe into the water with sports internationally by obtaining the UEFA Champions League rights in Brazil, which will cement the must-have status of our recently acquired sports network, Esporte Interativo. 
Adult Swim continued to attract the largest audiences of young adults, including the top 2 new shows among adults 18 to 34, Attack on Titan and Black Jesus. That's the type of programming that helped Adult Swim to be ranked as the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 34 for the 10th consecutive year as well as being the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 49. 
And the network it shares a channel with, Cartoon Network, is on an absolute roll. In a year where most kids' networks were down double digits, Cartoon grew its audience in kids 6 to 11, and we gained momentum through the year. In the fourth quarter, Cartoon grew ratings in its key demos by solid double digits, and that's a trend that's continued into the first quarter of this year. 
Despite these successes, we know we can do better, in particular, at TBS and TNT. And we're confident that with new leadership in place and a focus on distinctive original programming, we will do better. The success of CNN is a great example of how the right management and the right programming strategy can drive growth even in the face of challenging industry trends. 
In 2014, CNN grew its prime time ratings in adults 25 to 54, while MSNBC registered double-digit declines. And CNN had an average total day monthly reach of almost 77 million total viewers, the largest cumulative audience of any cable news network. CNN took share by going deeper on the biggest stories, revamping key data points like morning and expanding its innovative lineup of original prime time series based around talent like Anthony Bourdain, Morgan Spurlock, Lisa Ling and Mike Rowe. Its original programming also helped CNN draw, by far, the youngest medium prime time audience among its cable news rivals and match its youngest on record. CNN's strong performance has continued into 2015, with its ratings in adults 25 to 54 up 70% in January compared to double-digit declines for MSNBC. And CNN will look to build on that success by further expanding its lineup of originals this year. Developing a robust slate of must-have programming is a process that takes time, but that's one of the things our company does best, and we're confident in the team at Turner, their strategy and their ability to drive increased viewership across platforms as they execute on the plans they're putting in place. 
Before I turn it over to Howard, I want to emphasize that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute on the ambitious strategy and growth plans we shared with you last October. We're proud of our track record of industry-leading adjusted EPS growth and shareholder returns over the past 5 or 6 years. But 2015 is really our first full year as the new Time Warner, and we're just getting underway. We're mindful of the challenges ahead of us, but we've done a lot of work to get to the right structure, the right management and the right strategy so that we're positioned to lead the industry and continue to deliver superior value to our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Howard."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with how we ended the year and the progress we're making on the long",3179,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. We're pleased with how we ended the year and the progress we're making on the long-term targets we discussed at our Investor Day. As we look out over the next several years, we continue to expect that solid revenue growth, attractive margin expansion and accelerating growth in adjusted OI will, on average, lead to high teens growth in adjusted EPS. 
In 2014, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 18%, our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. That's in line with our updated guidance and exceeded the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, adjusted EPS included a net benefit of $0.10 from the tax matters and programming, restructuring and severance charges that we previously discussed with you. Including the additional restructuring and programming charges we took in the fourth quarter and net of intercompany eliminations, we incurred $469 million of restructuring and severance charges and $388 million of programming charges in the second half of 2014. We're expecting the restructuring actions to translate into run rate savings of close to $500 million, most of which will come in 2015. That will free up resources to invest even more in content and position us to accelerate our revenue growth in the coming years while also continuing to expand margins. Those actions were consistent with our ongoing focus on expense management. 
Excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from both periods, total expenses increased only 3% for the year, despite our continued investments in great content. And about 100 basis points of that growth was due to the international consolidations at HBO and Warner's' acquisition of Eyeworks. 
Total SG&A declined slightly for the year. We also had another strong year of cash flow, which was up 12%. Free cash flow per share was up an even more impressive 19%, benefiting from our ongoing share repurchase program. In 2014, we repurchased $5.5 billion of our shares, a significant acceleration from the prior year. Combined with $1.1 billion in dividends, we returned $6.6 billion to shareholders during the year. And as evidenced by the dividend increase we announced this morning, we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders going forward. So we had another good year of financial performance in 2014 and returned a substantial amount of capital to shareholders while also making great progress in positioning the company for strong growth in the years to come. 
I have one additional item to note regarding our 2014 results. One of our equity method investments is currently undergoing an international tax audit. If there are any material developments with this situation prior to the filing of our Form 10-K at the end of the month, we may be required to update our results to reflect their final 2014 earnings. 
Moving on. This morning, we provided our outlook for 2015. We anticipate another year of very attractive growth with adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 a share, which implies mid-teens growth when excluding the $0.10 benefit to 2014 I noted earlier. So we expect good growth despite foreign currency swings that, at current rates, would result in a year-over-year drag of approximately $0.20 to $0.25. And we'll do that as we continue to invest aggressively in content to position the company to accelerate revenue growth in 2016. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we ended 2014 with a record fourth quarter for revenues and adjusted operating income. Just as important, we continued to make progress in positioning Turner to accelerate growth over the next several years and beyond. 
Subscription revenues increased 5% for the quarter and 7% for the year. And that included an FX headwind of close to 200 basis points in the quarter and approximately 100 basis points for the year. Without that, international Subscription revenue would have increased double digits for both periods due to continued positive trends in Latin America. 
Domestic Subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. But excluding the impact from our dispute with DISH, domestic Subscription revenues would have increased in the high single digits, similar to our growth for the full year. And that reflected the positive impact of our current domestic renewal cycle. We anticipate completing new deals with the remainder of our top 10 affiliates by the end of this year and -- which should drive very attractive growth in our Subscription revenue over the next several years. 
Largely as a result of timing of those renewals, and as we indicated to you in the past, we will not see the same benefit from domestic renewals in 2015 that we saw in 2014. At current rates, we also expect headwinds of around 300 basis points from foreign currency movements, including the move to the Sicad 2 rate in Venezuela. Taking into account those factors, we anticipate Subscription revenue growth will slow materially this year before reaccelerating well into the double digits in 2016 and beyond. 
Moving on. Advertising revenues declined 1% in 4Q, similar to our expectations coming into the quarter, but were up 1% for the year. The fourth quarter included a drag of close to 500 basis points as a result of airing fewer Major League Baseball playoff games, foreign currency movements and the impact from DISH. Absent those, ad revenue would have grown in the quarter. 
Domestic advertising declined modestly in the quarter. And that included a decline in domestic entertainment, including young adults, which was partly offset by healthy growth at news, where we continued to benefit from positive ratings momentum and very strong trends in our digital business. 
Excluding the impact of FX, international advertising increased in the high single digits with growth across all regions. 
Looking to 2015, current rates imply about a 200 basis point drag on advertising from foreign currency movements, including the move to the Sicad 2 rate in Venezuela. In the first quarter, we are seeing a modest improvement in the domestic environment. Scatter pricing is pacing up mid- to high single digits over the upfront, while volume remains moderate. Putting all those factors together, we anticipate total advertising revenues to be about flat. 
Excluding programming and restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly in the quarter and 5% for the year. And without those same charges, programming expenses increased 2% in the quarter and 7% for the year. That reflects our ongoing investments in both sports and original programming, which we expect will generate attractive returns over the next several years. 
Looking through the charges I just discussed, we limited total expense growth to 4% in 2014. And that was a result of keeping SG&A costs flat, reflecting our commitment to tightly managing our nonprogramming expenses in order to direct additional resources to key programming. 
So in 2014, we continued to execute our plan at Turner, and we feel we've laid the groundwork to expand margins and grow the business at very attractive rates over the next several years. 
Turning to HBO, where we had another year of solid growth in both revenues and adjusted operating income. 
Subscription revenues were up 5% in the quarter and 8% for the year. The consolidations of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributed about 300 basis points to the full year growth. As a reminder, we had fully lapped both consolidations before the start of the fourth quarter. 
Domestically, we had steady Subscription revenue growth throughout the year. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO and Cinemax together added over 2.8 million domestic subscribers in 2014. That's the best domestic sub growth in over 3 decades. As we've previously discussed, most of these subscriber additions are nonrevenue-generating. Still, we saw some improvement in the subscriber mix in 2014, which contributed to a modest acceleration in domestic Subscription revenue growth. And we expect a further acceleration in that growth over the next few years. 
Turning to content and other revenues, which increased 14% in the quarter and 24% for the year. That was boosted by a record year in home video, led by sales of season 3 of Game of Thrones. HBO's licensing deal with Amazon also contributed to the strong full year results. 
Across HBO's international operations, including unconsolidated JVs, we increased revenues double digits in 2014. And that included growth in both our licensing and Networks business. International subscriber trends also remained strong, growing double digits across most regions. Sub growth was especially strong in Latin America and Europe in 2014. 
Adjusted operating income declined 5% in the quarter. And that was largely due to the timing of theatrical expenses and investments in original programming, which drove mid-teens growth in programming expenses. 
Marketing expenses were also higher in the quarter as we continued to invest in the brand. 
For the full year, programming costs were up in the high single digits when excluding the international consolidations. To help fund that investment, HBO remains focused on constraining nonprogramming expenses. And excluding the international consolidations, we limited SG&A growth to 1% in 2014. 
Despite the drop in the fourth quarter and higher restructuring charges, adjusted operating income grew 7% for the year. So we had another year of solid growth, and we continued the subscriber momentum we've had over the past few years, both domestically and internationally. 
Given the strong demand for the product globally, we feel very good about our ability to further accelerate growth over the next several years. 
Now on to Warner Bros. If we're excluding restructuring and severance charges, 2014 would have been another record year for adjusted operating income. And we achieved that thanks to continued growth in the TV business and our focus on cost containment. 2014 also benefited from a patent license and settlement agreement. 
On the TV side, revenues grew double digits in the fourth quarter, capping off a great year. Internationally, Warner's continues to benefit from the growing demand for high-quality TV content from both linear and SVOD buyers. We're also seeing growth in local production from Eyeworks, the acquisition we completed earlier in 2014. And domestically, Warner's remains the industry leader in prime time series produced for broadcast networks for the 2014, 2015 TV season. So the trends in TV production remain positive, and we're confident we can continue to grow this business over the next several years. 
Theatrically, coming into the year, we knew we had tough comps, especially in the fourth quarter, and that played out as expected with revenue declining for both the quarter and the year. But we're off to a terrific start in 2015 with the success of American Sniper. And longer term, we think we have the strongest slate in the history of the company. So overall, we feel really good about the outlook for our theatrical business. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 12% for the year, in part due to a softer slate. That was roughly in line with the overall market, which was down 7%, excluding SVOD. However, we continue to see positive trends in digital across both theatrical and television product, with electronic sell-through revenue up 40% for the year. 
On the expense side, consistent with our company-wide focus on efficiency, Warner continues to tightly manage overhead costs. Excluding restructuring and severance charges for both periods, total expenses increased less than 2%, and SG&A was down 4% for the year. 
As we head into 2015, we'll start to see the benefit from the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter, which we expect to contribute to margin expansion over time. 
So on the whole, Warner's had a very good year. And with our slate of franchised films starting in 2016 and the strong secular demand for high-quality TV content, we feel we're in great position to grow Warner's at attractive rates for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to the next slide. We had another year of strong free cash flow generation, growing free cash flow 12% to $3.5 billion. As you can see on this slide, we've broken out the programming, restructuring and severance charges incurred in the second half of 2014, which had a significant impact on adjusted operating income 
Our cash taxes increased primarily due to lower foreign tax credits. Cash interest increased as a result of the additional debt we issued during the year. And the improvement in working capital was primarily due to lower participations at Warner Bros. 
Looking to 2015, keep in mind that we will have approximately $300 million of severance payments related to the restructuring actions we took this past year. In addition, we expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash, primarily due to the large syndication sale at Warner's. All that aside, we still anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation. And we expect to continue converting a very high percentage of our earning into free cash flow in the years to come. 
Looking at our balance sheet. We ended 2014 with $19.9 billion of net debt, up $1.6 billion compared to the end of 2013. That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, during 2014, we repurchased $5.5 billion in shares and combined with our dividend, returned $6.6 billion in total to shareholders. 
During the year, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2 billion of long-term debt at very favorable rates. 
On the M&A front, we invested just under $1 billion in 2014. The majority of that was directed towards our financing arrangements with CME and our acquisition of Eyeworks' international television operations. Due to the programming, restructuring and severance charges in the second half of the year, our net leverage ratio was around 3x at the end of 2014. However, excluding those charges, our net leverage ratio would have been 2.7x, slightly below our target level. 
One item to keep in mind in terms of our use of capital during the next few years will be the cash payments related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. The majority of these payments will be recognized in investing activities, including a few hundred million dollars in 2015. On balance, I'm pleased with how we executed on our capital plan in 2014. And as we look ahead, neither our philosophy nor our processes around capital allocation have changed, so you can expect us to remain very disciplined and balanced in our approach to capital allocation. 
We remain committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade credit ratings and are comfortable with our net leverage target of 2.75x. We continue to believe that target provides us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, engage in strategic M&A and provide direct returns to shareholders, while at the same time optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. 
In 2015, we expect to deliver really attractive growth in adjusted operating income and another year of solid double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And we expect that will be as a result of strong growth across all of our divisions. Before getting into the details, please note that my comments will be based on 2014 results, excluding the programming, restructuring and severance charges taken in the second half of the year. 
At Turner, we'll benefit from around $200 million in savings from the restructuring efforts and more modest programming expense growth as our NASCAR deal ended in 2014. Those factors should translate into healthy margin expansion. While we continue to see positive underlying trends internationally, the strong dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela will provide headwinds. Nonetheless, we anticipate a return to very healthy adjusted operating income growth, which is evidence of our continued ability to manage our cost structure to drive attractive growth even in years with more modest top line trends. 
At HBO, we continue to see strong demand for our services globally, and that should result in continued solid Subscription revenue growth. And along with disciplined expense management, we anticipate that we will drive a significant acceleration in adjusted operating income growth in 2015. As we've previously discussed, we plan to launch an ""over-the-top"" service domestically this year and will provide more color on those plans as we get closer to launching. 
At Warner Bros., we anticipate revenue growth to be led by our TV syndication slate, which includes 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest. We also have a robust slate of videogames anchored by key franchise releases, Batman Arkham and Mortal Kombat. So we expect strong revenue growth combined with cost savings from the restructurings to translate into very attractive adjusted operating income growth and another record year at Warner's. 
So looking across all 3 segments, we're set up for a very good year from an operating perspective. And that's despite an expected drag on adjusted operating income of approximately $250 million to $300 million as a result of the strength in the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela. That impact will primarily show up at Turner and Warner Bros. and equates to approximately $0.20 to $0.25 at the adjusted EPS level, which we have factored into our outlook. 
It's also worth noting that intercompany eliminations will be a material drag this year due to increased content sales from Warner Bros. to HBO and Turner, including the syndication sale of 2 Broke Girls. 
In addition, we started to recognize 100% of CME's losses in our equity income in the fourth quarter as a result of our accumulated net losses exceeding the book value of our common stock investments. For context, in 2014, this change would have resulted in an additional $0.05 negative impact to adjusted EPS. 
In terms of cadence, we expect 2015 adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, given the timing of both syndication availabilities and this year's theatrical slate at Warner Bros. 
Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2015, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 or mid-teens growth when excluding the second half restructuring and programming charges and tax matters we noted earlier. And that's despite the negative impact of foreign exchange that I just noted. At the same time, our continued investments in high-quality video content and our industry-leading brands will position us for accelerating revenue growth in 2016, so we continue to expect high teens adjusted EPS growth, on average, through 2018 and remain on track to hit the financial targets we shared with you at our Investor Day in October. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A."

And are you able to be more specific regarding the year-over-year domestic drivers for 4Q, the DISH impact and subscriber changes versus core pricing? And for Jeff, you expressed a lot of confidence in achieving 2016 EPS guidance. But I think some investors are still uncertain with all the cross-currents right now for affiliate revenue. You've got Sling TV and cord-cutting, cord-shaving, the DISH outage in October. So I'm just curious, how many of the top 10 renewals are left to be completed?

And let me go into some of the reasons, and then John and Howard will pick up from there. We did see some sub declines last year in the basic cable universe, and we have planned for modest declines to continue. And I think, as everyone knows, ad growth has been very muted, but we still see very strong consumer demand for multichannel TV and increasing viewing across all the platforms. And we think that TV and video remains the best platform for reaching a mass audience for advertisers. We also see that multichannel revenues are also still growing at a healthy clip, so we think there is pretty good opportunity for continued growth. We're working closely with all our distributors to improve the consumer value proposition. That means more and more vibrant VOD offerings from all the networks. It means providing stacking rights for original series, and that would be another example where I think we -- HBO has all its series up, pretty much. Turner has all of its series up. And we think more SVOD -- I mean, more VOD and more and better user interfaces are going to make a difference in all of the retention, basically, of multichannel TV. We're also moving aggressively to provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting that they're coming to expect. And we think that as we do that more successfully, we're going to take that share from digital competitors over time. Beyond the traditional ecosystem, we think there's a lot of opportunity for companies like ours that specialize in high-quality content, not just in the U.S., but also globally. But if you just go back to the United States, Sling TV is one example of increased value and opportunity for networks like ours. HBO ""over-the-top"" is another example. So on the whole, we think the value of that content and of our networks is growing. And we think some of the changes that all of us are beginning to see in having more flexible consumer offerings are going to support the value of the best networks and the strongest brands. That's basically why we see ourselves on track for our targets in '16 and '18. And John and Howard, I think you have a few things to add."

With regard to the rhythm of our affiliate contracts, we've got 7 of the top 10 affiliates closed, and we intend to close the remaining deals this year. As we've reported in the past, everything is going exactly in accordance with plan. We are achieving the rate increases and the terms that we've been seeking. And this year, in the multiyear overall cycle, we fully anticipated and we've communicated before that there will be somewhat of a moderation in Subscriber revenue growth, but then it's going to pick back up beyond '15. I think it's important, though, when you look at the longer-term trends of multichannel in the U.S. to understand that the evidence that we see clearly indicates that the main reason why people are leaving the multichannel universe, let's call them cord-cutters, is because they either can't afford it or they don't think there's enough value in the offerings that are currently being provided to them by the MVPDs. We also believe that a portion of that community would like to sign back up for multichannel TV if their offerings were comprised of more affordable and greater flexibility. I think Sling, as Jeff said, is a great example, but I think it's important to understand that it's the first example. A lot of the economy packs that the MVPDs are currently offering are based more on whether the contracts allow for them, and they're based more on cost, and they're offered as retention tools as opposed to proactive marketing opportunities. I think that's going to change over time. And we've been saying for a long time that there's too many channels in existence today, and the approach that Time Warner and Turner have taken over the years of investing heavily in a core group of channels, we think, is going to really pay handsome dividends in the future as we have 2 of the top 5, 3 of the top 10 networks, and 85% of our affiliate fees are comprised in the top 4. And we're pleased to be in the Sling initial offering. So we're quite optimistic about how things are going to continue to evolve over time, and we're quite optimistic about the hand that we have in terms of the value of the networks."

So could you, I guess, first articulate, is there a different vision that, that team has in terms of genre or programming? Is it basic continuation of sort of the Boom brand and the Turner comedy brand? When do we expect to see the impact of Kevin's team and his process on ratings, for the schedule and ultimately, on advertising? And then also, how close is he working with Peter Roth for a holistic Turner-Warner product as well as Kevin for broader monetization outside of the first window? If you could sort of talk about the holistic approach Warner's has to the Turner properties there for content creation and distribution."

He has brought a great new perspective, a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm. He's officially been here for just over a month, and he's already announced the new organization and the new structure and is bringing in some fresh talent. And he's working terrifically with David Levy and together, working towards the upfront on the existing development slate and working on sharpening the brand-positioning reach of TNT and TBS as we move into the future. I want to just caution that we've got to give Kevin some time because he hasn't been here for very long. But I couldn't be more pleased with the talent and the direction that our big networks are going to be going in. And we're starting to build off of an increasing position of success. As we said before, TNT, we're going to look to go a little bit younger and more dual and sharpen the TBS brand promise. But if you think about, in the fourth quarter, we premiered The Librarians, which is the highest premier on all ad-supported basic cable. It beat out Last Ship, which was #2. We had 6 of the top 15 original dramas, as Jeff said. And on the original programming side, on TBS, we've got 6 new shows, 3 returning, and 2 Broke Girls coming on from Warner's. So I'd love for Kevin to give some perspective on how Kevin and the team are working with Warner's. We're really excited about 2 big dramas coming out of Warner's that are going to be moving on to TNT soon. And I, just from my perspective at Turner, I think the relationship has never been better, and Warner's is our most important partner."

Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors.
Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared marks, our divisional CEOs John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara will join us for a Q&A session. Jeff?"

We came into 2015 with a lot of momentum and delivered a standout first quarter both financially and strategically, underscoring the vibrancy of our business. We grew revenue 5% and adjusted operating income 12%, led by 26% increase of Turner. And that fueled 23% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We also returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
We accomplished all this at a time when we're aggressively pursuing new initiatives designed to adapt the company to the rapid changes that are occurring in the industry and to capitalize on the growing demand that we see for high-quality video content all over the world.
When we laid our long-term goals last October, you'll recall that we presented a plan for sustained success that revolved around increasing our investments in distinctive engaging content. We detailed our plans to monetize that content both within and beyond the traditional TV and filmmaker systems. And we talked about our unrelenting commitment to financial discipline, which is what enables us to fund even more investment in great content while also delivering strong financial results and returning capital to shareholders. We made progress on all those objectives this quarter. So this morning, I want to spend a few minutes going through some operational highlights, which illustrate how we're continuing to evolve our businesses and execute our plan.
I'll start inside ecosystem where our businesses are incredibly healthy.
In the first quarter, Turner generated the highest quarterly profit in its history. That performance was a reflection of the operating momentum Turner has across its portfolio, and it demonstrates the value we bring and derive from our partnerships with distributors around the world. Nowhere was our momentum more evident than in sports where we continue to show the power of premium programming. This year's NCAA men's tournament delivered its highest average viewership in 22 years. That included a Kentucky-Wisconsin national semifinal, which was the most-watched basketball game ever on cable TV as well as the most-watched program in Turner's history. That performance was matched by tremendous advertiser demand, generating double-digit ad growth for the tournament on our networks. The strong performance of the NCAA helped TBS finish as the #1 ad-supported U.S. cable network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time in the first quarter.
And if last year is any indication, the NBA playoffs will help TNT land in a similar position this quarter.
Beyond sports, we're also continuing to invest in the best original programming. TNT had 3 of the top 10 cable originals in the first quarter. That's Major Crocs, the Librarian and [indiscernible]. But the evolution of programming on TBS and TNT is just getting going. Over the remainder of the year, we have 8 new original series set to join an already strong lineup of original programming on those networks. We're particularly excited of the launch of a and upcoming seasons of The Last Ship, Murder in the First and Falling Skies on TNT and the debut of Angie Tribeca on TBS. So we're pleased with the progress there, and we're looking forward to sharing more of our upfront presentation in a couple of weeks.
At Adult Swim, we also continue to lead the way with millennial audiences. In the first quarter, it was the #1 ad-supported cable network in adults 18 to 34 for the 28th consecutive quarter. That's an incredible run.
In younger kids, Cartoon Network continued to take share by focusing on global franchises and improving our domestic scheduling. In the first quarter, Cartoon aired 9 of the top 10 cable telecast with boys 6 to 11, and it grew its audience 22% with kids 6 to 11.
The strength of its programming has been evident in video On Demand too. Cartoon ranked #1 in the kids category on VOD in the quarter, and it was the #1 cable network overall on VOD in January.
Meanwhile, CNN, the global news leader, followed a very strong 2014 by growing its total 25 to 54 audience 20% year-over-year in the quarter. HLN also had strong growth in its key demo while their 2 principal competitors both saw declines. 1 driver of CNN's growth has been the continued strength of its originals, including the successful launches of Finding Jesus and The Wonder List.
So as I said, we believe we'll bring in a lot of value to distributors and audiences, and that was clear in Turner's recently concluded renewal with DISH. The deal is entirely consistent with the business goals we've shared with you, and it means that we've now successfully completed renewals with 8 of Turner's top 10 distributors during this renewal cycle.
HBO and DISH also reported a new affiliate agreement, underscoring both HBO's commitment to both its original distributors and the value it provides to them. And on the heels of a very strong 2014, HBO continued to grow its subscriber base in the first quarter. Its subscriber momentum is a reflection of the powerful combination of the biggest and most recent Hollywood hits with the very best collection of groundbreaking original content.
This year, HBO's programming is once again standing out from the crowd, including headline-making documentaries like Going Clear and The King. Earlier this month, Game of Thrones returned for its fifth season, with its season premiere growing over last season when it became HBO's most watched original series ever.
We're also off to a strong start for the new seasons of Veep, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and Silicon Valley. And we'll follow those up with second seasons of True Detective and The Leftovers with new shows like Ballers and The Brink and with an expansion of our relationship with And as good as the current lineup is, we're just as excited about the pipeline with shows like Westward from J.J. Abrams to Boers, which will star Sarah Jessica Parker, and a rock 'n roll drama from Martin all coming to HBO in the near future.
Warner Bros. Television continues to match the success of our networks with an industry-leading lineup of programs across broadcast and cable, including the #1 comedy and the #1 unscripted series among adults 18 to 49 this season. Warner's content has also been key to Cartoon Networks' success with DC property Team Titans go logging as the #1 show among boys 6 to 11 in the quarter. And we're set for another very strong showing in this year's upfront where we expect DC to once again be a driving force for WB TV.
We also continue to see growth outside the U.S. with record international TV distribution revenue in the first quarter.
We've had similar success theatrically where Warner's was #1 at the domestic box office in the quarter. Its performance was led by American Sniper, which opened to wide release and great acclaim in January and to date, has brought in well over $0.5 billion at the global box office. In just 2 weeks, we're releasing another potential global hit, Mad Max Furey Road. And in the coming years, we think we have the strongest lineup of franchised films in the studios history.
Against that backdrop of momentum within the traditional ecosystem, let me talk for a moment about the progress we're making beyond that ecosystem. We see significant opportunities to further monetize our great content and to grow our leading brands through new broadband-delivered video services, branded online destinations and franchise expansions like videogames. And those opportunities are increasingly global in nature.
Last month, we broke new ground with the debut of HBO Now. That's our standalone broadband-delivered version of HBO. We started with Apple as our exclusive digital watch partner and Cablevision is our first traditional distribution partner, and you'll hear about even more ways to get HBO soon. The initial response has been very positive both in terms of subscribers and usage. And we're confident that with this launch, we're laying the groundwork for HBO's next leg of growth both domestically and around the world. That's just one example of how we're taking advantage of broadband distribution to extend the reach and increase the value of our content and our networks.
In the first quarter, Warner started the rollout of an SVOD service in Southeast Asia in partnership with SingTel and Sony Pictures called Hook. [ph] Hook launched the service in the Philippines in March and plans to expand in India, Thailand and Indonesia soon. And Hollywood VIP, Warner's SVOD partnership with China's , continues to perform strongly with growth accelerating in the most recent quarter.
Domestically, Turner and HBO have agreed to include their networks in the new multichannel offering from Sling. And Turner is now distributing its networks through Sony View. Turner's syndication deal with Hulu underscores the demand for our networks and their content across distribution platforms.
New distribution platforms are also demonstrating the enduring value of Warner's vast library. Just this quarter, Warner's licensed Friends to SVOD. That's more than a decade after it went off the air.
These new platforms and the growth in connected devices are creating additional ways for us to engage with consumers, and CNN is taking full advantage. CNN Digital reached more than 66 million multiplatform users in the U.S. during the first quarter, and it was the #1 news provider in mobile page views. CNN's strength across all platforms was underscored by the range of new digital distribution partnerships we announced in the first quarter, including Snap Chat,  the Apple Watch and Apple TV.
We're also building a global digital sports business around Bleacher Report, and we couldn't be more pleased with its performance. Last year, Bleacher Report to become the #2 sports destination, set to position them in the first quarter helping it to post double-digit revenue growth over last year.
We saw a similar live strong revenue growth on March Madness Live, another key digital sports assets. March Madness Live was a huge success this year, serving 81 million live video streams growing consumption by almost 20%. It's a great example of how the traditional and new digital ecosystems can successfully coexist. And it's just one of the success stories our brands have recently had in the app environment.
You've heard me say many times that Warner is just the global leader in television and film production, but we're also building momentum in our games business. We ended the first quarter with double-digit market share in the U.S., our highest share ever. And our recent release of Mortal Combat X generated more than $130 million in consumer sales in its first week of release. Our next major release will be the conclusion of our Batman Arkham Trilogy, Arkham Knight, which is going to hit stores later this quarter. And this fall, we'll be extending our LEGO games franchise into the toys-to-life category with the release of LEGO Dimensions. Dimensions will blend iconic franchises with physical LEGOs and interactive console player. LEGO and DC are key drivers of our theatrical and television businesses going forward, and games are a natural extension and growth opportunity that we're very excited about.
So you can see, this is a very active, very exciting time at Time Warner. We're reinforcing and benefiting from our investments in the health of the traditional film and TV ecosystems while aggressively pursuing the many growth opportunities we see beyond them. And we're more confident than ever that the investments we're making in great content will help drive growth for many years to come.
Thanks. Now let me turn it over to Howard."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a great start to the year with revenue growth of 5%, adjusted operatin",2236,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.
Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a great start to the year with revenue growth of 5%, adjusted operating income, up a very strong 12% to a quarterly record of $1.8 billion and adjusted EPS, up 23%. We're especially pleased with our results in light of significant foreign exchange headwinds, which were a drag of about $130 million on adjusted operating income and $0.14 on adjusted EPS in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income margins expanded more than 150 basis points, largely as a result of the cost-saving initiatives we undertook last year. Reflecting that, SG&A was down 7% in the quarter. At the same time, we increased investments both in content and marketing, including the support -- including to support the launch of HBO Now.
Moving down the income statement. We continue to turn growth in adjusted operating income into even faster growth in adjusted EPS. And that was due to our ongoing share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, which helped offset higher equity income losses. As a reminder, our earnings now reflect 100% of CME's results through equity income.
During the first quarter, we repurchased about $900 million in shares, and combined with our dividend, we returned almost $1.2 billion to shareholders. So we're executing really well across our businesses. And this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70. That implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS when excluding the 2014 programming and restructuring charges and tax matters, and that's despite a material drag from the stronger dollar. So we feel really good about the underlying trends in our businesses, and that gives us great confidence in our long-term growth prospects.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, with a growing operating momentum across its business which reflected in a first quarter. 5% revenue growth and significant margin expansion translated into 26% growth and adjusted operating income and a record quarter. Turner's momentum was evident in the improvement in advertising, which grew 4% in the quarter. That was ahead of our expectations due to the strength of the NCAA Tournament and healthy growth at our domestic news business. And that was despite a drag of over 150 basis points from foreign exchange.
Domestic growth was in the mid-single digits, and that included low single-digit growth of domestic entertainment including young adults and very healthy double-digit growth at news where we continue to benefit from positive ratings momentum and digital growth.
Excluding foreign exchange and the benefit from the consolidation of a sports  our sports network in Brazil, international advertising was up high single digits with growth across all regions.
Looking ahead, the domestic advertising market is relatively unchanged with scatter pricing up high single digits for our entertainment networks. In the second quarter, we expect a drag of close to 300 basis points from the combination of increasing foreign exchange headwinds and the absence of NASCAR programming. Taking that into consideration, we expect total advertising revenue to be flat to up low single digits.
Moving on. Subscription revenue increased 3% in the quarter, including a drag of over 250 basis points from foreign exchange. Domestic subscription revenue grew 4% as pricing increases were offset by modest sub losses.
We were really pleased with our recent renewal with a major affiliate, but keep in mind that the structure of our various contracts are such that we expect to see the benefit from improved pricing related to that deal beginning in 2016.
Excluding foreign exchange, international was up double-digits, primarily due to strong growth in Latin America where we continue to see healthy trends.
Looking to the second quarter. We expect domestic subscription revenue growth to remain in the same range as the first quarter. Based on current rates, we anticipate an impact of around 350 basis points from foreign exchange on total subscription revenue due to the continued strengthening of the dollar. As a result, we anticipate subscription revenue growth to modestly decelerate sequentially. However, we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to reaccelerate well into the double-digits in 2016 and 2017.
Content revenue also grew nicely, and that was due both to the timing of SVOD availabilities and a small contribution from our new Hulu deal.
Turning to margins. We were able to drive a 700 basis point year-over-year improvement in the quarter, partially as a result of the cost savings initiatives I noted earlier. Programming expenses were down 3%, and that was largely due to the timing of original programming as well as lower acquired programming cost related to our decision to abandon certain programming in the second half of last year. That more than offset increases in sports cost.
As we discussed with you previously, we plan to reinvest savings from the programming charges into new content that better fits our current vision for TNT and TBS, but it will take some time to execute that.
Taking that into account as well as the absence of NASCAR, we expect programming expense growth to be weighted to the back half of the year.
Total expenses declined 7% in the quarter due to lower SG&A and the decline in programming cost that I just discussed. SG&A was down 17% in the quarter, and that was due both to savings from the restructuring actions we took last year as well as lower marketing costs resulting from the timing of original programming.
Putting it all together, Turner had a great start to the year and is making real progress on its long-term strategic objectives. And we expect very strong growth in adjusted operating income in 2015.
Turning now to HBO, where subscriber trends continue to be very positive following a record year for domestic sub gains. Subscription revenue increased 4%, which included a slight drag from the transfer of HBO's basic cable service in India to Turner in January due to regulatory changes. Content and other revenues were up 5% in the quarter, and that underscored the continued demand for our content both in home entertainment and international licensing.
Across HBO's international operations, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues and adjusted operating income were flat. That was primarily due to a decline in LatAm related to the timing of certain programming expenses and foreign exchange. Overall, we still expect another year of growth at HBO's international networks, and that's a reflection of continued positive momentum in subscriber trends, especially in LatAm and the Nordics.
Adjusted operating income was down 1% in the quarter, mainly due to a 9% increase in programming expenses. And that was a result of mid-teens growth in original programming, including new series like Togetherness and Documentary Citizen 4, The  and Going Clear, as well as increase in theatrical availabilities. Marketing costs also increased to support the launch of HBO Now.
Excluding marketing costs, SG&A was down 3%, and that's a reflection of our company-wide focus on efficiencies and the restructuring actions taken in the second half of last year. Overall, HBO is off to a solid start to the year. The strength of the brand and demand for its content is evidenced by continued growth in its subscriber base and the positive reaction to HBO Now. And we expect subscriber growth and revenue to benefit modestly over the remainder of the year from the launch of HBO Now. At the same time, we will incur additional technology and marketing expenses to support its launch, which will limit the near-term benefit to adjusted operating income. And to the extent that performance exceeds our expectations this year, we will likely make additional investments in the product to position HBO Now for success over the long term.
Taking all that into account, HBO is making great progress on executing its plan and is on track for a significant acceleration in adjusted operating income growth this year.
Moving on to Warner Bros. We're off to a good start and, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income would have increased in the quarter. Revenues increased 4% with growth across each of Warner's businesses.
Theatrical revenue benefited from the success of American Sniper. We also saw strong growth in TV window for films both domestics and internationally, highlighting continued robust demand for our theatrical product.
Likewise, our TV business continued to benefit from strong global demand as evidenced by higher licensing revenue, including the SVOD sale of Friends. The increase in revenues was more than offset by higher associated film costs and increased PNA due to mix of films released in the quarter. Foreign exchange was also a significant headwind. As a result, adjusted operating income declined 13%.
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue was down 4% [ph] due to lower carryover revenues and declines in catalog. However, EST revenue growth remained very healthy, up over 30% in the quarter. The broader home entertainment industry was approximately in line with our results. That's a modest improvement from the trends we saw in the second half of last year, and growth in ESP also remains encouraging, up very solidly in the double-digits.
Overall, Warner Bros. had a good quarter and is on track to deliver very attractive growth in adjusted operating income in 2015, led by strong TV syndication revenue as well as a robust video game slate and savings from its 2014 restructuring actions.
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled just over $1 billion. That's down from a year ago due to a significant swing in working capital, but it's still very healthy conversion. The decline in working capital reflects higher content investments across the divisions, the timing of collections and higher participation payments at Warner Bros. due to the mix of titles.
Cash interest increased modestly as a result of the additional debt we issued in 2014. And our cash taxes increased primarily due to audit settlement in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash for the full year than it was in 2014, and that's primarily due to the large syndication sales at Warner's and severance payments related to the restructuring actions taken in 2014. Despite that, we anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation.
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with just over $20 billion of net debt, up about $330 million compared to the end of 2014. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders. As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased $890 million in shares, and combined with our dividend, returned almost $1.2 billion to shareholders in the first quarter.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3x. However, excluding the programming, restructuring and charges from the second half 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.65x, similar to the end of 2014 and slightly below our target leverage of 2.75x.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our balanced approach to capital allocation and expect to move closer to our leverage target over the remainder of the year.
With that, let's move onto the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. We got off to a great start in the first quarter with growing operating momentum across a wide swath of our businesses. That momentum gives us a lot of confidence in our outlook for the year. Even more importantly, we did that while continuing to lay the groundwork for accelerating growth in the years to come. And this morning, we reaffirmed our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS, which we anticipate will be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70.
We're still confident in that outlook despite FX headwinds, which we now estimate are even more significant than we discussed with you previously. As the years progress, we are fully incorporated the remeasurement of our balance sheet, the FX drag on our equity method investment, strong growth at our international businesses and further strengthening of the dollar. And based on today's rates, we now estimate approximately a $0.40 drag on adjusted EPS from FX in 2015.
Looking more closely at the second quarter. We expect Warner's adjusted operating income to be down due to the timing of both TV availabilities of our theatrical product as well as theatrical releases and associated PNA spend. We'll also have incremental spend at HBO to support the launch of HBO Now.
As a reminder, last year's second quarter benefited from HBO's licensing arrangement with Amazon. We're currently in discussions with Amazon about the size and scope of our relationship. The outcome of those discussions could have an impact on our second quarter results, and I'll have more to say about that when the discussions conclude.
Putting that all together, we anticipate growth in adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to slow significantly in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Despite that, we feel great about the momentum we're seeing across our businesses and are on track for another very good year of growth and adjusted EPS. And our ongoing investments in high-quality video content and industry-leading brands positions us for continued growth over the years to come.
And now, I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

And I think, as Richard already said, the recent partnership with HBO Now is one example. But you can also see it in the CNN placement on the Apple watch and CNN Go on Apple TV. So it's no surprise. I don't think anybody at Apple would be interested in launching a video product in the nature of a larger bundle as time goes along. We're pretty confident that not only will Apple do that, but you've also seen it with some of the other offerings whether in Slings or Sonys. And there's lot of energy and innovation around video-on-demand that is getting supercharged by the capacity of Internet delivery, broadband delivery, to really bring VOD and good interfaces to people's homes. They love the channel. And so if you have great channels and no weak channels, which I think is the position of Time Warner, all of these developments are something that we think we welcome. And we think it's going to be good for all the traditional distributors too to reinvigorate their packages and their marketing of channel packages that consumers want."

And we've been -- I still think that our unique combination of entertainment, sports, news, kids and young adult networks are tremendous valuable to distributor consumers. So then the question comes back to what about subscribers because obviously, that's the volume part of the equation. And while the U.S. multichannel household universe has been experiencing some subscriber losses, they haven't been material and we don't anticipate that they're going to be material. And as you've seen with us striking deals with Sling and with Sony and likely with others in the future, we're working hard with our existing MVPD partners as well as new partners to try to bring the multichannel subscription packaging to another level that will reach subscribers that otherwise have enjoyed multichannel ecosystem. So I'm hopeful and we're hopeful collectively that this new packaging era that we're moving into is going to reverse the subscriber trend losses that we've been experiencing recently in the United States. And I think we're entering a really, really exciting period where we can absolutely see subscriber growth.

So the point will get into, and I'm going to give it to Kevin in a minute, is you have to look at the particular show and where it is in its life cycle. You got to look at what alternate use it would have and worldwide sales on other outlets, whether it's networks or international territories, et cetera. So let me just say something about the SVOD impact on the ecosystem that I think answers your question. I mean, there -- of course there are increased bidding. As the world moves to offering more on-demand ways to see your favorite show, all the networks, whether it's in the United States or overseas, are bringing VOD into their network offerings. And so you can either license things to what we all used to think off as us traditionally linear networks that has a VOD offering, like a Sky in Western Europe, or you can license it to an SVOD -- pure SVOD service like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu Plus, et cetera. And what we basically do is we try to figure out what is the best match for a given piece of programming given its time in its life cycle and given the platform that it's going to be on. And we're not just trying to optimize -- we are trying to optimize the value of the show, but we have to think about the position of the network or platform that's bidding for the rights and how to really evolve the overall ecosystem as we do it. So that's basically how we view these things. In the case of the shows you are mentioning, we thought Hulu's ad-supported environment was a better fit for Turner's shows on some of their deals. And we think that the licensing choices we made on Seinfeld and Friends was the right choice for those, Kevin?"

And you have to look at not only where the show is in its life cycle, but what the marketplace looks like for that particular show. So there isn't a one-size-fits-all for where -- when you should go out into SVOD on a particular program because I would use Person of Interest as an example. Person of Interest in the first cycle of our syndication sale, we shared the window with WGN and Netflix. And so that's an example of where we think that that's at an appropriate way to market that particular show to maximize its value. In Friends and Seinfeld, as Jeff mentioned, those are very late in their lifecycle, third cycle for Friends and fourth cycle for Seinfeld. And it was obviously very opportunistic and a very good economic value for those particular shows, and so we took them. And I think it was the right thing for both of those shows."

So we're looking forward to unveiling the upfront in a few weeks, and you'll see that. Regarding programming, I'll speak to it from the network side and maybe Ken will comment from the studio side. We're continuing to explore obviously, menu new advertising app models, that includes programmatic on the TV we are experimenting with a very small amount of our inventory. And we've got strong controls in place around pricing, and it's not likely that we're going to be doing programmatic at scale on the TV side in the near term. At Turner, we've got a small number of must-have networks obviously, and we don't have a material amount of excess inventory anyway. So that's kind of inventory which would more likely get sold programmatically, and so we'll probably continue to leverage it selectively. We're doing more audience targeting on TV, but let's not confuse that with programmatic. In digital, it's clearly a much bigger opportunity and we're using programmatic a lot more, and we're going to continue to sell a bigger portion of our additional inventory through programmatic partners and at the same time, building out more robust data management capabilities to provide our advertising partners with better audience segmentation and targeting. So that should allow us to monetize our inventory more effectively. So let me turn it over to Kevin."

Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors.

24689,288841484,797450,"Time Warner Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thank you for listening in this morning. We came into 2015 with a lot of momentum and delivered a standout first quarter both financially and strategically, underscoring the vibrancy of our business. We grew revenue 5% and adjusted opera",1950,"Thanks, Mike, and thank you for listening in this morning. We came into 2015 with a lot of momentum and delivered a standout first quarter both financially and strategically, underscoring the vibrancy of our business. We grew revenue 5% and adjusted operating income 12%, led by a 26% increase of Turner. And that fueled 23% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We also returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
We accomplished all this at a time when we're aggressively pursuing new initiatives designed to adapt the company to the rapid changes that are occurring in the industry and to capitalize on the growing demand that we see for high-quality video content all over the world.
When we laid our long-term goals last October, You will recall that we presented a plan for sustained success that revolved around increasing our investments in distinctive, engaging content. We detailed our plans to monetize that content both within and beyond the traditional TV and film ecosystems. And we talked about our unrelenting commitment to financial discipline, which is what enables us to fund even more investment in great content while also delivering strong financial results and returning capital to shareholders. We made progress on all those objectives this quarter. 
So this morning, I want to spend a few minutes going through some operational highlights, which illustrate how we're continuing to evolve our businesses and execute our plan I'll start inside the ecosystem where our businesses are incredibly healthy.
In the first quarter, Turner generated the highest quarterly profit in its history. That performance was a reflection of the operating momentum Turner has across its portfolio, and it demonstrates the value we bring and derive from our partnerships with distributors around the world. 
Nowhere was our momentum more evident than in sports, where we continue to show the power of premium programming. This year's NCAA men's tournament delivered its highest average viewership in 22 years. That included a Kentucky-Wisconsin national semifinal, which was the most-watched basketball game ever on cable TV as well as the most-watched program in Turner's history. That performance was matched by tremendous advertiser demand, generating double-digit ad growth for the tournament on our networks. 
The strong performance of the NCAA helped TBS finish as the #1 ad-supported U.S. cable network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time in the first quarter. And if last year is any indication, the NBA playoffs will help TNT land in a similar position this quarter.
Beyond sports, we're also continuing to invest in the best original programming. TNT had 3 of the top 10 cable originals in the first quarter. That's Major Crimes, the Librarians and Rizzoli & Isles. 
But the evolution of programming on TBS and TNT is just getting going. Over the remainder of the year, we have 8 new original series set to join an already strong lineup of original programming on those networks. We're particularly excited about the launch of Proof and upcoming seasons of The Last Ship, Murder in the First and Falling Skies on TNT and the debut of Angie Tribeca on TBS. So we're pleased with the progress there, and we're looking forward to sharing more at our upfront presentation in a couple of weeks.
At Adult Swim, we also continue to lead the way with millennial audiences. In the first quarter, it was the #1 ad-supported cable network in adults 18 to 34 for the 28th consecutive quarter. That's an incredible run.
In younger kids, Cartoon Network continued to take share by focusing on global franchises and improving our domestic scheduling. In the first quarter, Cartoon aired 9 of the top 10 cable telecast with boys 6 to 11, and it grew its audience 22% with kids 6 to 11. The strength of its programming has been evident in video on demand, too. Cartoon ranked #1 in the kids category on VOD in the quarter, and it was the #1 cable network overall on VOD in January.
Meanwhile, CNN, the global news leader, followed a very strong 2014 by growing its total 25 to 54 audience 20% year-over-year in the quarter. HLN also had strong growth in its key demo while their 2 principal competitors both saw declines. One driver of CNN's growth has been the continued strength of its originals, including the successful launches of Finding Jesus and The Wonder List.
So as I said, we believe we'll bring in a lot of value to distributors and audiences, and that was clear in Turner's recently concluded renewal with DISH. The deal is entirely consistent with the business goals we've shared with you, and it means that we've now successfully completed renewals with 8 of Turner's top 10 distributors during this renewal cycle.
HBO and DISH also concluded a new affiliate agreement, underscoring both HBO's commitment to its traditional distributors and the value it provides to them. And on the heels of a very strong 2014, HBO continued to grow its subscriber base in the first quarter. Its subscriber momentum is a reflection of the powerful combination of the biggest and most recent Hollywood hits with the very best collection of groundbreaking original content.
This year, HBO's programming is once again standing out from the crowd, including headline-making documentaries like Going Clear and The Jinx. Earlier this month, Game of Thrones returned for its fifth season, with its season premiere growing over last season when it became HBO's most watched original series ever.
We're also off to a strong start for the new seasons of Veep, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and Silicon Valley. And we'll follow those up with second seasons of True Detective and The Leftovers, with new shows like Ballers and The Brink, and with an expansion of our relationship with Vice. And as good as the current lineup is, we're just as excited about the pipeline, with shows like Westworld from J.J. Abrams; Divorce, which will star Sarah Jessica Parker, and a rock 'n roll drama from Martin Scorsese, all coming to HBO in the near future.
Warner Bros. Television continues to match the success of our networks with an industry-leading lineup of programs across broadcast and cable, including the #1 comedy and the #1 unscripted series among adults 18 to 49 this season. Warner's content has also been key to Cartoon Networks' success with DC property Team Titans Go! ranking as the #1 show among boys 6 to 11 in the quarter. And we're set for another very strong showing in this year's upfront, where we expect DC to once again be a driving force for WBTV.
We also continue to see growth outside the U.S. with record international TV distribution revenue in the first quarter.
We've had similar success theatrically, where Warner's was #1 at the domestic box office in the quarter. Its performance was led by American Sniper, which opened to wide release and great acclaim in January and to date has brought in well over $0.5 billion with the global box office. In just 2 weeks, we're releasing another potential global hit, Mad Max: Fury Road. And in the coming years, we think we have the strongest lineup of franchised films in the studio's history.
Against that backdrop of momentum within the traditional ecosystem, let me talk for a moment about the progress we're making beyond that ecosystem. We see significant opportunities to further monetize our great content and to grow our leading brands through new broadband-delivered video services, branded online destinations and franchise extensions like videogames. And those opportunities are increasingly global in nature.
Last month, we broke new ground with the debut of HBO Now. That's our standalone broadband-delivered version of HBO. We started with Apple as our exclusive digital launch partner and Cablevision as our first traditional distribution partner. And you'll hear about even more ways to get HBO soon. 
The initial response has been very positive both in terms of subscribers and usage. And we are confident that with this launch, we're laying the groundwork for HBO's next leg of growth both domestically and around the world. That's just one example of how we're taking advantage of broadband distribution to extend the reach and increase the value of our content and our networks.
In the first quarter, Warner started the rollout of an SVOD service in Southeast Asia in partnership with SingTel and Sony Pictures called HOOQ. HOOQ launched the service in the Philippines in March and plans to expand in India, Thailand and Indonesia soon. And Hollywood VIP, Warner's SVOD partnership with China's Tencent, continues to perform strongly with growth accelerating in the most recent quarter.
Domestically, Turner and HBO have agreed to include their networks in the new multichannel offering from Sling. And Turner is now distributing its networks through Sony Vue. Turner's syndication deal with Hulu further underscores the demand for our networks and their content across distribution platforms.
New distribution platforms are also demonstrating the enduring value of Warner's vast library. Just this quarter, Warner's licensed Friends to SVOD. That's more than a decade after it went off the air.
These new platforms and the growth in connected devices are creating additional ways for us to engage with consumers, and CNN is taking full advantage. CNN Digital reached more than 66 million multiplatform users in the U.S. during the first quarter, and it was the #1 news provider in mobile page views. CNN's strength across all platforms was underscored by the range of new digital distribution partnerships we announced in the first quarter, including Snapchat, Roku, the Apple Watch and Apple TV.
We are also building a global digital sports business around Bleacher Report, and we couldn't be more pleased with its performance. Last year, Bleacher Report passed Yahoo! to become the #2 sports destination, such a position it maintained in the first quarter, helping it to post double-digit revenue growth over last year.
We saw a similar live strong revenue growth on March Madness Live, another key digital sports asset. March Madness Live was a huge success this year, serving 81 million live video streams and growing consumption by almost 20%. It's a great example of how the traditional and new digital ecosystems can successfully coexist. And it's just one of the success stories our brands have recently had in the app environment.
You've heard me say many times that Warner is just the global leader in television and film production, but we're also building momentum in our games business. We ended the first quarter with double-digit market share in the U.S., our highest share ever. And our recent release of Mortal Kombat X generated more than $130 million in consumer sales in its first week of release. 
Our next major release will be the conclusion of our Batman Arkham Trilogy, Arkham Knight, which is going to hit stores later this quarter. And this fall, we'll be extending our LEGO games franchise into the toys-to-life category with the release of LEGO Dimensions. Dimensions will blend iconic franchises with physical LEGOs and interactive console play. LEGO and DC are key drivers of our theatrical and television businesses going forward, and games are a natural extension and growth opportunity that we're very excited about.
So you can see, this is a very active, very exciting time at Time Warner. We're reinforcing and benefiting from our investments in the health of the traditional film and TV ecosystems while aggressively pursuing the many growth opportunities we see beyond them. And we're more confident than ever that the investments we're making in great content will help drive growth for many years to come.
Thanks. Now let me turn it over to Howard."
24689,288841484,797450,"Time Warner Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a great start to the year with revenue growth of 5%, adjusted operatin",2238,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.
Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a great start to the year with revenue growth of 5%, adjusted operating income up a very strong 12% to a quarterly record of $1.8 billion and adjusted EPS up 23%. We're especially pleased with our results in light of significant foreign exchange headwinds, which were a drag of about $130 million on adjusted operating income and $0.14 on adjusted EPS in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income margins expanded more than 150 basis points, largely as a result of the cost-saving initiatives we undertook last year. Reflecting that, SG&A was down 7% in the quarter. At the same time, we increased investments both in content and marketing, including the support -- including to support the launch of HBO Now.
Moving down the income statement. We continue to turn growth in adjusted operating income into even faster growth in adjusted EPS. And that was due to our ongoing share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, which helped offset higher equity income losses. As a reminder, our earnings now reflect 100% of CME's results through equity income.
During the first quarter, we repurchased about $900 million in shares, and combined with our dividend, we returned almost $1.2 billion to shareholders. So we're executing really well across our businesses. And this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70. That implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS when excluding the 2014 programming and restructuring charges and tax matters. And that's despite a material drag from the stronger dollar. So we feel really good about the underlying trends in our businesses, and that gives us great confidence in our long-term growth prospects.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner. With the growing operating momentum across its business which reflected in a first quarter, 5% revenue growth and significant margin expansion translated into 26% growth in adjusted operating income and a record quarter. Turner's momentum was evident in the improvement in advertising which grew 4% in the quarter. That was ahead of our expectations due to the strength of the NCAA Tournament and healthy growth at our domestic news business. And that was despite a drag of over 150 basis points from foreign exchange.
Domestic growth was in the mid-single digits, and that included low single-digit growth of domestic entertainment including young adults and very healthy double-digit growth at news, where we continue to benefit from positive ratings momentum and digital growth.
Excluding foreign exchange and the benefit from the consolidation of Esporte Interativo, our sports network in Brazil, international advertising was up high single digits with growth across all regions.
Looking ahead, the domestic advertising market is relatively unchanged with scatter pricing up high single digits for our entertainment networks. In the second quarter, we expect a drag of close to 300 basis points from the combination of increasing foreign exchange headwinds and the absence of NASCAR programming. Taking that into consideration, we expect total advertising revenue to be flat to up low single digits.
Moving on. Subscription revenue increased 3% in the quarter, including a drag of over 250 basis points from foreign exchange. Domestic subscription revenue grew 4% as pricing increases were offset by modest sub losses.
We were really pleased with our recent renewal with a major affiliate, but keep in mind that the structure of our various contracts are such that we expect to see the benefit from improved pricing related to that deal beginning in 2016.
Excluding foreign exchange, international was up double-digits primarily due to strong growth in Latin America where we continue to see healthy trends.
Looking to the second quarter. We expect domestic subscription revenue growth to remain in the same range as the first quarter. Based on current rates, we anticipate an impact of around 350 basis points from foreign exchange on total subscription revenue due to the continued strengthening of the dollar. As a result, we anticipate subscription revenue growth to modestly decelerate sequentially. However, we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to reaccelerate well into the double digits in 2016 and 2017.
Content revenue also grew nicely, and that was due both to the timing of SVOD availabilities and a small contribution from our new Hulu deal.
Turning to margins. We were able to drive a 700-basis-point year-over-year improvement in the quarter, partially as a result of the cost savings initiatives I noted earlier. Programming expenses were down 3% and that was largely due to the timing of original programming as well as lower acquired programming cost related to our decision to abandon certain programming in the second half of last year. That more than offset increases in sports costs.
As we discussed with you previously, we plan to reinvest savings from the programming charges into new content that better fits our current vision for TNT and TBS, but it will take some time to execute that. Taking that into account, as well as the absence of NASCAR, we expect programming expense growth to be weighted to the back half of the year.
Total expenses declined 7% in the quarter due to lower SG&A and the decline in programming cost that I just discussed. SG&A was down 17% in the quarter, and that was due both to savings from the restructuring actions we took last year as well as lower marketing cost resulting from the timing of original programming.
Putting it all together, Turner had a great start to the year and is making real progress on its long-term strategic objectives. And we expect very strong growth in adjusted operating income in 2015.
Turning now to HBO, where subscriber trends continue to be very positive following a record year for domestic sub gains. Subscription revenue increased 4%, which included a slight drag from the transfer of HBO's basic cable service in India to Turner in January due to regulatory changes. Content and other revenues were up 5% in the quarter, and that underscored the continued demand for our content both in home entertainment and international licensing.
Across HBO's international operations, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues and adjusted operating income were flat. That was primarily due to a decline in LatAm related to the timing of certain programming expenses and foreign exchange. Overall, we still expect another year of growth at HBO's international networks, and that's a reflection of continued positive momentum in subscriber trends, especially in LatAm and the Nordics.
Adjusted operating income was down 1% in the quarter, mainly due to a 9% increase in programming expenses. And that was a result of mid-teens growth in original programming, including new series like Togetherness and documentaries Citizenfour, The Jinx and Going Clear, as well as an increase in theatrical availabilities. Marketing cost also increased to support the launch of HBO Now.
Excluding marketing costs, SG&A was down 3%, and that's a reflection of our company-wide focus on efficiencies and the restructuring actions taken in the second half of last year. 
Overall, HBO is off to a solid start to the year. The strength of the brand and demand for its content is evidenced by continued growth in its subscriber base and the positive reaction to HBO Now. And we expect subscriber growth and revenue to benefit modestly over the remainder of the year from the launch of HBO Now. 
At the same time, we will incur additional technology and marketing expenses to support its launch, which will limit the near-term benefit to adjusted operating income. And to the extent that performance exceeds our expectations this year, we will likely make additional investments in the product to position HBO Now for success over the long term.
Taking all that into account, HBO is making great progress on executing its plan and is on track for a significant acceleration in adjusted operating income growth this year.
Moving on to Warner Bros. We're off to a good start and, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income would have increased in the quarter. Revenues increased 4%, with growth across each of Warner's businesses.
Theatrical revenue benefited from the success of American Sniper. We also saw strong growth in TV window for films both domestically and internationally, highlighting continued robust demand for our theatrical product.
Likewise, our TV business continued to benefit from strong global demand as evidenced by higher licensing revenue, including the SVOD sale of Friends. The increase in revenues was more than offset by higher associated film costs and increased P&A due to mix of films released in the quarter. Foreign exchange was also a significant headwind. As a result, adjusted operating income declined 13%.
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue was down 4% due to lower carryover revenues and declines in catalog. However, EST revenue growth remained very healthy, up over 30% in the quarter. The broader home entertainment industry was approximately in line with our results. That's a modest improvement from the trends we saw in the second half of last year, and growth in ESP also remains encouraging, up very solidly in the double-digits.
Overall, Warner Bros. had a good quarter and is on track to deliver very attractive growth in adjusted operating income in 2015, led by strong TV syndication revenue as well as a robust video game slate and savings from its 2014 restructuring actions.
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled just over $1 billion. That's down from a year ago due to a significant swing in working capital, but at still very healthy conversion. The decline in working capital reflects higher content investments across the divisions, the timing of collections and higher participation payments at Warner Bros. due to the mix of titles.
Cash interest increased modestly as a result of the additional debt we issued in 2014. And our cash taxes increased primarily due to audit settlement in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash for the full year than it was in 2014, and that's primarily due to the large syndication sales at Warner's and severance payments related to the restructuring actions taken in 2014. Despite that, we anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation.
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with just over $20 billion of net debt, up about $330 million compared to the end of 2014. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders. As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased $890 million in shares, and combined with our dividend, returned almost $1.2 billion to shareholders in the first quarter.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3x. However, excluding the programming, restructuring and severance charges from the second half of 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.65x, similar to the end of 2014 and slightly below our target leverage of 2.75x.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our balanced approach to capital allocation and expect to move closer to our leverage target over the remainder of the year.
With that, let's move onto the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. We got off to a great start in the first quarter with growing operating momentum across a wide swath of our businesses. That momentum gives us a lot of confidence in our outlook for the year. Even more importantly, we did that while continuing to lay the groundwork for accelerating growth in the years to come. And this morning, we reaffirmed our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS, which we anticipate will be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70.
We're still confident in that outlook despite FX headwinds, which we now estimate are even more significant than we discussed with you previously. As the year has progressed, we have fully incorporated the remeasurement of our balance sheet, the FX drag on our equity method investees, strong growth at our international businesses and further strengthening of the dollar. And based on today's rates, we now estimate approximately a $0.40 drag on adjusted EPS from FX in 2015.
Looking more closely at the second quarter. We expect Warner's adjusted operating income to be down due to the timing of both TV availabilities of our theatrical product as well as theatrical releases and associated P&A spend. We'll also have incremental spend at HBO to support the launch of HBO Now.
As a reminder, last year's second quarter benefited from HBO's licensing arrangement with Amazon. We're currently in discussions with Amazon about the size and scope of our relationship. The outcome of those discussions could have an impact on our second quarter results, and I'll have more to say about that when the discussions conclude.
Putting that all together, we anticipate growth in adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to slow significantly in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Despite that, we feel great about the momentum we're seeing across our businesses and are on track for another very good year of growth in adjusted EPS. And our ongoing investments in high-quality video content and industry-leading brands positions us for continued growth over the years to come.
And now I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

And I think, as Richard already said, the recent partnership with HBO Now is one example. But you can also see it in the CNN placement on the Apple Watch and CNN Go on Apple TV. So it's no surprise. I don't think, to anybody is that Apple would be interested in launching a video product in the nature of a larger bundle as time goes along. We're pretty confident that not only will Apple do that, but you've also seen it with some of the other offerings, whether in Sling's or Sony's. And there's lot of energy and innovation around video-on-demand that is getting supercharged by the capacity of Internet delivery, broadband delivery, to really bring VOD and good interfaces to people's homes. They love the channel. And so if you have great channels and no weak channels, which I think is the position of Time Warner, all of these developments are something that we think we welcome. And we think it's going to be good for all the traditional distributors to reinvigorate their packages and their marketing of channel packages that consumers want."

So then the question comes back to what about subscribers? Because obviously, that's the volume part of the equation. And while the U.S. multichannel household universe has been experiencing some subscriber losses, they haven't been material, and we don't anticipate that they're going to be material. And as you've seen with us striking deals with Sling and with Sony and likely with others in the future, we're working hard with our existing MVPD partners as well as new partners to try to bring the multichannel subscription packaging to another level that will reach subscribers that otherwise haven't joined the multichannel ecosystem. So I'm hopeful. I think we're hopeful collectively that this new packaging era that we're moving into is going to reverse the subscriber trend losses that we've been experiencing recently in the United States. And I think we're entering a really, really exciting period where we can absolutely see subscriber growth.

So the point we'll get into, and I'm going to give it to Kevin in a minute, is you have to look at the particular show and where it is in its life cycle. You got to look at what alternate use it would have and worldwide sales on other outlets, whether it's networks or international territories, et cetera. So let me just say something about the SVOD impact on the ecosystem that I think answers your question. I mean, there -- of course there are increased bidding. As the world moves to offering more on-demand ways to see your favorite show, all the networks, whether it's in the United States or overseas, are bringing VOD into their network offerings. And so you can either license things to what we all used to think of as traditional linear networks that has a VOD offering, like a Sky in Western Europe, or you can license it to an SVOD, a pure SVOD service like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu Plus, et cetera. And what we basically do is we try to figure out what is the best match for a given piece of programming given its time in its life cycle and given the platform that it's going to be on. And we're not just trying to optimize -- well, we are trying to optimize the value of the show, but we have to think about the position of the network or platform that's bidding for the rights and how to really evolve the overall ecosystem as we do it. So that's basically how we view these things. In the case of the shows you are mentioning, we thought Hulu's ad-supported environment was a better fit for Turner's shows on some of their deals.

So there isn't a one-size-fits-all for where the -- when you should go out into SVOD on a particular program. Because I would use Person of Interest as an example. Person of Interest in the first cycle of our syndication sale, we shared the window with WGN and Netflix. And so that was -- that's an example of where we think that that's at an appropriate way to market that particular show to maximize its value. In Friends and Seinfeld, as Jeff mentioned, those are very late in their lifecycle, third cycle for Friends and fourth cycle for Seinfeld. And it was obviously very opportunistic and a very good economic value for those particular shows. And so we took them. And I think it was the right thing for both of those shows."

As far as syndication value goes, as Jeff said, on -- we're continuing to see incredibly healthy demand for the biggest shows. Obviously, and I would use The Big Bang Theory as an example of that and why there's continuing demand for those types of shows. They continue to perform extremely well, and despite cable networks, and John can comment over those, the expansion of original programming, there's still a need for that -- our programming, syndicated product, to go in to be able to fill out a 24-hour schedule. And so we're going to continue to be able to fill that need. Will there be pressure on second and third and fourth tier shows? Absolutely. I think that you will see some pressure on those shows. But the newer big shows that I think that you can -- you've been accustomed to seeing from Warner Bros. will continue to have healthy, healthy domestic syndication value. And we're not talking about -- I don't think your concerns are international, because international, we've seen incredibly strong growth from our international licensing. So if your concern is domestic, I think you can see some pressure on second, third, fourth tier shows. It think it's more of what makes the first-tier shows even more valuable because they're breaking out. And internationally across the board, we're seeing strong growth."

But more important than that, we feel good about really the strength and concentration and reach of our networks. Because if you look at the Turner networks with the top 4 networks having the lion's share of Turner's business, if you put HBO with that, you be at 5 of the most heavily demanded must-carry networks in the world that have been really sought after by everybody that's coming up with these various other packages, smaller packages, VOD packages, whatever it is. And we think basically, whether it's the question of what goes into a video-on-demand package or what goes into a smaller bundle, to the extent distributors were able to create packages that are more attractive to consumers, given the networks we have, we think that's great for both consumers and for our networks. And that's the reason why, over the last many years, we were concentrating our efforts on basically making our must-have networks stronger and having more must-see programming rather than launching marginal networks that others have done. So we've got about 90% of our affiliate fees at Time Warner in 5 networks. And we think they add a lot of value to consumers and have the kind of programming that people love on demand. That's basically our view whether the question is smaller bundles or VOD packages."

I would respectfully dissent about the binge dynamic. Two points. One, if you take a show like The Jinx, for example, which was an enormously popular kind of quintessential HBO show, you would have ruined the entire momentum and excitement about that show, had people have been able to binge watch it. Part of the whole dynamic was following that mystery as it evolves. Secondly, on shows like Sloan [ph] and True Detective, I think there's a lot to be said for having social media and the zeitgeist itself be a part of a continuing conversation over 8 weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, and we like that. We think that's great for the brand. We think our consumers like that. If we decided that wasn't the case, we've got the shows ready. We could make them available to binge. But right now, we like laying it out on a week-to-week basis. And by the way, if people decide they want to binge, they can save up and binge later in the middle of the season. So I'm not of the school that there's an overwhelming propensity to binge watch. I just don't believe it."

So look, obviously, it's early to discuss with any level of specificity. But at least starting from a broad perspective, the ad market appears to have stabilized compared to what we were looking at in the fourth quarter of last year. So I think that's a real positive. In addition, despite the Nielsen ratings challenges, we're seeing ratings momentum across most of our big networks. So of course that should help as well, and we're feeling really good about the program and lineup that we'll be unveiling for advertisers in a few weeks. And we're going to come to the market for the first time in the history of Turner with our entire portfolio. And so we're excited about that. And you -- and we will be unveiling. And you'll see new products with an increased focus on data analytics, targeting and ROI. And I thought today's article in The Wall Street Journal was just sort of the early stages of the case that TV is going to be making as it relates to a really vibrant advertising medium. And so we're going to be offering advertisers the ability to integrate data analytics into TV advertising and also to do behavioral targeting. And while targeting is not new for us, it's different now, at least for 3 reasons. Number one, there's significantly more data available than ever before. Number two, it helps us understand our audiences better and how to categorize the audiences into segments that are valuable to advertisers. And then the third is technology advancement enable us to better manage inventory and insert the right ads at the right time to the right audience. So we're looking forward to unveiling the upfront in a few weeks, and you'll see that. Regarding programmatic, I'll speak to it from the network side, and maybe Kevin will comment from the studio side. We're continuing to explore, obviously, many new advertising app models, that includes programmatic. On the TV side, we're experimenting with a very small amount of our inventory. And we've got strong controls in place around pricing. And it's not likely that we're going to be doing programmatic at scale on the TV side in the near term. At Turner, we've got a small number of must-have networks obviously, and we don't have a material amount of excess inventory anyway. So that's the kind of inventory which would more likely get sold programmatically. And so we'll probably continue to leverage it selectively. We're doing more audience targeting on TV, but let's not confuse that with programmatic. In digital, it's clearly a much bigger opportunity and we're using programmatic a lot more. And we're going to continue to sell a bigger portion of our digital inventory through programmatic partners and at the same time building out more robust data management capabilities to provide our advertising partners with better audience segmentation and targeting. So that should allow us to monetize our inventory more effectively. So let me turn it over to Kevin."

We came into 2015 with a lot of momentum and delivered a standout first quarter, both financially and strategically, underscoring the vibrancy of our business. We grew revenue 5% and adjusted operating income 12%, led by a 26% increase at Turner. And that fueled 23% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We also returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
We accomplished all this at a time when we're aggressively pursuing new initiatives designed to adapt the company to the rapid changes that are occurring in the industry and to capitalize on the growing demand that we see for high-quality video content all over the world.
When we laid our long-term goals last October, you will recall that we presented a plan for sustained success that revolved around increasing our investments in distinctive, engaging content. We detailed our plans to monetize that content both within and beyond the traditional TV and film ecosystems. And we talked about our unrelenting commitment to financial discipline, which is what enables us to fund even more investment in great content while also delivering strong financial results and returning capital to shareholders. We made progress on all those objectives this quarter. 
So this morning, I want to spend a few minutes going through some operational highlights, which illustrate how we're continuing to evolve our businesses and execute our plan. I'll start inside the ecosystem, where our businesses are incredibly healthy.
In the first quarter, Turner generated the highest quarterly profit in its history. The outperformance was a reflection of the operating momentum Turner has across its portfolio, and it demonstrates the value we bring and derive from our partnerships with distributors around the world. 
Nowhere was our momentum more evident than in sports, where we continue to show the power of premium programming. This year's NCAA men's tournament delivered its highest average viewership in 22 years. That included a Kentucky-Wisconsin national semifinal, which was the most-watched basketball game ever on cable TV as well as the most-watched program in Turner's history. That performance was matched by tremendous advertiser demand, generating double-digit ad growth for the tournament on our networks. 
The strong performance of the NCAA helped TBS finish as the #1 ad-supported U.S. cable network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time in the first quarter. And if last year is any indication, the NBA playoffs will help TNT land in a similar position this quarter.
Beyond sports, we're also continuing to invest in the best original programming. TNT had 3 of the top 10 cable originals in the first quarter. That's Major Crimes, the Librarians and Rizzoli & Isles. 
But the evolution of programming on TBS and TNT is just getting going. Over the remainder of the year, we have 8 new original series set to join an already strong lineup of original programming on those networks. We're particularly excited about the launch of Proof and upcoming seasons of The Last Ship, Murder in the First and Falling Skies on TNT, and the debut of Angie Tribeca on TBS. So we're pleased with the progress there, and we're looking forward to sharing more at our upfront presentation in a couple of weeks.
At Adult Swim, we also continue to lead the way with millennial audiences. In the first quarter, it was the #1 ad-supported cable network in adults 18 to 34 for the 28th consecutive quarter. That's an incredible run.
In younger kids, Cartoon Network continued to take share by focusing on global franchises and improving our domestic scheduling. In the first quarter, Cartoon aired 9 of the top 10 cable telecasts with boys 6 to 11, and it grew its audience 22% with kids 6 to 11. The strength of its programming has been evident in video on demand, too. Cartoon ranked #1 in the kids category on VOD in the quarter, and it was the #1 cable network overall on VOD in January.
Meanwhile, CNN, the global news leader, followed a very strong 2014 by growing its total 25 to 54 audience 20% year-over-year in the quarter. HLN also had strong growth in its key demo, while their 2 principal competitors both saw declines. One driver of CNN's growth has been the continued strength of its originals, including the successful launches of Finding Jesus and The Wonder List.
So as I said, we believe we'll bring in a lot of value to distributors and audiences, and that was clear in Turner's recently concluded renewal with DISH. The deal is entirely consistent with the business goals we've shared with you, and it means that we've now successfully completed renewals with 8 of Turner's top 10 distributors during this renewal cycle.
HBO and DISH also concluded a new affiliate agreement, underscoring both HBO's commitment to its traditional distributors and the value it provides to them. And on the heels of a very strong 2014, HBO continued to grow its subscriber base in the first quarter. Its subscriber momentum is a reflection of the powerful combination of the biggest and most recent Hollywood hits with the very best collection of groundbreaking original content.
This year, HBO's programming is once again standing out from the crowd, including headline-making documentaries like Going Clear and The Jinx. Earlier this month, Game of Thrones returned for its fifth season, with its season premiere growing over last season when it became HBO's most watched original series ever.
We're also off to a strong start for the new seasons of Veep, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and Silicon Valley. And we'll follow those up with second seasons of True Detective and The Leftovers, with new shows like Ballers and The Brink, and with an expansion of our relationship with Vice. And as good as the current lineup is, we're just as excited about the pipeline, with shows like Westworld from J.J. Abrams; Divorce, which will star Sarah Jessica Parker; and a rock 'n roll drama from Martin Scorsese, all coming to HBO in the near future.
Warner Bros. Television continues to match the success of our networks with an industry-leading lineup of programs across broadcast and cable, including the #1 comedy and the #1 unscripted series among adults 18 to 49 this season. Warner's content has also been key to Cartoon Networks' success, with DC property Team Titans Go! ranking as the #1 show among boys 6 to 11 in the quarter. And we're set for another very strong showing in this year's upfront, where we expect DC to once again be a driving force for WBTV.
We also continue to see growth outside the U.S. with record international TV distribution revenue in the first quarter.
We've had similar success theatrically, where Warner's was #1 at the domestic box office in the quarter. Its performance was led by American Sniper, which opened to wide release and great acclaim in January and to date has brought in well over $0.5 billion at the global box office. In just 2 weeks, we're releasing another potential global hit, Mad Max: Fury Road. And in the coming years, we think we have the strongest lineup of franchised films in the studio's history.
Against that backdrop of momentum within the traditional ecosystem, let me talk for a moment about the progress we're making beyond that ecosystem. We see significant opportunities to further monetize our great content and to grow our leading brands through new broadband-delivered video services, branded online destinations and franchise extensions like videogames. And those opportunities are increasingly global in nature.
Last month, we broke new ground with the debut of HBO Now. That's our standalone broadband-delivered version of HBO. We started with Apple as our exclusive digital launch partner and Cablevision as our first traditional distribution partner. And you'll hear about even more ways to get HBO soon. 
The initial response has been very positive both in terms of subscribers and usage. And we are confident that with this launch, we're laying the groundwork for HBO's next leg of growth both domestically and around the world. That's just one example of how we're taking advantage of broadband distribution to extend the reach and increase the value of our content and our networks.
In the first quarter, Warner started the rollout of an SVOD service in Southeast Asia, in partnership with SingTel and Sony Pictures, called HOOQ. HOOQ launched the service in the Philippines in March and plans to expand to India, Thailand and Indonesia soon. And Hollywood VIP, Warner's SVOD partnership with China's Tencent, continues to perform strongly with growth accelerating in the most recent quarter.
Domestically, Turner and HBO have agreed to include their networks in the new multichannel offering from Sling. And Turner is now distributing its networks through Sony Vue. Turner's syndication deal with Hulu further underscores the demand for our networks and their content across distribution platforms.
New distribution platforms are also demonstrating the enduring value of Warner's vast library. Just this quarter, Warner's licensed Friends to SVOD. That's more than a decade after it went off the air.
These new platforms and the growth in connected devices are creating additional ways for us to engage with consumers, and CNN is taking full advantage. CNN Digital reached more than 66 million multiplatform users in the U.S. during the first quarter, and it was the #1 news provider in mobile page views. CNN's strength across all platforms was underscored by the range of new digital distribution partnerships we announced in the first quarter, including Snapchat, Roku, the Apple Watch and Apple TV.
We are also building a global digital sports business around Bleacher Report, and we couldn't be more pleased with its performance. Last year, Bleacher Report passed Yahoo! to become the #2 sports destination. That's a position it maintained in the first quarter, helping it to post double-digit revenue growth over last year.
We saw a similar live [ph] strong revenue growth on March Madness Live, another key digital sports asset. March Madness Live was a huge success this year, serving 81 million live video streams [ph] and growing consumption by almost 20%. It's a great example of how the traditional and new digital ecosystems can successfully coexist. And it's just one of the success stories our brands have recently had in the app environment.
You've heard me say many times that Warner's is the global leader in television and film production, but we're also building momentum in our games business. We ended the first quarter with double-digit market share in the U.S., our highest share ever. And our recent release of Mortal Kombat X generated more than $130 million in consumer sales in its first week of release. 
Our next major release will be the conclusion of our Batman Arkham Trilogy, Arkham Knight, which is going to hit stores later this quarter. And this fall, we'll be extending our LEGO games franchise into the toys-to-life category with the release of LEGO Dimensions. Dimensions will blend iconic franchises with physical LEGOs and interactive console play. LEGO and DC are key drivers of our theatrical and television businesses going forward, and games are a natural extension and growth opportunity that we're very excited about.
So you can see, this is a very active, very exciting time at Time Warner. We're reinforcing and benefiting from our investments in the health of the traditional film and TV ecosystems while aggressively pursuing the many growth opportunities we see beyond them. And we're more confident than ever that the investments we're making in great content will help drive growth for many years to come.
Thanks. Now let me turn it over to Howard."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a great start to the year with revenue growth of 5%, adjusted operatin",2237,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.
Starting with consolidated results. We're off to a great start to the year with revenue growth of 5%, adjusted operating income up a very strong 12% to a quarterly record of $1.8 billion and adjusted EPS up 23%. We're especially pleased with our results in light of significant foreign exchange headwinds, which were a drag of about $130 million on adjusted operating income and $0.14 on adjusted EPS in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income margins expanded more than 150 basis points, largely as a result of the cost-saving initiatives we undertook last year. Reflecting that, SG&A was down 7% in the quarter. At the same time, we increased investments both in content and marketing, including the support -- including to support the launch of HBO Now.
Moving down the income statement. We continue to turn growth in adjusted operating income into even faster growth in adjusted EPS. And that was due to our ongoing share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, which helped offset higher equity income losses. As a reminder, our earnings now reflect 100% of CME's results through equity income.
During the first quarter, we repurchased about $900 million in shares, and combined with our dividend, we returned almost $1.2 billion to shareholders. So we're executing really well across our businesses. And this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70. That implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS when excluding the 2014 programming and restructuring charges and tax matters. And that's despite a material drag from the stronger dollar. So we feel really good about the underlying trends in our businesses, and that gives us great confidence in our long-term growth prospects.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner. With the growing operating momentum across its business, which reflected in a first quarter, 5% revenue growth and significant margin expansion translated into 26% growth in adjusted operating income and a record quarter. Turner's momentum was evident in the improvement in advertising, which grew 4% in the quarter. That was ahead of our expectations due to the strength of the NCAA Tournament and healthy growth at our domestic news business. And that was despite a drag of over 150 basis points from foreign exchange.
Domestic growth was in the mid-single digits, and that included low single-digit growth of domestic entertainment, including young adults, and very healthy double-digit growth at news, where we continue to benefit from positive ratings momentum and digital growth.
Excluding foreign exchange and the benefit from the consolidation of Esporte Interativo, our sports network in Brazil, international advertising was up high-single digits with growth across all regions.
Looking ahead, the domestic advertising market is relatively unchanged with scatter pricing up high-single digits for our entertainment networks. In the second quarter, we expect a drag of close to 300 basis points from the combination of increasing foreign exchange headwinds and the absence of NASCAR programming. Taking that into consideration, we expect total advertising revenue to be flat to up low-single digits.
Moving on. Subscription revenue increased 3% in the quarter, including a drag of over 250 basis points from foreign exchange. Domestic subscription revenue grew 4%, as pricing increases were offset by modest sub losses.
We were really pleased with our recent renewal with a major affiliate, but keep in mind that the structure of our various contracts are such that we expect to see the benefit from improved pricing related to that deal beginning in 2016.
Excluding foreign exchange, international was up double-digits, primarily due to strong growth in Latin America, where we continue to see healthy trends.
Looking to the second quarter. We expect domestic subscription revenue growth to remain in the same range as the first quarter. Based on current rates, we anticipate an impact of around 350 basis points from foreign exchange on total subscription revenue due to the continued strengthening of the dollar. As a result, we anticipate subscription revenue growth to modestly decelerate sequentially. However, we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to reaccelerate well into the double digits in 2016 and 2017.
Content revenue also grew nicely, and that was due both to the timing of SVOD availabilities and a small contribution from our new Hulu deal.
Turning to margins. We were able to drive a 700-basis-point year-over-year improvement in the quarter, partially as a result of the cost savings initiatives I noted earlier. Programming expenses were down 3%, and that was largely due to the timing of original programming as well as lower acquired programming cost related to our decision to abandon certain programming in the second half of last year. That more than offset increases in sports costs.
As we discussed with you previously, we plan to reinvest savings from the programming charges into new content that better fits our current vision for TNT and TBS, but it will take some time to execute that. Taking that into account, as well as the absence of NASCAR, we expect programming expense growth to be weighted to the back half of the year.
Total expenses declined 7% in the quarter due to lower SG&A and the decline in programming cost that I just discussed. SG&A was down 17% in the quarter, and that was due both to savings from the restructuring actions we took last year as well as lower marketing cost resulting from the timing of original programming.
Putting it all together, Turner had a great start to the year and is making real progress on its long-term strategic objectives. And we expect very strong growth in adjusted operating income in 2015.
Turning now to HBO, where subscriber trends continue to be very positive following a record year for domestic sub gains. Subscription revenue increased 4%, which included a slight drag from the transfer of HBO's basic cable service in India to Turner in January due to regulatory changes. Content and other revenues were up 5% in the quarter, and that underscored the continued demand for our content both in home entertainment and international licensing.
Across HBO's international operations, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues and adjusted operating income were flat. That was primarily due to a decline in LatAm related to the timing of certain programming expenses and foreign exchange. Overall, we still expect another year of growth at HBO's international networks, and that's a reflection of continued positive momentum in subscriber trends, especially in LatAm and the Nordics.
Adjusted operating income was down 1% in the quarter, mainly due to a 9% increase in programming expenses. And that was a result of mid-teens growth in original programming, including new series like Togetherness and documentaries Citizenfour, The Jinx and Going Clear, as well as an increase in theatrical availabilities. Marketing cost also increased to support the launch of HBO Now.
Excluding marketing costs, SG&A was down 3%, and that's a reflection of our company-wide focus on efficiencies and the restructuring actions taken in the second half of last year. 
Overall, HBO is off to a solid start to the year. The strength of the brand and demand for its content is evidenced by continued growth in its subscriber base and the positive reaction to HBO Now. And we expect subscriber growth and revenue to benefit modestly over the remainder of the year from the launch of HBO Now. 
At the same time, we will incur additional technology and marketing expenses to support its launch, which will limit the near-term benefit to adjusted operating income. And to the extent that performance exceeds our expectations this year, we will likely make additional investments in the product to position HBO Now for success over the long term.
Taking all that into account, HBO is making great progress on executing its plan and is on track for a significant acceleration in adjusted operating income growth this year.
Moving on to Warner Bros. We're off to a good start and, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income would have increased in the quarter. Revenues increased 4%, with growth across each of Warner's businesses.
Theatrical revenue benefited from the success of American Sniper. We also saw strong growth in the TV window for films both domestically and internationally, highlighting continued robust demand for our theatrical product.
Likewise, our TV business continued to benefit from strong global demand as evidenced by higher licensing revenue, including the SVOD sale of Friends. The increase in revenues was more than offset by higher associated film costs and increased P&A due to the mix of films released in the quarter. Foreign exchange was also a significant headwind. As a result, adjusted operating income declined 13%.
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue was down 4% due to lower carryover revenues and declines in catalog. However, EST revenue growth remained very healthy, up over 30% in the quarter. The broader home entertainment industry was approximately in line with our results. That's a modest improvement from the trends we saw in the second half of last year, and growth in EST also remains encouraging, up very solidly in the double-digits.
Overall, Warner Bros. had a good quarter and is on track to deliver very attractive growth in adjusted operating income in 2015, led by strong TV syndication revenue as well as a robust video game slate and savings from its 2014 restructuring actions.
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled just over $1 billion. That's down from a year ago due to a significant swing in working capital, but is still very healthy conversion. The decline in working capital reflects higher content investments across the divisions, the timing of collections and higher participation payments at Warner Bros. due to the mix of titles.
Cash interest increased modestly as a result of the additional debt we issued in 2014. And our cash taxes increased primarily due to audit settlements in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash for the full year than it was in 2014, and that's primarily due to the large syndication sales at Warner's and severance payments related to the restructuring actions taken in 2014. Despite that, we anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation.
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with just over $20 billion of net debt, up about $330 million compared to the end of 2014. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders. As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased $890 million in shares, and combined with our dividend, returned almost $1.2 billion to shareholders in the first quarter.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3x. However, excluding the programming, restructuring and severance charges from the second half of 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.65x, similar to the end of 2014 and slightly below our target leverage of 2.75x.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our balanced approach to capital allocation and expect to move closer to our leverage target over the remainder of the year.
With that, let's move onto the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. We got off to a great start in the first quarter with growing operating momentum across a wide swath of our businesses. That momentum gives us a lot of confidence in our outlook for the year. Even more importantly, we did that while continuing to lay the groundwork for accelerating growth in the years to come. And this morning, we reaffirmed our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS, which we anticipate will be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70.
We're still confident in that outlook despite FX headwinds, which we now estimate are even more significant than we discussed with you previously. As the year has progressed, we have fully incorporated the remeasurement of our balance sheet, the FX drag on our equity method investees, strong growth at our international businesses and further strengthening of the dollar. And based on today's rates, we now estimate approximately a $0.40 drag on adjusted EPS from FX in 2015.
Looking more closely at the second quarter. We expect Warner's adjusted operating income to be down due to the timing of both TV availabilities of our theatrical product as well as theatrical releases and associated P&A spend. We'll also have incremental spend at HBO to support the launch of HBO Now.
As a reminder, last year's second quarter benefited from HBO's licensing arrangement with Amazon. We're currently in discussions with Amazon about the size and scope of our relationship. The outcome of those discussions could have an impact on our second quarter results, and I'll have more to say about that when the discussions conclude.
Putting that all together, we anticipate growth in adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to slow significantly in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Despite that, we feel great about the momentum we're seeing across our businesses and are on track for another very good year of growth in adjusted EPS. And our ongoing investments in high-quality video content and industry-leading brands positions us for continued growth over the years to come.
And now I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

And I think, as Richard already said, the recent partnership with HBO Now is one example. But you can also see it in the CNN placement on the Apple Watch and CNN Go on Apple TV. So it's no surprise, I don't think, to anybody that Apple would be interested in launching a video product in the nature of a larger bundle as time goes along. We're pretty confident that not only will Apple do that, but you've also seen it with some of the other offerings, whether it's Sling's or Sony's. And there's lot of energy and innovation around video-on-demand that is getting supercharged by the capacity of Internet delivery, broadband delivery, to really bring VOD and good interfaces to people's homes. They love the channel. And so if you have great channels and no weak channels, which I think is the position of Time Warner, all of these developments are something that we think -- we welcome.

And while the U.S. multichannel household universe has been experiencing some subscriber losses, they haven't been material, and we don't anticipate that they're going to be material. And as you've seen with us striking deals with Sling and with Sony and likely with others in the future, we're working hard with our existing MVPD partners as well as new partners to try to bring the multichannel subscription packaging to another level that will reach subscribers that otherwise haven't joined the multichannel ecosystem. So I'm hopeful. I think we're hopeful collectively that this new packaging era that we're moving into is going to reverse the subscriber trend losses that we've been experiencing recently in the United States. And I think we're entering a really, really exciting period, where we can absolutely see subscriber growth.

So the point we'll get into, and I'm going to give it to Kevin in a minute, is you have to look at the particular show and where it is in its life cycle. You got to look at what alternate use it would have and worldwide sales on other outlets, whether it's networks or international territories, et cetera. So let me just say something about the SVOD impact on the ecosystem that I think answers your question. I mean, there -- of course, there are increased bidding. As the world moves to offering more on-demand ways to see your favorite show, all the networks, whether it's in the United States or overseas, are bringing VOD into their network offerings. And so you can either license things to what we all used to think of as traditional linear networks that has a VOD offering, like a Sky in Western Europe, or you can license it to an SVOD, a pure SVOD service like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu Plus, et cetera. And what we basically do is we try to figure out what is the best match for a given piece of programming given its time in its life cycle and given the platform that it's going to be on. And we're not just trying to optimize -- well, we are trying to optimize the value of the show, but we have to think about the position of the network or platform that's bidding for the rights and how to really evolve the overall ecosystem as we do it. So that's basically how we view these things. In the case of the shows you are mentioning, we thought Hulu's ad-supported environment was a better fit for Turner's shows on some of their deals. And we think that the licensing choices we made on Seinfeld and Friends was the right choice for those. But Kevin, you did it..."

And you have to look at not only where the show is in its life cycle, but what the marketplace looks like for that particular show. So there isn't a one-size-fits-all for where the -- when you should go out into SVOD on a particular program. Because I would use Person of Interest as an example. Person of Interest in the first cycle of our syndication sale, we shared the window with WGN and Netflix. And so that was -- that's an example of where we think that that's at an appropriate way to market that particular show to maximize its value. In Friends and Seinfeld, as Jeff mentioned, those are very late in their life cycle, third cycle for Friends and fourth cycle for Seinfeld. And it was obviously very opportunistic and a very good economic value for those particular shows. And so we took them. And I think it was the right thing for both of those shows."

Obviously -- and I would use The Big Bang Theory as an example of that and why there's continuing demand for those types of shows.

And so we're going to continue to be able to fill that need. Will there be pressure on second- and third- and fourth-tier shows? Absolutely. I think that you will see some pressure on those shows.

Because if you look at the Turner networks with the top 4 networks having the lion's share of Turner's business, if you put HBO with that, you be at 5 of the most heavily demanded must-carry networks in the world that have been really sought after by everybody that's coming up with these various other packages, smaller packages, VOD packages, whatever it is. And we think basically, whether it's the question of what goes into a video-on-demand package or what goes into a smaller bundle, to the extent distributors were able to create packages that are more attractive to consumers, given the networks we have, we think that's great for both consumers and for our networks. And that's the reason why, over the last many years, we were concentrating our efforts on basically making our must-have networks stronger and having more must-see programming rather than launching marginal networks that others have done. So we've got about 90% of our affiliate fees at Time Warner in 5 networks. And we think they add a lot of value to consumers and have the kind of programming that people love on demand.

In addition, despite the Nielsen ratings challenges, we're seeing ratings momentum across most of our big networks. So of course, that should help as well, and we're feeling really good about the programming lineup that we'll be unveiling for advertisers in a few weeks. And we're going to come to the market, for the first time in the history of Turner, with our entire portfolio. And so we're excited about that. And you -- and we will be unveiling. And you'll see new products with an increased focus on data analytics, targeting and ROI. And I thought today's article in The Wall Street Journal was just sort of the early stages of the case that TV is going to be making as it relates to a really vibrant advertising medium. And so we're going to be offering advertisers the ability to integrate data analytics into TV advertising and also to do behavioral targeting. And while targeting is not new for us, it's different now, at least for 3 reasons. Number one, there's significantly more data available than ever before. Number two, it helps us understand our audiences better and how to categorize the audiences into segments that are valuable to advertisers. And then the third is technology advancement will enable us to better manage inventory and insert the right ads at the right time to the right audience. So we're looking forward to unveiling the upfront in a few weeks, and you'll see that. Regarding programmatic, I'll speak to it from the network side, and maybe Kevin will comment from the studio side. We're continuing to explore, obviously, many new advertising app models, that includes programmatic. On the TV side, we're experimenting with a very small amount of our inventory. And we've got strong controls in place around pricing. And it's not likely that we're going to be doing programmatic at scale on the TV side in the near term. At Turner, we've got a small number of must-have networks obviously, and we don't have a material amount of excess inventory anyway. So that's the kind of inventory which would more likely get sold programmatically. And so we'll probably continue to leverage it selectively. We're doing more audience targeting on TV, but let's not confuse that with programmatic. In digital, it's clearly a much bigger opportunity and we're using programmatic a lot more. And we're going to continue to sell a bigger portion of our digital inventory through programmatic partners and at the same time, building out more robust data management capabilities to provide our advertising partners with better audience segmentation and targeting. So that should allow us to monetize our inventory more effectively. So let me turn it over to Kevin."

Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. 
After the prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for a Q&A session. Jeff?"

We had another very strong quarter, with revenues increasing 8% to $7.3 billion, reflecting growth at all our operating divisions.

We had another very strong quarter, with revenues increasing 8% to $7.3 billion, reflecting growth at all our operating divisions. We grew our adjusted operating income by 15% to a record $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS was up 28% and year-to-date, we've returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
These results reflect the steady progress we're making on our strategic priorities, and they put us on track for another year of very attractive financial performance. 
As you all know, we're committed to delivering industry-leading financial results, while investing aggressively to adapt to the rapid changes in the media landscape. 
We will continue to help fund those investments through a company-wide focus on operational efficiency. And those investments is what will allow us to capitalize on the growing global opportunities for the very best video content across both the traditional and emerging video ecosystems. 
You can see how we're taking advantage of those opportunities and the performance of each of our divisions this quarter. Let me start with Home Box Office, where our unrivaled original programming has never been strong. 
This year, HBO and its sister channel, Cinemax, received a combined 131 Primetime Emmy nominations. That includes a record of 125th for HBO, and that marks the 15th-year in a row that HBO has received the most nominations of any network, and it includes nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series for Silicon Valley and VEEP and for Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones. 
These accolades reflect the excitement we're seeing among HBO subscribers. Game of Thrones, fifth season set yet another record as the most-watched HBO season ever, captivating over 20 million viewers each episode. 
And 3 of our acclaimed newcomers from last year, Silicon Valley, Last Week, Tonight with John Oliver and True Detective, each returned to strong audiences in their second season. 
In June, we introduced 2 new hits, Ballers and The Brink, both of which have been renewed. 
We launched HBO NOW, our standalone streaming service in the U.S. during the second quarter, and we're extremely pleased with how well it's been received. It was the top grossing entertainment app on iTunes in both May and June, and we recently expanded its distribution to Verizon, Amazon and Google. We'll be adding other platforms soon as well as more traditional distribution lines. 
Given the positive earlier reaction to NOW, we're already investing in additional programming to support the service. 
For example, we think programming from our new multiplatform agreement with sports personality, Bill Simmons, will be particularly appealing to consumers in an on demand environment. 
At the same time, our discussions with the creative community indicate HBO GO and HBO NOW have made the service an even more attractive outlet and you'll see additional amounts, which demonstrating that in the coming months. 
In addition to programming, we'll be investing even more in marketing to take advantage of the large subscriber opportunity we see in front of us. 
We're also in the process of significantly increasing our programming investment Turner entertainment networks with a focus on more creatively ambitious projects, and that's going to further differentiate and strengthen networks that are already leading the industry. 
In the second quarter, TNT and TBS ranked #1 and #2, respectively, among ad-supported cable networks in prime time for adults 18-49. 
And including Adult Swim, Turner climbed the top 3 spots in primetime among adults 18-34. 
Adult Swim also finished this ad-supported cable's #1 network in total day among adults 18-34 for the 29th consecutive quarter, supported by our originals like Rick and Morty, which just celebrated its second season debut by more than doubling its audience from last season's premiere. 
TNT's leading performance in the quarter underscore the importance of our partnership with the NBA and the strength of our untapped talent. So we're particularly pleased that the crew of the Emmy award-winning, Inside the NBA, has re-app with Turner for the duration of our new NBA agreement. 
Over time, we are confident that refreshing our brands and our content at TBS and TNT will result in the same kind of renaissance we're seeing at Cartoon Network and CNN. 
Cartoon Network grew total day ratings among kids 6-11 by double digits, and it was the only major kids network to grow in the quarter, overtaking Nickelodeon as the #2 network in ad demo for the first time in its history. 
At CNN, primetime viewership in its key 25-54 demo grew 25% in the quarter, and it continued to age down while our competitors aged up. 
CNN is also building on its leading digital. In June, CNN.com streamed 212 million videos, that's a record for the site, and it made it the news leader in digital video for the second straight month, ahead of Buzz feed and Yahoo! news. 
Turner and Warner Bros. also making progress on their global kids strategy. Together, they recently announced plans to produce close to 450 half hours of original animated content for Turner's kids networks and to make greater use of Warner's iconic animation library globally. 
In addition to making Boomerang, a global brand for Cartoon Network, this will provide a new platform for Warner's to reinvigorate classic characters and to create new kids franchise. And it's a great example of the natural collaboration taking place across the company. 
We're upgrading not just our content, but also, our marketing partners' ability to utilize it effectively. At this year's upfront, we announced the new Turner data cloud, which provides marketers a greatly enhanced ability to target audiences across our linear and digital properties. 
And our innovative advertising products were critical to Turner [indiscernible] price increases at the very top of the industry. 
Warner Bros. also had a strong performance in this year's upfront with 62 programs slated for the upcoming television season. Warner's lineup included 29 shares on broadcast time with at least 2 series on each network. That includes a record 20 returning shows, and it makes Warner's the top supplier of broadcast series, again, this year. 
We all know Warner's is the gold standard in television and film production, but its growing videogame business is also an industry leader. 
For the first half of the year, Warner ranked as the top videogame publisher in North America and had the 2 biggest releases in Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X. We're looking to build on that momentum with next month's release of LEGO Dimensions, our entry into the Toys to Life category. 
What you're seeing across Warner, which is also happening throughout our company is how the best IP can be monetized across many different platforms both inside and beyond traditional ecosystems. 
For example, D.C. content is the basis for 7 shows scheduled to air in the upcoming season, including returning heads like The Flash and Gotham and new shows such as Supergirl. 
It's also the basis for our biggest names franchise and the new ventures like DC Superhero Girl, the toys of digital content partnerships we recently announced with Mattel. 
Plus, I can't resist, we still have a nice business selling actual comic books. And of course, there are the films. At last month's Comic-Con, the new retailer for Batman v. Superman, Dawn of Justice, generated the most buzz in any upcoming film, both inside the convention halls and on social media and DC's Suicide Squad was not far behind. Those films don't come out until 2016, but they provide a sense as to why we have so much confidence in our slate for the next year and many years to come. 
So a year after the Time Inc. spin-off, I'm really pleased with how we're executing our strategy to take advantage of the growing opportunities we see both within and beyond the traditional video 
ecosystem. 
At the same time, we recognize the pace of change in our industry is accelerating, and that means we're going to have to move even faster to ensure we have the best content, provide the best possible consumer experience and can monetize our viewership effectively across a wide variety of platforms and geographies, all while maintaining our focus on operational efficiency. 
So in the coming months and years, you'll see us investing aggressively to stay ahead of the changes in our industry and capitalize on an environment where the biggest hits, networks and brands are taking share. 
With our global scale and strong brands, I'm confident we're well positioned for that environment, and that we can both beat our strategic objectives and continue to deliver industry-leading financial results. 
With that, let me turn it over to Howard."
24689,305675205,849304,"Time Warner Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. Halfway through the year, our execution to date. In the first half, we grew adjust",2290,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. Halfway through the year, our execution to date. In the first half, we grew adjusted operating income 13% and adjusted EPS 25%, and we did that while making progress on our strategic objectives and investing aggressively for future growth. 
In the second quarter, revenue was up a very healthy 8% and adjusted operating income rose 15% to $1.9 billion, a record quarterly profit. 
And excluding a drag of approximately 400 basis points from FX, revenue growth would have been 12%. 
In addition to strong revenue growth, adjusted operating income margins expanded more than 150 basis points, and that's despite 6% growth from total expenses, primarily from increased investments in content and marketing. 
Moving forward, we'll remain disciplined on overhead and other nonprogramming related spending to help fund investments that will strengthen our competitive position and drive future growth. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted EPS grew 28% in the quarter, so once again, we were able to grow adjusted EPS even faster than adjusted operating income. That was helped by our ongoing share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased over $900 million in shares and paid close to $300 million in dividends. 
So year-to-date, we returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders. 
And this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015, adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70. That implied mid-teens growth and adjusted EPS when excluding the programming and restructuring charges and tax matters in the second half of 2014. And that's despite a material drag from a stronger U.S. dollar that we have discussed previously. 
So we feel really good about how we're operating and remain focused on executing our strategy to drive continued growth longer term. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we posted very strong profit growth of 20%. 
Subscription revenues increased 2% or 6%, excluding the impact of FX. Domestic subscription revenue grew 4%, consistent with the first quarter. Absent a drag of approximately 20 percentage points from FX, international subscription revenue was up low double digits. And on that basis, we continue to see the healthiest trends in Latin America. 
Looking to the third quarter, we expect a negative impact of approximately 500 basis points on total subscription revenue growth as a result of FX and the benefit from certain contractual settlements in the third quarter of 2014. However, we expect underlying domestic subscriber trend to be consistent with the first half of the year and remain on track for domestic sub revenue growth to accelerate into the teens in 2016 and 2017. 
Moving on, advertising declined 1%, but excluding FX grew a little more than 1%. That was a bit below our initial expectation, largely due to airing fewer NBA playoffs game than anticipated. 
In total, the impact from foreign exchange, fewer NBA games and the absence of NASCAR weighed on gross by close to 500 basis points in the quarter. 
Domestic advertising improved slightly in the quarter. International advertising grew low sample digits when excluding an FX drag of over 18% and a benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil, and that was despite difficult comparisons in Latin America due to the impact of the World Cup last year. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, scatter pricing is currently facing up high single to low double digits, but weighing center on entertainment networks is likely offset the benefits. 
We also expect a drag of over 400 basis points on advertising from a combination of foreign exchange, and the absence of the NASCAR programming.  As a result, we anticipate total advertising revenue to be down modestly. 
Content and other revenues increased close to 50% in the quarter, and that was boosted by our deal with Hulu, which is a great example of how we can benefit from our increased investment in and ownership of original programming. 
Adjusted operating income was up 20% with margins expanding close to 600 basis points. That was helped by a 6% decline in total expenses, including lower programming costs. 
Programming expenses were down 9% in the quarter. That was largely due to the absence of NASCAR programming as well as lower acquired programming costs. 
As we discussed with you previously, we are investing in new content that better fits our refresh programming strategy at TNT and TBS. So ramping that programming will start to show up in the fourth quarter of this year. Taking that into account in the absence of NASCAR programming in the third quarter, we anticipate that programming cost growth will be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. 
SG&A expenses were essentially flat in the quarter, but excluding a reversal of an accrued contingency in the second quarter of last year, SG&A would have been down mid-single digits, and that reflects our continued focus on cost efficiencies and savings from last year's restructuring action. 
So overall, Turner's executing really well and is making great progress on the strategic initiative. And we remain on track to deliver strong growth and adjusted operating income in 2015, while continuing to make the investments necessary to position us for strong growth over the long term. 
Turning now to HBO, where we are investing significantly to take advantage of the large global opportunity we see for premium services. 
Domestically, subscription revenue growth remained in the mid-single digits despite very attractive sub-growth. 
Consistent with recent quarters, subscription revenue growth has been limited by a shift towards nonrevenue generated subs. 
Over time, we expect to better monetize those subscribers, which should help drive an acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth. 
Similarly, we anticipate HBO NOW will be a more material contributor to subscription revenue growth over time. We're pleased with the initial consumer response to the service, but we saw only a modest benefit to the sub-revenue in the second quarter due to the 30-day free trial period for new subscribers. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect to benefit from a full quarter of paying subs on HBO NOW. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO NOW recently launched on Amazon, Google and Verizon, which should contribute more meaningfully to subscription revenue growth later in the year. 
Moving on, content and other revenues were down 7% in the quarter due in part to difficult comparisons with our home entertainment releases. 
In the quarter, we recognized a comparable amount of revenues from our licensing agreement with Amazon as we did in the year ago quarter, while agreeing to expand our relationship to include the distribution of HBO NOW. 
At our international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, we continue to see good subscriber growth but revenues declined due to foreign currency movement and the transfer of HBO's basic service in India to Turner. 
Adjusted operating income fell 8% in the quarter as we made significant investments in marketing and technology to support the launch of HBO NOW. 
And given our plan to continue investing in customer acquisition, we expect HBO NOW to generate losses for the remainder of this year, and that's typical of r an early-stage subscriber business year. 
Even so, we are on track for another good year of adjusted operating income growth as we anticipate revenue trends to improve in the second half of the year. And our early experience suggest that HBO NOW will be a highly profitable revenue stream for us over time. 
Moving on to Warner Bros. which posted a record second quarter, growing revenue 15% and adjusted operating income 46%, and that's despite a significant drag from foreign exchange.  These results underscore our growing ability to monetize the best IP across a wide variety of platforms. 
The biggest growth driver was our games business, which posted its best quarter ever led by the strong performance of franchise releases Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X. 
Games' revenue more than tripled, passing $0.5 billion in the second quarter alone and with a great IP of Warner's disposal, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for this business. 
On the TV side, revenue increased over 20% due to strong growth and licensing fees. That growth included the second cycle syndication of The Big Bang Theory, the SVOD licensing of Seinfeld and an international license of Friends, all of which highlight the increasing value of hit content. 
In theatrical business, revenues declined in the quarter despite modest growth from our film releases, and that was a result of lower TV licensing of films and the timing of the home entertainment release of the latest installment of The Hobbit franchise. 
Across theoretical and TV, home entertainment revenue was down 18%, that was due to timing of home entertainment release I just mentioned and softness in catalog. 
Even with that difficult comparison, EST revenue growth remains healthy, increasing close to 20%. And EST growth for the industry was close to 30%, helping offset the decline in physical sales, up to consumer spending across the broader home entertainment industry down mid-single digits in the quarter. 
So overall, Warner Bros. had a terrific quarter and is on pace for very attractive growth and a record year of adjusted operating income in 2015 and with great theatrical slate and momentum at our TV and games businesses, we're confident we can continue to drive solid growth in the coming years. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled $1.8 billion in the first half, that's down from a year ago due to a significant swing in working capital, but it's still very healthy conversion. Growth in working capital reflects higher receivables from increased gains and content revenues, the timing of collections, severance payments related to last year's restructuring initiatives and increased content investments across our divisions. 
Cash interest increased modestly as a result of the additional debt we issued last year and our cash taxes declined, primarily due to favorable tax legislation that was passed late in 
2014. Looking ahead, we continue to expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash for the full year than it was in 2014. That is mainly due to strong syndication revenues at Warner's and severance payments related to the restructuring actions taken in 2014. 
Despite that, we anticipate 2016 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $20.7 billion of net debt, up nearly $800 million from the end of 2015. That's, largely due to our ongoing commitment to direct shareholder returns. 
In the first half of the year, we returned a total of $2.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2.9 billion of long-term debt at attractive rates. That included our first euro-denominated debt offering, which will lack a natural hedge to the euro-denominated assets on our balance sheet. 
We also retired $1.7 billion of debt as a result of maturity of a tender offer we made for higher price debt. And we're in the process of redeeming the remaining $300 million of that series of debt. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3x. However, excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from the second half of 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.64x, slightly below our target leverage of 2.75x. 
We continue to believe that leverage target provides us flexibility to invest in our businesses, engage in strategic M&A and provide direct return to shareholders, while at the same time, optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. 
We had a great first half of the year, and we're very pleased with the progress we're making across our businesses. That progress is evident in our results to date and our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70, which we reaffirmed this morning. 
As we discussed with you previously, that include a foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $0.40 based on current rates. 
Excluding that FX headwind, our outlook would imply over 20% growth off last year's base of $4.15. That outlook also includes ongoing investments at our network businesses in areas such as programming, marketing and technology to strengthen our position within the rapidly changing ecosystem. 
And those investments will be heavily weighted towards the back half of this year. 
At Turner, we'll begin ramping up our content investments, resulting in significantly higher programming costs and associated marketing expenses starting in the fourth quarter. 
Meanwhile, at HBO, we intend to continue investing in customer acquisition and technology for HBO NOW as we expand distribution and position the product for long-term success. 
At Warner's, we're challenging theatrical comparisons in the second half of the year. Still, we anticipate healthy growth in the third quarter due to the syndication of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest as well as the continued benefit from our strong gains slate. 
Taken the timing of our investing spending into account, we expect our growth in adjusted EPS will slow materially in the back half of the year. Even so, we're on track for another year of very attractive growth in adjusted EPS, and we believe the investments we're making in high-quality content and the development of new business models will position us for accelerated growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

I think if you go back when we started to talk about domestic subscription revenue growth expectations, we've been remarkably on track. And I would say that we're still very, very much on track for more original expeditions. So last year, we grew domestic subscriber revenue high single digits. This year, we expected that to moderate somewhat into mid-single digits and I fully expect will be able to hit that. And then in '16 and then again in '17, we fully expect that to accelerate well into the teens. And against that backdrop, we have seen some modest unit declines in the U.S. U.S. But I would say that, that trend has been in existence and ongoing now for some time, we have not seen an acceleration in those declines, and those declines have not been overly material. And of course, that trend has really been in front of our inclusion in some of these more economically viable or skinny packages, which we think over time, as they become a little bit more mature might have the ability to stabilize the overall unit trends and possibly even return it to growth overtime as we think the distributors' ability to offer more economically, the very attractive bundles to that element of the demand is only a positive thing. And of course, we, at Turner, have the type of networks that we think will be overly represented in those type of bundles. So we think the trends have been in existence for sometime, there's no acceleration of any negative trends, and we still a really positive and optimistic about what the future holds."

We've been expecting for some time that on average in any given year, we expect the whole down programming cost growth to an average no more than high single digits. And so clearly, in some years, it will be higher. In some years, it will be lower. This year, in 2015, will be a year as Howard just said with the expectation of growth only in low single digits that it will be lower than the average. In part, that's due to the loss in NASCAR and before some of the new sports kicking in future years. So for example, programming cost in Q3 will probably be down again because of the absence of NASCAR in the fourth quarter. I think we're currently planning on doubling the number of original series episodes compared to a year ago and there'll be a lot more heavily weighted to the scripted side versus non-scripted where it was 1 year ago or 2. So the average cost will be somewhat higher. But we're really excited about the programming cycle that we're going to be beginning to enter, which should be over for a long period.

And I have to say, this is an area we're talking a lot about the impact that technology is having on consumption. But I think technology is moving so quickly and is going to have a dramatically positive impact on the advocacy of advertising on TV. So you're right in the sense that we are making investments to strengthen our overall technology platform, and you saw us introduce a number of advanced advertising products at this year's upfront a few months ago, whether it's targeting NOW, which allows an advertiser to optimize across TNT and TBS or a product of audience of NOW, which allows us to optimize across the Turner networks with audience guarantees. So we're highly confident we're going to be able to more efficiently manage and monetize all of our inventory across all of Turner. And it's one of the reasons why we want to present all of Turner under in 1 meeting at the upfront because of the strength and the breadth of our brands. We have a lot to learn as we move forward. We're working with some of our biggest partners, and we're roughly using 20% of our inventory for targeting, but that's going to dramatically ramp in the future. We're investing in technology, we're investing in data, we've come a long way over the last year and I think a lot of the capabilities that so-called digital companies have had an advantage over TV are going to be eliminated as TV cannot only provide targeting an increase reach and relevance, but also in a very, very immersive experience with longform video that's professionally produced. So I think we're in a very, very early stages of seeing TV make a dramatic comeback on the attractiveness of advertising."

Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO.

We had another very strong quarter, with revenues increasing 8% to $7.3 billion, reflecting growth at all our operating divisions. We grew our adjusted operating income by 15% to a record $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS was up 28%, and year-to-date, we have returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
These results reflect the steady progress we're making on our strategic priorities, and they put us on track for another year of very attractive financial performance. 
As you all know, we're committed to delivering industry-leading financial results, while investing aggressively to adapt to the rapid changes in the media landscape. 
We will continue to help fund those investments through a company-wide focus on operational efficiency. And those investments are what will allow us to capitalize on the growing global opportunities for the very best video content across both the traditional and emerging video ecosystems. 
You can see how we're taking advantage of those opportunities and the performance of each of our divisions this quarter. Let me start with Home Box Office, where our unrivaled original programming has never been strong. 
This year, HBO and its sister channel, Cinemax, received a combined 131 Primetime Emmy nominations. That includes a record of 126th for HBO, and that marks the 15th year in a row that HBO has received the most nominations of any network, and it includes nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series for Silicon Valley and Veep and for Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones. 
These accolades reflect the excitement we're seeing among HBO subscribers. Game of Thrones' fifth season set yet another record as the most-watched HBO season ever, captivating over 20 million viewers each episode. 
And 3 of our acclaimed newcomers from last year, Silicon Valley, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and True Detective, each returned to strong audiences in their second seasons. 
In June, we introduced 2 new hits, Ballers and The Brink, both of which have already been renewed. 
We launched HBO Now, our standalone streaming service in the U.S. during the second quarter, and we're extremely pleased with how well it's been received. It was the top-grossing entertainment app on iTunes in both May and June, and we recently extended its distribution to Verizon, Amazon and Google. We'll be adding other platforms soon as well as more traditional distribution partners. 
Given the positive early reaction to Now, we are already investing in additional programming to support the service. 
For example, we think programming from our new multiplatform agreement with sports personality, Bill Simmons, will be particularly appealing to consumers in an on-demand environment. 
At the same time, our discussions with the creative community indicate HBO GO and HBO Now have made the service an even more attractive outlet, and you'll see additional amounts demonstrating that in the coming months. 
In addition to programming, we'll be investing even more in marketing to take advantage of the large subscriber opportunity we see in front of us. 
We're also in the process of significantly increasing our programming investment at Turner's entertainment networks, with a focus on more creatively ambitious projects, and that's going to further differentiate and strengthen networks that are already leading the industry. 
In the second quarter, TNT and TBS ranked #1 and #2 respectively among ad-supported cable networks in prime time with adults 18 to 49. 
And including Adult Swim, Turner claimed the top 3 spots in prime time among adults 18 to 34. 
Adult Swim also finished as ad-supported cable's #1 network in total day among adults 18 to 34 for the 29th consecutive quarter, supported by originals like Rick and Morty, which just celebrated its second season debut by more than doubling its audience from last season's premiere. 
TNT's leading performance in the quarter underscored the importance of our partnership with the NBA and the strength of our on-air talent. So we're particularly pleased that the crew of the Emmy award-winning, Inside the NBA, has re-upped with Turner for the duration of our new NBA agreement. 
Over time, we are confident that refreshing our brands and our content at TBS and TNT will result in the same kind of renaissance we're seeing at Cartoon Network and CNN. 
Cartoon Network grew total day ratings among kids 6 to 11 by double digits, and it was the only major kids network to grow in the quarter, overtaking Nickelodeon as the #2 network in that demo for the first time in its history. 
At CNN, prime time viewership in its key 25 to 54 demo grew 25% in the quarter, and it continued to age down, while our competitors aged up. 
CNN is also building on its lead in digital. In June, CNN.com streamed 212 million videos, that's a record for the site, and it made it the news leader in digital video for the second straight month, ahead of BuzzFeed and Yahoo! News. 
Turner and Warner Bros. are also making progress on their global kids strategy. Together, they recently announced plans to produce close to 450 half hours of original animated content for Turner's kids networks and to make greater use of Warner's iconic animation library globally. 
In addition to making Boomerang, a global flanker brand for Cartoon Network, this will provide a new platform for Warner's to reinvigorate classic characters and to create new kids franchises. And it's a great example of the natural collaboration taking place across the company. 
We're upgrading not just our content, but also our marketing partners' ability to utilize it effectively. At this year's upfront, we announced the new Turner data cloud, which provides marketers a greatly enhanced ability to target audiences across our linear and digital properties. 
And our innovative advertising products were critical to Turner garnering price increases at the very top of the industry. 
Warner Bros. also had a strong performance in this year's upfront, with 62 programs slated for the upcoming television season. Warner's lineup included 29 shows on broadcast prime time, with at least 2 series on each network. That includes a record 20 returning shows, and it makes Warner's the top supplier of broadcast series again this year. 
We all know Warner's is the gold standard in television and film production, but its growing videogame business is also an industry leader. 
For the first half of the year, Warner ranked as the top videogame publisher in North America and had the 2 biggest releases in Batman Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X. We're looking to build on that momentum with next month's release of LEGO Dimensions, our entry into the toys-to-life category. 
What you're seeing across Warner, which is also happening throughout our company, is how the best IP can be monetized across many different platforms both inside and beyond traditional ecosystems. 
For example, DC content is the basis for 7 shows scheduled to air in the upcoming season, including returning hits like The Flash and Gotham, and new shows such as Supergirl. 
It's also the basis for our biggest names franchise and new ventures like DC Super Hero Girls, the toys of a digital content partnership we recently announced with Mattel. 
Plus, I can't resist pointing out, we still have a nice business selling actual comic books. And of course, there are the films. At last month's Comic-Con, the new trailer for Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, generated the most buzz of any upcoming film both inside the convention halls and on social media. And DC's Suicide Squad was not far behind. Those films don't come out until 2016, but they provide a sense as to why we have so much confidence in our slate for the next year and many years to come. 
So a year after the Time Inc. spin-off, I'm really pleased with how we're executing our strategy to take advantage of the growing opportunities we see both within and beyond the traditional video 
ecosystem. 
At the same time, we recognize the pace of change in our industry is accelerating, and that means we're going to have to move even faster to ensure we have the best content, provide the best possible consumer experience and can monetize our viewership effectively across a wide variety of platforms and geographies, all while maintaining our focus on operational efficiency. 
So in the coming months and years, you'll see us investing aggressively to stay ahead of the changes in our industry and capitalize on an environment where the biggest hits, networks and brands are taking share. 
With our global scale and strong brands, I'm confident we're well positioned for that environment and that we can both meet our strategic objectives and continue to deliver industry-leading financial results. 
With that, let me turn it over to Howard."
24689,305675205,849702,"Time Warner Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. Halfway through the year, we're really pleased with our execution to date. In the",2302,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. Halfway through the year, we're really pleased with our execution to date. In the first half, we grew adjusted operating income 13% and adjusted EPS 25%, and we did that while making progress on our strategic objectives and investing aggressively for future growth. 
In the second quarter, revenue was up a very healthy 8% and adjusted operating income rose 15% to $1.9 billion, a record quarterly profit. And excluding a drag of approximately 400 basis points from FX, revenue growth would have been 12%. 
In addition to strong revenue growth, adjusted operating income margins expanded more than 150 basis points, and that's despite a 6% growth from total expenses, primarily from increased investments in content and marketing. 
Moving forward, we'll remain disciplined on overhead and other nonprogramming-related spending to help fund investments that will strengthen our competitive position and drive future growth. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted EPS grew 28% in the quarter, so once again, we were able to grow adjusted EPS even faster than adjusted operating income. That was helped by our ongoing share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased over $900 million in shares and paid close to $300 million in dividends. So year-to-date, we have returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders. 
And this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015, adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70. That implies mid-teens growth and adjusted EPS when excluding the programming and restructuring charges and tax matters from the second half of 2014. And that's despite a material drag from a stronger U.S. dollar that we have discussed with you previously. 
So we feel really good about how we're operating and remain focused on executing our strategy to drive continued growth longer-term. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we posted very strong profit growth of 20%. 
Subscription revenues increased 2% or 6%, excluding the impact of FX. Domestic subscription revenue grew 4%, consistent with the first quarter. Absent a drag of approximately 20 percentage points from FX, international subscription revenue was up low double digits. And on that basis, we continue to see the healthiest trends in Latin America. 
Looking to the third quarter, we expect a negative impact of approximately 500 basis points on total subscription revenue growth as a result of FX and the benefit from certain contractual settlements in the third quarter of 2014. However, we expect underlying domestic subscriber trends to be consistent with the first half of the year and remain on track for domestic sub revenue growth to accelerate into the teens in 2016 and 2017. 
Moving on. Advertising declined 1%, but excluding FX, grew a little more than 1%. That was a bit below our initial expectation, largely due to airing fewer NBA playoff games than anticipated. 
In total, the impact from foreign exchange, fewer NBA games and the absence of NASCAR weighed on growth by close to 500 basis points in the quarter. 
Domestic advertising grew slightly in the quarter. International advertising grew low single digits when excluding an FX drag of over 18% and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil. And that was despite difficult comparisons in Latin America due to the impact of the World Cup last year. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, scatter pricing is currently pacing up high single to low double digits, though ratings at our entertainment networks will likely offset that benefit. 
We also expect a drag of over 400 basis points on advertising from the combination of foreign exchange and the absence of NASCAR programming. As a result, we anticipate total advertising revenue to be down modestly. 
Content and other revenues increased close to 50% in the quarter, and that was boosted by our deal with Hulu, which is a great example of how we can benefit from our increased investment in and ownership of original programming. 
Adjusted operating income was up 20%, with margins expanding close to 600 basis points. That was helped by a 6% decline in total expenses, including lower programming costs. 
Programming expenses were down 9% in the quarter. That was largely due to the absence of NASCAR programming as well as lower-acquired programming costs. 
As we discussed with you previously, we are investing in new content that better fits our refresh programming strategy at TNT and TBS. The ramp in that programming will start to show up in the fourth quarter of this year. Taking that into account and the absence of NASCAR programming in the third quarter, we anticipate that programming cost growth will be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. 
SG&A expenses were essentially flat in the quarter, but excluding a reversal of an accrued contingency in the second quarter of last year, SG&A would have been down mid-single digits. And that reflects our continued focus on cost efficiencies and savings from last year's restructuring action. 
So overall, Turner is executing really well and is making great progress on its strategic initiative. And we remain on track to deliver strong growth and adjusted operating income in 2015, while continuing to make the investments necessary to position us for strong growth over the long term. 
Turning now to HBO, where we are investing significantly to take advantage of the large global opportunity we see for premium services. 
Domestically, subscription revenue growth remained in the mid-single digits despite very attractive sub growth. 
Consistent with recent quarters, subscription revenue growth has been limited by a shift toward nonrevenue-generated subs. Over time, we expect to better monetize those subscribers, which should help drive an acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth. 
Similarly, we anticipate HBO Now will be a more material contributor to subscription revenue growth over time. We're pleased with the initial consumer response to the service, but we saw only a modest benefit to the sub revenue in the second quarter due to the 30-day free-trial period for new subscribers. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect to benefit from a full quarter of paying subs on HBO Now. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO Now recently launched on Amazon, Google and Verizon, which should contribute more meaningfully to subscription revenue growth later in the year. 
Moving on, content and other revenues were down 7% in the quarter due in part to difficult comparisons with our home entertainment releases. 
In the quarter, we recognized a comparable amount of revenues from our licensing agreement with Amazon as we did in the year-ago quarter, while agreeing to expand our relationship to include the distribution of HBO Now. 
At our international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, we continue to see good subscriber growth, though revenue declined due to foreign currency movement and the transfer of HBO's basic service in India to Turner. 
Adjusted operating income fell 8% in the quarter as we made significant investments in marketing and technology to support the launch of HBO Now. 
And given our plan to continue investing in customer acquisition, we expect HBO Now to generate losses for the remainder of this year, and that's typical for an early-stage subscriber business. 
Even so, we are on track for another good year of adjusted operating income growth as we anticipate revenue trends to improve in the second half of the year. And our early experience suggest that HBO Now will be a highly profitable revenue stream for us over time. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., which posted a record second quarter, growing revenue 15% and adjusted operating income 46%, and that's despite a significant drag from foreign exchange. These results underscore our growing ability to monetize the best IP across a wide variety of platforms. 
The biggest growth driver was our games business, which posted its best quarter ever, led by the strong performance of franchise releases, Batman Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X. 
Games' revenue more than tripled, passing $0.5 billion in the second quarter alone, and with a great IP at Warner's disposal, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for this business. 
On the TV side, revenue increased over 20% due to strong growth and licensing fees. That growth included the second cycle syndication of The Big Bang Theory, the SVOD licensing of Seinfeld and an international license of Friends, all of which highlight the increasing value of hit content. 
In our theatrical business, revenues declined in the quarter despite modest growth from our film releases, and that was a result of lower TV licensing of films and the timing of the home entertainment release of the latest installment of The Hobbit franchise. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue was down 18%. That was due to the timing of home entertainment release I just mentioned and softness in catalog. 
Even with that difficult comparison, EST revenue growth remains healthy, increasing close to 20%. And EST growth for the industry was close to 30%, helping offset a decline in physical sales that took consumer spending across the broader home entertainment industry down mid-single digits in the quarter. 
So overall, Warner Bros. had a terrific quarter and is on pace for very attractive growth and a record year of adjusted operating income in 2015. And with a great theatrical slate and momentum at our TV and games businesses, we're confident we can continue to drive solid growth in the coming years. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled $1.8 billion in the first half. That's down from a year ago due to a significant swing in working capital, but it's still very healthy conversion. Growth in working capital reflects higher receivables from increased gains and content revenues, the timing of collections, severance payments related to last year's restructuring initiatives and increased content investments across our divisions. 
Cash interest increased modestly as a result of the additional debt we issued last year, and our cash taxes declined, primarily due to favorable tax legislation that was passed late in 2014. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash for the full year than it was in 2014. And that is mainly due to strong syndication revenues at Warner's and severance payments related to the restructuring actions taken in 2014. Despite that, we anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $20.7 billion of net debt, up nearly $800 million from the end of 2015. That's largely due to our ongoing commitment to direct shareholder returns. 
In the first half of the year, we returned a total of $2.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2.9 billion of long-term debt at attractive rates. That included our first euro-denominated debt offering, which will act as a natural hedge to the euro-denominated assets on our balance sheet. 
We also retired $1.7 billion of debt as a result of a maturity of a tender offer we made for higher price debt. And we're in the process of redeeming the remaining $300 million of that series of debt. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3x. However, excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from the second half of 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.64x, slightly below our target leverage of 2.75x. 
We continue to believe that leverage target provides us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, engage in strategic M&A and provide direct returns to shareholders, while at the same time, optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. 
We had a great first half of the year, and we're very pleased with the progress we're making across our businesses. That progress is evident in our results to date and our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70, which we reaffirm this morning. 
As we've discussed with you previously, that includes a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $0.40 based on current rates. 
Excluding that FX headwind, our outlook would imply over 20% growth off last year's base of $4.15. That outlook also includes ongoing investments at our network businesses in areas such as programming, marketing and technology to strengthen our position within the rapidly changing ecosystem. And those investments will be heavily weighted toward the back half of this year. 
At Turner, we'll begin ramping up our content investments, resulting in significantly higher programming costs and associated marketing expenses starting in the fourth quarter. 
Meanwhile, at HBO, we intend to continue investing in customer acquisition and technology for HBO Now as we expand distribution and position the product for long-term success. 
At Warner's, we are challenging theatrical comparisons in the second half of the year. Still, we anticipate healthy growth in the third quarter due to the syndication of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest as well as the continued benefit from our strong game slate. 
Taking the timing of our investment spending into account, we expect our growth in adjusted EPS will slow materially in the back half of the year. Even so, we are on track for another year of very attractive growth in adjusted EPS, and we believe the investments we're making in high-quality content and the development of new business models will position us for accelerating growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

I think if you go back to when we started to talk about domestic subscription revenue growth expectations, we've been remarkably on track. And I would say that we're still very, very much on track from our original expectations. So last year, we grew domestic subscriber revenue high single digits. This year, we expected that to moderate somewhat into mid-single digits and I fully expect we'll be able to hit that. And then in '16 and then again in '17, we fully expect that to accelerate well into the teens. And against that backdrop, we have seen some modest unit declines in the U.S. But I would say that, that trend has been in existence and ongoing now for some time. We have not seen any acceleration in those declines, and those declines have not been overly material. And of course, that trend has really been in front of our inclusion in some of these more economically viable or skinny packages, which we think, over time, as they become a little bit more mature, might have the ability to stabilize the overall unit trends and possibly even return it to growth over time as we think the distributors' ability to offer more economically the very attractive bundles to that element of the demand is only a positive thing. And of course, we, at Turner, have the type of networks that we think will be overly represented in those type of bundles. So we think the trends have been in existence for sometime. There's been no acceleration of any negative trends. And we're still really positive and optimistic about what the future holds."

This year, in 2015, will be a year, as Howard just said, with the expectation of growth only in the low single digits, that it will be lower than the average. In part, that's due to the loss of NASCAR and before some of the new sports deals kick in, in future years. So for example, programming cost in Q3 will probably be down again because of the absence of NASCAR in the fourth quarter. I think we're currently planning on doubling the number of original series episodes compared to a year ago, and they will be a lot more heavily weighted to the scripted side versus nonscripted where it was a year ago too. So the average cost per episode will be higher. But we're really excited about the programming cycle that we're going to be beginning to enter, which would -- which should be over a prolonged period.

And in fact, all those things support each other. And so what you see, everybody talks a lot about, for example, SVOD or Netflix internationally, that's fine, that's good. But what that does is it leads to increased demand from other SVOD services that leads to increased demand from other incumbent networks all over the world. And those are pretty positive. I think we mentioned a number of things in the prepared remarks on overcoming FX. And I think the way you open your question is not something we totally agree with. The timing is such we're not going to make specific statements every quarter on very long-term guidance. Things are going very well for us. If you look at 2015, this year, you had headwinds in foreign exchange of about $0.40 and yet here we are, throwing in an earnings growth essentially that takes that into account. I think we all expect just picking that FX as an ongoing situation for next year. But if you look at what we've done this year, that indicates, actually from an operating point of view, we're ahead of the plan that we gave. So I'm not going to go farther because we have decisions to make about what we do year-by-year."

I'll speak for Turner. Maybe Kevin can comment from the Warner side. We at Turner have now for some time been very, very much in favor of granting in-season stacking rights to distributors and affiliates for a number of reasons. The first is we want to make sure that with respect to the original programming that we have on the network that we're encouraging people who want to view these shows on a delayed basis, that they can come in, in the middle of the season and catch up. And we think it increases the probability of having successful shows and will drive overall viewership, not only for the shows that are stacked, but also the shows later on in the season that are being viewed live. So we think that, that can help the advertising business for the live linear feed. And we also think Comcast, for example, probably the furthest along in the development of dynamic ad insertion, we think dynamic ad insertion is a potential huge opportunity for us as network owners and for the industry at large as we think that delayed viewing as a currency will grow increasingly important over time. So we intend to offer stacking rights on all the shows that we own and get rights for, and we think it's just a really, really smart thing to do."

And I have to say, this is an area -- we're talking a lot about the impact that technology is having on consumption. But I think technology is moving so quickly and it's going to have a dramatically positive impact on the advocacy of advertising on TV. So you're right in the sense that we are making investments to strengthen our overall technology platform, and you saw us introduce a number of advanced advertising products at this year's upfront a few months ago, whether it's targeting Now, which allows an advertiser to optimize across TNT and TBS, or a product called Audience Now, which allows them to optimize across all Turner networks with audience guarantees. So we're highly confident we're going to be able to more efficiently manage and monetize all of our inventory across all of Turner. And it's one of the reasons why we wanted to present all of Turner under -- in 1 meeting at the upfront because of the strength and the breadth of our brands. We have a lot to learn as we move forward. We're working with some of our biggest partners, and we're roughly using 20% of our inventory for targeting. But that's going to dramatically ramp in the future. We're investing in technology, we're investing in data, we've come a long way over the last year. And I think a lot of the capabilities that so-called digital companies have had an advantage of over TV are going to be eliminated as TV cannot only provide targeting an increased reach in relevance, but also in a very, very immersive experience with long-form video that's professionally produced. So I think we're in the very, very early stages of seeing TV make a dramatic comeback on the attractiveness of advertising."

Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations.

We had another very strong quarter, with revenues increasing 8% to $7.3 billion, reflecting growth at all our operating divisions.

We had another very strong quarter, with revenues increasing 8% to $7.3 billion, reflecting growth at all our operating divisions. We grew our adjusted operating income by 15% to a record $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS was up 28%, and year-to-date, we've returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
These results reflect the steady progress we're making on our strategic priorities, and they put us on track for another year of very attractive financial performance. 
As you all know, we're committed to delivering industry-leading financial results, while investing aggressively to adapt to the rapid changes in the media landscape. 
We will continue to help fund those investments through a company-wide focus on operational efficiency. And those investments are what will allow us to capitalize on the growing global opportunities for the very best video content across both the traditional and emerging video ecosystems. 
You can see how we're taking advantage of those opportunities and the performance of each of our divisions this quarter. Let me start with Home Box Office, where our unrivaled original programming has never been strong. 
This year, HBO and its sister channel, Cinemax, received a combined 131 Primetime Emmy nominations. That includes a record of 126 for HBO, and that marks the 15th year in a row that HBO has received the most nominations of any network, and it includes nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series for Silicon Valley and Veep and for Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones. 
These accolades reflect the excitement we're seeing among HBO subscribers. Game of Thrones' fifth season set yet another record as the most-watched HBO season ever, captivating over 20 million viewers each episode. 
And 3 of our acclaimed newcomers from last year, Silicon Valley, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and True Detective, each returned to strong audiences in their second seasons. 
In June, we introduced 2 new hits, Ballers and The Brink, both of which have already been renewed. 
We launched HBO Now, our standalone streaming service in the U.S. during the second quarter, and we're extremely pleased with how well it's been received. It was the top-grossing entertainment app on iTunes in both May and June, and we recently extended its distribution to Verizon, Amazon and Google. We'll be adding other platforms soon as well as more traditional distribution partners. 
Given the positive early reaction to Now, we are already investing in additional programming to support the service. 
For example, we think programming from our new multiplatform agreement with sports personality, Bill Simmons, will be particularly appealing to consumers in an on-demand environment. 
At the same time, our discussions with the creative community indicate HBO GO and HBO Now have made the service an even more attractive outlet, and you'll see additional amounts demonstrating that in the coming months. 
In addition to programming, we'll be investing even more in marketing to take advantage of the large subscriber opportunity we see in front of us. 
We're also in the process of significantly increasing our programming investment at Turner's entertainment networks, with a focus on more creatively ambitious projects, and that's going to further differentiate and strengthen networks that are already leading the industry. 
In the second quarter, TNT and TBS ranked #1 and #2 respectively among ad-supported cable networks in prime time with adults 18 to 49. 
And including Adult Swim, Turner claimed the top 3 spots in prime time among adults 18 to 34. 
Adult Swim also finished as ad-supported cable's #1 network in total day among adults 18 to 34 for the 29th consecutive quarter, supported by originals like Rick and Morty, which just celebrated its second season debut by more than doubling its audience from last season's premiere. 
TNT's leading performance in the quarter underscored the importance of our partnership with the NBA and the strength of our on-air talent. So we're particularly pleased that the crew of the Emmy award-winning, Inside the NBA, has re-upped with Turner for the duration of our new NBA agreement. 
Over time, we are confident that refreshing our brands and our content at TBS and TNT will result in the same kind of renaissance we're seeing at Cartoon Network and CNN. 
Cartoon Network grew total day ratings among kids 6 to 11 by double digits, and it was the only major kids network to grow in the quarter, overtaking Nickelodeon as the #2 network in that demo for the first time in its history. 
At CNN, prime time viewership in its key 25 to 54 demo grew 25% in the quarter, and it continued to age down, while our competitors aged up. 
CNN is also building on its lead in digital. In June, CNN.com streamed 212 million videos, that's a record for the site, and it made it the news leader in digital video for the second straight month, ahead of BuzzFeed and Yahoo! News. 
Turner and Warner Bros. are also making progress on their global kids strategy. Together, they recently announced plans to produce close to 450 half hours of original animated content for Turner's kids networks and to make greater use of Warner's iconic animation library globally. 
In addition to making Boomerang, a global flanker brand for Cartoon Network, this will provide a new platform for Warner's to reinvigorate classic characters and to create new kids franchises. And it's a great example of the natural collaboration taking place across the company. 
We're upgrading not just our content, but also our marketing partners' ability to utilize it effectively. At this year's upfront, we announced the new Turner data cloud, which provides marketers a greatly enhanced ability to target audiences across our linear and digital properties. 
And our innovative advertising products were critical to Turner garnering price increases at the very top of the industry. 
Warner Bros. also had a strong performance in this year's upfront, with 62 programs slated for the upcoming television season. Warner's lineup included 29 shows on broadcast prime time, with at least 2 series on each network. That includes a record 20 returning shows, and it makes Warner's the top supplier of broadcast series again this year. 
We all know Warner's is the gold standard in television and film production, but its growing videogame business is also an industry leader.
 
For the first half of the year, Warner ranked as the top videogame publisher in North America and had the 2 biggest releases in Batman Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X. We're looking to build on that momentum with next month's release of LEGO Dimensions, our entry into the toys-to-life category. 
What you're seeing across Warner, which is also happening throughout our company, is how the best IP can be monetized across many different platforms both inside and beyond traditional ecosystems. 
For example, DC content is the basis for 7 shows scheduled to air in the upcoming season, including returning hits like The Flash and Gotham, and new shows such as Supergirl. 
It's also the basis for our biggest names franchise and new ventures like DC Super Hero Girls, the toys and digital content partnership we recently announced with Mattel. 
Plus, I can't resist pointing out, we still have a nice business selling actual comic books. And of course, there are the films. At last month's Comic-Con, the new trailer for Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, generated the most buzz of any upcoming film both inside the convention halls and on social media. And DC's Suicide Squad was not far behind. Those films don't come out until 2016, but they provide a sense as to why we have so much confidence in our slate for the next year and many years to come. 
So a year after the Time Inc. spin-off, I'm really pleased with how we're executing our strategy to take advantage of the growing opportunities we see both within and beyond the traditional video 
ecosystem. 
At the same time, we recognize the pace of change in our industry is accelerating, and that means we're going to have to move even faster to ensure we have the best content, provide the best possible consumer experience and can monetize our viewership effectively across a wide variety of platforms and geographies, all while maintaining our focus on operational efficiency. 
So in the coming months and years, you'll see us investing aggressively to stay ahead of the changes in our industry and capitalize on an environment where the biggest hits, networks and brands are taking share. 
With our global scale and strong brands, I'm confident we're well positioned for that environment and that we can both meet our strategic objectives and continue to deliver industry-leading financial results. 
With that, let me turn it over to Howard."
24689,305675205,849983,"Time Warner Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2015",2015-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results. Halfway through the year, we're really pleased with our execution to date. In the",2301,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
Starting with consolidated results. Halfway through the year, we're really pleased with our execution to date. In the first half, we grew adjusted operating income 13% and adjusted EPS 25%, and we did that while making progress on our strategic objectives and investing aggressively for future growth. 
In the second quarter, revenue was up a very healthy 8% and adjusted operating income rose 15% to $1.9 billion, a record quarterly profit. And excluding a drag of approximately 400 basis points from FX, revenue growth would have been 12%. 
In addition to strong revenue growth, adjusted operating income margins expanded more than 150 basis points, and that's despite a 6% growth from total expenses, primarily from increased investments in content and marketing. 
Moving forward, we'll remain disciplined on overhead and other nonprogramming-related spending to help fund investments that will strengthen our competitive position and drive future growth. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted EPS grew 28% in the quarter, so once again, we were able to grow adjusted EPS even faster than adjusted operating income. That was helped by our ongoing share repurchase program and a lower effective tax rate in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased over $900 million in shares and paid close to $300 million in dividends. So year-to-date, we've returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders. 
And this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015, adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70. That implies mid-teens growth and adjusted EPS when excluding the programming and restructuring charges and tax matters from the second half of 2014. And that's despite a material drag from a stronger U.S. dollar that we have discussed with you previously. 
So we feel really good about how we're operating and remain focused on executing our strategy to drive continued growth longer-term. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we posted very strong profit growth of 20%. 
Subscription revenues increased 2% or 6%, excluding the impact of FX. Domestic subscription revenue grew 4%, consistent with the first quarter. Absent a drag of approximately 20 percentage points from FX, international subscription revenue was up low double digits. And on that basis, we continue to see the healthiest trends in Latin America. 
Looking to the third quarter, we expect a negative impact of approximately 500 basis points on total subscription revenue growth as a result of FX and the benefit from certain contractual settlements in the third quarter of 2014. However, we expect underlying domestic subscriber trends to be consistent with the first half of the year and remain on track for domestic sub revenue growth to accelerate into the teens in 2016 and 2017. 
Moving on. Advertising declined 1%, but excluding FX, grew a little more than 1%. That was a bit below our initial expectations, largely due to airing fewer NBA playoff games than anticipated. 
In total, the impact from foreign exchange, fewer NBA games and the absence of NASCAR weighed on growth by close to 500 basis points in the quarter. 
Domestic advertising grew slightly in the quarter. International advertising grew low single digits when excluding an FX drag of over 18% and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil. And that was despite difficult comparisons in Latin America due to the impact of the World Cup last year. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, scatter pricing is currently pacing up high single to low double digits, though ratings at our entertainment networks will likely offset that benefit. 
We also expect a drag of over 400 basis points on advertising from the combination of foreign exchange and the absence of NASCAR programming. As a result, we anticipate total advertising revenue to be down modestly. 
Content and other revenues increased close to 50% in the quarter, and that was boosted by our deal with Hulu, which is a great example of how we can benefit from our increased investment in and ownership of original programming. 
Adjusted operating income was up 20%, with margins expanding close to 600 basis points. That was helped by a 6% decline in total expenses, including lower programming costs. 
Programming expenses were down 9% in the quarter. That was largely due to the absence of NASCAR programming as well as lower-acquired programming costs. 
As we discussed with you previously, we are investing in new content that better fits our refresh programming strategy at TNT and TBS. The ramp in that programming will start to show up in the fourth quarter of this year. Taking that into account and the absence of NASCAR programming in the third quarter, we anticipate that programming cost growth will be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. 
SG&A expenses were essentially flat in the quarter, but excluding a reversal of an accrued contingency in the second quarter of last year, SG&A would have been down mid-single digits. And that reflects our continued focus on cost efficiencies and savings from last year's restructuring actions. 
So overall, Turner is executing really well and is making great progress on its strategic initiative. And we remain on track to deliver strong growth and adjusted operating income in 2015, while continuing to make the investments necessary to position us for strong growth over the long term. 
Turning now to HBO, where we are investing significantly to take advantage of the large global opportunity we see for premium services. 
Domestically, subscription revenue growth remained in the mid-single digits despite very attractive sub growth. 
Consistent with recent quarters, subscription revenue growth has been limited by a shift toward nonrevenue-generated subs. Over time, we expect to better monetize those subscribers, which should help drive an acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth. 
Similarly, we anticipate HBO Now will be a more material contributor to subscription revenue growth over time. We're pleased with the initial consumer response to the service, but we saw only a modest benefit to the sub revenue in the second quarter due to the 30-day free-trial period for new subscribers. 
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect to benefit from a full quarter of paying subs on HBO Now. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO Now recently launched on Amazon, Google and Verizon, which should contribute more meaningfully to subscription revenue growth later in the year. 
Moving on, content and other revenues were down 7% in the quarter due in part to difficult comparisons with our home entertainment releases. 
In the quarter, we recognized a comparable amount of revenues from our licensing agreement with Amazon as we did in the year-ago quarter, while agreeing to expand our relationship to include the distribution of HBO Now. 
At our international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, we continue to see good subscriber growth, though revenue declined due to foreign currency movement and the transfer of HBO's basic service in India to Turner. 
Adjusted operating income fell 8% in the quarter as we made significant investments in marketing and technology to support the launch of HBO Now. 
And given our plan to continue investing in customer acquisition, we expect HBO Now to generate losses for the remainder of this year, and that's typical for an early-stage subscriber business. 
Even so, we are on track for another good year of adjusted operating income growth as we anticipate revenue trends to improve in the second half of the year. And our early experience suggests that HBO Now will be a highly profitable revenue stream for us over time. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., which posted a record second quarter, growing revenue 15% and adjusted operating income 46%, and that's despite a significant drag from foreign exchange. These results underscore our growing ability to monetize the best IP across a wide variety of platforms. 
The biggest growth driver was our games business, which posted its best quarter ever, led by the strong performance of franchise releases, Batman Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X. 
Games' revenue more than tripled, passing $0.5 billion in the second quarter alone, and with a great IP at Warner's disposal, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity for this business. 
On the TV side, revenue increased over 20% due to strong growth and licensing fees. That growth included the second cycle syndication of The Big Bang Theory, the SVOD licensing of Seinfeld and an international license of Friends, all of which highlight the increasing value of hit content. 
In our theatrical business, revenues declined in the quarter despite modest growth from our film releases, and that was a result of lower TV licensing of films and the timing of the home entertainment release of the latest installment of The Hobbit franchise. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue was down 18%. That was due to the timing of home entertainment release I just mentioned and softness in catalog. 
Even with that difficult comparison, EST revenue growth remains healthy, increasing close to 20%. And EST growth for the industry was close to 30%, helping offset a decline in physical sales that took consumer spending across the broader home entertainment industry down mid-single digits in the quarter. 
So overall, Warner Bros. had a terrific quarter and is on pace for very attractive growth and a record year of adjusted operating income in 2015. And with a great theatrical slate and momentum at our TV and games businesses, we're confident we can continue to drive solid growth in the coming years. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled $1.8 billion in the first half. That's down from a year ago due to a significant swing in working capital, but it's still very healthy conversion. Growth in working capital reflects higher receivables from increased gains and content revenues, the timing of collections, severance payments related to last year's restructuring initiatives and increased content investments across our divisions. 
Cash interest increased modestly as a result of the additional debt we issued last year, and our cash taxes declined, primarily due to favorable tax legislation that was passed late in 2014. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash for the full year than it was in 2014. And that is mainly due to strong syndication revenues at Warner's and severance payments related to the restructuring actions taken in 2014. Despite that, we anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $20.7 billion of net debt, up nearly $800 million from the end of 2015. That's largely due to our ongoing commitment to direct shareholder returns. 
In the first half of the year, we returned a total of $2.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2.9 billion of long-term debt at attractive rates. That included our first euro-denominated debt offering, which will act as a natural hedge to the euro-denominated assets on our balance sheet. 
We also retired $1.7 billion of debt as a result of a maturity of a tender offer we made for higher price debt. And we're in the process of redeeming the remaining $300 million of that series of debt. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3x. However, excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from the second half of 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.64x, slightly below our target leverage of 2.75x. 
We continue to believe that leverage target provides us the flexibility to invest in our businesses, engage in strategic M&A and provide direct returns to shareholders, while at the same time, optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. 
We had a great first half of the year, and we're very pleased with the progress we're making across our businesses. That progress is evident in our results to date and our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70, which we reaffirm this morning. 
As we've discussed with you previously, that includes a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $0.40 based on current rates. 
Excluding that FX headwind, our outlook would imply over 20% growth off last year's base of $4.15. That outlook also includes ongoing investments at our network businesses in areas such as programming, marketing and technology to strengthen our position within the rapidly changing ecosystem. And those investments will be heavily weighted toward the back half of this year. 
At Turner, we'll begin ramping up our content investments, resulting in significantly higher programming costs and associated marketing expenses starting in the fourth quarter. 
Meanwhile, at HBO, we intend to continue investing in customer acquisition and technology for HBO Now as we expand distribution and position the product for long-term success. 
At Warner's, we are challenging theatrical comparisons in the second half of the year. Still, we anticipate healthy growth in the third quarter due to the syndication of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest as well as the continued benefit from our strong game slate. 
Taking the timing of our investment spending into account, we expect our growth in adjusted EPS will slow materially in the back half of the year. Even so, we are on track for another year of very attractive growth in adjusted EPS, and we believe the investments we're making in high-quality content and the development of new business models will position us for accelerating growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

I think if you go back to when we started to talk about domestic subscription revenue growth expectations, we've been remarkably on track.

And then in '16 and then again in '17, we fully expect that to accelerate well into the teens. And against that backdrop, we have seen some modest unit declines in the U.S. But I would say that, that trend has been in existence and ongoing now for some time. We have not seen any acceleration in those declines, and those declines have not been overly material. And of course, that trend has really been in front of our inclusion in some of these more economically viable or skinny packages, which we think, over time, as they become a little bit more mature, might have the ability to stabilize the overall unit trends and possibly even return it to growth over time as we think the distributors' ability to offer more economically the very attractive bundles to that element of the demand is only a positive thing. And of course, we, at Turner, have the type of networks that we think will be overly represented in those type of bundles. So we think the trends have been in existence for some time. There's been no acceleration of any negative trends. And we're still really positive and optimistic about what the future holds."

We've been expecting for some time that on average in any given year, we expect to hold down programming cost growth to, on average, no more than high single digits. And so clearly, in some years, it will be higher. In some years, it will be lower. This year, in 2015, will be a year, as Howard just said, with the expectation of growth only in the low single digits, that it will be lower than the average. In part, that's due to the loss of NASCAR and before some of the new sports deals kick in, in future years. So for example, programming cost in Q3 will probably be down again because of the absence of NASCAR. In the fourth quarter, I think we're currently planning on doubling the number of original series episodes compared to a year ago, and they'll be a lot more heavily weighted to the scripted side versus nonscripted where it was a year ago too. So the average cost per episode will be higher. But we're really excited about the programming cycle that we're going to be beginning to enter, which would -- which should be over a prolonged period.

I'll speak for Turner. Maybe Kevin can comment from the Warner side. We at Turner have now for some time been very, very much in favor of granting in-season stacking rights to distributors and affiliates for a number of reasons. The first is we want to make sure that with respect to the original programming that we have on the network, that we're encouraging people who want to view these shows on a delayed basis, that they can come in, in the middle of the season and catch up. And we think it increases the probability of having successful shows and will drive overall viewership, not only for the shows that are stacked, but also the shows later on in the season that are being viewed live. So we think that, that can help the advertising business for the live linear feed. And we also think Comcast, for example, probably the furthest along in the development of dynamic ad insertion, we think dynamic ad insertion is a potential huge opportunity for us as network owners and for the industry at large as we think that delayed viewing as a currency will grow increasingly important over time.

And I have to say, this is an area -- we're talking a lot about the impact that technology is having on consumption. But I think technology is moving so quickly and it's going to have a dramatically positive impact on the efficacy of advertising on TV. So you're right in the sense that we are making investments to strengthen our overall technology platform, and you saw us introduce a number of advanced advertising products at this year's upfront a few months ago, whether it's targeting Now, which allows an advertiser to optimize across TNT and TBS, or a product called Audience Now, which allows them to optimize across all Turner networks with audience guarantees. So we're highly confident we're going to be able to more efficiently manage and monetize all of our inventory across all of Turner. And it's one of the reasons why we wanted to present all of Turner under -- in 1 meeting at the upfront because of the strength and the breadth of our brands. We have a lot to learn as we move forward. We're working with some of our biggest partners, and we're roughly using 20% of our inventory for targeting. But that's going to dramatically ramp in the future. We're investing in technology, we're investing in data, we've come a long way over the last year. And I think a lot of the capabilities that so-called digital companies have had an advantage of over TV are going to be eliminated as TV cannot only provide targeting an increased reach in relevance, but also in a very, very immersive experience with long-form video that's professionally produced.

We're very proud of the fact that we have at least 2 shows on every single network. And as I said, we have more shows coming back than ever."

When you scenario-plan out HBO over the long term, do you ever think about what a significant increase in content investment would do globally to the business? In other words, I think you spend about $2 billion a year. Is there a business model where that number doubles and you go big, global, more direct-to-consumer? Is there enough content out there to make it worth that kind of investment? I realize you have guidance that you got to work through all those pieces. But I'm just wondering, given how rapidly the world is changing, do you ever think about what HBO could do if there's an opportunity to just get much more aggressive on the content side to build a long-term value of the business?

So I like our spend. We're constantly looking at what opportunities there are. As I've said over and over again, and I think it's true, it's not that more is better, only better is better.

Welcome to Time Warner's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. 
This morning, we issued 2 press releases, 1 detailing our results for the third quarter and the other, reaffirming our 2015 full year business outlook. 
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website. 
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?"
24689,313907801,891717,"Time Warner Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thanks to everyone for listening in this morning. As you can see from our results, we had another very good quarter. Revenues increased 5%, $6.6 billion. We posted strong growth in adjusted operating income, which totaled $1.8 billion.",1956,"Thanks, Mike, and thanks to everyone for listening in this morning. 
As you can see from our results, we had another very good quarter. Revenues increased 5%, $6.6 billion. We posted strong growth in adjusted operating income, which totaled $1.8 billion. That translated into adjusted EPS of $1.25 per share, that's a record third quarter for the company, and we returned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
This continues our track record of delivering industry-leading performance, while also participating the company for a world where viewers consume an increasing amount of content on demand and on multiple platforms and devices. And that's where the brand needs to drive both inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem. 
We've been doing that by leveraging our strong brands, global scale and distinctive IP to produce content that resonates deeply with consumers and will become even more valuable in this environment. 
We've also been a leader in enhancing the value of the traditional TV bundle for consumers, making more content available on demand and on a growing array of devices. 
More recently, we've been strategically expanding outside the traditional TV ecosystem to tap into new growth opportunities, and we're executing these strategies across the globe, while at the same time remaining laser focus on operational and capital efficiency. 
The result has been a total shareholder return of 180% since the beginning of 2008, well above our peer average and more than double the S&P 500. 
To continue performing at those levels in the future, however, it's critical that we pushed on the accelerator because every day becomes clear that the trends we anticipated are happening and in some ways, they're happening even faster than we expected. 
These changes create challenges for our business, but they also produce many opportunities for us. And our goal is to use our unmatched combination of scale, brands and distinctive IP to capitalize on these trends so that our business is even more relevant, more competitive and profitable 5 to 10 years from now than they are today. That means moving even more aggressively to execute on our strategy by making investments for the long run. 
This is a formative time in media, a time when industry leaders for the next decade and beyond are being established. And I believe those companies with the resources and will to invest will thrive and most that don't, will falter. So it's important our primary focus beyond long-term competitive position and growth rather than near-term profitability. 
So with that as a background, I'd like to provide an update on our 2016 financial targets. We have not yet finished our project and long-range planning process, but we're far enough along that we can identify and size changes to our expectations that together suggests adjusted EPS is more likely to be around $5.25 next year. I'll give you some context on those changes and Howard will provide more detail in his remarks. 
But at current rates, we estimate the impact of foreign exchange on next year will be similar to this year, that's around $0.50 per share. Accounting for the significant majority of the change in our expectations. 
Beyond FX movements, there are areas where we've outperformed our expectation and other areas that have been more challenged. 
More importantly, we have also identified additional investments and other key decisions that will weigh on earnings in the near term but that we think will drive long-term growth. 
Program remains by far the most significant areas of investment for the company. As you all know, we have plans to invest aggressively in content in 2016 and beyond. 
But an increasing part of that investment will be directed towards brands and IP that we think will resonate with consumers on new platforms. 
HBO's investments in John Stuart, Bill Simon, Sesame Street, and its expanded vice relationship are all great examples. 
Turner's partnership with WR Media IMG to form e-sports league that will air on TGS is another example and there are many more to come. 
But having great content is no longer enough. Content has become just one element of the broader consumer experience. And while we are living in the gold age of television programming, for many consumers, the television viewing experience is stuck in the Bronze Age. So we're stepping up our investment and driving the best possible consumer experiences. 
For instance, we plan to increase our investments in new digital products and infrastructure so that we can meet consumer demand for video outside traditional TV and compete effectively across platforms. That includes new broadband delivered initiatives targeted millennials  such as HBO NOW, CNN start-up great big story and TBS' new digital studio, Super Deluxe. 
It also includes investments like Turner's majority stake in Ice Storm Planet, a leading platform for live streaming. 
And we'll continue to build out data and analytics capabilities, both as the engine of our industry-leading advanced advertising products and to inform our marketing, our digital products and even some of our content development itself. 
We've also advanced delivering even more value to consumers especially those who subscribe to the traditional bundle. 
As you know, our company has led the industry in making our content available to consumers on an on-demand basis. 
Given ongoing shifts and consumer behavior, we think it's important to provide even more on-demand content as part of our network offering. 
As a result, we're evaluating whether to retain our rights for a longer period of time and forgo or delay certain content licensing. This would effectively push the SVOD window for content on our networks to a multi-year period more consistent with traditional syndication. 
In our efforts to improve the consumer experience on our networks, we're also looking for opportunities to reduce our ad loads. Just last week, we announced that True TV will cut its ad loads in half for prime time original shows starting late next year. 
Over time, we think a better viewing experience will help drive higher viewership and enhance the value proposition of our network. 
As I've said before, I think now is the time for us to press our advantages, and I'm confident these investments in content, capabilities and the consumer experience will position us for continued strong growth in the years to come. And I'm confident because we are operating from a position of strength, which is evident, once again, in this quarter's results. 
So let's move to this quarter. Turning first to Warner Bros. which increased its revenues by 15%, led by continued strength in television and video games. 
Already the top supplier of broadcast television programming, Warner's has the 2 biggest new shows on broadcast this fall with Blindspot and Supergirl. 
Supergirl launched last week and represents 1 of 8 Warner shows on television this season based on our DC Entertainment, joining already established hits such as The Flash, Arrow and Gotham. 
DC's IP was also a significant contributor to our video games business, which through the end of the third quarter is the #1 U.S. publisher this year. 
And at the end of the third quarter, we launched LEGO Dimensions, which counts Lego, Batman and many of its DC counterparts along its cast of characters. 
We think it's going to be a big hit this holiday season and the next big game franchise for Warner. 
On the movie side, the countdown has started for March's Blockbuster Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice, which will be followed by the buzz generated screen version of DC's Suicide Squad. 
DC is a key part of Warner's growth strategy and in recent years has had tremendous success in both television and games. 
The next stage of growth for DC will be at film, which is also a critical driver in our plans to further expand our consumer products business. 
At Turner, TBS discovers Major League Baseball playoff was the most-watched postseason ever for the network, growing close to 50% over last year's coverage. 
And the NBA on TNT, one of our other key sports properties, set up to a great start last week with viewership of its opening night doubleheader growing almost 25% over a year ago. 
The continued strength of our sports lineup is helped TBS and TNT, the #1 and #4 cable networks in prime time year-to-date, respectively. And that's a great position to have ahead of the rebrands we'd be rolling out for each of those next works next year. 
We're optimistic these rebrands will have a similar impact over time as the changes we made at CNN and Cartoon Network. 
In the third quarter, CNN continued to grow prime time ratings across all key demographics, up 39% and 35% for adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54, respectively. 
CNN's lead has never been more apparent during its recent record-setting coverage of the Republican and Democratic presidential debates and CNN continued to build its deal to presence with the recently launched great big story, that's a distinctive independent mobile focused news brand aimed at millennial audiences, it's one of the many examples of how we're innovating outside of traditional TV ecosystem. 
Cartoon also continue to gain share, ending the third quarter as the #1 ad-supported cable network with kids 6 to 11 for the second consecutive quarter. 
Even more impressive, it was the #1 network in VOD across broadcast and cable in July and August. 
Adult Swim also shined brightly, finishing as ad-supported cable's #1 total network among adults 18 to 34 for the 30th consecutive quarter, that's an impressive front. 
Turning to HBO. There was another strong quarter for the global leader in print and subscription video. In September, HBO received a record 43 Primetime Emmy Awards, that's the most of any network for the 14th consecutive year. That included Best Drama for Game of Thrones and Best Comedy for Veep. 
In total, Game of Thrones was the recipient of 12 awards, and that's a record for a series in 1 year. 
So with HBO NOW, HBO is at the forefront of marrying the very best content with the next-generation consumer experience. While it's very early, and we have a lot of work ahead of us, the early results for HBO NOW points to a significant long-term opportunity.  To take full advantage of that opportunity, we'll continue to expand our line up of both distribution partners and supported devices for the HBO service. 
On that front, HBO NOW recently added Roku to its lineup of distributors, and we added support for Google's Chromecast and Amazon's FireTV. 
HBO is also expanding its content lineup to leverage its growing multiplatform presence. 
And yesterday, we announced that John Stewart will be joining the HBO family with a particular focus on providing content for our broadband platforms. 
Over time, we expect to expand the distribution of standalone HBO streaming services to many more territories around the world. 
For example, HBO Latin America recently announced plans to offer a standalone streaming version of HBO to Latin America and Caribbean broadcast consumers. The service will launch in Columbia before the end of the year and subsequently expand to other territories in the region. 
So we're just getting started. And I think you can see that we continue to execute at a very high level of across the company. We're moving quickly and decisively to take advantage of changes in technology and consumer behavior. And I'm confident the investments we're making in content, capabilities and in the consumer experience will further strengthen our competitive position, solidify our long-term growth prospects and enable us to continue providing industry-leading returns to our shareholders for many years to come. 
So let me turn it over to Howard second take you through the financials in greater detail. Howard?"
24689,313907801,891717,"Time Warner Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'd like to start by providing some additional context to the comments Jeff made on our 2016 targets. As Jeff noted and I want to emphasize, we're still working through our budget process and we plan to provide our 2016 o",2567,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'd like to start by providing some additional context to the comments Jeff made on our 2016 targets. 
As Jeff noted and I want to emphasize, we're still working through our budget process and we plan to provide our 2016 outlook when we report 4Q earnings. But as we stand today, we have visibility on and want to a number of items affecting 2016, including investment decisions we're in the process of making. By 
far, the most significant factor is FX, which at current rates, we expect to have a similar impact at this year or a drag of approximately $0.50 on adjusted EPS compared to our expectations when we put a plan in place last year. 
Beyond that, there are some parts of the business where we're tracking below. In other areas, we're outperforming our expectations compared to the plan represented at our Investor Day. 
In terms of operational headwinds, similar to the rest of the industry, ratings at our key domestic entertainment networks have declined to a greater degree than we anticipated a year ago, and that will negatively effect ad revenue next year. 
In addition, since the end of 2014, subscribers at Turner's domestic networks have declined approximately 1% beyond what our outlook had assumed, and we're assuming declines continue at a similar rate in 2016. 
On the positive side, our cost-savings efforts are running ahead of planned, and we remain focused on executing our efficiency initiatives and constraining overhead expenses. 
At CNN and Cartoon Network, ratings continue to be very strong, and that's driving upside to our advertising expectations for those businesses. 
At Warner Bros. our video games business is having a record year in 2015, and we see opportunities to continue to grow this business. So despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, we expect to outperform our initial video games expectations for next year. 
And finally, excluding FX, growth across our international businesses remain strong. 
Overall, the impact from operational headwinds not including FX and the benefit from improved performance in the areas I just walked through are roughly similar in size, each running several hundred million dollars. 
Beyond those changes, we have also identified some additional investments we believe are critical to our long-term success. We recognize the video ecosystem as rapidly evolving and strongly believe this is the time to press our advantage. 
So as Jeff noted, we've decided to invest even more aggressively in our businesses for the focus on content, capabilities and enhancing the consumer experience. And while we are still evaluating the size, those investments could also run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Taking into account those additional investments, we think 2016 adjusted EPS is more likely to be around $5.25. But as I mentioned, we're still working through our budget process so other factors could influence our outlook to even the upside or downside. 
Looking beyond 2016, we're in very early stages of updating our long-range plan. But I would point out that FX drag I noted earlier will carry through into the future years and that means we don't expect to be over $8 in adjusted EPS in 2018 at this point. 
Even so, we're excited about the progress we're making on some of the upside opportunities we discussed with you previously. And we think the investments we're making to enhance the consumer experience will be a critical point of differentiation for the company. So we're very confident we can grow these businesses at industry-leading levels in the years to come. 
Now let me turn to the third quarter results. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
As you recall, last year's third quarter results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company and programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items, my comments today relates to expenses, margin and adjusted operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date periods will exclude these charges from all periods. 
Starting with consolidated results. We had another strong quarter, and we're really pleased with our performance year-to-date. 
Through the first 3 quarters of the year, revenues increased 6% and adjusted operating income grew 13%, and we've achieved that will continue to execute on our strategic objectives and laying the groundwork for future growth. 
In the third quarter, revenues grew 5% or 10%, excluding the drag of almost 500 basis points from FX. Adjusted operating income increased 13% with margins expanding about 200 basis points.  That reflects our continued cost disciplined as we held total expense growth to 2% in the quarter. That included a 6% reduction in SG&A due to savings from the restructuring action taken last year and our ongoing cost controls as well as a decline in equity compensation that's helping from the movement in our stock price. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted EPS was $1.25 compared for $1.22 in the prior quarter and increased almost 30% when excluding last year's charges and benefit from a tax settlement. 
During the quarter, we repurchased over $1.2 billion in shares and paid $285 million in dividend. And year-to-date, we've returned almost $4.2 billion to shareholders. 
This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, and that's despite a foreign currency drag of approximately $0.45 to $0.50, which is above our previous estimate due primarily to the recent weakening of certain currencies in Latin America. 
So we feel really good about how we're operating, and we remain on track for another year of very attractive adjusted EPS growth. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we are encouraged by the improvement in advertising trends, and we put in another quarter of profit growth despite significant FX headwinds. 
Year-to-date, Turner has grown adjusted operating income a very strong 16%. Subscription revenues declined 1% in the quarter, but increased around 4% when looking through the impact of foreign exchange and last year's benefit from certain domestic contractual settlements. 
Domestic Subscription revenues grew low some single digits. Subscriber losses were modest headwind to growth in the quarter and we're consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year, declining around 1.5% on average. 
Absent the track of more than 20 percentage points from FX, international subscription revenue was up low double digits with the biggest gains, again, coming from Latin America. 
Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect a net negative impact of approximately 300 basis points on total subscription revenue growth from the combination of continued FX headwinds and the benefit from the comparison to last year's carriage dispute with DISH and with higher pricing set at 9 of our top 10 distributors, we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teen in 2016 and to grow at a similar rate in 2017. 
Moving on. Advertising declined 1%, but was up 3% when excluding FX and the impact from the absence of NASCAR programming. Domestic advertising was flat in the quarter. Market international advertising group to double-digit absent an FX drag of almost 20 percentage points and a benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a net drag of close to 250 basis points as a result of the impact of FX headwinds, partially offset by the targeted comparison to last year's carriage dispute with DISH and a benefit from airing 3 additional Major League Baseball play off games this year. 
At the same time, scatter pricing has been very healthy, pacing up strong double digits versus the upfront. And putting those factors together, we anticipate total advertising revenue to be up low single digits in the quarter. 
Looking at our costs. We've reduced expenses by 7% and margins expanded over 250 basis points, helped by lower programming costs and SG&A. 
Programming expenses were down 9%, primarily due to the absence of NASCAR. SG&A declined 6% reflecting our continued focus on cost efficiencies as well as savings from last year's restructuring actions. 
In the fourth quarter, excluding the charges from last year, we anticipate programming cost growth to be up about 20% due to Major League Baseball and the timing of original programming on TNT. 
A significant portion of the increase from higher MLB stems from the additional games and the significant growth in ratings in advertising during the playoffs, which pulls additional rates amortization into the quarter. 
We also expect higher marketing expenses associated with our originals. As a result, adjusted operating income, excluding charges should be down significantly in the fourth quarter. 
As we approach the rebrand of TBS and TNT, we're also evaluating the fit of certain programming we currently air. To the extent we decide not to use the programming in the future, that could result in charges during the fourth quarter of nothing close to the magnitude we saw in 2014. Even so, Turner remains on track for another year of solid growth and adjusted operating income. 
At the same time, we're continuing to make investments necessary to position us for long-term success. 
Turning out HBO where we continue to see very strong demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits and consistent with our last several quarters, a shift toward none revenue generated subs was the constraint on revenue growth. 
As we expected, HBO NOW's contribution to some revenue increased from last quarter. However, it's still a very much in its infancy as both the product and the business. 
Over time, we expect NOW to be a more significant contributor as we launch on additional platforms and continue to invest on the product. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues grew 13%. That was mainly from the domestic licensing of a large go series. Adjusted operating income was up 21%. That was helped by 3% decline in total expenses despite investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. 
Programming costs fell 6% due to lower theatrical expenses. 
So HBO is on track for another year of good growth and adjusted operating income and given the strong global demand for our content and the investments we're making in programming and with HBO NOW, we feel HBO is well positioned to deliver attractive financial results over the long term. 
Moving on to Warner Bros. where we continue to benefit from the diversity of Warner's businesses. In the quarter, revenue increased 15% and adjusted operating income was up a strong 36%, and that's despite a material drag from FX. 
Television revenues increased over 20% due to strong growth in licensing fees, that was mainly due to the domestic licensing of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest. 
Meanwhile, Warner's continued its year in video games with revenues more than tripling for the second consecutive quarter. That was led by the releases of LEGO Dimensions and Mad Max as well as continued strong sales from our franchise titles, Mortal Kombat X and Batman: Arkham Knight. These are a few examples of how we can leverage the great IT and franchise at Warner's at games and why we see a very attractive long-term opportunity for this business. 
Across theatrical and TV, home video revenues were down 7% in the quarter, in line with industry trends. 
At the same time, digital trends remained healthy with DST up double digits to Warner's MV industry. 
Overall, Warner Bros. had a great quarter and remains on pace for a record year of adjusted operating income in 2015 and with a healthy trends in our TV business, our growing video games presence and an ambitious theatrical slate that kicks off next year, we're confident Warner's can continue to growth at attractive levels in the years to come. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled $2.9 billion in the first 9 months of the year, that's up from a year ago due to growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes, partially offset by a significant swing of working capital. 
The growth in working capital reflects higher receivables from increased TV licensing revenues, severance payments related to last year's restructuring initiatives and increased content investments across our divisions. 
Our cash taxes declined, primarily due to the timing of favorable tax legislation and related payments. 
And given healthy conversion so far this year, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow generation. 
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $21.2 billion of net debt, up almost $1.4 billion from the end of 2014. That's mostly due to the approximately $3.9 billion we returned to shareholders in the first 9 months through share repurchases and dividends. 
Since our last earnings call, we redeemed over $300 million in debt that remained outstanding on our 2016 notes after our tender offer earlier this year. 
And on the M&A front, we've invested $344 million so far this year. That includes Turner's investment in Ice Steam Planet in the third quarter, and that's a great example of the kind of tuck-in acquisitions we have prioritized in recent years and that remains our focus. 
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.7x. However, excluding programming restructuring and severance charges from the fourth quarter of 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.64x, slightly below our target leverage of 2.75x. 
As we look forward, we do not anticipate a change in either our target leverage or our capital allocation philosophy, which will remain focused on investments back into our businesses, targeted M&A and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. We're really pleased with how we're executing across our business and with our strong financial results through the first 9 months of the year. 
Given our strong year-to-date results, I want to provide some additional context on our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS, which we continue to expect to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70. 
As I've mentioned earlier, that includes an FX headwind of approximately $0.45 to $0.50 based on current rates. 
Looking through that FX headwind, our outlook implies over 20% growth of last year's base of $4.15. 
Midpoint of our outlook suggests adjusted EPS will be down slightly in the fourth quarter when compared to the $0.98 we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. That's mainly due to investments across our networks businesses that we previously discussed with you, including further technology and marketing investments related HBO NOW and significantly higher programming and marketing costs at Turner. 
Meanwhile, at Warner Bros., we have difficult theatrical release comparisons, an unfavorable mix of costs related to investments in content in videogames in TV, and we continue to face material FX headwind. 
But overall, we're very pleased with our performance this year and on track for our seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth and adjusted EPS. And we believe the investments we're making will both strengthen our position inside a traditional TV ecosystem and allow us to take advantage of the growing opportunities outside of it. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

It's Jeff, I'll start. First, I think all of us know that shows the premier on either broadcast or cable channels, the biggest monetization support, by far, is the carriage fee, plus the advertising that supports either a big bundle or a streamlined bundle. And if you then go to the aftermarkets, syndication, SVOD, et cetera, if we're talking about SVOD, which we also drive some much smaller subscription revenue, and it has limited or no ad revenue, it's pretty clear that, that offers less monetization support in general for the quality and diversity of programming that we've all gotten used to seeing on the dock. So we think a lot about how to enhance the value of the traditional pay-TV bundle. And it's something we're obviously looking at that our network. Historically, the syndication window was 4 years after the original air date. And that -- whether it went to syndication over the year, whether it went to cable basic, that was supported by subscription revenue, it was supported by advertising. More recently, we've seen most serialized content move towards 1 year windows. But just take our HBO deal and Richard is going to speak to it, given your question, the Amazon deal has a 3-year window. So we'll continue to evaluate and see what window works best for different type of content, the pay-TV, originals, the broadcast premieres, the cable premieres, and we'll look very carefully at the health of our network and all Warner's network partners to make sure that we optimize the value of content to provide support for the diversity of what you're seeing today. And we all need to consider that the shift in viewing to digital platform suggest that consumers often don't mind waiting a year for certain content if that's the way that it's offered. So you look at the basic cable network, and they may compete with services like HBO, Netflix, et cetera, all of which, the HBO is the Netflix, they have long-term exclusivity for their shows. So we're still evaluating what it would look like, but it could be adjusting the window somewhat, as I said, in my prepared remarks today. Also, let's go to international. The big source of support for programming. It's a very interesting example of how it could work. And if you, for example, Netflix is doing smart things, entering a number of territories, it's aggressively building for syndicated content and what you see is that in most territories, we see incumbent distributors bid for second window rights, not just first window right. They, of course, supported by subscription fees, advertising, et cetera. So this increased competition is driving demand for great TV content, it's benefiting Warner Bros. It's rapidly evolving ecosystem, not just here but overseas, and we expect change in innovation to continue. So that's why we're thinking about this. I don't want to emphasize that what you're hearing today from us is -- hopefully, you'll hear a very confident position, and we're quite resolved to kneel and benefit in the long-term because we think the focus of our basic and pay-TV networks is an advantage. We think we're going to be in -- whichever bundles are out there, streamlined or launched, and we think this moves a very important to secure the long-term growth, and we think it's all going to work."

Two pretty broad questions. Let me see if I can get through them quickly. On the subscription revenue side, we are quite pleased with the position that we're in right now and quite confident in our ability to continue to drive very, very strong subscription revenue growth. I think you're probably referring to the domestic side. We've now completed 9 of 10 deals where we have absolutely 100% cheaper rate increases that we were seeking. We're confident that we will complete the remaining deal in reasonably short order. All of our contracts have certain penetration protections that give us additional confidence. But I do want to just comment for one second with respect to the declines in the subscribers in the United States. In the prior quarters and another forms, we've said that we've been planning for declines to continue. We don't anticipate that they're going to be material. We continue to still believe that what we're doing now is we're starting to just -- as we are planning for next year, we are going to assume that the rate of decline is similar to this year, although in an encouraging way, the traditional distributors who have reported third quarter earnings, most if not all of them have reported improvements year-over-year and some distributors, the best third quarters that they had in years. In addition, we are in talks with numerous interested parties to potentially large OTT services. And as Jeff said, we will fully anticipate, and those vandals with a portfolio of networks that we have. So I think as you look out on the horizon, there is reason to be really confident and optimistic that we could even stem losses altogether and maybe even get back to a position of growth in the United States. On the ad load side, we announced recently, which is a first for us that we were going to take truTV and provide an enhanced viewing experience beginning next year that will essentially provide for 21% for programming. And in some respects, we're starting a truTV, we're going to learn a lot. I think, as Jeff said, the consumer experience is increasingly important, we're transforming Turner to focus solely first and foremost, on the consumer, where the consumer  is going and what they've experienced going to be. When we think about the ad part of that we have in our networks, I'm comfortable with where we are for the most part. But I think tru is going to be a very, very interesting experiment to see whether it actually will make a difference with respect to the learnings experience, and we don't anticipate it will have really any revenue impact with respect to that network. So we're going to continue to pay very close attention to this entire deeply about the experience that we provided our consumers with our brands, and we'll be providing more updates as we get into next year."

In fact, I think, because we've now gotten our businesses with those 3 into the ones that we think work best together, both in strategic planning, in global distribution, and global sourcing of leading project, meaning attracting creators, whether film, TV shows, et cetera, these are huge advantages for Time Warner. And what we're all talking about, including all of your questions, are how to take the obviously successful history of bundles, which have hard penetration, not just in the United States but everywhere and have a significant amount of ad support and how to evolve all of them into more VOD, better guide interface and the programming, some of which goes for premium, not ad supported, some of which belongs in an ad-supported environment within an evolve ad environment. All of this holds true. And I think what you're seeing now in the evolution of streamlined bundles and new distributors is more opportunity on a global basis to make all this program production and network landing more engaged and more relevant.

And I'm just wondering, one, what's stopping you from literally launching your own kind of everything Time Warner, forget even just about Turner but everything Time Warner direct-to-consumer at x price, and keeping all SVOD rights. And then if that's not attractive or if that's not something you're going to do, as you think about -- you chose earlier this year to sell content to Hulu, why is Hulu better?  Because I was surprised that you all allowed, in your contracts, Hulu to be ad-free given that I thought Hulu the benefit was it protected the ad model.

If you take the point  -- let's start with premium branded services like an HBO, Showtime, Netflix. So for a long time, HBO, I think more than 15 years has had a VOD service and therefore all of the programming the original programming, et cetera, that's on HBO is all there, and it's quite successful just as it is at Netflix or Showtime. Now it's true, to stay with HBO your question that when we sold or licensed some syndicated window product 3 years of Amazon, all of which is still on HBO, what we're giving is consumers more choice and doing a sampling, which for HBO with Amazon and Amazon Fire subscribers that allows HBO to get a trial so they can see the program and sign onto the current service. Those kinds of things make sense for premium network and then to go to your question on basic networks like Turner or podcast network. Those are typically premieres often once a week shows across the dial, whether it's broadcast cable and most consumers are used to getting those in a bundle whether the bundle have to be 100 networks, whether it's 30, 50 or 10 the consumer chooses, which, I think, over time they'll have more choice to be able to do. If we took the course you're suggesting and it's worth thinking about it, of course, take say that Turner networks and put them on their own, but you do have some questions of distribution of coverage, of ad support, which it may not be the best way to premiere a range of basic cable SVOD. And remember, most of the distributors out there don't have the really strong ability to support an offering like that. That could emerge, but it's not here now."

No matter who we license to, it's important that we focus on maximizing the value of our content across all distribution platforms and key point across all windows in time. That includes continuing to evaluate what window works best for different types of content, half our comedies are different, serialized dramas, and when consuming the best partners, there are many different considerations beyond just the price. For example, I think, as you referenced, Hulu established advertising volume by charging additionally or two-level depending whether consumer has ads or not. The question of whether it's a sufficient charge for the ad remains to be seen. But we think competition on as ad providers not the ones that Amazon and Netflix, Hulu, but as you go around the world, you have a combination of pure SVOD guys, you have SVOD services from incumbent broadcasters. It's becoming a fairly rich competition. It's good for consumers, it's good for content value, and we think we'll arrive at the right mix. I think if your underlying point is it doesn't make a lot of sense to sell programming to our given distribution model, let's call it bundle with a fair amount subscription support and advertising support and when you sell it to a method of distribution that has less realistic ad and subscription support, that was clearly not a sustainable thing for either content production or networks over the long term."

Welcome to Time Warner's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other, reaffirming our 2015 full year business outlook.
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?"
24689,313907801,892244,"Time Warner Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thanks everyone for listening in this morning.As you can see from our results, we had another very good quarter. Revenues increased 5% to $6.6 billion. We posted strong growth in adjusted operating income, which totaled $1.8 billion. T",1957,"Thanks, Mike, and thanks everyone for listening in this morning.
As you can see from our results, we had another very good quarter. Revenues increased 5% to $6.6 billion. We posted strong growth in adjusted operating income, which totaled $1.8 billion. That translated into adjusted EPS of $1.25 per share. That's a record third quarter for the company. And we returned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
This continues our track record of delivering industry-leading performance, while also positioning the company for a world where viewers consume an increasing amount of content on demand and on multiple platforms and devices. And that's a world in which brands need to thrive both inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem.
We've been doing that by leveraging our strong brands, global scale and distinctive IP to produce content that resonates deeply with consumers and will become even more valuable in this environment.
We've also been a leader in enhancing the value of the traditional TV bundle for consumers, making more content available on demand and on a growing array of devices.
More recently, we've been strategically expanding outside the traditional TV ecosystem to tap into new growth opportunities, and we're executing these strategies across the globe, while at the same time remaining laser-focused on operational and capital efficiency.
The result has been a total shareholder return of 180% since the beginning of 2008, well above our peer average and more than double the S&P 500.
To continue performing at those levels in the future, however, it's critical that we push on the accelerator because every day it becomes clear that the trends we anticipated are happening and in some ways, they're happening even faster than we expected.
These changes create challenges for our business, but they also produce many opportunities for us. And our goal is to use our unmatched combination of scale, brands and distinctive IP to capitalize on these trends so that our businesses are even more relevant, more competitive and profitable 5 to 10 years from now than they are today. That means moving even more aggressively to execute our strategy by making investments for the long run.
This is a formative time in media, a time when industry leaders for the next decade and beyond are being established. And I believe those companies with the resources and will to invest will thrive and most that don't, will falter. So it's important our primary focus beyond long-term competitive position and growth rather than near-term profitability.
So with that as a background, I'd like to provide an update on our 2016 financial targets. We have not yet finished our budget and long-range planning process, but we're far enough along that we can identify and size some changes to our expectations that together suggest adjusted EPS is more likely to be around $5.25 next year. I'll give you some context on those changes and Howard will provide more detail in his remarks.
But at current rates, we estimate the impact of foreign exchange on next year would be similar to this year. That's around $0.50 per share, accounting for the significant majority of the change in our expectations.
Beyond FX movements, there are areas where we've outperformed our expectation and other areas that have been more challenging.
More important, we have also identified additional investments and other key decisions that will weigh on earnings in the near term, but that we think will drive long-term growth.
Programming remains by far the most significant area of investment for the company. As you all know, we have plans to invest aggressively in content in 2016 and beyond. But an increasing part of that investment will be directed towards brands and IP that we think will resonate with consumers on new platforms.
HBO's investments in Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, Sesame Street, and its expanded VICE relationship are all great examples.
Turner's partnership with WME | IMG to form an eSports league that will air on TBS is another example, and there are many more to come.
But having great content is no longer enough. Content has become just one element of the broader consumer experience. And while we are living in the Golden Age of television programming, for many consumers, the television viewing experience is stuck in the Bronze Age. So we're stepping up our investment in driving the best possible consumer experiences.
For instance, we plan to increase our investments in new digital products and infrastructure so that we can meet consumer demand for video outside traditional TV and compete effectively across platforms. That includes new broadband-delivered initiatives targeted at millennials such as HBO NOW, CNN startup Great Big Story and TBS' new digital studio, Super Deluxe. It also includes investments like Turner's majority stake in iStreamPlanet, a leading platform for live streaming.
And we'll continue to build out data and analytics capabilities, both as the engine of our industry-leading advanced advertising product and to inform our marketing, our digital products and even some of our content development itself.
It also means delivering even more value to consumers, especially those who subscribe to the traditional bundle. As you know, our company has led the industry in making our content available to consumers on an on-demand basis.
Given ongoing shifts in consumer behavior, we think it's important to provide even more on-demand content as part of our network offering. As a result, we're evaluating whether to retain our rights for a longer period of time and forgo or delay certain content licensing. This would effectively push the SVOD window for content on our networks to a multiyear period more consistent with traditional syndication.
In our efforts to improve the consumer experience on our networks, we're also looking for opportunities to reduce our ad loads. Just last week, we announced that truTV will cut its ad load in half for prime time original shows starting late next year.
Over time, we think a better viewing experience will help drive higher viewership and enhance the value proposition of our network. As I've said before, I think now is the time for us to press our advantages, and I'm confident these investments in content, capabilities and the consumer experience will position us for continued strong growth in the years to come. And I'm confident because we're operating from a position of strength, which was evident, once again, in this quarter's results.
So let's look at this quarter. Turning first to Warner Bros. which increased its revenues by 15%, led by continued strength in television and video games.
Already the top supplier of broadcast television programming, Warner's has the 2 biggest new shows on broadcast this fall with Blindspot and Supergirl.
Supergirl launched last week and represents 1 of 8 Warner shows on television this season based on our DC Entertainment library, joining already established hits such as The Flash, Arrow and Gotham.
DC's IP was also a significant contributor to our video games business, which through the end of the third quarter is the #1 U.S. publisher this year. And at the end of the third quarter, we launched LEGO Dimensions, which counts LEGO Batman and many of his DC counterparts among its cast of characters. We think it's going to be a big hit this holiday season and the next big game franchise for Warner.
On the movie side, the countdown has started for March's blockbuster Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which will be followed by the buzz-generating screen version of DC's Suicide Squad.
DC is a key part of Warner's growth strategy and in recent years has had tremendous success in both television and games.
The next stage of growth for DC will be in film, which is also a critical driver in our plans to further expand our consumer products business.
At Turner, TBS' coverage of Major League Baseball playoffs was the most-watched postseason ever for the network, growing close to 50% over last year's coverage.
And the NBA on TNT, one of our other key sports properties, got off to a great start last week with viewership of its opening night doubleheader growing almost 25% over a year ago.
The continued strength of our sports lineup has helped make TBS and TNT the #1 and #4 cable networks in prime time year-to-date, respectively. And that's a great position to have ahead of the rebrands we'll be rolling out for each of those networks next year. We're optimistic these rebrands will have a similar impact over time as the changes we made at CNN and Cartoon Network.
In the third quarter, CNN continued to grow prime time ratings across all key demographics, up 39% and 35% for adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54, respectively.
CNN's reach has never been more apparent than during its recent record-setting coverage of the Republican and Democratic presidential debates and CNN continued to build its digital presence with the recently launched Great Big Story. That's a distinctive independent, mobile-focused news brand aimed at millennial audiences. It's one of the many examples of how we're innovating outside the traditional TV ecosystem.
Cartoon also continue to gain share, ending the third quarter as the #1 ad-supported cable network with kids 6 to 11 for the second consecutive quarter. Even more impressive, it was the #1 network in VOD across broadcast and cable in July and August.
Adult Swim also shined brightly, finishing as ad-supported cable's #1 total day network among adults 18 to 34 for the 30th consecutive quarter. That's an impressive run.
Turning to HBO. It was another strong quarter for the global leader in print and subscription video. In September, HBO received a record 43 Primetime Emmy Awards. That's the most of any network for the 14th consecutive year. That included Best Drama for Game of Thrones and Best Comedy for Veep.
In total, Game of Thrones was the recipient of 12 awards, and that's a record for a series in 1 year.
So with HBO NOW, HBO is at the forefront of marrying the very best content with the next-generation consumer experience. While it's very early, and we have a lot of work ahead of us, the early results for HBO NOW point to a significant long-term opportunity. To take full advantage of that opportunity, we'll continue to expand our lineup of both distribution partners and supported devices for the HBO service.
On that front, HBO NOW recently added Roku to its lineup of distributors, and we added support for Google's Chromecast and Amazon's Fire TV.
HBO is also expanding its content lineup to leverage its growing multi-platform presence.
And yesterday, we announced that Jon Stewart will be joining the HBO family with a particular focus on providing content for our broadband platforms. 
Over time, we expect to expand the distribution of standalone HBO streaming services to many more territories around the world.
For example, HBO Latin America recently announced plans to offer a standalone streaming version of HBO to Latin American and Caribbean broadband consumers. The service will launch in Colombia before the end of the year and subsequently expand to other territories in the region.
So we're just getting started. And I think you can see that we continue to execute at a very high level across the company. We're moving quickly and decisively to take advantage of changes in technology and consumer behavior. And I'm confident the investments we're making in content, capabilities and in the consumer experience will further strengthen our competitive position, solidify our long-term growth prospects and enable us to continue providing industry-leading returns to our shareholders for many years to come.
Now let me turn it over to Howard so he can take you through the financials in greater detail. Howard?"

But as we stand today, we have visibility on and want to share a number of items affecting 2016, including investment decisions we're in the process of making.
By far, the most significant factor is FX, which at current rates, we expect to have a similar impact as this year or a drag of approximately $0.50 on adjusted EPS compared to our expectations when we put our plan in place last year.
Beyond that, there are some parts of the business where we're tracking below and other areas we're outperforming our expectations compared to the plan we presented at our Investor Day.
In terms of operational headwinds, similar to the rest of the industry, ratings at our key domestic entertainment networks have declined to a greater degree than we anticipated a year ago, and that will negatively affect ad revenue next year.
In addition, since the end of 2014, subscribers at Turner's domestic networks have declined approximately 1% beyond what our outlook had assumed, and we're assuming declines continue at a similar rate in 2016.
On the positive side, our cost-savings efforts are running ahead of plan, and we remain focused on executing our efficiency initiatives and constraining overhead expenses.
At CNN and Cartoon Network, ratings continue to be very strong, and that's driving upside to our advertising expectations for those businesses.
At Warner Bros., our video games business is having a record year in 2015, and we see opportunities to continue to grow this business. So despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, we expect to outperform our initial video games expectations for next year.
And finally, excluding FX, growth across our international businesses remain strong.
Overall, the impact from operational headwinds not including FX and the benefit from improved performance in the areas I just walked through are roughly similar in size, each running several hundred million dollars.
Beyond those changes, we have also identified some additional investments we believe are critical to our long-term success. We recognize the video ecosystem as rapidly evolving and strongly believe this is the time to press our advantage.
So as Jeff noted, we've decided to invest even more aggressively in our businesses with a focus on content, capabilities and enhancing the consumer experience. And while we are still evaluating the size, those investments could also run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Taking into account those additional investments, we think 2016 adjusted EPS is more likely to be around $5.25. But as I mentioned, we're still working through our budget process so other factors could influence our outlook to either the upside or downside.
Looking beyond 2016, we're in the very early stages of updating our long-range plan, but I would point out the FX drag I noted earlier will carry through into future years, and that means we don't expect to be over $8 in adjusted EPS in 2018 at this point.
Even so, we're excited about the progress we are making on some of the upside opportunities we discussed with you previously. And we think the investments we're making to enhance the consumer experience will be a critical point of differentiation for the company. So we're very confident we can grow these businesses at industry-leading levels in the years to come.
Now let me turn to the third quarter results. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.
As you'll recall, last year's third quarter results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company and programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items, my comments today related to expenses, margin and adjusted operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date periods will exclude these charges from all periods.
Starting with consolidated results. We had another strong quarter, and we're really pleased with our performance year-to-date. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, revenues increased 6% and adjusted operating income grew 13%, and we've achieved that while continuing to execute on our strategic objectives and laying the groundwork for future growth.
In the third quarter, revenues grew 5% or 10% excluding the drag of almost 500 basis points from FX. Adjusted operating income increased 13% with margins expanding about 200 basis points. That reflects our continued cost discipline as we held total expense growth to 2% in the quarter. That included a 6% reduction in SG&A due to savings from the restructuring action taken last year and our ongoing cost controls as well as a decline in equity compensation resulting from the movement in our stock price.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted EPS was $1.25 compared for $1.22 in the prior year quarter and increased almost 30% when excluding last year's charges and benefit from a tax settlement.
During the quarter, we repurchased over $1.2 billion in shares and paid $285 million in dividend. And year-to-date, we've returned almost $4.2 billion to shareholders.
This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, and that's despite a foreign currency drag of approximately $0.45 to $0.50, which is above our previous estimate due primarily to the recent weakening of certain currencies in Latin America. So we feel really good about how we're operating, and we remain on track for another year of very attractive adjusted EPS growth.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we are encouraged by the improvement in advertising trends, and we posted another quarter of profit growth despite significant FX headwinds.
Year-to-date, Turner has grown adjusted operating income a very strong 16%. Subscription revenues declined 1% in the quarter, but increased around 4% when looking through the impact of foreign exchange and last year's benefit from certain domestic contractual settlements.
Domestic Subscription revenues grew low single digits. Subscriber losses were a modest headwind to growth in the quarter and were consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year, declining around 1.5% on average.
Absent the drag of more than 20 percentage points from FX, international Subscription revenue was up low double digits with the biggest gains, again, coming from Latin America.
Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect a net negative impact of approximately 300 basis points on total subscription revenue growth from the combination of continued FX headwinds and the benefit from the comparison to last year's carriage dispute with DISH and with higher pricing set at 9 of our top 10 distributors, we remain on track for domestic Subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teens in 2016 and to grow at a similar rate in 2017.
Moving on. Advertising declined 1%, but was up 3% when excluding FX and the impact from the absence of NASCAR programming. Domestic advertising was flat in the quarter. International advertising grew in the low double digits absent an FX drag of over 20 percentage points and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a net drag of close to 250 basis points as a result of the impact of FX headwinds, partially offset by the positive comparison to last year's carriage dispute with DISH and the benefit from airing 3 additional Major League Baseball playoff games this year.
At the same time, scatter pricing has been very healthy, pacing up strong double digits versus the upfront. And putting those factors together, we anticipate total advertising revenue to be up low single digits in the quarter.
Looking at our costs. We've reduced expenses by 7% and margins expanded over 250 basis points, helped by lower programming cost and SG&A.
Programming expenses were down 9%, primarily due to the absence of NASCAR. SG&A declined 6% reflecting our continued focus on cost efficiencies as well as savings from last year's restructuring actions.
In the fourth quarter, excluding the charges from last year, we anticipate programming cost growth to be up about 20% due to Major League Baseball and the timing of original programming on TNT.
A significant portion of the increase from higher MLB stems from the additional games and the significant growth in ratings in advertising during the playoffs, which pulled additional rates amortization into the quarter.
We also expect higher marketing expenses associated with our originals. As a result, adjusted operating income, excluding charges, should be down significantly in the fourth quarter.
As we approach the rebrands of TBS and TNT, we're also evaluating the fit of certain programming we currently air. To the extent we decide not to use the programming in the future, that could result in charges during the fourth quarter, though nothing close to the magnitude we saw in 2014. Even so, Turner remains on track for another year of solid growth in adjusted operating income. At the same time, we're continuing to make the investments necessary to position us for long-term success.
Turning now to HBO, where we continue to see very strong demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits and consistent with the last several quarters, a shift toward non-revenue generating subs was a constraint on revenue growth.
As we expected, HBO NOW's contribution to sub revenue increased from last quarter. However, it's still very much in its infancy as both a product and a business. Over time, we expect NOW to be a more significant revenue contributor as we launch on additional platforms and continue to invest in the product.
Moving on. Content and other revenues grew 13%. That was mainly from the domestic licensing of a library series. Adjusted operating income was up 21%. That was helped by a 3% decline in total expenses despite investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. Programming cost fell 6% due to lower theatrical expenses.
So HBO is on track for another year of good growth in adjusted operating income and given the strong global demand for our content and the investments we're making in programming and with HBO NOW, we feel HBO is well positioned to deliver attractive financial results over the long term.
Moving on to Warner Bros., where we continue to benefit from the diversity of Warner's businesses. In the quarter, revenue increased 15% and adjusted operating income was up a strong 36%, and that's despite a material drag from FX.
Television revenues increased over 20% due to strong growth in licensing fees, and that was mainly due to the domestic licensing of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest.
Meanwhile, Warner's continued its record year in video games, with revenues more than tripling for the second consecutive quarter. That was led by the releases of LEGO Dimensions and Mad Max as well as continued strong sales from our franchise titles, Mortal Kombat X and Batman: Arkham Knight. These are a few examples of how we can leverage the great IP and franchises at Warner's in games and why we see a very attractive long-term opportunity for this business.
Across theatrical and TV, home video revenues were down 7% in the quarter, in line with industry trends. At the same time, digital trends remained healthy, with EST up double digits for Warner's and the industry.
Overall, Warner Bros. had a great quarter and remains on pace for a record year of adjusted operating income in 2015 and with a healthy trend in our TV business, our growing video games presence and an ambitious theatrical slate that kicks off next year, we're confident Warner's can continue to grow at attractive levels in the years to come.
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled $2.9 billion in the first 9 months of the year. That's up from a year ago due to growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes, partially offset by a significant swing of working capital.
The growth in working capital reflects higher receivables from increased TV licensing revenues, severance payments related to last year's restructuring initiatives and increased content investment across our divisions.
Our cash taxes declined primarily due to the timing of favorable tax legislation and related payments. And given healthy conversion so far this year, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow generation.
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $21.2 billion of net debt, up almost $1.4 billion from the end of 2014. That's mostly due to the approximately $3.9 billion we returned to shareholders in the first 9 months through share repurchases and dividends.
Since our last earnings call, we redeemed over $300 million in debt that remained outstanding on our 2016 notes after our tender offer earlier this year.
And on the M&A front, we've invested $344 million so far this year. That includes Turner's investment in iStreamPlanet in the third quarter. And that's a great example of the kind of tuck-in acquisition we have prioritized in recent years, and that remains our focus.
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.7x. However, excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from the fourth quarter of 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.64x, slightly below our target leverage of 2.75x.
As we look forward, we do not anticipate a change in either our target leverage or our capital allocation philosophy, which will remain focused on investments back into our businesses, targeted M&A and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. We're really pleased with how we're executing across our business and with our strong financial results through the first 9 months of the year. 
Given our strong year-to-date results, I want to provide some additional context on our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS, which we continue to expect to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70.
As I mentioned earlier, that includes an FX headwind of approximately $0.45 to $0.50 based on current rates.
Looking through that FX headwind, our outlook implies over 20% growth off last year's base of $4.15.
Midpoint of our outlook suggests adjusted EPS will be down slightly in the fourth quarter when compared to the $0.98 we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. That's mainly due to investments across our networks businesses that we've previously discussed with you, including further technology and marketing investments related HBO NOW and significantly higher programming and marketing costs at Turner.
Meanwhile, at Warner Bros., we have difficult theatrical release comparisons, an unfavorable mix of cost related to investments in content at video games and TV, and we continue to face material FX headwinds.
But overall, we're very pleased with our performance this year and we're on track for our seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. And we believe the investments we're making will both strengthen our position inside the traditional TV ecosystem and allow us to take advantage of the growing opportunities outside of it.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

First, I think all of us know that for shows that premier on either broadcast or cable channels, the biggest monetization support, by far, is the carriage fee, plus the advertising that supports either a big bundle or a s",567,"Thanks, Michael. Yes, I'll start. First, I think all of us know that for shows that premier on either broadcast or cable channels, the biggest monetization support, by far, is the carriage fee, plus the advertising that supports either a big bundle or a streamlined bundle. And if you then go to the aftermarket, syndication, SVOD, et cetera, if we're talking about SVOD, which we also all know drives a much smaller subscription revenue and it has limited or no ad revenue, it's pretty clear that, that offers less monetization support in general for the quality and diversity of programming that we've all gotten used to seeing on the dock. So we think a lot about how to enhance the value of the traditional pay-TV bundle. And it's something we're obviously looking at, at our network. Historically, the syndication window was 4 years after the original air date. And that whether it went to syndication over the year, whether it went to cable basic, that was supported by subscription revenue, it was supported by advertising. More recently, we've seen most serialized content move towards 1 year windows. But just take our HBO deal and Richard's going to speak to it, given your question, the Amazon deal has a 3-year window. So we'll continue to evaluate and see what window works best for different types of content, the pay-TV, originals, the broadcast premieres, the cable premieres, and we'll look very carefully at the health of our networks and all of Warner's network partners to make sure that we optimize the value of content to provide support for the diversity of what you're seeing today. And we all need to consider that the shift in viewing to digital platform suggest that consumers often don't mind waiting a year for certain content if that's the way that it's offered. So you look at the basic cable network, and they compete with services like HBO, Netflix, et cetera, all of which, the HBOs, the Netflixes, they have long-term exclusivity for their shows. So we're still evaluating what it would look like, but it could mean adjusting the window somewhat, as I said in my prepared remarks today. Also, let's go to international, the big source of support for programming. It's a very interesting example of how it could work. And if you take the example, I think Netflix is doing some smart things, entering a number of territories. It's aggressively bidding for syndicated content. And what you see is that in most territories, we see incumbent distributors bid for second window rights, not just first window rights. They are, of course, supported by subscription fees, advertising, et cetera. So this increased competition is driving demand for great TV content. It's benefiting Warner Bros. It's a rapidly evolving ecosystem, not just here, but overseas. And we expect change and innovation to continue. So that's why we're thinking about this. I do want to emphasize that what you're hearing today from us is -- hopefully, you'll hear a very confident position, and we're quite resolved to deal and benefit in the long term because we think the focus of our basic and pay-TV networks is an advantage. We think we're going to be in whichever bundles are out there, streamlined or large. And we think these moves are very important to secure the long-term growth, and we think it's all going to work."

Two pretty broad questions. Let me see if I can get through them quickly. On the subscription revenue side, we are quite pleased with the position that we're in right now and quite confident in our ability to continue to drive very, very strong subscription revenue growth. I think you were probably referring to the domestic side. We've now completed 9 of 10 deals where we have absolutely 100% achieved the rate increases that we were seeking. We're confident that we will complete the remaining deal in reasonably short order. All of our contracts have certain penetration protections that give us additional confidence, but I do want to just comment for one second with respect to the declines in the subscribers in the United States. In the prior quarters and in another forums, we've said that we've been planning for declines to continue. We don't anticipate that they're going to be material. We continue to still believe that. What we're doing now is we're starting to just -- as we're planning for next year, we're going to assume that the rate of decline is similar to this year, although in an encouraging way, the traditional distributors who have reported third quarter earnings, most of them, if not all of them, have reported improvements year-over-year. And some distributors, the best third quarter that they had in years. In addition, we are in talks with numerous interested parties to potentially launch OTT services. And as Jeff said, we would fully anticipate participating in those bundles with the portfolio of networks that we have. So I think as you look out on the horizon, there is reason to be really confident and optimistic that we could even stem losses altogether and maybe even get back to a position of growth in the United States. On the ad load side, we announced recently, which is a first for us, that we were going to take truTV and provide an enhanced viewing experience beginning next year that will essentially provide for 21% of our programming. And in some respects, we're starting the truTV, we're going to learn a lot. I think, as Jeff said, the consumer experience is increasingly important. We're transforming Turner to focus solely, first and foremost, on the consumer, where the consumer is going and what that experience is going to be. When we think about the ad part that we have on our networks, I'm comfortable with where we are for the most part, but I think tru is going to be a very, very interesting experiment to see whether it actually will make a difference with respect to the viewing experience. And we don't anticipate it will have really any revenue impact with respect to that network. So we're going to continue to pay very close attention to this. We care deeply about the experiences that we provide our consumers with our brands. And we'll be providing more updates as we get into next year."

So that incremental $0.15 of investment, about $150 million to $200 million of EBITDA investment versus where you might have thought at the Analyst Day. So do I have that math right? And then, Jeff, I guess, sort of interesting, right, perhaps the issue around SVOD rights demonstrates that Warner Bros. and HBO have different profit maximization strategic priorities than Turner. The synergies among these 3 still sufficient or is it -- does it make more sense to have Turner and Warner's, HBO, separate at this point given the dynamics you guys are talking about today?"

So I don't think there's any benefit to what you're saying in any kind of separation. In fact, I think, because we've now gotten our businesses with those 3 into the ones that we think work best together, both in strategic planning, in global distribution, in global sourcing of leading projects, meaning attracting creators, whether film, TV shows, et cetera, these are huge advantages for Time Warner. And what we're all talking about, including all of your questions, are how to take the obviously successful history of bundles, which have very high penetration, not just in the United States, but everywhere and have a significant amount of ad support and how to evolve all of them into more VOD, better guide and interface and the programming, some of which goes for premium, not ad-supported, some of which belongs in an ad-supported environment, but in a evolved ad environment. All of that still holds true. And I think what you're seeing now in the evolution of streamlined bundles and new distributors is more opportunity on a global basis to make all this program production and network branding more engaged and more relevant. So we wouldn't split any of this up. We think it belongs together, and it gives us an advantage relative to our competitors."

And then if that's not attractive or that's not something you're going to do, as you think about -- you chose earlier this year to sell content to Hulu. Why is Hulu better?

If you take the point -- let's start with premium branded services like an HBO, Showtime, Netflix. For a long time in HBO, I think more than 15 years, has had a VOD service and therefore all of the programming, the original programming, et cetera, that's on HBO is all there, and it's quite successful just as it is at Netflix or Showtime. Now it is true, if you stay with HBO, your question that when we sold or licensed some syndicated window product 3 years all to Amazon, all of which is still on HBO, what we're giving is consumers more choice and doing a sampling, which for HBO with Amazon and Amazon Fire subscribers that allows HBO to get a trial so they can see all the programming and then sign on to the current service. Those kinds of things make sense for premium networks and then go to your question on basic networks like Turner or pick a broadcast network. Those are typically premieres, often once a week shows across the dial, whether it's broadcast or cable and most consumers are used to getting those in a bundle, whether the bundle has to be 100 networks, whether it's 30, 50 or 10 that a consumer chooses, which, I think, over time they'll have more choice to be able to do. If we took the course you're suggesting and it's worth thinking about, of course, take, say, the Turner network and put them on their own. You do have some questions of distribution, of coverage, of ad support, which it may not be the best way to premiere a range of basic cable network. And remember, most of the distributors out there don't have the really strong ability to support an offering like that. That could emerge, but it's not here now."

No matter who we license to, it's important that we focus on maximizing the value of our content across all distribution platforms and key point, across all windows in time. That includes continuing to evaluate what window works best for different types of content. Half hour comedies are different than serialized dramas. And when considering the best partner, there are many different considerations beyond just the price. For example, I think, as you referenced, Hulu established advertising has value by charging additionally or 2 levels depending whether a consumer has ads or not. The question of whether it's a sufficient charge for the ad remains to be seen. But we think competition on SVOD providers, not just the ones like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, but as you go around the world, you have a combination of pure SVOD guys, you have SVOD services from incumbent broadcasters, it's becoming a fairly rich competition. It's good for consumers. It's good for content value. And we think we'll arrive at the right mix. I think if your underlying point is that it doesn't make a lot of sense to sell programming to a given distribution model, let's call it a bundle with a fair amount of subscription support and advertising support and when you sell it to a method of distribution that has less realistic ad and subscription support, that would clearly not be a sustainable thing for either content production or networks over the long term."

Welcome to Time Warner's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other reaffirming our 2015 full year business outlook.
Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?"
24689,313907801,892432,"Time Warner Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and thanks everyone for listening in this morning.As you can see from our results, we had another very good quarter. Revenues increased 5% to $6.6 billion. We posted strong growth in adjusted operating income, which totaled $1.8 billion. T",1957,"Thanks, Mike, and thanks everyone for listening in this morning.
As you can see from our results, we had another very good quarter. Revenues increased 5% to $6.6 billion. We posted strong growth in adjusted operating income, which totaled $1.8 billion. That translated into adjusted EPS of $1.25 per share. That's a record third quarter for the company. And we returned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
This continues our track record of delivering industry-leading performance, while also positioning the company for a world where viewers consume an increasing amount of content on demand and on multiple platforms and devices. And that's a world in which brands need to thrive both inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem.
We've been doing that by leveraging our strong brands, global scale and distinctive IP to produce content that resonates deeply with consumers and will become even more valuable in this environment.
We've also been a leader in enhancing the value of the traditional TV bundle for consumers, making more content available on demand and on a growing array of devices.
More recently, we've been strategically expanding outside the traditional TV ecosystem to tap into new growth opportunities, and we're executing these strategies across the globe, while at the same time remaining laser-focused on operational and capital efficiency.
The result has been a total shareholder return of 180% since the beginning of 2008, well above our peer average and more than double the S&P 500.
To continue performing at those levels in the future, however, it's critical that we push on the accelerator because every day it becomes clearer that the trends we anticipated are happening and in some ways, they're happening even faster than we expected.
These changes create challenges for our business, but they also produce many opportunities for us. And our goal is to use our unmatched combination of scale, brands and distinctive IP to capitalize on these trends so that our businesses are even more relevant, more competitive and profitable 5 to 10 years from now than they are today. That means moving even more aggressively to execute our strategy by making investments for the long run.
This is a formative time in media, a time when industry leaders for the next decade and beyond are being established. And I believe those companies with the resources and will to invest will thrive and those that don't, will falter. So it's important our primary focus be on long-term competitive position and growth rather than near-term profitability.
So with that as a background, I'd like to provide an update on our 2016 financial targets. We have not yet finished our budget and long-range planning process, but we're far enough along that we can identify and size changes to our expectations that together suggest that adjusted EPS is more likely to be around $5.25 next year. I'll give you some context on those changes and Howard will provide more detail in his remarks.
But at current rates, we estimate the impact of foreign exchange on next year would be similar to this year. That's around $0.50 per share, accounting for the significant majority of the change in our expectations.
Beyond FX movements, there are areas where we've outperformed our expectation and other areas that have been more challenging.
More important, we have also identified additional investments and other key decisions that will weigh on earnings in the near term, but that we think will drive long-term growth.
Programming remains by far the most significant area of investment for the company. As you all know, we have plans to invest aggressively in content in 2016 and beyond. But an increasing part of that investment will be directed towards brands and IP that we think will resonate with consumers on new platforms.
HBO's investments in Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, Sesame Street and its expanded VICE relationship are all great examples.
Turner's partnership with WME | IMG to form an eSports league that will air on TBS is another example, and there are many more to come.
But having great content is no longer enough. Content has become just one element of the broader consumer experience. And while we are living in the Golden Age of television programming, for many consumers, the television viewing experience is stuck in the Bronze Age. So we're stepping up our investment in driving the best possible consumer experiences.
For instance, we plan to increase our investments in new digital products and infrastructure so that we can meet consumer demand for video outside traditional TV and compete effectively across platforms. That includes new broadband-delivered initiatives targeted at millennials such as HBO NOW, CNN startup Great Big Story and TBS' new digital studio, Super Deluxe. It also includes investments like Turner's majority stake in iStreamPlanet, a leading platform for live streaming.
And we'll continue to build out data and analytics capabilities, both as the engine of our industry-leading advanced advertising product and to inform our marketing, our digital products and even some of our content development itself.
It also means delivering even more value to consumers, especially those who subscribe to the traditional bundle. As you know, our company has led the industry in making our content available to consumers on an on-demand basis.
Given ongoing shifts in consumer behavior, we think it's important to provide even more on-demand content as part of our network offering. As a result, we're evaluating whether to retain our rights for a longer period of time and forgo or delay certain content licensing. This would effectively push the SVOD window for content on our networks to a multiyear period, more consistent with traditional syndication.
In our efforts to improve the consumer experience on our networks, we're also looking for opportunities to reduce our ad loads. Just last week, we announced that truTV will cut its ad load in half for prime time original shows starting late next year.
Over time, we think a better viewing experience will help drive higher viewership and enhance the value proposition of our network. As I've said before, I think now is the time for us to press our advantages, and I'm confident these investments in content, capabilities and the consumer experience will position us for continued strong growth in the years to come. And I'm confident because we're operating from a position of strength, which was evident once again in this quarter's results.
So let's look at this quarter, turning first to Warner Bros. which increased its revenues by 15%, led by continued strength in television and video games.
Already the top supplier of broadcast television programming, Warner's has the 2 biggest new shows on broadcast this fall with Blindspot and Supergirl.
Supergirl launched last week and represents 1 of 8 Warner shows on television this season based on our DC Entertainment library, joining already established hits such as The Flash, Arrow and Gotham.
DC's IP was also a significant contributor to our video games business, which through the end of the third quarter is the #1 U.S. publisher this year. And at the end of the third quarter, we launched LEGO Dimensions, which counts LEGO Batman and many of his DC counterparts among its cast of characters. We think it's going to be a big hit this holiday season and the next big game franchise for Warner's.
On the movie side, the countdown has started for March's blockbuster Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which will be followed by the buzz-generating screen version of DC's Suicide Squad.
DC is a key part of Warner's growth strategy and in recent years has had tremendous success in both television and games.
The next stage of growth for DC will be in film, which is also a critical driver in our plans to further expand our consumer products business.
At Turner, TBS' coverage of Major League Baseball playoffs was the most-watched postseason ever for the network, growing close to 50% over last year's coverage.
And the NBA on TNT, one of our other key sports properties, got off to a great start last week with viewership of its opening night doubleheader growing almost 25% over a year ago.
The continued strength of our sports lineup has helped make TBS and TNT the #1 and #4 cable networks in prime time year-to-date, respectively. And that's a great position to have ahead of the rebrands we'll be rolling out for each of those networks next year. We're optimistic these rebrands will have a similar impact over time as the changes we made at CNN and Cartoon Network.
In the third quarter, CNN continued to grow prime time ratings across all key demographics, up 39% and 35% for adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54, respectively.
CNN's reach has never been more apparent than during its recent record-setting coverage of the Republican and Democratic presidential debates and CNN continued to build its digital presence with the recently launched Great Big Story. That's a distinctive, independent, mobile-focused news brand aimed at millennial audiences. It's one of the many examples of how we're innovating outside the traditional TV ecosystem.
Cartoon also continue to gain share, ending the third quarter as the #1 ad-supported cable network with kids 6 to 11 for the second consecutive quarter. Even more impressive, it was the #1 network in VOD across broadcast and cable in July and August.
Adult Swim also shined brightly, finishing as ad-supported cable's #1 total day network among adults 18 to 34 for the 30th consecutive quarter. That's an impressive run.
Turning to HBO. It was another strong quarter for the global leader in premium subscription video. In September, HBO received a record 43 Primetime Emmy Awards. That's the most of any network for the 14th consecutive year. That included Best Drama for Game of Thrones and Best Comedy for Veep.
In total, Game of Thrones was the recipient of 12 awards, and that's a record for a series in 1 year.
So with HBO NOW, HBO is at the forefront of marrying the very best content with a next-generation consumer experience. While it's very early, and we have a lot of work ahead of us, the early results for HBO NOW point to a significant long-term opportunity. To take full advantage of that opportunity, we'll continue to expand our lineup of both distribution partners and supported devices for the HBO service.
On that front, HBO NOW recently added Roku to its lineup of distributors, and we added support for Google's Chromecast and Amazon's Fire TV.
HBO is also expanding its content lineup to leverage its growing multi-platform presence.
And yesterday, we announced that Jon Stewart will be joining the HBO family with a particular focus on providing content for our broadband platforms. 
Over time, we expect to expand the distribution of standalone HBO streaming services to many more territories around the world.
For example, HBO Latin America recently announced plans to offer a standalone streaming version of HBO to Latin American and Caribbean broadband consumers. The service will launch in Colombia before the end of the year and subsequently expand to other territories in the region.
So we're just getting started. And I think you can see that we continue to execute at a very high level across the company. We're moving quickly and decisively to take advantage of changes in technology and consumer behavior. And I'm confident the investments we're making in content, capabilities and in the consumer experience will further strengthen our competitive position, solidify our long-term growth prospects and enable us to continue providing industry-leading returns to our shareholders for many years to come.
Now let me turn it over to Howard so he can take you through the financials in greater detail. Howard?"

I'd like to start by providing some additional context to the comments Jeff made on our 2016 targets.
As Jeff noted and I want to emphasize, we're still working through our budget process, and we plan to provide our 2016 outlook when we report 4Q earnings. But as we stand today, we have visibility on and want to share a number of items affecting 2016, including investment decisions we're in the process of making.
By far, the most significant factor is FX, which at current rates, we expect to have a similar impact as this year or a drag of approximately $0.50 on adjusted EPS compared to our expectations when we put our plan in place last year.
Beyond that, there are some parts of the business where we're tracking below and other areas where we're outperforming our expectations compared to the plan we presented at our Investor Day.
In terms of operational headwinds, similar to the rest of the industry, ratings at our key domestic entertainment networks have declined to a greater degree than we anticipated a year ago, and that will negatively affect ad revenue next year.
In addition, since the end of 2014, subscribers at Turner's domestic networks have declined approximately 1% beyond what our outlook had assumed, and we're assuming declines continue at a similar rate in 2016.
On the positive side, our cost-savings efforts are running ahead of plan, and we remain focused on executing our efficiency initiatives and constraining overhead expenses.
At CNN and Cartoon Network, ratings continue to be very strong, and that's driving upside to our advertising expectations for those businesses.
At Warner Bros., our video games business is having a record year in 2015, and we see opportunities to continue to grow this business. So despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, we expect to outperform our initial video games expectations for next year.
And finally, excluding FX, growth across our international businesses remain strong.
Overall, the impact from operational headwinds not including FX and the benefit from improved performance in the areas I just walked through are roughly similar in size, each running several hundred million dollars.
Beyond those changes, we have also identified some additional investments we believe are critical to our long-term success. We recognize the video ecosystem as rapidly evolving and strongly believe this is the time to press our advantage.
So as Jeff noted, we've decided to invest even more aggressively in our businesses with a focus on content, capabilities and enhancing the consumer experience. And while we are still evaluating the size, those investments could also run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Taking into account those additional investments, we think 2016 adjusted EPS is more likely to be around $5.25. But as I mentioned, we're still working through our budget process so other factors could influence our outlook to either the upside or downside.
Looking beyond 2016, we're in the very early stages of updating our long-range plan, but I would point out the FX drag I noted earlier will carry through into future years, and that means we don't expect to be over $8 in adjusted EPS in 2018 at this point.
Even so, we're excited about the progress we are making on some of the upside opportunities we discussed with you previously. And we think the investments we're making to enhance the consumer experience will be a critical point of differentiation for the company. So we're very confident we can grow these businesses at industry-leading levels in the years to come.
Now let me turn to the third quarter results. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.
As you'll recall, last year's third quarter results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company and programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items, my comments today related to expenses, margin and adjusted operating income for the third quarter and year-to-date periods will exclude these charges from all periods.
Starting with consolidated results. We had another strong quarter, and we're really pleased with our performance year-to-date. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, revenues increased 6% and adjusted operating income grew 13%, and we've achieved that while continuing to execute on our strategic objectives and laying the groundwork for future growth.
In the third quarter, revenues grew 5% or 10% excluding the drag of almost 500 basis points from FX. Adjusted operating income increased 13% with margins expanding about 200 basis points. That reflects our continued cost discipline as we held total expense growth to 2% in the quarter. That included a 6% reduction in SG&A due to savings from the restructuring action taken last year and ongoing cost controls as well as a decline in equity compensation resulting from the movement in our stock price.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted EPS was $1.25 compared to $1.22 in the prior year quarter and increased almost 30% when excluding last year's charges and benefit from a tax settlement.
During the quarter, we repurchased over $1.2 billion in shares and paid $285 million in dividend. And year-to-date, we've returned almost $4.2 billion to shareholders.
This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2015 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, and that's despite a foreign currency drag of approximately $0.45 to $0.50, which is above our previous estimate due primarily to the recent weakening of certain currencies in Latin America. So we feel really good about how we're operating, and we remain on track for another year of very attractive adjusted EPS growth.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we are encouraged by the improvement in advertising trends, and we posted another quarter of profit growth despite significant FX headwinds.
Year-to-date, Turner has grown adjusted operating income a very strong 16%. Subscription revenues declined 1% in the quarter, but increased around 4% when looking through the impact of foreign exchange and last year's benefit from certain domestic contractual settlements.
Domestic subscription revenues grew low single digits. Subscriber losses were a modest headwind to growth in the quarter and were consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year, declining around 1.5% on average.
Absent the drag of more than 20 percentage points from FX, international subscription revenue was up low double digits with the biggest gains, again, coming from Latin America.
Looking to the fourth quarter. We expect a net negative impact of approximately 300 basis points on total subscription revenue growth from the combination of continued FX headwinds and the benefit from the comparison to last year's carriage dispute with DISH. And with higher pricing set at 9 of our top 10 distributors, we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teens in 2016 and to grow at a similar rate in 2017.
Moving on. Advertising declined 1%, but was up 3% when excluding FX and the impact from the absence of NASCAR programming. Domestic advertising was flat in the quarter. International advertising grew in the low double digits absent an FX drag of over 20 percentage points and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a net drag of close to 250 basis points as a result of the impact of FX headwinds, partially offset by the positive comparison to last year's carriage dispute with DISH and the benefit from airing 3 additional Major League Baseball playoff games this year.
At the same time, scatter pricing has been very healthy, pacing up strong double digits versus the upfront. And putting those factors together, we anticipate total advertising revenue to be up low single digits in the quarter.
Looking at our costs. We've reduced expenses by 7% and margins expanded over 250 basis points, helped by lower programming cost and SG&A.
Programming expenses were down 9%, primarily due to the absence of NASCAR. SG&A declined 6% reflecting our continued focus on cost efficiencies as well as savings from last year's restructuring actions.
In the fourth quarter, excluding the charges from last year, we anticipate programming cost growth to be up about 20% due to Major League Baseball and the timing of original programming on TNT.
A significant portion of the increase from higher MLB stems from the additional games and the significant growth in ratings and advertising during the playoffs, which pulled additional rates amortization into the quarter.
We also expect higher marketing expenses associated with our originals. As a result, adjusted operating income, excluding charges, should be down significantly in the fourth quarter.
As we approach the rebrands of TBS and TNT, we're also evaluating the fit of certain programming we currently air. To the extent we decide not to use the programming in the future, that could result in charges during the fourth quarter, though nothing close to the magnitude we saw in 2014. Even so, Turner remains on track for another year of solid growth in adjusted operating income. At the same time, we're continuing to make the investments necessary to position us for long-term success.
Turning now to HBO, where we continue to see very strong demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits and consistent with the last several quarters, a shift toward non-revenue generating subs was a constraint on revenue growth.
As we expected, HBO NOW's contribution to sub revenue increased from last quarter. However, it's still very much in its infancy as both a product and a business. Over time, we expect NOW to be a more significant revenue contributor as we launch on additional platforms and continue to invest in the product.
Moving on. Content and other revenues grew 13%. That was mainly from the domestic licensing of a library series. Adjusted operating income was up 21%. That was helped by a 3% decline in total expenses despite investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. Programming cost fell 6% due to lower theatrical expenses.
So HBO is on track for another year of good growth in adjusted operating income and given the strong global demand for our content and the investments we're making in programming and with HBO NOW, we feel HBO is well positioned to deliver attractive financial results over the long term.
Moving on to Warner Bros., where we continue to benefit from the diversity of Warner's businesses. In the quarter, revenue increased 15% and adjusted operating income was up a strong 36%, and that's despite a material drag from FX.
Television revenues increased over 20% due to strong growth in licensing fees, and that was mainly due to the domestic licensing of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest.
Meanwhile, Warner's continued its record year in video games, with revenues more than tripling for the second consecutive quarter. That was led by the releases of LEGO Dimensions and Mad Max as well as continued strong sales from our franchise titles, Mortal Kombat X and Batman: Arkham Knight. These are a few examples of how we can leverage the great IP and franchises at Warner's in games and why we see a very attractive long-term opportunity for this business.
Across theatrical and TV, home video revenues were down 7% in the quarter, in line with industry trends. At the same time, digital trends remained healthy, with EST up double digits for Warner's and the industry.
Overall, Warner Bros. had a great quarter and remains on pace for a record year of adjusted operating income in 2015. And with a healthy trend in our TV business, our growing video games presence and an ambitious theatrical slate that kicks off next year, we're confident Warner's can continue to grow at attractive levels in the years to come.
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled $2.9 billion in the first 9 months of the year. That's up from a year ago due to growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes, partially offset by a significant swing in working capital.
The growth in working capital reflects higher receivables from increased TV licensing revenues, severance payments related to last year's restructuring initiatives and increased content investment across our divisions.
Our cash taxes declined primarily due to the timing of favorable tax legislation and related payments. And given healthy conversion so far this year, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow generation.
Now looking at our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $21.2 billion of net debt, up almost $1.4 billion from the end of 2014. That's mostly due to the approximately $3.9 billion we returned to shareholders in the first 9 months through share repurchases and dividends.
Since our last earnings call, we redeemed the over $300 million in debt that remained outstanding on our 2016 notes after our tender offer earlier this year.
And on the M&A front, we've invested $344 million so far this year. That includes Turner's investment in iStreamPlanet in the third quarter. And that's a great example of the kind of tuck-in acquisition we have prioritized in recent years, and that remains our focus.
Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.7x. However, excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from the fourth quarter of 2014, our leverage ratio would have been 2.64x, slightly below our target leverage of 2.75x.
As we look forward, we do not anticipate a change in either our target leverage or our capital allocation philosophy, which will remain focused on investments back into our businesses, targeted M&A and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2015. We're really pleased with how we're executing across our business and with our strong financial results through the first 9 months of the year. 
Given our strong year-to-date results, I want to provide some additional context on our 2015 outlook for adjusted EPS, which we continue to expect to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70.
As I mentioned earlier, that includes an FX headwind of approximately $0.45 to $0.50 based on current rates.
Looking through that FX headwind, our outlook implies over 20% growth off last year's base of $4.15.
Midpoint of our outlook suggests adjusted EPS will be down slightly in the fourth quarter when compared to the $0.98 we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. That's mainly due to investments across our networks businesses that we've previously discussed with you, including further technology and marketing investments related to HBO NOW and significantly higher programming and marketing costs at Turner.
Meanwhile, at Warner Bros., we have difficult theatrical release comparisons, an unfavorable mix of cost related to investments in content and video games and TV, and we continue to face material FX headwinds.
But overall, we're very pleased with our performance this year and we're on track for our seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. And we believe the investments we're making will both strengthen our position inside the traditional TV ecosystem and allow us to take advantage of the growing opportunities outside of it.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to start the Q&A."

First, I think all of us know that for shows that premier on either broadcast or cable channels, the biggest monetization support, by far, is the carriage fee, plus the advertising that supports either a big bundle or a s",567,"Thanks, Michael. Yes, I'll start. First, I think all of us know that for shows that premier on either broadcast or cable channels, the biggest monetization support, by far, is the carriage fee, plus the advertising that supports either a big bundle or a streamlined bundle. And if you then go to the aftermarket, syndication, SVOD, et cetera, if we're talking about SVOD, which we also all know drives a much smaller subscription revenue and it has limited or no ad revenue, it's pretty clear that, that offers less monetization support in general for the quality and diversity of programming that we've all gotten used to seeing on the dock. So we think a lot about how to enhance the value of the traditional pay-TV bundle. And it's something we're obviously looking at, at our network. Historically, the syndication window was 4 years after the original air date. And that, whether it went to syndication over the year, whether it went to cable basic, that was supported by subscription revenue, it was supported by advertising. More recently, we've seen most serialized content move towards 1 year windows. But just take our HBO deal and Richard's going to speak to it, given your question, the Amazon deal has a 3-year window. So we'll continue to evaluate and see what window works best for different types of content, the pay-TV, originals, the broadcast premieres, the cable premieres, and we'll look very carefully at the health of our networks and all of Warner's network partners to make sure that we optimize the value of content to provide support for the diversity of what you're seeing today. And we all need to consider that the shift in viewing to digital platforms suggest that consumers often don't mind waiting a year for certain content if that's the way that it's offered. So you look at the basic cable network, and they compete with services like HBO, Netflix, et cetera, all of which, the HBOs, the Netflixes, they have long-term exclusivity for their shows. So we're still evaluating what it would look like, but it could mean adjusting the window somewhat, as I said in my prepared remarks today. Also, let's go to international, the big source of support for programming. It's a very interesting example of how it could work. And if you take the example, I think Netflix is doing some smart things, entering a number of territories. It's aggressively bidding for syndicated content. And what you see is that in those territories, we see incumbent distributors bid for second window rights, not just first window rights. They are, of course, supported by subscription fees, advertising, et cetera. So this increased competition is driving demand for great TV content. It's benefiting Warner Bros. It's a rapidly evolving ecosystem, not just here, but overseas. And we expect change and innovation to continue. So that's why we're thinking about this. I do want to emphasize that what you're hearing today from us is -- hopefully, you'll hear a very confident position, and we're quite resolved to deal and benefit in the long term because we think the focus of our basic and pay-TV networks is an advantage. We think we're going to be in whichever bundles are out there, streamlined or large. And we think these moves are very important to secure the long-term growth, and we think it's all going to work."

And where do you think we need to be? Maybe you can elaborate on sort of the puts and takes in that decision. How much of a pricing lift do you get, assuming it's enough to offset the ad volume decline over time?"

On the subscription revenue side, we are quite pleased with the position that we're in right now and quite confident in our ability to continue to drive very, very strong subs",495,"Alexia, 2 pretty broad questions, let me see if I can get through them quickly. On the subscription revenue side, we are quite pleased with the position that we're in right now and quite confident in our ability to continue to drive very, very strong subscription revenue growth. I think you were probably referring to the domestic side. We've now completed 9 of 10 deals where we have absolutely 100% achieved the rate increases that we were seeking. We're confident that we will complete the remaining deal in reasonably short order. All of our contracts have certain penetration protections that give us additional confidence, but I do want to just comment for one second with respect to the declines in the subscribers in the United States. In the prior quarters and in other forums, we've said that we've been planning for declines to continue. We don't anticipate that they're going to be material. We continue to still believe that. What we're doing now is we're starting to just -- as we're planning for next year, we're going to assume that the rate of decline is similar to this year, although in an encouraging way, the traditional distributors who have reported third quarter earnings, most of them, if not all of them, have reported improvements year-over-year. And some distributors, the best third quarters that they had in years. In addition, we are in talks with numerous interested parties to potentially launch OTT services. And as Jeff said, we would fully anticipate participating in those bundles with the portfolio of networks that we have. So I think as you look out on the horizon, there is reason to be really confident and optimistic that we could even stem losses altogether and maybe even get back to a position of growth in the United States. On the ad load side, we announced recently, which is a first for us, that we were going to take truTV and provide an enhanced viewing experience beginning next year that will essentially provide for 21% more programming. And in some respects, we're starting with truTV, we're going to learn a lot. I think, as Jeff said, the consumer experience is increasingly important. We're transforming Turner to focus solely, first and foremost, on the consumer, where the consumer is going and what that experience is going to be. When we think about the ad clutter that we have on our networks, I'm comfortable with where we are for the most part, but I think tru is going to be a very, very interesting experiment to see whether it actually will make a difference with respect to the viewing experience. And we don't anticipate it will have really any revenue impact with respect to that network. So we're going to continue to pay very close attention to this. We care deeply about the experiences that we provide our consumers with our brands. And we'll be providing more updates as we get into next year."

So I don't think there's any benefit to what you're saying in any kind of separation. In fact, I think, because we've now gotten our businesses with those 3 into the ones that we think work best together, both in strategic planning, in global distribution, in global sourcing of leading projects, meaning attracting creators, whether film, TV shows, et cetera, these are huge advantages for Time Warner. And what we're all talking about, including all of your questions, are how to take the obviously successful history of bundles, which have very high penetration, not just in the United States, but everywhere and have a significant amount of ad support and how to evolve all of them into more VOD, better guide and interface and the programming, some of which goes for a premium, not ad-supported, some of which belongs in an ad-supported environment, but in a evolved ad environment. All of that still holds true. And I think what you're seeing now in the evolution of streamlined bundles and new distributors is more opportunity on a global basis to make all this program production and network branding more engaged and more relevant. So we wouldn't split any of this up. We think it belongs together, and it gives us an advantage relative to our competitors."

If you take the point -- let's start with premium branded services like an HBO, Showtime, Netflix. For a long time in HBO, I think more than 15 years, has had a VOD service and therefore all of the programming, the original programming, et cetera, that's on HBO is all there, and it's quite successful, just as it is at Netflix or Showtime. Now it is true, if you stay with HBO, your question, that when we sold or licensed some syndicated window product, 3 years, all to Amazon, all of which is still on HBO, what we're giving is consumers more choice and doing a sampling reach for HBO with Amazon and Amazon Fire subscribers that allows HBO to get a trial so they can see all the programming and then sign on to the current service. Those kinds of things make sense for premium networks. And then to go to your question on basic networks like Turner or pick a broadcast network. Those are typically premieres, often once a week shows across the dial, whether it's broadcast or cable and most consumers are used to getting those in a bundle, whether the bundle has to be 100 networks, whether it's 30, 50 or 10 that a consumer chooses, which, I think, over time they'll have more choice to be able to do. If we took the course you're suggesting and it's worth thinking about, of course, take, say, the Turner network and put them on their own. You do have some questions of distribution, of coverage, of ad support, which it may not be the best way to premiere a range of basic cable network. And remember, most of the distributors out there don't have the really strong ability to support an offering like that. That could emerge, but it's not here now."

That includes continuing to evaluate what window works best for different types of content. Half hour comedies are different than serialized dramas. And when considering the best partner, there are many different considerations beyond just the price. For example, I think, as you referenced, Hulu established advertising has value by charging additionally or 2 levels depending whether a consumer has ads or not. The question of whether it's a sufficient charge for the ad remains to be seen. But we think competition on SVOD providers, not just the ones like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, but as you go around the world, you have a combination of pure SVOD guys, you have SVOD services from incumbent broadcasters, it's becoming a fairly rich competition. It's good for consumers. It's good for content value. And we think we'll arrive at the right mix. I think if your underlying point is that it doesn't make a lot of sense to sell programming to a given distribution model, let's call it a bundle, with a fair amount of subscription support and advertising support and then you sell it to a method of distribution that has less realistic ad and subscription support, that would clearly not be a sustainable thing for either content production or networks over the long term."
