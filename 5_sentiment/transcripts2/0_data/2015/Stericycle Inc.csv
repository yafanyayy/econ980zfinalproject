In 2014, the team made great progress in all areas of the business. Let me highlight a couple of the accomplishments. We increased our regulated waste, operational infrastructure, enabling the continued growth of our retail and SQ regulated waste business. We expanded our international operations, completing 27 acquisitions in 10 countries, including a new geography, South Korea. We upgraded the pollution control systems across our U.S. network of incinerators and complied with new EPA Title V standards, reducing our emission significantly. In the quarter, we closed 9 acquisitions, 5 domestic and 4 international. The international acquisitions were 2 in Brazil and 2 in Argentina. The revenues from the 9 acquisitions were $7 million in the quarter, and annualized, approximately $43 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. I'm pleased to report that the integration of the PSA acquisition continues to be on track and that the business is performing well. As we have mentioned in previous calls, as PSC synergies take effect, our margins will continue to improve. Our international business delivered strong internal growth in the quarter. The team remains focused on multiple revenue opportunities in all of the geographies. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 601 accounts, of which 579,000 were small, and the remainder were large. Looking ahead, we remain excited about our expanding growth opportunities. Whether the customers are physician practice, a large hospital system, a Fortune 1000 company or a retail chain, Stericycle provides multiple services to help them improve their operations and to achieve their goals. As we execute on the strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.
In closing, I would like to thank each member of our worldwide team for their focus on our core values, commitment to our customers and strong performance for our shareholders.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusting items. Our current 2015 guidance does include an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately $17 million in revenue and $0.06 in earnings per share. For 2015, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.63 to $4.69. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international 6% to 9%; and recalls and returns revenue between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts who have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%.

And a lot of those are really virtually of those additional services still have plenty of runway to go in some of them our new service offerings for Stericycle. And Hospital side of the business, little bit different. You're doing with contracts that have an annual revenue of 30,000 to 35,000 on medical waste. Sharps Management can more than double that revenue. Pharmaceutical waste can more than double that revenue as well. And hazardous waste can go anywhere between $15,000 to $25,000, but we do not double, but certainly increase it. And the Communication Solutions, which on the slide that we give in and presentation doesn't really account for that, although we are looking to update that slide, but we are getting some nice wins with some IDNs on the console side. So I think it's a conservative numbers or do not every medical waste customer can be sold every one of those services, but there are a lot of customers that can be up-sold to those additional services."

In 2014, the team made great progress in all areas of the business. Let me highlight a couple of the accomplishments. 
We increased our regulated waste operational infrastructure, enabling the continued growth of our retail and SQ regulated waste business. We expanded our international operations, completing 27 acquisitions in 10 countries, including a new geography, South Korea. We upgraded the pollution control systems across our U.S. network of incinerators and complied with new EPA Title V standards, reducing our emission significantly. In the quarter, we closed 9 acquisitions, 5 domestic and 4 international. The international acquisitions were 2 in Brazil and 2 in Argentina. The revenues from the 9 acquisitions were $7 million in the quarter and annualized, approximately $43 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
I'm pleased to report that the integration of the PSC acquisition continues to be on track and that the business is performing well. As we have mentioned in previous calls, as PSC synergies take effect, our margins will continue to improve. 
Our international business delivered strong internal growth in the quarter. The team remains focused on multiple revenue opportunities in all geographies. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 601,000 accounts, of which 579,000 were small and the remainder were large. 
Looking ahead, we remain excited about our expanding growth opportunities. Whether the customer is a physician practice, a large hospital system, a Fortune 1000 company or a retail chain, Stericycle provides multiple services to help them improve their operations and to achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.
In closing, I would like to thank each member of our worldwide team for their focus on our core values, commitment to our customers and strong performance for our shareholders.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusting items. 
Our current 2015 guidance does include an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately $17 million in revenue and $0.06 in earnings per share. For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.63 to $4.69. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%.

But to give you a little bit more color on what do we mean by that, most of our legacy-regulated waste volume has now been internalized. So we've internalized that into the TSD structure -- TSDF structure that we've acquired in PSC. Really, we remain excited about the future opportunity that, that infrastructure has given us. So from that standpoint, I think the high expectations we had about the growth of this business with the infrastructure that PSC had is coming to fruition. The teams are fully integrated. All the teams are working together, and we're really kind of under one umbrella now, which we've newly branded Stericycle Environmental Solutions. So one thing I'll remind everybody about is the seasonality in that business. We've talked about it a little bit, Al, on the call right after the PSC acquisition. The project work of that, which is about 20% of the PSC revenue, does tend to come out slow in the first quarter and build up as the year goes on. So we anticipate that same seasonality going in 2015 and that project work building as the year goes on."

We have a pretty good detail on how that breaks out, and it really hasn't fundamentally changed. On the medical waste side for small practice, the Steri-Safe program, at the highest levels, can more than double our revenues. When you add in things like appointment reminders, live call center work, after-hours answering, that has an opportunity to take that up almost 6x. And in haz waste, even on the SQ side, for certain pharmaceutical drugs that are hazardous upon disposal and even nonhazardous pharmaceutical drugs, that can add additional revenue as well. So on the SQ side, it's probably conservative saying that it can more than triple the revenue. And a lot of those -- or really, virtually all of those additional services still have plenty of runway to go, and some of them are new service offerings for Stericycle. On the hospital side of the business, a little bit different. You're dealing with contracts that have an annual revenue of $30,000 to $35,000 on medical waste. Sharps Management can more than double that revenue. Pharmaceutical waste can more than double that revenue as well. And hazardous waste can go anywhere between $15,000 to $25,000 in revenue, not double it but certainly increase it. And then the Communication Solutions, which, on that slide that we gave in the Investor Relation presentation, doesn't really account for that. Although we are looking to update that slide because we are getting some nice wins with some IDNs on the ComSol side. So I think it's a conservative number. Certainly, not every medical waste customer can be sold every one of those services, but there are a lot of customers that can be up-sold to those additional services."

In 2014, the team made great progress in all areas of the business. Let me highlight a couple of the accomplishments. 
We increased our regulated waste operational infrastructure, enabling the continued growth of our retail and SQ regulated waste business. We expanded our international operations, completing 27 acquisitions in 10 countries, including a new geography, South Korea. We upgraded the pollution control systems across our U.S. network of incinerators and complied with new EPA Title V standards, reducing our emission significantly. In the quarter, we closed 9 acquisitions, 5 domestic and 4 international. The international acquisitions were 2 in Brazil and 2 in Argentina. The revenues from the 9 acquisitions were $7 million in the quarter and annualized, approximately $43 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
I'm pleased to report that the integration of the PSC acquisition continues to be on track and that the business is performing well. As we have mentioned in previous calls, as PSC synergies take effect, our margins will continue to improve. 
Our international business delivered strong internal growth in the quarter. The team remains focused on multiple revenue opportunities in all geographies. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 601,000 accounts, of which 579,000 were small and the remainder were large. 
Looking ahead, we remain excited about our expanding growth opportunities. Whether the customer is a physician practice, a large hospital system, a Fortune 1000 company or a retail chain, Stericycle provides multiple services to help them improve their operations and to achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.
In closing, I would like to thank each member of our worldwide team for their focus on our core values, commitment to our customers and strong performance for our shareholders.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusting items. 
Our current 2015 guidance does include an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately $17 million in revenue and $0.06 in earnings per share. For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.63 to $4.69. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%.
In closing, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results and remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2015 and beyond.

So from that standpoint, I think the high expectations we had about the growth of this business with the infrastructure that PSC had is coming to fruition. The teams are fully integrated. All the teams are working together, and we're really kind of under one umbrella now, which we've newly branded Stericycle Environmental Solutions. The one thing I'll remind everybody about is the seasonality in that business. We've talked about it a little bit, Al, on the call right after the PSC acquisition. The project work of that, which is about 20% of the PSC revenue, does tend to come out slow in the first quarter and build up as the year goes on.

We have a pretty good detail on how that breaks out, and it really hasn't fundamentally changed. On the medical waste side for small practice, the Steri-Safe program, at the highest levels, can more than double our revenues. When you add in things like appointment reminders, live call center work, after-hours answering, that has an opportunity to take that up almost 6x. And in haz waste, even on the SQ side, for certain pharmaceutical drugs that are hazardous upon disposal and even nonhazardous pharmaceutical drugs, that can add additional revenue as well. So on the SQ side, it's probably conservative saying that it can more than triple the revenue. And a lot of those -- or really, virtually all of those additional services still have plenty of runway to go, and some of them are new service offerings for Stericycle. On the hospital side of the business, a little bit different. You're dealing with contracts that have an annual revenue of $30,000 to $35,000 on medical waste. Sharps Management can more than double that revenue. Pharmaceutical waste can more than double that revenue as well. And hazardous waste can go anywhere between $15,000 to $25,000 in revenue, not double it but certainly increase it. And then the Communication Solutions, which, on that slide that we gave in the Investor Relation presentation, doesn't really account for that. Although we are looking to update that slide because we are getting some nice wins with some IDNs on the ComSol side. So I think it's a conservative number. Certainly, not every medical waste customer can be sold every one of those services, but there are a lot of customers that can be up-sold to those additional services."

I think it's -- obviously, we talked about patient transport services in the U.K. Brent touched on Clinical Services being adopted now in Spain. There are some markets overseas like Canada, Ireland and the U.K. where we have our Sharps Management program. It just depends, really, on the maturity of a country and how many different additional services are rolled out. But we're seeing growth, good growth across the board, Shlomo."

From an EPS guidance, you're absolutely right. Prior guidance was $4.69 to $4.75. We had the $0.06 of foreign exchange headwind and then the acquisitions of about $0.02.

This week marks the 1-year anniversary of the PSC Environmental Services acquisition. We are very pleased to report the synergies we discussed in the areas of long-haul transportation, route density and disposal costs have been achieved. The integrated business, which will be branded as Stericycle Environmental Solutions, is positioned for future improvements and investments and growth. 
On the international front, the team continues to drive strong internal growth. We recently returned from a trip from Latin America where we reviewed our strategic growth plans, numerous continuous improvement projects, and newly acquired businesses. The international team has made significant progress in many areas and we remain excited about our growth opportunities in all geographies.

For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.64 to $4.69. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.81 million to $2.86 billion depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for our 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million.

The areas where we said we get those integration expenses, we hit those as long-haul, transportation, it's the route density, it's the disposal options that we have, waste disposal of the business. Most of our legacy volume that Stericycle had pre-PSC acquisition has been integrated. We remain really excited about the opportunity because this new infrastructure gives us a unique ability in the marketplace. And obviously, now going forward, we really want to go with the brand, which is Stericycle Environmental Solutions. We talked about in the last call, certainly, we think there's an opportunity to increase margins right now. Those margins for ComSol are -- I'm sorry, Environmental Solutions is in the mid-20s gross margin and even in the low teens, we think over a longer period of time we can raise those to the high 20s, low 30s and EBIT margins in Environmental Solutions in the mid- to high-teens.

Probably the most interesting cost that we incur this year and that I've never seen before, we literally had to shovel the roofs of several of our facilities, both plants and transfer stations in different locations. And if you've never paid for shovel in the roof, it's a very big bill. As you have not to only shovel the roof, but you then have to haul the snow away. And I got the pleasure of seeing those bills over several states and several facilities."

It's tough point when you're dealing all of the things that Brent has talked about in weather and how much truly is a weather impact and how much is there is a feeling out there that there could be some seasonality in healthcare and a growing seasonality component to healthcare. I think it's a little too early for us to say if there is seasonality and does it impact our business. Certainly on the SQ side where we have fixed fees on some of the contracts, seasonality doesn't play into it. But when you're talking about large IDNs, large customers, you certainly -- you want to look at that. I think it's a little difficult given the quarter we just had on whether to say that there is definitely some more seasonality. I think seasonality for us, when we talk about seasonality, it impacts a little bit more on the ESol business. We previously discussed the ESol and experiences that we have in seasonality of Q1. It's important to understand that seasonality is a function on Environmental Solutions on both volume and weather. And with severe weather we had in Q1, it resulted in a larger than anticipated reduction in volume. And to Stan's point around the bridge and what we think is going to happen in the future, we fully anticipate based on historical models that we have in that space but the majority of that will rebound in 2015 and I think you see our overall confidence in the business for the year. We feel really good about the year and that's what we want to kind of believe, that we're feeling good about the rebound in the business on both the weather and the seasonality."

Revenues from the 15 acquisitions were $7.5 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $42.5 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in local geographies and lines of business. 
This week marks the 1-year anniversary of the PSC Environmental Services acquisition. We are very pleased to report the synergies we discussed in the areas of long-haul transportation, route density and disposal cost have been achieved. The integrated business, which will be branded as Stericycle Environmental Solutions, is positioned for future improvements and investments and growth. 
On the international front, the team continues to drive strong internal growth. We recently returned from a trip from Latin America where we reviewed our strategic growth plans, numerous continuous improvement projects, and newly acquired businesses. The international team has made significant progress in many areas and we remain excited about our growth opportunities in all geographies. 
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provide multiple services to help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.

For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.64 to $4.69. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.81 billion to $2.86 billion depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for our 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be in the range of 34.5% to 35%.

Also foreign exchange was a decrease of revenue by $12.6 million. And also, Shlomo, when you're comparing quarter-to-quarter, there was 1 less business day in Q1 compared to Q4.

This was probably -- I've been here a decade and this is probably the worst winter I have seen, while being at Stericycle, especially from an operational perspective.

So from a revenue perspective, you mentioned that every single month, January, February and March, we had several days in each of those months where we literally could not get the trucks out in several domiciles, whether it was ice storms -- and I would tell you, the ice storms probably hurt you more than the snowstorms because as we know those Midwest states, the Tennessees, the Kentuckys in the world, the Missouris, are just not prepared to handle that kind of weather. So we really had several days we couldn't get the trucks out. And then when we did get the trucks out, only a small percentage of the trucks could actually make all the stops, which then kind of rolls over into the cost perspective. Now going and picking up of those stops the day after, the day after that, the next week and I'm paying overtime to get those pickups. Probably the most interesting cost that we incur this year is that I've never seen before, we literally had to shovel the roofs of several of our facilities, both plants and transfer stations in different locations.

It's tough when you're dealing with all of the things that Brent just talked about on the weather and how much truly is a weather impact and how much is it that there is a feeling out there that there could be some seasonality in healthcare and a growing seasonality component to healthcare. I think it's a little too early for us to say if there is seasonality, does it impact our business. Certainly on the SQ side where we have fixed fees on some of the contracts, seasonality doesn't play into it. But when you're talking about large IDNs, large customers, you certainly -- you want to look at that. I think it's a little difficult given the quarter we just had on whether to say that it is definitely some more seasonality. I think seasonality for us, when we talk about seasonality, it impacts a little bit more on the E Sol business. We previously discussed the E Sol and experiences that we have in seasonality of Q1. It's important to understand that seasonality is a function in the on Environmental Solutions on both volume and weather. And with the severe weather we had in Q1, it resulted in a larger than anticipated reduction in volume. And to Dan's point around the bridge and what we think is going to happen in the future, we fully anticipate based on historical models that we have in that space that a majority of that will rebound in 2015 and I think you see our overall confidence in the business for the year.

But really, the focus is on the countries that we're currently in. And I think, to your point, a good example of that is the 11 international acquisitions we closed in countries that were in, in the last quarter. We had a really strong acquisition quarter. We're proud of the team, the M&A team and the integration team, what they put off in Q1."

So we think back to the previous call and we're talking about PSC and now, our Environmental Solutions business. We have discussed that the Environmental Solutions business does experience seasonality in Q1. And seasonality is a function of volume and weather. But because there was severe weather in Q1, it resulted in a larger-than-anticipated reduction in volume in Environmental Solutions. We fully anticipate that will come back. To give you a little color there, just on the Environmental Solutions side, there were some of our operating locations that we lost 1 to 2 days of business per week for 2 months straight where we're just not productive. So we had in our estimate, in our guidance, we thought to be some seasonality. The severe weather made seasonality worse. That's why we're seeing so much as weather, so much might be seasonality.

Revenues from the 15 acquisitions were $7.5 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $42.5 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
This week marks the 1-year anniversary of the PSC Environmental Services acquisition. We are very pleased to report the synergies we discussed in the areas of long-haul transportation, route density and disposal cost have been achieved. The integrated business, which will be branded as Stericycle Environmental Solutions, is positioned for future improvements, investments and growth. 
On the international front, the team continues to drive strong internal growth. We recently returned from a trip from Latin America where we reviewed our strategic growth plans, numerous continuous improvement projects, and newly acquired businesses. The international team has made significant progress in many areas and we remain excited about our growth opportunities in all geographies. 
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provide multiple services to help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues. 
As we celebrate Earth Day this week, we would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to helping customers promote health and safeguard the environment. I'll now turn it over to Charlie."

We believe analysts will have estimates for our 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be in the range of 34.5% to 35%.

This was probably -- I've been here a decade and this is probably the worst winter I have seen, while being at Stericycle, especially from an operational perspective. It hit us both on revenue and from a cost perspective. So from a revenue perspective, you mentioned that every single month, January, February and March, we had several days in each of those months where we literally could not get the trucks out in several domiciles, whether it was ice storms -- and I would tell you, the ice storms probably hurt you more than the snowstorms because as we know those Midwest states, the Tennessees, the Kentuckys in the world, the Missouris, are just not prepared to handle that kind of weather. So we really had several days we couldn't get the trucks out. And then when we did get the trucks out, only a small percentage of the trucks could actually make all the stops, which then kind of rolls over into the cost perspective. I'm now going and picking up of those stops the day after, the day after that, the next week and I'm paying overtime to get those pickups. Probably the most interesting cost that we incur this year is that I've never seen before, we literally had to shovel the roofs of several of our facilities, both plants and transfer stations in different locations. And if you've never paid for shoveling a roof, it's a very big bill. As you have to not only shovel the roof, but you then have to haul the snow away.

It's tough when you're dealing with all of the things that Brent just talked about on the weather and how much truly is a weather impact and how much is it that there is a feeling out there that there could be some seasonality in healthcare and a growing seasonality component to healthcare. I think it's a little too early for us to say if there is seasonality, does it impact our business. Certainly on the SQ side where we have fixed fees on some of the contracts, seasonality doesn't play into it. But when you're talking about large IDNs, large customers, you certainly -- you want to look at that. I think it's a little difficult given the quarter we just had on whether to say that it is definitely some more seasonality. I think seasonality for us, when we talk about seasonality, it impacts a little bit more on the E Sol business. We previously discussed the E Sol and experiences that we have in seasonality of Q1. It's important to understand that seasonality is a function in the on Environmental Solutions on both volume and weather. And with the severe weather we had in Q1, it resulted in a larger than anticipated reduction in volume. And to Dan's point around the bridge and what we think is going to happen in the future, we fully anticipate based on historical models that we have in that space that a majority of that will rebound in 2015 and I think you see our overall confidence in the business for the year.

So we think back to the previous call and we're talking about PSC and now, our Environmental Solutions business. We have discussed that the Environmental Solutions business does experience seasonality in Q1. And seasonality is a function of volume and weather. But because there was severe weather in Q1, it resulted in a larger-than-anticipated reduction in volume in Environmental Solutions. We fully anticipate that will come back. To give you a little color there, just on the Environmental Solutions side, there were some of our operating locations that we lost 1 to 2 days of business per week for 2 months straight where we're just not productive. So we had in our estimate, in our guidance, we thought to be some seasonality. The severe weather made seasonality worse. That's why we're seeing so much as weather, so much might be seasonality.

And that's why it's 5 -- I think to look at that is $0.05 and we think all of that's going to come back obviously, as the weather improves throughout the year."

This was probably -- I've been here a decade and this is probably the worst winter I have seen, while being at Stericycle, especially from an operational perspective. It hit us both on revenue and from a cost perspective. So from a revenue perspective, you mentioned that every single month, January, February and March, we had several days in each of those months where we literally could not get the trucks out in several domiciles, whether it was ice storms -- and I would tell you, the ice storms probably hurt you more than the snowstorms because as we know those Midwest states, the Tennessees, the Kentuckys in the world, the Missouris, are just not prepared to handle that kind of weather. So we really had several days we couldn't get the trucks out. And then when we did get the trucks out, only a small percentage of the trucks could actually make all the stops, which then kind of rolls over into the cost perspective. I'm now going and picking up of those stops the day after, the day after that, the next week and I'm paying overtime to get those pickups. Probably the most interesting cost that we incur this year is that I've never seen before, we literally had to shovel the roofs of several of our facilities, both plants and transfer stations in different locations. And if you've never paid for shoveling a roof, it's a very big bill. As you have to not only shovel the roof, but you then have to haul the snow away.

Is there a seasonality component now to healthcare? It's tough when you're dealing with all of the things that Brent just talked about on the weather and how much truly is a weather impact and how much is it that there is a feeling out there that there could be some seasonality in healthcare and a growing seasonality component to healthcare. I think it's a little too early for us to say if there is seasonality, does it impact our business. Certainly on the SQ side where we have fixed fees on some of the contracts, seasonality doesn't play into it. But when you're talking about large IDNs, large customers, you certainly -- you want to look at that. I think it's a little difficult given the quarter we just had on whether to say that it is definitely some more seasonality. I think seasonality for us, when we talk about seasonality, it impacts a little bit more on the E Sol business. We previously discussed the E Sol and experiences that we have in seasonality of Q1. It's important to understand that seasonality is a function in the on Environmental Solutions on both volume and weather. And with the severe weather we had in Q1, it resulted in a larger than anticipated reduction in volume. And to Dan's point around the bridge and what we think is going to happen in the future, we fully anticipate based on historical models that we have in that space that a majority of that will rebound in 2015 and I think you see our overall confidence in the business for the year. We feel really good about the year and that's what we want to kind of leave, that we are feeling good about the rebound in the business on both the weather and the seasonality."

Prior to that, the platform that we bought was NotifyMD . It was more of an SQ play. We've seen some good growth on Beryl. It's now really combined. We don't look at it as LQ, SQ anymore. We kind of look at it together. And the reason for that, Richard, is, really, some of the services like employment reminders are applicable to both the LQ and the SQ space. So again those services can be sold to doctors' offices. They're being sold to medical practices that are associated with hospitals. They could be sold to hospitals. So we kind of look of them combined now. But the Beryl acquisition was an important acquisition for us a couple of years ago and it's done well for us."

So we think back to the previous call and we're talking about PSC and now, our Environmental Solutions business. We have discussed that the Environmental Solutions business does experience seasonality in Q1. And seasonality is a function of volume and weather. But because there was severe weather in Q1, it resulted in a larger-than-anticipated reduction in volume in Environmental Solutions. We fully anticipate that will come back. To give you a little color there, just on the Environmental Solutions side, there were some of our operating locations that we lost 1 to 2 days of business per week for 2 months straight where we're just not productive. So we had in our estimate, in our guidance, we thought to be some seasonality. The severe weather made seasonality worse. That's why we're seeing so much as weather, so much might be seasonality. We think the 2 are integrated and are connected. And that's why it's 5 -- I think to look at that is $0.05 and we think all of that's going to come back obviously, as the weather improves throughout the year."

Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.
Last year, we expanded our recall business with the acquisition of a company specializing in the automotive industry. Our combined capabilities allow us to offer our unique recall solution to the automotive sector. As a result, this contributed to a nice rebound in our recalls and returns business in the quarter.
On the international front, our success in selling multiple services resulted in strong organic growth in the quarter. We have now fully launched the service in both Brazil and Chile. Now that this solution is available in these markets, our customers can begin to enjoy the safety, compliance and sustainability benefits provided by this service offering.
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provide multiple services to our customers improve their operation and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.

For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates would be in the range of $4.64 to $4.69. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.88 billion depending on assumptions for growth and impact from foreign exchange rates.

We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million.
2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 34.5%.

That gave us exposure to that sector, matching that -- leveraging those relationships with our call center capabilities. It, obviously, provides our customers now with a unique solution, and we believe the sector is an opportunity for both our customers and Stericycle. If you think about our capabilities, we used to serve -- we were serving the pharmaceutical industry, the medical device industry, consumer products and the food and beverage industry, we really weren't exposed to the automotive sector. Now by having that exposure to that sector, if you think about a recall event now in the U.S. really for that matter or any part of the world, we have that experience and the exposure now to all of those sector. It's really rounded out our service offerings, and the team put out a great number in Q2, at the $23.8 million level, which was a nice improvement over Q1.

Last year, we expanded our recall business with the acquisition of a company specializing in the automotive industry. Our combined capabilities allow us to offer our unique recall solution to the automotive sector. As a result, this contributed to a nice rebound in our recalls and returns business in the quarter.

Now that this solution is available in these markets, our customers can begin to enjoy the safety, compliance and sustainability benefits provided by this service offering.
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provides multiple services to help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.

For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates would be in the range of $4.64 to $4.69. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.88 billion depending on assumptions for growth and impact from foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $100 million to $115 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be in a range of 34% to 34.5%. In closing, we're very pleased with our second quarter 2015 results and remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2015 and beyond. 
Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. [Operator Instructions] Blaire, you can now open the Q&A lines."

Those more than offset the unfavorable impact of about 15 basis points from acquisitions and about 30 basis points due to our benefits related to health care claims. Our core business improved by about 16 basis points from efficiency and slightly lower fuel expense. So our Q2 gross margin was 42.6%. And I think you asked to compare that to your expectation. And I think if we look to The Street models, they were about 43.3%. And if you bridge to that acquisitions, in the quarter, we're about a 30 basis point headwind. Customer mix, both in our recall and our international business unfavorably impacted us slightly by about 16 basis points. And then as I mentioned before, increases in our benefits related to health care claims were unfavorable by about 30 basis points.

As far as the auto sector, as Brent mentioned in his comments, we did a small acquisition in 2014 that gave us exposure to that sector, matching the -- and leveraging those relationships with our call center capabilities. It obviously provides our customers now with a unique solution, and we believe the sector is an opportunity for both our customers and Stericycle. If you think about our capabilities, we used to serve -- we were serving the pharmaceutical industry, the medical device industry, consumer products and the food and beverage industry. We really weren't exposed to the automotive sector. Now by having that exposure to that sector, if you think about a recall event now in the U.S, really for that matter in any part of the world, we have that experience and the exposure now to all of those sectors. It really rounded out our service offering, and the team put out a great number in Q2 at the $23.8 million level, which was a nice improvement over Q1.

Going forward, in Q3, I think still the 35.5% to 36% rate is a good rate to hold. And base off the benefit we saw in Q1, that would give you an annual tax rate of about a 34% to 34.5%."

Keep in mind, too, they had 2 different operating systems. And whenever you have that, it makes it hard to accomplish certain synergies until you get on the same platform. I'm happy to report that all of their locations now are on SAP. So things like route density, moving customers from on-site shredding to off-site shredding to their facilities, which are actually under capacity, which will be a nice pick up for us as we use that available capacity. All those things will contribute to growing our overall EBITDA."

I think we talked about it before. The fixed cost -- the team has done a really good job. The fixed cost is more involved in the facilities, the call center facility that we have, also the warehouse space that we have when we take product back. When we start to get to the low 20s or high teens, it's hard to make up that fixed costs. So you saw that was a driver of margins down in Q3, Q4, a little bit in Q1 of this year. Then once we get past those low 20s, $1 million, that is, in revenue, those fixed costs now are coming in and, obviously, earnings additional margins on that. So when you talk about a lot of other costs to going in there, the variable cost is more of labor. It's the retrieval labor that we have, of independent contractors they go out and grab the products or the nonperforming assets, it's the call center agents that we have a large influx of call center work. But I would tell you that, that high -- when you get below the low 20s, it's tough to cover that, those fixed costs. And then the customer mix obviously would also impact the gross margin as well."

We're always working to improve that SQ-LQ mix, and one of the main ways we do that is through our Clinical Services. This quarter, we actually had a really good Clinical Services performance. That helps bring more margin to our business and helps to grow that. And we're always focused on different types of acquisitions, new services that will continue to drive our margin.

Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include: Changes in governmental regulations of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste; increases in transportation and other operating costs; the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste industry; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles; exposure to environmental liabilities; and compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In the quarter, we closed 8 acquisitions, 6 domestic and 2 international. The international acquisitions were in the Netherlands, which represents a new country for us, and Canada. Revenues from the 8 acquisitions were $10.1 million in the quarter and, annualized, are approximately $48.3 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.
Last year, we expanded our recall business with the acquisition of a company specializing in the automotive industry. Our combined capabilities allow us to offer our unique recall solution to the automotive sector. As a result, this contributed to a nice rebound in our recalls and returns business in the quarter.
On the international front, our success in selling multiple services resulted in strong organic growth in the quarter. We have now fully launched the Sharps Management Service in both Brazil and Chile. Now that this solution is available in these markets, our customers can begin to enjoy the safety, compliance and sustainability benefits provided by this service offering.
Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provides multiple services to help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.
As you all know, last week, Stericycle announced the acquisition of Shred-it International. This exciting new platform provides us an excellent opportunity to continue our organic growth, acquisitions and international expansion for many years to come. We would like to thank all of the Shred-it and Stericycle team members for all their hard work and dedication they demonstrated in making this acquisition possible.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusting items.
For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.64 to $4.69. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.88 billion depending on assumptions for growth and impact from foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $100 million to $115 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be in a range of 34% to 34.5%. In closing, we're very pleased with our second quarter 2015 results and remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2015 and beyond.

So really, when you say where are we taking it now, we're taking it more where, as you know, Scott, we've got great capabilities in call center, not only in our Communication Solutions, but also in our recall and returns division. So it's taking that and leveraging those relationships over those capabilities that we have. It certainly contributed to the growth in Q2. I wouldn't say that we had other contributors as well. We had a record number of recalls for the quarter. We are building momentum in the auto sector, and we do anticipate that, that momentum will continue for the remainder of the year. Obviously, we brought up the low end of the guidance. We're still missing some of those multiple blockbuster acquisitions, and that's why we brought the top end down a bit. But we think the momentum, especially in the auto sector, will continue for the rest of 2015."

The guided tax rate for the quarter was, in fact, 35.5% to 36%.

And while you did see an as-reported tax rate of 33.64%, this was primarily a result of the large settlement that we had discussed and done an 8-K earlier on in the quarter. When you adjust for the settlement, the tax rate in the quarter is actually 35.5%, right in line with guidance. And so as a result, we got no EPS benefit on our adjusted EPS that we reported. Going forward, in Q3, I think still the 35.5% to 36% rate is a good rate to hold. And based off the benefit we saw in Q1, that would give you an annual tax rate of about a 34% to 34.5%."

The fixed cost is more involved in the facilities, the call center facility that we have, also the warehouse space that we have when we take product back. When we start to get to the low 20s or high teens, it's hard to make up that fixed costs. So you saw that was a driver of margins down in Q3, Q4, a little bit in Q1 of this year. Then once we get past those low 20s, $1 million, that is, in revenue, those fixed costs now are coming in and, obviously, earnings additional margins on that. So when you talk about a lot of other costs to going in there, the variable cost is more of labor. It's the retrieval labor that we have, of independent contractors they go out and grab the products or the nonperforming assets, it's the call center agents that we have a large influx of call center work. But I would tell you that, that high -- when you get below the low 20s, it's tough to cover that, those fixed costs. And then the customer mix obviously would also impact the gross margin as well."

Domestic revenues were $523.5 million, of which $493.2 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services, and $30.3 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 6%, consisting of SQ up 7% and LQ up 4%. 
Growth rates were unfavorably impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volume from our industrial customers. International revenues were $195.1 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $33 million was up 8%. This growth rate was also unfavorably impacted by lower hazardous waste volume. Acquisitions contributed $33.3 million to growth in the quarter. Growth profit was $299.7 million or 41.7% of revenues. 
SG&A expense, including amortization, was $138 million or 19.2% of revenues. Net interest expense was $17.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $41.8 million or $0.47 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.08 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments including the recent legal settlement. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.17 at the end of the quarter, which includes the equity from the recent mandatory convertible preferred issuance. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $875 million. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 88,376 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $11.9 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 4 million shares.

International acquisitions were 3 in South Korea, 2 in Spain and 2 in Romania. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were $2.2 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $14.3 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
In the quarter, we experienced solid growth in selling additional services to our existing customer base. This growth came from retail hazardous waste, storage management, pharmaceutical waste and Communication Solutions. For example, we are seeing increased adoption of our pharmaceutical waste service by physician practices. By utilizing our existing customer relationships, along with our environmental solutions infrastructure, we are able to deliver a simple and cost-effective service that keeps our customers compliant and helps protect the environment. 
We also experienced solid growth in our recall and return business. The combination of our recall expertise and the relationships in the automotive sector are creating many opportunities. The team has done a terrific job of flexing up our call center capacity to meet the demand of several large engagements. This has resulted in our best recall and returns quarter in the past 3 years. 
On October 1, we closed the Shred-it acquisition. The acquisition team is off to a quick start, driving operational synergies and laying the groundwork for long-term growth. 
Today, less than 20% of our existing Stericycle customers utilize Shred-it for secure information destruction services. This acquisition provides another value-added service for our customers and an exciting growth opportunity for Stericycle.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015 and preliminary guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisitions related and other adjusting items. 
The current 2015 and preliminary 2016 guidance also includes the recently closed Shred-it acquisition, the related increase in share count and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. 
For 2015, we believe that analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.38 to $4.41. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be approaching $3 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; international, 7% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $100 million and $110 million. 
We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $417 million to $426 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $104 million to $110 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 33.5% to 34%. This assumes the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 36%. 
Now I'd like to provide remarry guidance for 2016. As a reminder, in 2016, we will be reporting on a cash EPS basis. For modeling purposes, our 2015 EPS guidance of $4.38 to $4.41 is equivalent to $4.69 to $4.72 on a cash EPS basis. 
For 2016, we believe analyst cash EPS estimates will be in the range of $5.28 to $5.35, using a share count of approximately 92 million, which we are comfortable with. 
For comparative purposes, when 2015 cash EPS is normalized for tax rates and foreign exchange impact, this represents a cash EPS growth rate of approximately 17%. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.72 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; International, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $470 million to $485 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $140 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%. 
In closing, although disappointed with the results in Q3, we are confident about the long-term fundamentals of our business and remain excited about the growth opportunities in 2016 and beyond.

We also had some great consolidation that we did earlier in the year, which provided a much lower tax rate. So when you normalize for that tax going to the 36 because we don't expect those are going to replicate, that's about $0.12 difference. Also, the continued foreign expense or foreign exchange escalation throughout the year is about another $0.04. So when you normalize for that you would look at about a $4.53 to a $4.56, on an average, $4.55.

What those asked about, those were redirection of waste flows required from the facility fires, payroll adjustment required by unions due to 2, due to inflation in 2 Latin American countries. We experienced some higher operational costs from running our newly compliant incinerators. Regarding the project work, yes, that does come out as higher. We have a certain amount of -- a significant amount of fixed cost that are ties to the industry.

Domestic revenues were $523.5 million, of which $493.2 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services, and $30.3 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 6%, consisting of SQ up 7% and LQ up 4%. Growth rates were unfavorably impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volume from our industrial customers. 
International revenues were $195.1 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $33 million was up 8%. This growth rate was also unfavorably impacted by lower hazardous waste volume. 
Acquisitions contributed $33.3 million to growth in the quarter. Growth profit was $299.7 million or 41.7% of revenues. 
SG&A expense, including amortization, was $138 million or 19.2% of revenues. Net interest expense was $17.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $41.8 million or $0.47 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.08 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments including the recent legal settlement. 
Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.17 at the end of the quarter, which includes the equity from the recent mandatory convertible preferred issuance. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $875 million. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 88,376 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $11.9 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 4 million shares.

International acquisitions were 3 in South Korea, 2 in Spain and 2 in Romania. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were $2.2 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $14.3 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
In the quarter, we experienced solid growth in selling additional services to our existing customer base. This growth came from retail hazardous waste, Sharps Management, pharmaceutical waste and Communication Solutions. For example, we are seeing increased adoption of our pharmaceutical waste service by physician practices. By utilizing our existing customer relationships, along with our environmental solutions infrastructure, we are able to deliver a simple and cost-effective service that keeps our customers compliant and helps protect the environment. 
 
We also experienced solid growth in our recall and return business. The combination of our recall expertise and the relationships in the automotive sector are creating many opportunities. The team has done a terrific job of flexing up our call center capacity to meet the demand of several large engagements. This has resulted in our best recall and returns quarter in the past 3 years. 
On October 1, we closed the Shred-it acquisition. The acquisition team is off to a quick start, driving operational synergies and laying the groundwork for long-term growth. 
Today, less than 20% of our existing Stericycle customers utilize Shred-it for secure information destruction services. This acquisition provides another value-added service for our customers and an exciting growth opportunity for Stericycle. We would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Shred-it team members to our Stericycle family.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015 and preliminary guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusted items. 
The current 2015 and preliminary 2016 guidance also includes the recently closed Shred-it acquisition, the related increase in share count and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. 
For 2015, we believe that analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.38 to $4.41. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be approaching $3 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; international, 7% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $100 million and $110 million. 
We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $417 million to $426 million. 
2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $104 million to $110 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 33.5% to 34%. This assumes the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 36%. 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary guidance for 2016. As a reminder, in 2016, we will be reporting on a cash EPS basis. For modeling purposes, our 2015 EPS guidance of $4.38 to $4.41 is equivalent to $4.69 to $4.72 on a cash EPS basis. 
For 2016, we believe analyst cash EPS estimates will be in the range of $5.28 to $5.35, using a share count of approximately 92 million, which we are comfortable with. 
For comparative purposes, when 2015 cash EPS is normalized for tax rates and foreign exchange impact, this represents a cash EPS growth rate of approximately 17%. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.72 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; International, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $470 million to $485 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $140 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%. 
In closing, although disappointed with the results in Q3, we are confident about the long-term fundamentals of our business and remain excited about the growth opportunities in 2016 and beyond.

Again, this year, from a tax perspective, we had 2 large legal settlements, which significantly lowered our tax rate. We also had some great entity consolidation that we did earlier in the year, which provided a much lower tax rate. So when you normalize for that tax going to the 36 because we don't expect those are going to replicate, that's about $0.12 difference. Also, the continued foreign expense or foreign exchange escalation throughout the year is about another $0.04. So when you normalize for that, you would look at about a $4.53 to a $4.56, on average, $4.55.

What those [indiscernible] that you asked about, those were redirection of waste flows required from 2 facility fires, payroll adjustment required by unions due to 2 -- due to inflation in 2 Latin American countries. We've experienced some higher operational costs from running our newly compliant Title V incinerators. Regarding the project work, yes, that does come out as higher. We have a certain amount of -- a significant amount of fixed cost that are tied to the industry. And when that revenue comes in, we're able to leverage those resources and go at them.

And Gary, that includes project work and lower volumes from the industrial waste customers. Obviously, we feel the shortfall in the projects and these volumes are directly related to the drop in energy and commodity prices. And I think you kind of said it. We acquired assets over the last several years that included industrial waste customers, and these customers' volumes obviously are now included in our base business. So certainly, from a guidance perspective, since we thought that this pressure will not only continue to get slightly worse for the remainder of 2015, level out in 2016, that's why we took it out of our guidance in 2015 and for 2016. But it's certainly the acquisitions we've made were a portion of the businesses. I think you're absolutely right about that shouldn't be our focus. All along, we've talked about building an SQ recurring revenue model. We are certainly going to do that. We'll look at that with a little more gusto now that we've seen that project work, fluctuate more than we like. We saw it fluctuate in Q1. It came back in Q2. We thought we were going to be right there in Q3 and Q4, so this cost [ph] is obviously built during the quarter, but the focus will be over time is to transition this project in industrial waste work, which is not our core focus, to a more SQ recurring revenue model.

And I think if you think through, as I said before, although we don't directly work with energy or mining companies, many of our customers do work for these industries. So the rate of decline, when we look at these customers, was much faster than we anticipated, and it declined rapidly in the quarter. So 2 examples I think we look at, we've had that's servicing and customer for several years that provides generators to the oil and gas industry. This customer provided very steady volumes over the last several years. Their business was down by over 70%, when we look at that specific example, Q3 year-over-year. Another example, we had a contract with a customer that provides equipment cleaning services for the energy and the mining industry. In Q3, we experienced an 80% decline, again, related to the energy and commodity prices. So they're just 2 examples. Obviously, we've been negatively impacted from this.

As we work through mapping Shred-it expenses into Stericycle's structure from IFRS to GAAP, you're going to see changes in gross margin in SG&A. And so with
that, I think it's more important if you just look at it from an EBIT perspective. And I think the model going forward has about 268 basis point impact when we bring in Shred-it right now. So if you look at our EBIT, it was Q3, 23.6, about a 268 basis point impact when you include Shred-it into that number. You'll see about 55 basis points of improvement. So certainly, while we expect some of this to continue, you do see some nice expansion going in there as we work for the plan Charlie talked about. And I think for your modeling purposes, about a 20.6 EBIT for Q4, and that would put you at about full year of 22.3."

Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 6%, consisting of SQ up 7% and LQ up 4%. Growth rates were unfavorably impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volume from our industrial customers. 
International revenues were $195.1 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $33 million was up 8%. This growth rate was also unfavorably impacted by lower hazardous waste volume. 
Acquisitions contributed $33.3 million to growth in the quarter. Growth profit was $299.7 million or 41.7% of revenues. 
SG&A expense, including amortization, was $138 million or 19.2% of revenues. Net interest expense was $17.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $41.8 million or $0.47 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.08 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments including the recent legal settlement.

Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. 
In the quarter, we experienced solid growth in selling additional services to our existing customer base. This growth came from retail hazardous waste, Sharps Management, pharmaceutical waste and Communication Solutions. For example, we are seeing increased adoption of our pharmaceutical waste service by physician practices. By utilizing our existing customer relationships, along with our environmental solutions infrastructure, we are able to deliver a simple and cost-effective service that keeps our customers compliant and helps protect the environment. 
 
We also experienced solid growth in our recall and return business. The combination of our recall expertise and the relationships in the automotive sector are creating many opportunities. The team has done a terrific job of flexing up our call center capacity to meet the demand of several large engagements. This has resulted in our best recall and returns quarter in the past 3 years. 
On October 1, we closed the Shred-it acquisition. The acquisition team is off to a quick start, driving operational synergies and laying the groundwork for long-term growth. 
Today, less than 20% of our existing Stericycle customers utilize Shred-it for secure information destruction services.

I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015 and preliminary guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusted items. 
The current 2015 and preliminary 2016 guidance also includes the recently closed Shred-it acquisition, the related increase in share count and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. 
For 2015, we believe that analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.38 to $4.41. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be approaching $3 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; international, 7% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $100 million and $110 million. 
We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $417 million to $426 million. 
2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $104 million to $110 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 33.5% to 34%. This assumes the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 36%. 
Now I'd like to provide preliminary guidance for 2016. As a reminder, in 2016, we will be reporting on a cash EPS basis. For modeling purposes, our 2015 EPS guidance of $4.38 to $4.41 is equivalent to $4.69 to $4.72 on a cash EPS basis. 
For 2016, we believe analyst cash EPS estimates will be in the range of $5.28 to $5.35, using a share count of approximately 92 million, which we are comfortable with. 
For comparative purposes, when 2015 cash EPS is normalized for tax rates and foreign exchange impact, this represents a cash EPS growth rate of approximately 17%. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.72 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. 
We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; International, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $470 million to $485 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $140 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%. 
In closing, although disappointed with the results in Q3, we are confident about the long-term fundamentals of our business and remain excited about the growth opportunities in 2016 and beyond.

Again, this year, from a cash perspective, we had 2 large legal settlements, which significantly lowered our tax rate. We also had some great entity consolidation that we did earlier in the year, which provided a much lower tax rate. So when you normalize for that tax going to the 36 because we don't expect those are going to replicate, that's about $0.12 difference. Also, the continued foreign expense or foreign exchange escalation throughout the year is about another $0.04. So when you normalize for that, you would look at about a $4.53 to a $4.56, on average, $4.55.

We acquired assets over the last several years that included industrial waste customers, and these customers' volumes obviously are now included in our base business. So certainly, from a guidance perspective, since we thought that this pressure will not only continue but get slightly worse for the remainder of 2015, level out in 2016, that's why we took it out of our guidance in 2015 and for 2016. But it's certainly the acquisitions we've made were a portion of the businesses. I think you're absolutely right about that shouldn't be our focus. All along, we've talked about building an SQ recurring revenue model. We are certainly going to do that. We'll look at that with a little more gusto now that we've seen that project work, fluctuate more than we like. We saw it fluctuate in Q1. It came back in Q2.

To give you an example, Scott, on what do we mean by that type of work, I'll give you kind of 2 examples. And I think if you think through, as I said before, although we don't directly work with energy or mining companies, many of our customers do work for these industries. So the rate of decline, when we look at these customers, was much faster than we anticipated, and it declined rapidly in the quarter. So 2 examples I think we look at, we've had that's servicing and customer for several years that provides generators to the oil and gas industry. This customer provided very steady volumes over the last several years. Their business was down by over 70%, when we look at that specific example, Q3 year-over-year. Another example, we had a contract with a customer that provides equipment cleaning services for the energy and the mining industry. In Q3, we experienced an 80% decline, again, related to the energy and commodity prices. So they're just 2 examples. Obviously, we've been negatively impacted from this.

And Brent even talked about it in his opening comments, a lot of that is coming around the call center work. That does have some related lower margins. But we feel really good about where we are in that business, certainly for 2015 and for 4Q and for our 2015 results. When you think about the auto recalls and why we're excited about that, obviously, there's a heightened sensitivity to auto recalls in general. And if you think about Stericycle, we offer a turnkey solution for these manufacturers to help them assess their customers. So what do we do? We help them in notifying and we help to get their response rate up, and that's where they're getting a lot of pressure. So we think it's further adds to the solutions in the recall space. We don't break out certainly where we're getting these recalls from, but auto recall helps us get to that high level of a little over $30 million in the quarter."

If you did, I apologize. If you didn't, if you could offer that up. I'm just trying to get a better sense of the gross margins implicit in your guidance, if you back out some of these -- the fees, the fires, et cetera, costs that were kind of nonrecurring in the quarter. Just trying to get a better sense of what the jumping off point is and whether we should continue to expect that underlying 10 to 20 basis points of sequential gross margin going forward. Or maybe a little bit more color on what Shred-it does for the margin outlook there."

And we gave it before, but certainly, we're happy to do that for you again. The Q2 gross margin was 42.66, and we have the 40 basis points of unfavorability that came from the lower-than-expected project worldwide.",241,"Sure. Let me first give you the bridge. And we gave it before, but certainly, we're happy to do that for you again. The Q2 gross margin was 42.66, and we have the 40 basis points of unfavorability that came from the lower-than-expected project worldwide. We did have those higher costs, and I gave a lot of color on that. It was 51 basis points. That's how you get to the 41.77. If you want to look at the guidance going forward, I would urge you to, for your modeling, let's focus on EBIT. As we work through mapping Shred-it expenses into Stericycle's structure from IFRS to GAAP, you're going to see changes in gross margin in SG&A. And so with
that, I think it's more important if you just look at it from an EBIT perspective. And I think the model going forward has about 268 basis point impact when we bring in Shred-it right now. So if you looked at our EBIT, it was Q3, 23.6, about a 268 basis point impact when you include Shred-it into that number. You'll see about 55 basis points of improvement. So certainly, while we expect some of this to continue, you do see some nice expansion going in there as we work toward the plan Charlie talked about. And I think for your modeling purposes, about a 20.6 EBIT for Q4, and that would put you at about full year of 22.3."
