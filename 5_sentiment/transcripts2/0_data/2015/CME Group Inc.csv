I'm very pleased with our team's efforts and our performance during 2014. Further, the Q4 results we are going to talk about today were outstanding, and I'm proud of our staff for their hard work during some pretty difficult times. During the fourth quarter, our ADV reached almost 15 million contracts, up more than 30% and it is our second highest volume quarter in our history during our normally slows time of the year. We saw significant growth in every product area ranging from 40% growth in mad metals to 41% growth in interest rates. Record options ADV increased 38% and futures rose 29%. Q4 revenue of $841 million was the second-highest we have ever had. Most importantly, our earnings per share on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was up more than 50%. 
Over the last 3 to 4 years, we have been investing organically in a very positive way to broaden our global reach and to drive more core volume growth as trading conditions improve. I've spoken about this on every earnings call since I became CEO, and we are making progress. 
During the quarter, we created 3 million contracts per day from outside the United States, by far, the highest level we've ever seen. Revenue from outside the U.S. are accounted for approximately 30% of our global revenue and 24% of the volume. Our liquidity is building around the clock. You certainly saw that on our Record Day  in October with a much higher proportion traded from outside the U.S. than an average day. 
Fourth quarter electronic ADV from European clients was 2.4 million contracts, up 45% on a year-over-year basis outperforming North America, which rose 31%. 
In Europe, we saw growth of 61% year-over-year in our interest rate business and 32% growth in equities during the quarter. 
About 3 years ago, we made a concerted effort to reach out to educate European clients about the products suite client by client. In 2014, we spent considerable time talking to these clients about our OTC rates offering and marketing how euro dollars, treasuries and other products can be utilized. We also pointed that the interest rate curve was more dynamic in the U.S. and provided more opportunity for them than other alternatives. Based on our efforts and market conditions, both hedges and speculators from this region have ramped up the activity in our markets. The portion of our interest rate swap business coming from outside the U.S. is increasing, particularly from European-based clients. 
This is surprising since the European mandate for clearing is still several quarters away. We have successfully transitioned some businesses from these clients into futures driven by superior capital efficiency relative to swaps. 
In Asia, our volumes rose 51% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Volume grew 96%, energy jumped 56% and the interest rates were up 54%. In Asia, in our review, we are at very early stages in terms of awareness and education and ultimately, the conversion of new clients. Many of our client meetings are about expanding the footprint of our product offering and man-made progress in discussion terms to connectivity through our training platform and establishing clearing relationships. Once we carefully engaged the ongoing, trading activity tends to be fairly sticky. Based on the way we are at this point and the large number of potential clients, I anticipate this region will be the fastest growing area for CME Group over the next 3 to 5 years. 
I will now shift to talking about a field of our product areas, starting with rate, futures, options and cleared swaps. Our OTC efforts continue to progress in the fourth quarter. We had the highest clearing revenue to date in Q4, which John will touch upon. In interest rates swaps, during 2014, we only took our competitor in DTC dollar-based clearing moving from 32% market share in 2013 to 49% in 2014, including 55% in the fourth quarter. We recently had picked up market share as well in nondollar swap clearing, which you can see on Slide 9. 
In addition to significant customer engagement, our unique portfolio managing value proposition is clearly drawing more U.S. and European clients our platform. As an update, we are now up to 36 firms utilizing portfolio margining, double the 17 we had at the end of 2013. We are currently providing $3.9 billion of savings versus $1 billion at the end of 2013. We added 2 additional MCMs who are with our clients and increasing the total to 9 MCMs. Trade count market share, which is most closely tied to revenue, jumped from 47% from 2013 to 51% in Q4 2014. 
Lastly, we are currently at 64% of the open interest in terms of the global OTC clearing houses. We continue to market our interest rate futures and options to our more than 500 OTC clearing customers. Clearly, this is one of the drivers of our 40-plus percent growth in rates volume during Q4 and almost 20% growth in 2014. Comparatively, the 6 businesses of banks, European rate, volumes and cash treasury volumes were all under pressure. 
I wanted to share a couple of updates on statistics that we follow very closely. Large open interest holders in rates jumped by 15% during 2014 to 1,615 firms spread over our rate futures complex. About half of this increase was in our euro dollars, 2-year treasuries and Fed funds contract, so we are seeing more focus on the front end now. 
Our treasury futures national volume was as a percent of reported cash treasuries jumped to 75% portfolio, up from 67% in 2013. 
Lastly, block volumes are up 80% in 2014 for rate products, outperforming other venues. This is an indicator of large participants entry on markets and using futures for OTC start trading. 
Our focus is to continue to aggressively draw attention to the advantages of our products, and I would expect the debate about the fed decision-making to remain in place. Because we list contracts up to 10 years, one of the nice things for us is we benefit financially prior to the actual first increase and beyond. Within treasuries, we are seeing increased volatility in market events recently. In January, treasury futures were up 25% and treasury options were up 31%. Activity that is clearly hinged to both domestic and global events has us interconnected. 
Lastly, we are working to leverage our connectivity and relationships with credit trading clients' increased activity in our credit default swap business. During Q4, our revenue exceeded $1 million for the first time and was up 67% sequentially as we achieve the highest revenue market share yet. While the current revenue is fairly small, this is worth watching in 2015 as we expand our offerings. 
Turning to FX. We had a challenging time during the first 8 months of 2014 due to extremely low volatility and turmoil in the cash FX market. Volumes averaged around 700,000 per day during that time. From September to December, we averaged 1 million per day, up 36% versus the prior year as volatility returned to normalized levels. In January, our FX business rose more than 20% from the prior year. Our expectation is that market participants will continue to be drawn to the deep liquidity we have in FX and the safety and soundness of a cleared market. Our trading and clearing processes function very smoothly during this event that occurred a few weeks ago. We are pleased that we are new record open interest and continue to grow a number of large open interest holders, which are in a high trading volatility environment should support our volume growth. We have seen it pick up in our energy business, and our market share grew during the year in natural gas and crude oil. 
Volatility hit an all-time low in energy in the second and third quarters last year, and we have seen outsized activity and that has changed. WTI prices were range bound between $80 and $105 for a few years, and we have clearly rebased, which very few experts projected last June. Volatility now is back near historical norms. And as we know, these markets are difficult to predict. Our team is heavily engaged with energy customers about our full suite of products and the unique possibilities in the marketplace. We are increasingly focused on the European energy markets where a large percentage of the business remains uncleared. 
As you all know, innovation has been a hallmark of our exchange, and we are certainly not slowed down on that front. Recently, we calculated the volume and revenue from products launched since closing our mergers. In total, since 2010, we have driven 450 million new contracts traded and $380 million of incremental revenue from these products. Over the last quarter, we have announced many of the new product expansions, including Palm oil swamps, iron ore futures, European natural gas, kilo gold futures and physically settled coco futures in Europe. We're working as closely as ever with both domestic and non-U.S.-based client I've mentioned, and they are looking for more alternatives from us. In particular, our new European natural gas activity has exceeded our oil expectation during the first 2 weeks of trading, driven by commercial use of participation. 
Finally, we made some important decisions in October to right size our company and to reorganize our structure. The new accountability and structure has worked well and will help us we execute our goals in 2015 and beyond. We are completely focused on efficiency throughout the organization and meeting the demands of our customers in practically any environment. Our focus is on driving operating margins, earnings and free cash flow higher, which is currently how our competition targets are set throughout the firm. 
I thank my colleagues for their significant effort and engagement. With that, let me turn the call over to John to discuss the financials."
2004577,279352678,756206,"CME Group Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with how we finished 2014 with a strong fourth quarter performance. We continue to demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our business model. Looking at the adjusted results, rev",1565,"Thank you, Gill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with how we finished 2014 with a strong fourth quarter performance. We continue to demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our business model. 
Looking at the adjusted results, revenue increased by $154 million or 22% compared to Q4 last year. And expenses increased less than 1%. Most importantly, our adjusted earnings per share rose more than 50%. 
Now I'll turn to some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q4 was $0.731, up from $0.725 last quarter despite higher volume. The main driver for the increase was a shift in the product mix with an increased proportion of total volume from higher price commodity products. 
OTC swaps revenue totaled $18 million for the quarter, up 16% versus last quarter. In Q4, we captured $148 for our OTC trade due to positive customer mix shifts this quarter. We cleared approximately 1,780 trades per day in the quarter, up from prior quarters. In January, that has jumped to more than 2,000 per day. Market data revenue is up 17% versus Q4 last year, driven primarily by our pricing change, but also bolstered by new paying customers. 
Lastly, other revenues is up sequentially, driven by approximately $3 million related to platform development with our partners in Brazil. Also, we had higher compliance compared to the prior quarter, which was offset in other expense. 
Adjusted expenses in Q4 were $341 million, close to Q4 last year when we had elevated technology-related cost. Based on the very strong volume in Q4 and higher-than-expected revenue, our license fees and volumes grew more than we projected during the last call. Total compensation was down $2 million sequentially despite the higher bonus, driven by staff reductions. At the end of Q3, we had 2,825 employees and we ended the year and approximately 2,685, which is down approximately 5%. 
Turning to taxes. The effective rate for the year ended at about 37% on a pro forma basis, down from last year's 37.6%, with the effective tax rate for this quarter of approximately 36.4%. 
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, we had more than $1,550,000,000 in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. In January, we paid out $671 million in our variable dividend of $2 per share. Following the dividend payout and the impact of strong fourth quarter, as well as cash flow timing, we start the rate approximately $880 million of cash. We are extremely focused on providing a significant return of capital to our shareholders including our recently announced 6% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. 
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $42 million. And for the year, we came in at $138 million. This is below guidance provided last quarter and the difference is driven largely by a shift in real estate-related timing. 
Now I'd like to turn to our forward guidance for 2015. As you know, we don't provide volume or revenue projections. We said last quarter that we would go through our budgeting process and that we expect it to be able to keep expenses flat in 2015. After a thorough review, our expense guidance for 2015 is flat at $1.31 billion. Based on the fact that variable expenses increases, transaction fees grow. We will be extremely focused on our discretionary and fixed infrastructure expenses to support this guidance at higher revenue levels that we saw in 2014. 
I'll provide some assistance in terms of the expense line items. Compensation is likely to be higher in 2015 as normal merit promotion increases and some selective hiring more than offset the reduction from our October announcement. Our bonus at the target level in 2015 is approximately $70 million, which is similar to the actual payout this year with obviously higher targets. As information, the ceiling on the bonus is $105 million, and we would have to exceed our cash earnings target by 20% to reach that level. 
Turning to the license fee line, there are 3 products that contribute virtually to all of the expense. The largest impact is in our equity business where we have our professional and index joint venture, so as that business line changes, the payout will fluctuate. We capture approximately 7% of this in nonoperating income and expense due to ownership stake in the joint venture. The other 2 product areas which drive licensees are energy based on clear port broker incentives and our interest rate swaps revenue share with founding members. Volume in our core interest rates, FX, tags and metals futures products have very little impact on the slide. This means our license fees, as a percentage of transaction fees, is impacted by product mix. For example, in 2014, the ratio range from 4% when interest rate volumes dominated in Q3, and that jumped to 4.8% in Q4 when we saw surge in equities and energy volumes altered mix. 
In addition, in 2015, we plan to reduce marketing and other expenses by approximately $10 million. I know it is difficult for you to triangulate where our expenses would be at various levels. The management team is very focused on delivering expenses at $1.31 billion in 2015, and we all realized that variable expenses may be impacted at different revenue levels. We will do our best to reduce costs without impacting our growth plans if volume grow significantly. The bottom line is that if our expenses end up being materially higher than our guidance due the variable expenses because our revenue is so high, I will be happy and I suspect our shareholders will be too. 
One final point on expenses. We have traditionally guided to mid-single digit expense growth for the company, and we were at that level during the last few years even as we invested in new growth areas. With much of the infrastructure in place now, we are revising our expense outlook to low- to mid-single digit range for the next few years. We will methodically look at our business to drive efficiencies. An example of that is the announcement last night concerning the closure of most of our futures pits and 2 of our options pits, which we anticipate completing in July. As a result, we will reduce annual expense by approximately $10 million. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million in 2015, in line with where we have been the last few years, and that includes some of the real estate carryover from last year. 
Our tax rate is expected to be 37% assuming no change in no income tax laws or any corporate tax changes at the federal level. 
In terms of market data, we are working with our intermediaries to help them appropriately categorize subscriber usage, and we will complete our first billing process in late February for those that operated under our announced expired market data, electronic training waver. Therefore, we will provide more color on the expected financial impact of the change on our Q1 earnings call. 
As a reminder, beginning in January 2015, we started to charge 50% of our monthly rate per screen to previously waived professional subscribers, which equates to $42.50 per month per CME group exchange. We have been working closely with our client base and provided a market a 2-plus year transition period before charging the full rate, which will take effect in January 2016. At that point, we will be in  line with other exchanges that eliminated the market data waiver several years ago. For now, the consensus estimate of $375 million of market data revenues in appropriate placeholder. I look forward to providing you more clarity in a few months. 
Finally, we adjusted transaction fee pricing across all 6 products in a targeted way, which went into effect earlier this week. We expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 1.5% assuming the same mix levels in 2015 and the largest percentage change will be in interest rates, primarily in treasuries. 
Now for a brief comment concerning our transaction with GFI. As you saw, CME and GFI mutually terminated our merger agreement. The battle unfolded over the last few months is over the IDB business and was not our fight, which led to our decision to ultimately take a step back from the transaction. However, we still have an agreement with GPI, GFI's largest shareholder, that limits their ability to sell their shares or vote their shares for alternate transactions for 12 months. 
Looking forward, we have been a part of the trade platform for sometime, and we have a long-term commercial agreement with Trayport. We will continue to build our energy business through the platform. As Gill mentioned, we recently launched European natural gas products, which are off to a good start. Activity in January continue to be robust. We averaged more than 15.6 million contracts per day for the month, up more than 20%. Similar to Q4, we saw strength across the Board with all product areas up double digits and outperforming other multi-asset class derivatives exchanges. 
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue  if you have further questions. Thank you."

I think another thing that has added to the complement in the tremendous growth and interest rates is the uncertainty of what's happening in the marketplace in general. And by us having that full breadth of the yield curve, you're seeing a nice capability for the marketplace to be able to buildup in terms of their expectations and in closer to the front end of the curve. If you recall, a couple of years back, we were really building up in the back 32 months of euro dollars and we've done a lot to build that activity, create open interest and volume has occurred in respect to that.

I'm very pleased with our team's efforts and our performance during 2014. Further, the Q4 results we are going to talk about today were outstanding, and I'm proud of our staff for their hard work during some pretty difficult times. During the fourth quarter, our ADV reached almost 15 million contracts, up more than 30%, and it is our second highest volume quarter in our history during a normally slow time of the year. We saw significant growth in every product area ranging from 14% growth in mad, [ph] metals, to 41% growth in interest rates. Record options ADV increased 38%, and futures rose 29%. Q4 revenue of $841 million was the second highest we have ever had. Most importantly, our earnings per share on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was up more than 50%. 
Over the last 3 to 4 years, we have been investing organically in a very targeted way to broaden our global reach and to drive more core volume growth as trading conditions improve. I've spoken about this on every earnings call since I became CEO, and we are making progress. 
During the quarter, we created 3 million contracts per day from outside the United States, by far, the highest level we've ever seen. Revenue from outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 30% of our global revenue and 24% of the volume. Our liquidity is building around the clock. You certainly saw that on our record day in October, when a much higher proportion traded from outside the U.S. than an average day. 
Fourth quarter electronic ADV from European clients was 2.4 million contracts, up 45% on a year-over-year basis, outperforming North America, which rose 31%. 
In Europe, we saw growth of 61% year-over-year in our interest rate business, and 32% growth in equities during the quarter. 
About 3 years ago, we made a concerted effort to reach out to educate European clients about the products suite client-by-client. In 2014, we spent considerable time talking to these clients about our OTC rates offering and marketing how Eurodollars, treasuries and other products can be utilized. We also pointed that the interest rate curve was more dynamic in the U.S. and provided more opportunity for them than other alternatives. Based on our efforts and market conditions, both hedges and speculators from this region have ramped up the activity in our markets. The portion of our interest rate swap business coming from outside the U.S. is increasing, particularly from European-based clients.  This is surprising since the European mandate for clearing is still several quarters away. We have successfully transitioned some businesses from these clients into futures driven by superior capital efficiency relative to swaps. 
In Asia, our volumes rose 51% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Our equities volume grew 96%, energy jumped 56% and the interest rates were up 54%. In Asia, in our review, we are at very early stages in terms of awareness and education and, ultimately, the conversion of new clients. Many of our client meetings are about expanding the full breadth of our product offering and when we make progress,  the discussion turns to connectivity through our training platform and establishing clearing relationships. Once we successfully engage, the ongoing trading activity tends to be fairly sticky. Based on the way we are at this point and the large number of potential clients, I anticipate this region will be the fastest-growing area for CME Group over the next 3 to 5 years. 
I will now shift to talking about a few of our product areas, starting with rate, futures, options and cleared swaps. Our OTC efforts continued to progress in the fourth quarter. We had the highest clearing revenue to date in Q4, which John will touch upon. In interest rates swaps, during 2014, we only took our competitor in D-to-C dollar-based clearing, moving from 32% market share in 2013 to 49% in 2014, including 55% in the fourth quarter. We recently had picked up market share as well in nondollar swap clearing, which you can see on Slide 9. 
In addition to significant customer engagement, our unique portfolio managing value proposition is clearly drawing more U.S. and European clients our platform. As an update, we are now up to 36 firms utilizing portfolio margining, double the 17 we had at the end of 2013. We are currently providing $3.9 billion of savings versus $1 billion at the end of 2013. We added 2 additional FCMs, who are live with our clients and increasing the total to 9 FCMs. Trade count market share, which is most closely tied to revenue, jumped from 47% from 2013 to 51% in Q4 2014. 
Lastly, we are currently at 64% of the open interest in terms of the global OTC clearing houses. We continue to market our interest rate futures and options to our more than 500 OTC clearing customers. Clearly, this is one of the drivers of our 40-plus percent growth in rates volume during Q4 and almost 20% growth in 2014. Comparatively, the 6 businesses of banks, European rate, volumes and cash treasury volumes were all under pressure. 
I wanted to share a couple of updates on statistics that we follow very closely. Large open interest holders in rates jumped by 15% during 2014 to 1,615 firms spread over our rate futures complex. About half of this increase was in our Eurodollars, 2-year treasuries and Fed fund contracts, so we are seeing more focus on the front end now. 
Our treasury futures national volume was as a percent of reported cash treasuries jumped to 75% for full year, up from 67% in 2013. 
Lastly, block volumes are up 80% in 2014 for rate products, outperforming other venues. This is an indicator of large participants' entry on markets and using futures for OTC start trading. 
Our focus is to continue to aggressively draw attention to the advantages of our products, and I would expect the debate about the fed decision-making to remain in place. Because we list contracts up to 10 years, one of the nice things for us is we benefit financially prior to the actual first increase and then beyond. Within treasuries, we have seen an increased volatility in market events recently. In January, treasury futures were up 25% and treasury options were up 31%. Activity that is clearly hinged to both domestic and global events has us interconnected. 
Lastly, we are working to leverage our connectivity and relationships with credit trading clients to increase activity in our credit default swap business. During Q4, our revenue exceeded $1 million for the first time and was up 67% sequentially, as we achieved the highest revenue market share yet. While the current revenue is fairly small, this is worth watching in 2015 as we expand our offerings. 
Turning to FX. We had a challenging time during the first 8 months of 2014, with extremely low volatility and turmoil in the cash FX market. Volumes averaged around 700,000 per day during that time. From September to December, we averaged 1 million per day, up 36% versus the prior year, as volatility returned to normalized levels. In January, our FX business rose more than 20% from the prior year. Our expectation is that market participants will continue to be drawn to the deep liquidity we have in FX and the safety and soundness of a cleared market. Our trading and clearing processes function very smoothly during the Swiss Franc event that occurred a few weeks ago. We are pleased that we are at near-record open interest and continue to grow the number of large open interest holders, which in a higher-trending volatility environment should support our volume growth. We have seen a pick up in our energy business, and our market share grew during the year in natural gas and crude oil. 
Volatility hit an all-time low in energy in the second and third quarters last year, and we have seen outsized activity and that has changed. WTI prices were range-bound between $80 and $105 for a few years, and we have clearly rebased, which very few experts projected last June. Volatility now is back near historical norms. And as we know, these markets are difficult to predict. Our team is heavily engaged with energy customers about our full suite of products and the unique possibilities in the marketplace. We are increasingly focused on the European energy markets, where a large percentage of the business remains uncleared. 
As you all know, innovation has been a hallmark of our exchange, and we have certainly not slowed down on that front. Recently, we calculated the volume and revenue from products launched since closing our mergers. In total, since 2010, we have driven 450 million new contracts traded and $380 million of incremental revenue from these products. Over the last quarter, we have announced many of the new product expansions, including Palm oil swamps, iron ore futures, European natural gas, kilo gold futures and physically settled coco futures in Europe. We are working as closely as ever with both domestic and non-U.S.-based clients, I'd mentioned, and they are looking for more alternatives from us. In particular, our new European natural gas activity has exceeded our oil expectation during the first few weeks of trading, driven by commercial use of participation. 
Finally, we made some important decisions in October to right size our company and to reorganize our structure. The new accountability and structure has worked well and will help as we execute our goals in 2015 and beyond. We are completely focused on efficiency throughout the organization and meeting the demands of our customers in practically any environment. Our focus is on driving operating margins, earnings and free cash flow higher, which is currently how our compensation targets are set throughout the firm.  I thank my colleagues for their significant effort and engagement. 
With that, let me turn the call over to John Pietrowicz to discuss the financials."
2004577,279352678,756486,"CME Group Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with how we finished 2014 with a strong fourth quarter performance. We continued to demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our business model. Looking at the adjusted results, re",1540,"Thank you, Gill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with how we finished 2014 with a strong fourth quarter performance. We continued to demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our business model. 
Looking at the adjusted results, revenue increased by $154 million or 22% compared to Q4 last year, and expenses increased less than 1%. Most importantly, our adjusted earnings per share rose more than 50%. 
Now I'll turn to some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q4 was $0.731, up from $0.725 last quarter despite higher volume. The main driver for the increase was a shift in the product mix, with an increased proportion of total volume from higher price commodity products. 
OTC swaps revenue totaled $18 million for the quarter, up 16% versus last quarter. In Q4, we captured $148 for our OTC trade due to positive customer mix shifts this quarter. We cleared approximately 1,780 trades per day in the quarter, up from prior quarters. In January, that has jumped to more than 2,000 per day. Market data revenue is up 17% versus Q4 last year, driven primarily by our pricing change, but also bolstered by new paying customers. 
Lastly, other revenues is up sequentially, driven by approximately $3 million related to platform development with our partners in Brazil. Also, we had higher compliance finds compared to the prior quarter, which was offset in other expense. 
Adjusted expenses in Q4 were $341 million, close to Q4 last year when we had elevated technology-related costs. Based on the very strong volume in Q4 and higher-than-expected revenue, our license fees and bonus grew more than we projected during the last call. Total compensation was down $2 million sequentially despite the higher bonus, driven by recent staff reductions. At the end of Q3, we had 2,825 employees and we ended the year at approximately 2,685, which is down approximately 5%. 
Turning to taxes. The effective rate for the year ended at about 37% on a pro forma basis, down from last year's 37.6%, with the effective tax rate for this quarter of approximately 36.4%. 
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, we had more than $1,550,000,000 in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. In January, we paid out $671 million in our variable dividend of $2 per share. Following the dividend payout and the impact of strong fourth quarter as well as cash flow timing, we started the rate approximately $880 million of cash. We are extremely focused on providing a significant return of capital to our shareholders, including our recently announced 6% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. 
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $42 million, and for the year, we came in at $138 million. This is below guidance provided the last quarter and the difference is driven largely by a shift in real estate-related timing. 
Now I'd like to turn to our forward guidance for 2015. As you know, we don't provide volume or revenue projections. We said last quarter that we would go through our budgeting process and that we expect it to be able to keep expenses flat in 2015. After a thorough review, our expense guidance for 2015 is flat at $1.31 billion. Based on the fact that variable expenses increase as transaction fees grow, we will be extremely focused on our discretionary and fixed infrastructure expenses to support this guidance at higher revenue levels than we saw in 2014. 
I'll provide some assistance in terms of the expense line items. Compensation is likely to be higher in 2015 as normal merit promotion increases and some selective hiring more than offset the reduction from our October announcement. Our bonus at the target level in 2015 is approximately $70 million, which is similar to the actual payout this year, with obviously higher targets. As information, the ceiling on the bonus is $105 million, and we would have to exceed our cash earnings target by 20% to reach that level. 
Turning to the license fee line, there are 3 product groups that contribute to virtually all of the expense. The largest impact is in our equity business, where we had our professional and index joint venture, so as that business line changes, the payout will fluctuate. We capture approximately 7% of this in nonoperating income and expense due to our ownership stake in the joint venture. The other 2 product areas which drive licensees are energy, based on ClearPort broker incentives and our interest rate swaps revenue share with founding members. Volume in our core interest rates, FX, ags and metals futures products have very little impact on this line. This means our license fees as a percentage of transaction fees, is impacted by product mix. For example, in 2014, the ratio ranged from 4%, when interest rate volumes dominated in Q3, and that jumped to 4.8% in Q4 when we saw surge in equities and energy volumes altered the mix. 
In addition, in 2015, we plan to reduce marketing and other expenses by approximately $10 million. I know it is difficult for you to triangulate where our expenses would be at various revenue levels. The management team is very focused on delivering expenses at $1.31 billion in 2015, and we all realized that variable expenses may be impacted at different revenue levels. We will do our best to reduce costs without impacting our growth plans, if volume grows significantly. The bottom line is that if our expenses end up being materially higher than our guidance due the variable expenses because our revenue is so high, I will be happy, and I suspect our shareholders will be too. 
One final point on expenses. We have traditionally guided to mid-single digit expense growth for the company, and we were at that level during the last few years even as we invested in new growth areas. With much of the infrastructure in place now, we are revising our expense outlook to low- to mid-single digit range for the next few years. We will methodically look at our business to drive efficiencies. An example of that is the announcement last night concerning the closure of most of our futures pits and 2 of our options pits, which we anticipate completing in July. As a result, we will reduce annual expense by approximately $10 million. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million in 2015, in line with where we have been the last few years, and that includes some of the real estate carryover from last year. 
Our tax rate is expected to be 37%, assuming no change in known income tax laws or any corporate tax changes at the federal level. 
In terms of market data, we are working with our intermediaries to help them appropriately categorize subscriber usage, and we will complete our first billing process in late February for those that operated under our now expired market data, electronic trading waiver. Therefore, we will provide more color on the expected financial impact of the change on our Q1 earnings call. 
As a reminder, beginning in January 2015, we started to charge 50% of our monthly rate per screen to previously waived professional subscribers, which equates to $42.50 per month per CME group exchange. We have been working closely with our client base, and provided the market a 2-plus year transition period before charging the full rate, which will take effect in January 2016. At that point, we will be in  line with other exchanges that eliminated the market data waiver several years ago. For now, the consensus estimate of $375 million of market data revenues in appropriate placeholder. I look forward to providing you more clarity in a few months. 
Finally, we adjusted transaction fee pricing across all 6 products in a targeted way, which went into effect earlier this week. We expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 1.5%, assuming the same mix levels in 2015, and the largest percentage change will be in interest rates, primarily in treasuries. 
Now for a brief comment concerning our transaction with GFI. As you saw, CME and GFI mutually terminated our merger agreement. The battle that unfolded over the last few months was over the IDB business and was not our fight, which led to our decision to ultimately take a step back from the transaction. However, we will still have an agreement with JPI, GFI's largest shareholder, that limits their ability to sell their shares or vote their shares for an alternative transaction for 12 months. 
Looking forward, we have been a part of the Trayport platform for sometime, and we have a long-term commercial agreement with Trayport. We will continue to build our energy business through the platform. As Gill mentioned, we recently launched European natural gas products, which are off to a good start. Activity in January continued to be robust. We averaged more than 15.6 million contracts per day for the month, up more than 20%. Similar to Q4, we saw strength across the board, with all product areas up double digits and outperforming other multi-asset class derivatives exchanges. 
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

I think another thing that has added to the complement in the tremendous growth in interest rates is the uncertainty of what's happening in the marketplace in general. And by us having that full breadth of the yield curve, you're seeing a nice capability for the marketplace to be able to build up, in terms of their expectations and closer to the front end of the curve. If you recall, a couple of years back, we were really building up in the back 32 months of Eurodollars, and we've done a lot to build that activity, create open interest; and volume has occurred in respect to that.

What's interesting to note among the papers is they make a note that is not a -- they're not taking a fact-based approach. And the entire approach, as to the cheapness of ETFs, seems to be driven by the cost of heavy, which is embedded in futures. And so -- and on an apples-to-apples basis -- I believe it's at Goldman, and analysts will point out that S&P E-minis are still a far more efficient product than the ETF. So now I bring everybody back some years ago, and both JPMorgan as well as Goldman Sachs issued some papers to their clients talking about why, on a fact basis, ETFs are more expensive than futures. Those facts have not changed. And so we are in the process of educating our clients or, in some cases, reeducating our clients, with respect to all of the facts. And case in point, we have been -- we are up 20% this year, itself, on the S&P, and we had a very high growth rate last, last year.

I'm very pleased with our team's efforts and our performance during 2014. Further, the Q4 results we are going to talk about today were outstanding, and I'm proud of our staff for their hard work during some pretty difficult times. During the fourth quarter, our ADV reached almost 15 million contracts, up more than 30%, and it is our second highest volume quarter in our history during a normally slow time of the year. We saw significant growth in every product area, ranging from 14% growth in metals to 41% growth in interest rates. Record options ADV increased 38%, and futures rose 29%. Q4 revenue of $841 million was the second highest we have ever had. Most importantly, our earnings per share on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was up more than 50%. 
Over the last 3 to 4 years, we have been investing organically in a very targeted way to broaden our global reach and to drive more core volume growth as trading conditions improve. I've spoken about this on every earnings call since I became CEO, and we are making progress. 
During the quarter, we traded 3 million contracts per day from outside the United States, by far, the highest level we've ever seen. Revenue from outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 30% of our Globex revenue and 24% of the volume. Our liquidity is building around the clock. You certainly saw that on our record day in October, when a much higher proportion traded from outside the U.S. than an average day. 
Fourth quarter electronic ADV from European clients was 2.4 million contracts, up 45% on a year-over-year basis, outperforming North America, which rose 31%. 
In Europe, we saw growth of 61% year-over-year in our interest rate business, and 32% growth in equities during the quarter. 
About 3 years ago, we made a concerted effort to reach out to educate European clients about the product suite client-by-client. In 2014, we spent considerable time talking to these clients about our OTC rates offering and marketing how our Eurodollars, treasuries and other products can be utilized. We also pointed that the interest rate curve was more dynamic in the U.S. and provided more opportunity for them than other alternatives. Based on our efforts and market conditions, both hedgers and speculators from this region have ramped up the activity in our markets. The portion of our interest rate swap business coming from outside the U.S. is increasing, particularly from European-based clients.  This is surprising since the European mandate for clearing is still several quarters away. We have successfully transitioned some businesses from these clients into futures, driven by superior capital efficiency relative to swaps. 
In Asia, our volumes rose 51% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Our equities volume grew 96%, energy jumped 56% and the interest rates were up 54%. In Asia, in our view, we are at very early stages in terms of awareness and education and, ultimately, the conversion of new clients. Many of our client meetings are about expanding the full breadth of our product offering and when we make progress, the discussion turns to connectivity through our training platform and establishing clearing relationships. Once we successfully engage, the ongoing trading activity tends to be fairly sticky. Based on where we are at this point and the large number of potential clients, I anticipate this region will be the fastest-growing area for CME Group over the next 3 to 5 years. 
I will now shift to talking about a few of our product areas, starting with rate futures, options and cleared swaps. Our OTC efforts continued to progress in the fourth quarter. We had the highest clearing revenue to date in Q4, which John will touch upon. In interest rates swaps, during 2014, we overtook our competitor in D2C dollar-based clearing, moving from 32% market share in 2013 to 49% in 2014, including 55% in the fourth quarter. We recently have picked up market share as well in nondollar swap clearing, which you can see on Slide 9. 
In addition to significant customer engagement, our unique portfolio margining value proposition is clearly drawing more U.S. and European clients our platform. As an update, we are now up to 36 firms utilizing portfolio margining, double the 17 we had at the end of 2013. We are currently providing $3.9 billion of savings versus $1 billion at the end of 2013. We added 2 additional FCMs who are live with our clients and increasing the total to 9 FCMs. Trade count market share, which is most closely tied to revenue, jumped from 47% from 2013 to 51% in Q4 2014. 
Lastly, we are currently at 64% of the open interest in terms of the global OTC clearing houses. We continue to market our interest rate futures and options to our more than 500 OTC clearing customers. Clearly, this is one of the drivers of our 40-plus percent growth in rates volume during Q4 and almost 20% growth in 2014. Comparatively, the FICC businesses at banks, European rates, volumes and cash treasury volumes were all under pressure. 
I wanted to share a couple of updates on statistics that we follow very closely. Large open interest holders in rates jumped by 15% during 2014 to 1,615 firms spread over our rate futures complex. About half of this increase was in our Eurodollars, 2-year treasuries and Fed fund contracts, so we are seeing more focus on the front end now. 
Our treasury futures notional volume was -- as a percent of reported cash treasuries jumped to 75% for full year, up from 67% in 2013. 
Lastly, block volumes are up 80% in 2014 for rate products, outperforming other venues. This is an indicator of large participants entering our markets and using futures for OTCs now trading. 
Our focus is to continue to aggressively draw attention to the advantages of our products, and I would expect the debate about the Fed decision-making to remain in place. Because we list contracts up to 10 years, one of the nice things for us is we benefit financially prior to the actual first increase and then beyond. Within treasuries, we have seen an increased volatility in market events recently. In January, treasury futures were up 25% and treasury options were up 31%. Activity that is clearly hinged to both domestic and global events has us interconnected. 
Lastly, we are working to leverage our connectivity and relationships with credit trading clients to increase activity in our credit default swap business. During Q4, our revenue exceeded $1 million for the first time and was up 67% sequentially, as we achieved the highest revenue market share yet. While the current revenue is fairly small, this is worth watching in 2015 as we expand our offerings. 
Turning to FX. We had a challenging time during the first 8 months of 2014, with extremely low volatility and turmoil in the cash FX market. Volumes averaged around 700,000 per day during that time. From September to December, we averaged 1 million per day, up 36% versus the prior year as volatility returned to normalized levels. In January, our FX business rose more than 20% from the prior year. Our expectation is that market participants will continue to be drawn to the deep liquidity we have in FX and the safety and soundness of a cleared market. Our trading and clearing processes functioned very smoothly during the Swiss Franc event that occurred a few weeks ago. We are pleased that we are at near-record open interest and continue to grow the number of large open-interest holders, which in a higher-trending volatility environment should support our volume growth. We have seen a pick-up in our energy business, and our market share grew during the year in natural gas and crude oil. 
Volatility hit an all-time low in energy in the second and third quarters last year, and we have seen outsized activity as that has changed. WTI prices were range-bound between $80 and $105 for a few years, and we have clearly rebased, which very few experts projected last June. Volatility now is back near historical norms. And as we know, these markets are difficult to predict. Our team is heavily engaged with energy customers about our full suite of products and the unique possibilities in the marketplace. We are increasingly focused on the European energy markets, where a large percentage of the business remains uncleared. 
As you all know, innovation has been a hallmark of our exchange, and we have certainly not slowed down on that front. Recently, we calculated the volume and revenue from products launched since closing our mergers. In total, since 2010, we have driven 450 million new contracts traded and $380 million of incremental revenue from these products. Over the last quarter, we have announced many other new product expansions, including palm oil swamps, iron ore futures, European natural gas, kilo gold futures and physically settled cocoa futures in Europe. We are working as closely as ever with both domestic and non-U.S.-based clients I mentioned, and they are looking for more alternatives from us. In particular, our new European natural gas activity has exceeded our oil expectation during the first few weeks of trading, driven by commercial user participation. 
Finally, we made some important decisions in October to rightsize our company and to reorganize our structure. The new accountability and structure has worked well and will help as we execute our goals in 2015 and beyond. We are completely focused on efficiency throughout the organization and meeting the demands of our customers in practically any environment. Our focus is on driving operating margins, earnings and free cash flow higher, which is currently how our compensation targets are set throughout the firm.  I thank my colleagues for their significant effort and engagement. 
With that, let me turn the call over to John Pietrowicz to discuss the financials."
2004577,279352678,756567,"CME Group Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with how we finished 2014 with a strong fourth quarter performance. We continued to demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our business model. Looking at the adjusted results, re",1543,"Thank you, Gill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with how we finished 2014 with a strong fourth quarter performance. We continued to demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our business model. 
Looking at the adjusted results, revenue increased by $154 million or 22% compared to Q4 last year, and expenses increased less than 1%. Most importantly, our adjusted earnings per share rose more than 50%. 
Now I'll turn to some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q4 was $0.731, up from $0.725 last quarter despite higher volume. The main driver for the increase was a shift in the product mix, with an increased proportion of total volume from higher-priced commodity products. 
OTC swaps revenue totaled $18 million for the quarter, up 16% versus last quarter. In Q4, we captured $148 per IRS OTC trade due to positive customer mix shifts this quarter. We cleared approximately 1,780 trades per day in the quarter, up from prior quarters. In January, that has jumped to more than 2,000 per day. Market data revenue is up 17% versus Q4 last year, driven primarily by our pricing change, but also bolstered by new paying customers. 
Lastly, other revenues is up sequentially, driven by approximately $3 million related to platform development with our partners in Brazil. Also, we had higher compliance fines compared to the prior quarter, which was offset in other expense. 
Adjusted expenses in Q4 were $341 million, close to Q4 last year when we had elevated technology-related costs. Based on the very strong volume in Q4 and higher-than-expected revenue, our license fees and bonus grew more than we projected during the last call. Total compensation was down $2 million sequentially despite the higher bonus, driven by recent staff reductions. At the end of Q3, we had 2,825 employees and we ended the year at approximately 2,685, which is down approximately 5%. 
Turning to taxes. The effective rate for the year ended at about 37% on a pro forma basis, down from last year's 37.6%, with the effective tax rate for this quarter of approximately 36.4%. 
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, we had more than $1,550,000,000 in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. In January, we paid out $671 million in our variable dividend of $2 per share. Following the dividend payout and the impact of strong fourth quarter as well as cash flow timing, we started the year with approximately $880 million of cash. We are extremely focused on providing a significant return of capital to our shareholders, including our recently announced 6% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. 
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $42 million, and for the year, we came in at $138 million. This is below guidance provided the last quarter, and the difference was driven largely by a shift in real estate-related timing. 
Now I'd like to turn to our forward guidance for 2015. As you know, we don't provide volume or revenue projections. We said last quarter that we would go through our budgeting process and that we expected to be able to keep expenses flat in 2015. After a thorough review, our expense guidance for 2015 is flat at $1.31 billion. Based on the fact that variable expenses increase as transaction fees grow, we will be extremely focused on our discretionary and fixed infrastructure expenses to support this guidance at higher revenue levels than we saw in 2014. 
I'll provide some assistance in terms of the expense line items. Compensation is likely to be higher in 2015, as normal merit promotion increases and some selective hiring more than offset the reduction from our October announcement. Our bonus at the target level in 2015 is approximately $70 million, which is similar to the actual payout this year, with obviously higher targets. As information, the ceiling on the bonus is $105 million, and we would have to exceed our cash earnings target by 20% to reach that level. 
Turning to the license fee line, there are 3 product groups that contribute to virtually all of the expense. The largest impact is in our equity business, where we have a profit share with our indexed joint venture, so as that business line changes, the payout will fluctuate. We capture approximately 7% of this in nonoperating income and expense due to our ownership stake in the joint venture. The other 2 product areas which drive license fees are energy, based on ClearPort broker incentives; and our interest rate swaps revenue share with founding members. Volume in our core interest rates, FX, ags and metals futures products have very little impact on this line. This means our license fees as a percentage of transaction fees is impacted by product mix. For example, in 2014, the ratio ranged from 4%, when interest rate volumes dominated in Q3, and that jumped to 4.8% in Q4, when we saw a surge in equities and energy volumes alter the mix. 
In addition, in 2015, we plan to reduce marketing and other expenses by approximately $10 million. I know it is difficult for you to triangulate where our expenses would be at various revenue levels. The management team is very focused on delivering expenses at $1.31 billion in 2015, and we all realize that variable expenses may be impacted at different revenue levels. We will do our best to reduce costs without impacting our growth plans, if volume grows significantly. The bottom line is that if our expenses end up being materially higher than our guidance due the variable expenses because our revenue is so high, I will be happy, and I suspect our shareholders will be too. 
One final point on expenses. We have traditionally guided to mid-single-digit expense growth for the company, and we were at that level during the last few years, even as we invested in new growth areas. With much of the infrastructure in place now, we are revising our expense outlook to low- to mid-single digit range for the next few years. We will methodically look at our business to drive efficiencies. An example of that is the announcement last night concerning the closure of most of our futures pits and 2 of our options pits, which we anticipate completing in July. As a result, we will reduce annual expense by approximately $10 million. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million in 2015, in line with where we have been the last few years, and that includes some of the real estate carryover from last year. 
Our tax rate is expected to be 37%, assuming no change in Illinois income tax laws or any corporate tax changes at the federal level. 
In terms of market data, we are working with our intermediaries to help them appropriately categorize subscriber usage, and we will complete our first billing process in late February for those that operated under our now-expired market data electronic trading waiver. Therefore, we will provide more color on the expected financial impact of the change on our Q1 earnings call. 
As a reminder, beginning in January 2015, we started to charge 50% of our monthly rate per screen to previously waived professional subscribers, which equates to $42.50 per month per CME Group exchange. We have been working closely with our client base and provided the market a 2-plus year transition period before charging the full rate, which will take effect in January 2016. At that point, we will be in line with other exchanges that eliminated the market data waiver several years ago. For now, the consensus estimate of $375 million of market data revenue is an appropriate placeholder. I look forward to providing you more clarity in a few months. 
Finally, we adjusted transaction fee pricing across all 6 products in a targeted way, which went into effect earlier this week. We expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 1.5%, assuming the same mix levels in 2015, and the largest percentage change will be in interest rates, primarily in treasuries. 
Now for a brief comment concerning our transaction with GFI. As you saw, CME and GFI mutually terminated our merger agreement. The battle that unfolded over the last few months was over the IDB business and was not our fight, which led to our decision to ultimately take a step back from the transaction. However, we will still have an agreement with JPI, GFI's largest shareholder, that limits their ability to sell their shares or vote their shares for an alternative transaction for 12 months. 
Looking forward, we have been a part of the Trayport platform for some time, and we have a long-term commercial agreement with Trayport. We will continue to build our energy business through the platform. As Gill mentioned, we recently launched European natural gas products, which are off to a good start. Activity in January continued to be robust. We averaged more than 15.6 million contracts per day for the month, up more than 20%. Similar to Q4, we saw strength across the board, with all product areas up double digits and outperforming other multi-asset class derivatives exchanges. 
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

I think another thing that has added to the complement and the tremendous growth in interest rates is the uncertainty of what's happening in the marketplace in general. And by us having that full breadth of the yield curve, you're seeing a nice capability for the marketplace to be able to build up in terms of their expectations and closer to the front end of the curve. If you recall, a couple of years back, we were really building up in the back 32 months of Eurodollars, and we've done a lot to build that activity, create open interest, and volume has occurred in respect to that.

Niamh, the debate around skin in the game is certainly an interesting debate. We believe -- we're big believers in the importance of people who bring risk into the system putting up the skin in the game to cover that risk. So we're really a little bit troubled by the way the debate is being handled in the industry now. It seems to be defining skin in the game so very, very narrowly as just funds that the clearing house puts at the front of the waterfall. And if you think about the reason that the regulators pushed OTC clearing mandate after the crisis, it is for the very reason that clearing houses exist, to ensure that all participants who bring risk into the system appropriately pay for the risk that they bring. So the skin in the game that market users and the clearing members bring to cover the exposure that they bear is the most important element of the system and an issue that we're very, very focused on, managing the concentration risk. We encourage you all to actually look at our paper that we put out about this to help to kind of broaden out the debate."

What's interesting to note among the papers is they make a note that is not a -- they're not taking a fact-based approach. And the entire approach as to the cheapness of ETFs seems to be driven by the cost of carry, which is embedded in futures. And so on an apples-to-apples basis -- I believe it's a Goldman analyst who points out that S&P E-minis are still a far more efficient product than the ETF. So now I bring everybody back some years ago, when both JPMorgan as well as Goldman Sachs issued some papers to their clients talking about why, on a fact basis, ETFs are more expensive than futures. Those facts have not changed. And so we are in the process of educating our clients or, in some cases, reeducating our clients with respect to all of the facts. And case in point, we have been -- we are up 20% this year, itself, on the S&P, and we had a very high growth rate last year.

I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since the beginning of the year in terms of our growth initiatives and our volume relative to market conditions. Also our efforts on the expense side are clearly evident in our Q1 results and I applaud our team for their efforts.
During the first quarter, our ADV reached almost 15 million contracts, which is the second highest volume quarter in our history. We had record energy volume, up more than 20% and interest rates and FX volume each grew by more than 10%. Some notable quarterly records included overall options ADV of 2.8 million contracts as well as records in WTI and Brent crude, gasoline and heating oil products.
Energy volume has been very robust overall this year. We have had standout results with our WTI crude oil contracts relative to the other primary crude benchmark. Year-to-date, our WTI futures and WTI options are each up more than 60% and combined we have average 1.1 million contracts per day so far this year.
Turning to FX. Activity has been impressive and FX volumes averaged about 725,000 per day in the first half of last year. That number jumped to about 875,000 in the second half, and we saw almost 1.1 million contracts per day in March of this year. In April, we are trending up about 40% compared to last year. Certainly, you have heard about positive trends in the FX activity on several of the large banks earnings call. Open interest in FX continues to run at peak levels. With upcoming election in the U.K. and the ongoing debate about what the Fed will do, we expect to continue to see some interesting activity in our FX markets.
Moving on to our interest rate quadrant, after the strong first quarter, we have seen slowdown in activity since dovish sentiment from the Fed Meeting in mid-March, coupled with a normally slow April and Easter holiday period. Weaker economic data tends to push expectations of a Fed rate move further out, as evidenced and our fed funds futures markets, while making the ebb and flow of the rate decision debate even more dependent on upcoming economic data in the spring and summer months. Volatility in rate products have dropped in April, which you can see in the slides. We are fortunate that we have a very diverse product set, which is important when volume fluctuates like it does every year.
As I've mentioned last quarter, we are focused on 3 primary areas of organic growth, increased penetration of global clients, attractive flow from the swaps business through clearing and exchange-traded alternatives and diving options growth across the platform, which elevates futures volume as well.
Volumes from outside the U.S. continues to be impressive as we leverage our investments in global headcount, partnerships and product development. Our Q1 electronic trading volume out of Asia reached a record 570,000 contracts per day, up 22% from Q1 of last year. That was double the 10% growth we saw out of North America during the quarter. Energy volume led the way in terms of product line growth from Asia, followed by FX and equities, all up more than 40%. Clearly, Asian clients are comfortable trading and clearing directly with the U.S. base exchange.
Average daily volume from Europe grew by 14% to 2.3 million contracts, led by interest rates and energy products. In addition, I'm pleased to see our European exchange is starting to expand from small base. On April 10, we traded 10,000 contracts for the first time with contributions from FX, European national gas and cocoa.
Turning to our Swaps clearing. Positive momentum continued in Q1 and we are very pleased to have a leadership position here. We continue to push on the innovation front. Relative to the other major global clearing houses in rates, we were first with coupon blending, which offers capital and operational efficiencies in a capital and a resource constrained world. This significantly reduces the number of transactions and the notional outstanding required to maintain given portfolio. Already, customers have reduced over 100,000 line items and over $8 trillion in notional using the service. In addition, we are also working with TriOptima to offer multilateral compression for interest rate swaps for FCM house accounts.
We were also first logically so, with portfolio margining, facilitating individual client risk reduction by as much as 85%. Since the end of last year, the number of end clients utilizing this solution has more than doubled to 43 firms through 11 live clearing members. In December 2013, we expanded our offering to include clearing for Mexican peso swaps, making our IRS product scope the broadest available on any platform, with 18 currencies. We now have 37 clients voluntarily clearing these are Mexican peso swaps, including both dealer-to-dealer and dealer-to-client, and it is our fifth-largest currency. All of these efforts have helped us to gain market share in the plain Vanilla fixed versus floating swaps in both dollar and non-dollar currencies.
We continue to market our interest rate futures and options to over 500 CME OTC clearing customers. During the quarter, Greenwich Associates published a total transaction cost analysis comparing the cost of swaps versus futures. Based on the detailed analytics from the 42 clients surveyed, it showed that futures are nearly always the lowest-cost alternative. The Greenwich report is available on our website and we continue to educate market participants about this important comparison. Building on this, in March, we launched a new web tool in conjunction with ICAP and the Beast Apps called RapidRV. This robust offering provides over 15 different analytics that allow customers to explore relative value and comparative pricing of swaps, cash treasury markets and CME Group interest-rate futures. With real-time pricing feeds, customers are able to view side-by-side pricing analysis and opportunity assessment across fixed income products.
For some time now, we have provided updates on statistics that we follow very closely that are potential signs of OTC clients using futures. Many of you have asked for additional data points on this transition.
Last quarter, I mentioned our treasury features business reached a highest proportion ever of the cash treasury business at 75% of the size of the cash market. I'm pleased to say in March that number jumped 77%. One new piece of data can be found in the slide. We have analyze the activity of our top users of portfolio margining and we have futures trading growth rates almost twice that of the overall marketplace.
The third area of growth I want to touch on is our options business. We eclipsed our prior peak options volume from Q4 to set and new quarterly volume record in Q1. This was driven by continued investment in our options trading functionality and bolstered by specific sales and marketing campaigns to draw new customers to our options markets. We saw double-digit growth in interest rate, approximately 50% of our options businesses traded electronically with about 40% traded on the flow and the remainder via privately negotiated transactions.
In terms of our efforts to electronify options, we have made significant progress within Eurodollar options on Globex over the last year. The percentage of Eurodollar option volume traded on Globex has grown from 11% in 2013 to 13% in 2014, and almost to 20% in March and April of this year. This recent increase in electronic activity has been driven by growth from European participants trading in our overnight hours. In comparison, in our earnings slide deck, you can see how the electronification of treasury options, which are currently around 63%, has created meaningful growth. The reference slides illustrate the same trend across other product lines as well.
You can see the power of this transition, most significantly, perhaps in FX options where the average daily volume is up ninefold since 2009, powered by electronic trading. Additionally, we continue to successfully grow our energy options volumes on Globex with 41% of our total energy options trading in -- on Globex in Q1, up from just 28% in Q1 of last year. The point here is that options growth will drive activity in the futures markets too, since both these products are on the same platform and combination trades can be executed.
So overall, we have agonize start to the operator continue to focus on ways to expand the business, while driving productivity improvements throughout the organization.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financial. Thank you."

I'm pleased with our results this quarter with revenue up over 8% and expenses down 2% compared with Q1 last year, driving operating margins above 62% for the quarter. Our best result in the last few years. Adj",719,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter with revenue up over 8% and expenses down 2% compared with Q1 last year, driving operating margins above 62% for the quarter. Our best result in the last few years. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.98, up 18% for the quarter compared to a strong Q1 last year. We saw a nice performance in our core futures, OTC clearing and market data revenue. I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q1 was $0.753, up from $0.731 last quarter. The main driver of the increase was a shift in product mix, with an increased proportion of total volume coming from higher priced commodity products. Specifically, we saw an approximate 2% shift from equity to energy products. Our transaction fee increase went into effect in February, and we have 2 months at the higher level in the first-quarter RPC.
OTC swaps revenue totaled $20 million for the quarter, up 53% versus Q1 last year. During the first quarter, we captured $129 per IRS clear trade, which is consistent with what we've seen in the past, but down from Q4. We cleared approximately 2,370 trades per day in Q1, the highest level we have seen so far.
Market data revenue of $98 million was up 10% versus Q1 last year, driven primarily by the elevation of our fee waiver program, which we have discussed in the last few quarters. As a reminder, we began charging $42.50 per month for professional traders, who are grandfathered. And we also captured $6 per month on average per screen for nonprofessional traders. In Q1, we accrued for approximately 150,000 new screens, with approximately 1/3 of those at the higher professional level and 2/3 came in as nonprofessionals. It will likely take a few quarters to get to a steady state in terms of market data revenue, and we may seek a drop from those $98 million level this quarter as customers settle into the new pricing structure.
Adjusted expenses in Q1 were $317 million, down $8 million from Q1 last year. We are very focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization, and eliminating redundancy to improve agility and customer responsiveness. Virtually every expense category came down with the exception of Technology Services and volume-related license fees. At the same time, we continue to rollout significant number of new offerings, which Gill outlined.
At the end of Q1, we had 2,670 employees, down about 15 people from year end and down 90 relative to this point last year driven by our October restructuring.
Our compensation ratio for the quarter was 15.9%, down from more than 17% the last 2 years.
Turning to taxes, the effective date for the quarter was 36.6%.  And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $1.8 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, we issued a 10-year bound totaling $750 million at 3%, replacing debt that was going to mature in 2018. We also upsized our revolving credit facility from $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion. During Q1, our interest rate expense totaled $31 million, which was higher than Q4 primarily due to the double carry. We paid off the 2018 bond in April, and our quarterly run rate for interest expense will drop to approximately $29 million by the second half of the year.
If we adjust for the bond transaction completed on April 8, we had approximately $1.1 billion of total cash at the end of Q1. That leaves $400 million above the $700 million we target in terms of a minimum cash level. So far this year, we paid out over $800 million in total dividends.
During the first quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $27 million.
In summary, the first quarter of 2015 demonstrated the leveraging in our business model. The entire management team continues to focus on margin expansion with both top line growth and expense discipline.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question, so we can get to everyone. Please feel to get back into the queue if you have further questions. Thank you."

But I think the whole topic of equivalence has been taken very seriously by both sides. And I think the seems to be centered around margining, customer margining, which is 2-day net versus 1-day gross. And I think when you're talking about the topic of equivalence that will likely be a compromise. But I think, it's fundamentally, what said a few months ago, is the right point. U.S. is the global stand. The U.S. exchanges help create markets in London and all over the world. So some of the things that we have in place, if you're looking at the equivalence on a line-by-line basis, you have the U.S. for example, running full margin cycle twice a day. That does not happen in Europe. So if you're talking about margin period of risk, they are actually 2 margin periods of risk within a single day in the U.S. every single day. And that doesn't happen in Europe. And you cannot loan money in to our clients, that doesn't happen in Europe. You have to collect money from your clients, that doesn't happen in Europe. But the debate seems to be centered on margin itself. And the levels of margin on the client-side, which is the important side. On the client side in the U.S. on the gross margining basis, can be anywhere from 2x to 4x at large than it would be on the net basis. some noise that it might be roughly equivalent. Roughly equivalent is not true. It's 2x or more. So we expect the compromise, because we expect to make the same point that he made a few months ago. But I think just from of a factual base, there are a lot of differences there, the U.S. has fine-tuned their approach to customer protection far longer than anybody else."

If you look at the results between our energy complex versus their energy complex, I think up about 9% and about 23%, 24% or  so. In addition to kind of what we're seeing in world focusing on the TI side of the equation, we're also seeing outperformance of our options business. Our TI options both in volumes and OI is increasing which you're seeing on the Brent side of the equation. So when we're actually seeing its Our clients tend to move their main product and we're seeing actually Brent participation down relative to TI. So we think that continues to play out and we think that the participation in our markets as we globalize our customer base has been very positive for us And plus if you look back at the trading 95% of the days, TI trading is outpacing the volumes. They are trading on the highest Brent side. So we think that that will continue. And we think that's the story that is very positive for our franchises as a whole."

And with the portfolio margining, we saw a doubling actually the number of clients in Q1 using the portfolio margining versus a year-ago, now running 43 clients being facilitated by 11 FCMs. An interesting is not just having new participants enter our futures and options market with the big growth we've talked about before that we had over the last couple of years in large open interest holders, but in addition to that we see that the participants who are trading both in our futures and swaps and to take advantage of portfolio margining, their growth rates in our futures complex runs about double that of other participants.

While there is no publicly available information on that particular trait, we believe that particular trait probably runs on the order $80 billion a day or on the order of 800,000 contracts a day in our treasure features equivalent. At the moment, our EFRs in invoice spreads, so kind of the equivalent in interest rate futures plus cleared and straight swaps space relative to that swaps rate market remains a small fraction of the swaps market. We're running on the order of 60,000, 65,000 a day in our invoice spreads. So we continue to see a very large run way relative to that opportunity."

You've heard us point to the areas, in which we're making invest to participation in our options markets, investing in functionality to accommodate the more complex spreads, increasing our sales, marketing education and analytics tools, we're putting out there to bring more people to our people To answer your question, the reason that we feel so strong at the investments and options drives our core is that for every options they trade we think there is roughly between 2 and 2.5 futures the trait related to that option. Traditionally because there are number of participants that come in trade-offs neutral. They will hedge their position and options with our futures and then dynamically reestablish to maintain those hedges and change them as price goes on. Secondly, we are unique in every major asset class that Gill referenced. We have a referenced benchmark options business associated with that asset class. So we are bringing both the futures and options together, so we're dynamically bringing key participants to our markets. And finally, the growth in electronification as you've seen in the futures story, continues despite an increase the velocity of trading both in options and our futures. So you've seen these breakdowns in the desk, despite the fact we're about 49% to 50% electron. If you go inside these figures each one, you'll see that the treasury options on the following slide is close to 65% of electronic. Inside the energies business, you'll see our Brent options as close to 70% electronic. And net gas, which is in a different market structure state this is probably close to 5% or 10% electronic. So these investments we're making are both bringing new participants to us, put an unique value proposition for the future and the option hedge in the same clearinghouse for significant margin efficiencies and the electronification trends is a virtuous cycle of increased participation both on futures and options side."

I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since the beginning of the year in terms of our growth initiatives and our volume relative to market conditions. Also, our efforts on the expense side are clearly evident in our Q1 results and I applaud our team for their efforts.
During the first quarter, our ADV reached almost 15 million contracts, which is the second highest volume quarter in our history. We had record energy volume, up more than 20% and interest rates and FX volume each grew by more than 10%. Some notable quarterly records included overall options ADV of 2.8 million contracts as well as records in WTI and Brent crude, gasoline and heating oil products.
Energy volume has been very robust overall this year. We have had standout results with our WTI crude oil contracts relative to the other primary crude benchmark. Year-to-date, our WTI futures and WTI options are each up more than 60%. And combined, we have averaged 1.1 million contracts per day so far this year.
Turning to FX. Activity has been impressive and FX volumes averaged about 725,000 per day in the first half of last year. That number jumped to about 875,000 in the second half, and we saw almost 1.1 million contracts per day in March of this year. In April, we are trending up about 40% compared to last year. Certainly, you have heard about positive trends in the FX activity on several of the large banks' earnings calls. Open interest in FX continues to run at peak levels. With the upcoming election in the U.K. and the ongoing debate about what the Fed will do, we expect to continue to see some interesting activity in our FX markets.
Moving on to our interest rate quadrant. After a strong first quarter, we have seen a slowdown in activity since the dovish sentiment from the Fed meeting in mid-March, coupled with a normally slow April and Easter holiday period. Weaker economic data tends to push expectations of a Fed rate move further out, as evidenced in our Fed funds futures markets, while making the ebb and flow of the rate decision debate even more dependent on upcoming economic data in the spring and summer months. Volatility in rate products have dropped in April, which you can see in the slides. We are fortunate that we have a very diverse product set, which is important when volume fluctuates like it does every year.
As I've mentioned last quarter, we are focused on 3 primary areas of organic growth: increased penetration of global clients, attractive flow from the swaps business through clearing and exchange-traded alternatives and driving options growth across the platform, which elevates futures volume as well.
Volume from outside the U.S. continues to be impressive as we leverage our investments in global headcount, partnerships and product development. Our Q1 electronic trading volume out of Asia reached a record 570,000 contracts per day, up 22% from Q1 of last year. That was double the 10% growth we saw out of North America during the quarter. 
Energy volume led the way in terms of product line growth from Asia, followed by FX and equities, all up more than 40%. Clearly, Asian clients are comfortable trading and clearing directly with a U.S.-based exchange.
Average daily volume from Europe grew by 14% to 2.3 million contracts, led by interest rates and energy products. In addition, I'm pleased to see our European exchange is starting to expand from a small base. On April 10, we traded 10,000 contracts for the first time with contributions from FX, European national gas and cocoa.
Turning to Swaps clearing. Positive momentum continued in Q1 and we are very pleased to have a leadership position here. We continue to push on the innovation front. Relative to the other major global clearing houses in rates, we were first with coupon blending, which offers capital and operational efficiencies in a capital and a resource-constrained world. This significantly reduces the number of transactions and the notional outstanding required to maintain a given portfolio. Already, customers have reduced over 100,000 line items and over $8 trillion in notional using the service. 
In addition, we are also working with TriOptima to offer multilateral compression for interest rate swaps for FCM house accounts.
We were also first, logically so, with portfolio margining, facilitating individual client risk reduction by as much as 85%. Since the end of last year, the number of end clients utilizing this solution has more than doubled to 43 firms through 11 live clearing members. In December 2013, we expanded our offering to include clearing for the Mexican peso swaps, making our IRS product scope the broadest available on any platform, with 18 currencies. 
We now have 37 clients voluntarily clearing these Mexican peso swaps, including both dealer-to-dealer and dealer-to-client, and it is our fifth largest currency. All of these efforts have helped us to gain market share in plain vanilla fixed versus floating swaps in both dollar and non-dollar currencies.
We continue to market our interest rate futures and options to over 500 DME OTC clearing customers. During the quarter, Greenwich Associates published a total transaction cost analysis comparing the cost of swaps versus futures. Based on the detailed analytics from the 42 clients surveyed, it showed that futures are nearly always the lowest cost alternative. The Greenwich report is available on our website and we continue to educate market participants about this important comparison. 
Building on this, in March, we launched a new web tool in conjunction with ICAP and the Beast Apps called RapidRV. This robust offering provides over 15 different analytics that allow customers to explore relative value and comparative pricing of swaps, cash treasury markets and CME Group interest rate futures. With real-time pricing feeds, customers are able to view side-by-side pricing analysis and opportunity assessment across fixed income products.
For some time now, we have provided updates on statistics that we follow very closely that are potential signs of OTC clients using futures. Many of you have asked for additional data points on this transition.
Last quarter, I mentioned our treasury futures business reached the highest proportion ever of the cash treasury business at 75% of the size of the cash market. I'm pleased to say in March that number jumped to 77%. One new piece of data can be found in the slides. We have analyzed the activity of our top users of portfolio margining and we have futures trading growth rates almost twice that of the overall marketplace.
The third area of growth I want to touch on is our options business. We eclipsed our prior peak options volume from Q4 to set a new quarterly volume record in Q1. This was driven by continued investment in our options trading functionality and bolstered by specific sales and marketing campaigns to draw new customers to our options markets. We saw double-digit growth in interest rates, approximately 50% of our options business is traded electronically with about 40% traded on the flow, and the remainder via privately negotiated transactions.
In terms of our efforts to electronify options, we have made significant progress within Eurodollar options on Globex over the last year. The percentage of Eurodollar option volume traded on Globex has grown from 11% in 2013 to 13% in 2014, and almost to 20% in March and April of this year. This recent increase in electronic activity has been driven by growth from European participants trading in our overnight hours. In comparison, in our earnings slide deck, you can see how the electronification of treasury options, which are currently around 63%, has created meaningful growth. The referenced slide illustrate the same trend across other product lines as well.
You can see the power of this transition, most significantly, perhaps in FX options where the average daily volume is up ninefold since 2009, powered by electronic trading. Additionally, we continue to successfully grow our energy options volumes on Globex, with 41% of our total energy options trading in -- on Globex in Q1, up from just 28% in Q1 of last year. The point here is that options growth will drive activity in the futures markets, too, since both these products are on the same platform and combination trades can be executed.
So overall, we have had a nice start to the year. We continue to focus on ways to expand our business while driving productivity improvements throughout the organization.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

I'm pleased with our results this quarter with revenue up over 8% and expenses down 2% compared with Q1 last year, driving operating margins above 62% for the quarter, our best result in the last few years. Adj",719,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter with revenue up over 8% and expenses down 2% compared with Q1 last year, driving operating margins above 62% for the quarter, our best result in the last few years. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.98, up 18% for the quarter compared to a strong Q1 last year. We saw a nice performance in our core futures, OTC clearing and market data revenue. 
I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q1 was $0.753, up from $0.731 last quarter. The main driver of the increase was a shift in product mix, with an increased proportion of total volume coming from higher-priced commodity products. Specifically, we saw an approximate 2% shift from equity to energy products. 
Our transaction fee increase went into effect in February, and we have 2 months at the higher level in our first quarter RPC.
OTC swaps revenue totaled $20 million for the quarter, up 53% versus Q1 last year. During the first quarter, we captured $129 per IRS cleared trade, which is consistent with what we've seen in the past, but down from Q4. We cleared approximately 2,370 trades per day in Q1, the highest level we have seen so far.
Market data revenue of $98 million was up 10% versus Q1 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program, which we have discussed the last few quarters. As a reminder, we began charging $42.50 per month for professional traders, who are grandfathered. And we also captured $6 per month on average per screen for nonprofessional traders. In Q1, we accrued for approximately 150,000 new screens, with approximately 1/3 of those at the higher professional level and 2/3 came in as nonprofessionals. It will likely take a few quarters to get to a steady state in terms of market data revenue, and we may see a drop from those $98 million level this quarter as customers settle into the new pricing structure.
Adjusted expenses in Q1 were $317 million, down $8 million from Q1 last year. We are very focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization, and eliminating redundancy to improve agility and customer responsiveness. 
Virtually every expense category came down with the exception of Technology Services and volume-related license fees. At the same time, we continue to rollout significant number of new offerings, which Gill outlined.
At the end of Q1, we had 2,670 employees, down about 15 people from year-end and down 90 relative to this point last year driven by our October restructuring.
Our compensation ratio for the quarter was 15.9%, down from more than 17% the last 2 years.
Turning to taxes, the effective rate for the quarter was 36.6%.  And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $1.8 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, we issued a 10-year bond totaling $750 million at 3%, replacing debt that was going to mature in 2018. We also upsized our revolving credit facility from $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion. 
During Q1, our interest rate expense totaled $31 million, which was higher than Q4 primarily due to the double carry. We paid off the 2018 bond in April, and our quarterly run rate for interest expense will drop to approximately $29 million by the second half of the year.
If we adjust for the bond transaction we completed on April 8, we had approximately $1.1 billion of total cash at the end of Q1. That leaves $400 million above the $700 million we target in terms of a minimum cash level. So far this year, we've paid out over $800 million in total dividends.
During the first quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $27 million.
In summary, the first quarter of 2015 demonstrated the leverage in our business model. The entire management team continues to focus on margin expansion with both top line growth and expense discipline.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue if you have further questions. Thank you."

And I think Channing Massey [ph] is going to meet these European counterparts in a few days here. But I think the whole topic of equivalence has been taken very seriously by both sides. And I think the -- that the issue seemed  to be centered around margining, customer margining, which is 2-day net versus 1-day gross. And I think when you're talking about the topic of equivalence, there will likely be a compromise. But I think, fundamentally, what Channing Massey [ph] said a few months ago, is the right point, that the U.S. is the gold standard. The  U.S. exchange has helped create markets in London and all over the world. And so some of the things that we have in place, if you're looking at equivalence on a line-by-line basis, you have the U.S., for example, running full margin cycle twice a day. That does not happen in Europe. So if you're talking about margin period of risk, there are actually 2 margin periods of risk within a single day in the U.S. every single day, and that doesn't happen in Europe. And you cannot loan money to your clients. That doesn't happen in Europe. You have to collect money from your clients. That doesn't happen in Europe. But that debate seems to be centered on margin itself. And the levels of margin on the client side, which is the important side, on the client side in the U.S. on a gross margining basis, can be anywhere from 2x to 4x as large and then it would be on a net basis. We've heard some noise that it might be roughly equivalent. Roughly equivalent is not true. It's 2x or more. So we expect a compromise because we expect Channing Massey [ph] to make the same point that he made a few months ago, but I think just from of a factual base, there are a lot of differences there. The U.S. has fine-tuned their approach to customer protection far longer than anybody else."

If you actually look at what's going on globally in the energy market right now, it's an oversupply story. The oversupply story is very much a TI story. But when I actually look at the growth of our complex between ourselves and ICE, the overall story is being played out, an increasing market share of the world price discovery and certainly the question of price discovery taking place being driven by the Brent -- the TI side of the equation. If you look at the results between our energy complex versus their energy complex, I think ICE is up about 9% and we're up about 23%, 24% or so. In addition to kind of what we're seeing in the world focusing in on the TI side of the equation, we're also seeing out-performance of our options business. Our TI options, both in volumes and OI is increasing, not what you're seeing on the Brent side of the equation. So when we're actually seeing its volatile, clients tend to move their main products and we're seeing actually Brent participation down relative to TI. So we think that continues to play out and we think that the participation in our markets as we globalize our customer base has been very positive for us out of the story. And plus, if you look back at the trading, 95% of the days, TI trading is outpacing the volumes. They are trading on the ICE, Brent side. So we think that, that will continue.

But what we're seeing here is exactly what we have talked about over the last few years, where the nature of the business is such that when there is uncertainty around when the Fed would take action and what kind of action they will take, our products will react as -- such as you saw yesterday, and you've seen for many days in the first quarter. Derek or Sean, anything to add?"

We continue to see progress on the OTC side, both in terms of increasing number of clients, increasing volumes, increasing market share and as well the futurization. So on the futurization, Gill mentioned earlier, that we had, in the fourth quarter, record penetration of cash treasury market at 75%, and in April we saw 77%. So we continue to see progress on that front. In addition to that, another interesting statistic is we've seen a very big increase in a number of participants taking advantage of portfolio margining. And with the portfolio margining, we saw a doubling actually of the number of clients in Q1 using the portfolio margining versus a year ago, now running 43 clients being facilitated by 11 FCMs. An interesting front is not just having new participants enter our futures and options market with the big growth we've talked about before that we've had over the last couple of years in large, open-interest holders, but in addition to that we see that the participants who are trading both in our futures and swaps and who are taking advantage of portfolio margining, their growth rates in our futures complex runs about double that of other participants. So we're seeing an increasing number of participants in the futures as well as higher trading volumes by those folks taking advantage of our margin and capital efficiency. John?"

And I think one of the large banks recently announced a 75-basis-point charge on the collateral, that's being passed through to them as a way to offset some of these capital charges that they have. Now, this emphasizes even more what Sean just talked about, which is portfolio margining. The more efficient a portfolio is, the less collateral that is required. The less collateral that we put that as required makes for less expensive proposition for the client base, and by extension, less of a capital charge issue that the banks might have."

And if those market conditions occur and those eventualities occur, what are the things that regulators should be concerned about? Skin in the game would be one of them, but I would bet you it would be 100 on a long list of things you have to deal with because the whole argument behind the guarantee fund and being a SEDCO, a nearly defined SEDCO, we are systemically important and our requirements changed dramatically a few years ago from a cover 1 standard to a cover 2.

We don't have, on the business side, complete clarity into each and every account, and there is a Chinese wall.

We're seeing an increasing number of participants in our futures market that we believe are driven by our OTC sales activities. In addition to that those folks that are taking advantage of the portfolio margin, which we can't look through to, their growth rates in our futures complex is running around double that of the folks that are otherwise. So we continue to see increasing penetration of that. And the other thing I would say is I think that, that runway continues to be very large. If I can give you an example, the most popular trading strategy in U.S. dollar interest rate swap space is something called a swap spread. While there is no publicly available information on that particular trade, we believe that particular trade probably runs on the order $80 billion a day or on the order of 800,000 contracts a day in our treasury futures equivalent. At the moment, our EFRs in invoice spreads -- so kind of the equivalent in interest rate futures plus cleared interest rate swaps space relative to that swap spread market remains a small fraction of the swap spread market. We're running on the order of 60,000, 65,000 a day in our invoice spreads. So we continue to see a very large runway relative to that opportunity."

A couple of things: you've heard us point to the areas in which we're making investment to grow participation in our options markets, investing in functionality to accommodate some more complex spreads, increasing our sales, marketing and education and analytics tools, we're putting out there to bring more people to our market. To answer your question, the reason that we feel so strong that the investments and options drives our core is that for every options that trade, we think there is roughly between 2 and 2.5 futures the trade related to that option, traditionally, because there are a number of participants that come in the trade-offs in delta neutral. They will hedge their position in options with our futures and then dynamically reestablish and maintain those hedges and change them as price action goes on. Secondly, we are unique in that -- in every major asset class that Gill referenced. We have a referenced benchmark options business associated with that asset class. So we are bringing both the futures and options together, so we're dynamically bringing key participants to our markets. And finally, the growth in electronification, as you've seen in the futures story, continues to spot an increase of velocity with trading, both in options and our futures. So you've seen these breakdowns in the deck. Despite the fact that we're about 49% to 50% electronic, if you go inside these figures each one, you'll see that the treasury options on the following slide is close to 65% electronic. Inside the energies business, you'll see our Brent options is close to 70% electronic. And nat gas, which is in a different market structure state right now, is probably close to 5% or 10% electronic. So these investments we're making are both bringing new participants to us, creating a unique value proposition for the future and the option to hedge in the same clearing house for significant margin efficiencies, and the electronification trends has been a virtuous cycle of increased participation both on the futures and options side."

I think to your point, a lot of that turmoil that you are seeing in the marketplace is specific to OTC futures -- to OTC swaps and not futures, excuse me. So -- and as you said, it, on the one hand, helps the futures marketplace, but on the other hand, where the futures marketplace is truly complementary. It may have the potential to actually hurt. Our viewpoint, though, as we have developed futures contract with more and more flexibility built into them such as the swap deliverable futures that we rolled out, the differences are becoming less and less. And so the help to futures will continue on. I think that will be a net positive for us. The issue that the banks and the others that are providing services are facing right now is the initial mispricing of the business. It's how I would say it. And I think this is one of the things that no one knew where the pain points were going to be. Capital increases were not taken into account. I think on the net, when you take these things into account, what's emerging now is a rationalization of the true cost of clearing OTC which cannot be ignored. And so those banks that have decided to get out of the business, I think it's specific to the OTC side. And so that's on the one hand, concentrates, which will be a concern that we should have. The concern that we have here, the exchange is a concentration risk where OTC is being cleared in the hands of very few folks. And the regulator should be concerned about that, too, which leads them to higher capital charges, less participation, which was not what Dodd-Frank had intended, which is a broader participation in the marketplace. So on the whole to sum what I'm saying, and John has a few things to add here is it helps the futures marketplace. It allows us to innovate more and create more flexible futures contract that meet those marketplace needs without the expense associated with it. And the regulators would still have to start to look at the concentration issues that come about, and this leads them to the guarantee fund issues and all those other fun things. John?"

And I'm not sure what that something is for LCH at this point. So I think that's about it. I hope I answered the question that you have."

We've -- we take every one of these competitive threats very seriously. We start with the customers, and our focal point, if you heard from us over many of the last quarters' calls has been servicing our customer base, understanding their pain points and addressing that with product capital efficiencies, upper efficiencies, et cetera. We have had no shortage of exchanges come in and try to look at sort of a me-too approach to copying our list of products and our competitor's list of products. What we have found is that unless you're solving a specific customer problem, unless you're creating a solution for a pain point or bottleneck in the operational margin part of the equation, then there's -- it's a -- you've got tough haul. In addition to that, you're seeing a move into an asset class to your point with 2 very robust competitive dynamic market participants already. So what we have found in the feedback from customers is the only value prop we have heard is we're cheaper. Now, we've seen that before. We've seen no product differentiation, no technology differentiations, no margin efficiencies. So we're talking to our customers and saying, ""If we're continuing to serve your needs, we will continue to move into new areas of service for you."" So we take every one of these competitive threats seriously, but we're in the process of solving customer approaches. There is an analog here relative to a scene where NASDAQ went after a similar market, Anilex in Europe, thinking that there was an opportunity to bring together disconnected parts of the market with 2 already entrenched participants, and I think you've seen them really struggle. And there were a lot of stipends put out there to create a significant amount of volume. When those stipends disappeared, the volume disappeared. So this will keep us on our game, no question. We saw those volumes drop from over 100,000 ADV down to about 6,000 or 7,000 ADV. So we know this game. We understand the competitive threat. We take it as a form of flattery that we've got folks coming in thinking we've got fabulous products that they want as well. So we're focused on moving into servicing our clients in new ways. We're moving into new developing markets with new unique solutions like we're doing with our NBP and TTF products in CME Europe and other ways to serve our customer base. So that's -- we are absolutely acutely concerned about it. We've seen this before for the NYPC and other attacks, so we're taking it seriously."

I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since the beginning of the year in terms of our growth initiatives and our volume relative to market conditions. Also, our efforts on the expense side are clearly evident in our Q1 results and I applaud our team for their efforts.
During the first quarter, our ADV reached almost 15 million contracts, which is the second highest volume quarter in our history. We had record energy volume, up more than 20% and interest rates and FX volume each grew by more than 10%. Some notable quarterly records included overall options ADV of 2.8 million contracts as well as records in WTI and Brent crude, gasoline and heating oil products.
Energy volume has been very robust overall this year. We have had standout results with our WTI crude oil contracts relative to the other primary crude benchmark. Year-to-date, our WTI futures and WTI options are each up more than 60%. And combined, we have averaged 1.1 million contracts per day so far this year.
Turning to FX. Activity has been impressive and FX volumes averaged about 725,000 per day in the first half of last year. That number jumped to about 875,000 in the second half, and we saw almost 1.1 million contracts per day in March of this year. In April, we are trending up about 40% compared to last year. Certainly, you have heard about positive trends in the FX activity on several of the large banks' earnings calls. Open interest in FX continues to run at peak levels. With the upcoming election in the U.K. and the ongoing debate about what the Fed will do, we expect to continue to see some interesting activity in our FX markets.
Moving on to our interest rate quadrant. After a strong first quarter, we have seen a slowdown in activity since the dovish sentiment from the Fed meeting in mid-March, coupled with a normally slow April and Easter holiday period. Weaker economic data tends to push expectations of a Fed rate move further out, as evidenced in our Fed funds futures markets, while making the ebb and flow of the rate decision debate even more dependent on upcoming economic data in the spring and summer months. Volatility in rate products have dropped in April, which you can see in the slides. We are fortunate that we have a very diverse product set, which is important when volume fluctuates like it does every year.
As I've mentioned last quarter, we are focused on 3 primary areas of organic growth: increased penetration of global clients, attractive flow from the swaps business through clearing and exchange-traded alternatives and driving options growth across the platform, which elevates futures volume as well.
Volume from outside the U.S. continues to be impressive as we leverage our investments in global headcount, partnerships and product development. Our Q1 electronic trading volume out of Asia reached a record 570,000 contracts per day, up 22% from Q1 of last year. That was double the 10% growth we saw out of North America during the quarter. 
Energy volume led the way in terms of product line growth from Asia, followed by FX and equities, all up more than 40%. Clearly, Asian clients are comfortable trading and clearing directly with a U.S.-based exchange.
Average daily volume from Europe grew by 14% to 2.3 million contracts, led by interest rates and energy products. In addition, I'm pleased to see our European exchange is starting to expand from a small base. On April 10, we traded 10,000 contracts for the first time with contributions from FX, European national gas and cocoa.
Turning to Swaps clearing. Positive momentum continued in Q1 and we are very pleased to have a leadership position here. We continue to push on the innovation front. Relative to the other major global clearing houses in rates, we were first with coupon blending, which offers capital and operational efficiencies in a capital and a resource-constrained world. This significantly reduces the number of transactions and the notional outstanding required to maintain a given portfolio. Already, customers have reduced over 100,000 line items and over $8 trillion in notional using the service. 
In addition, we are also working with TriOptima to offer multilateral compression for interest rate swaps for FCM house accounts.
We were also first, logically so, with portfolio margining, facilitating individual client risk reduction by as much as 85%. Since the end of last year, the number of end clients utilizing this solution has more than doubled to 43 firms through 11 live clearing members. In December 2013, we expanded our offering to include clearing for the Mexican peso swaps, making our IRS product scope the broadest available on any platform, with 18 currencies. 
We now have 37 clients voluntarily clearing these Mexican peso swaps, including both dealer-to-dealer and dealer-to-client, and it is our fifth largest currency. All of these efforts have helped us to gain market share in plain vanilla fixed versus floating swaps in both dollar and non-dollar currencies.
We continue to market our interest rate futures and options to over 500 DME OTC clearing customers. During the quarter, Greenwich Associates published a total transaction cost analysis comparing the cost of swaps versus futures. Based on the detailed analytics from the 42 clients surveyed, it showed that futures are nearly always the lowest cost alternative. The Greenwich report is available on our website and we continue to educate market participants about this important comparison. 
Building on this, in March, we launched a new web tool in conjunction with ICAP and the Beast Apps called RapidRV. This robust offering provides over 15 different analytics that allow customers to explore relative value and comparative pricing of swaps, cash treasury markets and CME Group interest rate futures. With real-time pricing feeds, customers are able to view side-by-side pricing analysis and opportunity assessment across fixed income products.
For some time now, we have provided updates on statistics that we follow very closely that are potential signs of OTC clients using futures. Many of you have asked for additional data points on this transition.
Last quarter, I mentioned our treasury futures business reached the highest proportion ever of the cash treasury business at 75% of the size of the cash market. I'm pleased to say in March that number jumped to 77%. One new piece of data can be found in the slides. We have analyzed the activity of our top users of portfolio margining and we have seen futures trading growth rates almost twice that of the overall marketplace.
The third area of growth I want to touch on is our options business. We eclipsed our prior peak options volume from Q4 to set a new quarterly volume record in Q1. This was driven by continued investment in our options trading functionality and bolstered by specific sales and marketing campaigns to draw new customers to our options markets. We saw double-digit growth in interest rates, approximately 50% of our options business is traded electronically with about 40% traded on the floor, and the remainder via privately negotiated transactions.
In terms of our efforts to electronify options, we have made significant progress within Eurodollar options on Globex over the last year. The percentage of Eurodollar option volume traded on Globex has grown from 11% in 2013 to 13% in 2014, and almost to 20% in March and April of this year. This recent increase in electronic activity has been driven by growth from European participants trading in our overnight hours. In comparison, in our earnings slide deck, you can see how the electronification of treasury options, which are currently around 63%, has created meaningful growth. The referenced slide illustrate the same trend across our other product lines as well.
You can see the power of this transition, most significantly, perhaps in FX options where the average daily volume is up ninefold since 2009, powered by electronic trading. Additionally, we continue to successfully grow our energy options volumes on Globex, with 41% of our total energy options trading in -- on Globex in Q1, up from just 28% in Q1 of last year. The point here is that options growth will drive activity in the futures markets, too, since both these products are on the same platform and combination trades can be executed.
So overall, we have had a nice start to the year. We continue to focus on ways to expand our business while driving productivity improvements throughout the organization.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,288769815,799834,"CME Group Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter with revenue up over 8% and expenses down 2% compared with Q1 last year, driving operating margins above 62% for the quarter, our best result in the last few years. Adj",718,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter with revenue up over 8% and expenses down 2% compared with Q1 last year, driving operating margins above 62% for the quarter, our best result in the last few years. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.98, up 18% for the quarter compared to a strong Q1 last year. We saw a nice performance in our core futures, OTC clearing and market data revenue. 
I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q1 was $0.753, up from $0.731 last quarter. The main driver of the increase was a shift in product mix, with an increased proportion of total volume coming from higher-priced commodity products. Specifically, we saw an approximate 2% shift from equity to energy products. 
Our transaction fee increase went into effect in February, and we have 2 months at the higher level in our first quarter RPC.
OTC swaps revenue totaled $20 million for the quarter, up 53% versus Q1 last year. During the first quarter, we captured $129 per IRS cleared trade, which is consistent with what we've seen in the past, but down from Q4. We cleared approximately 2,370 trades per day in Q1, the highest level we have seen so far.
Market data revenue of $98 million was up 10% versus Q1 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program, which we have discussed the last few quarters. As a reminder, we began charging $42.50 per month for professional traders, who are grandfathered. And we also captured $6 per month on average per screen for nonprofessional traders. In Q1, we accrued for approximately 150,000 new screens, with approximately 1/3 of those at the higher professional level and 2/3 came in as nonprofessionals. It will likely take a few quarters to get to a steady state in terms of market data revenue, and we may see a drop from those $98 million level this quarter as customers settle into the new pricing structure.
Adjusted expenses in Q1 were $317 million, down $8 million from Q1 last year. We are very focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization, and eliminating redundancy to improve agility and customer responsiveness. 
Virtually every expense category came down with the exception of Technology Services and volume-related license fees. At the same time, we continue to rollout significant number of new offerings, which Gill outlined.
At the end of Q1, we had 2,670 employees, down about 15 people from year-end and down 90 relative to this point last year driven by our October restructuring.
Our compensation ratio for the quarter was 15.9%, down from more than 17% the last 2 years.
Turning to taxes, the effective rate for the quarter was 36.6%.  And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $1.8 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, we issued a 10-year bond totaling $750 million at 3%, replacing debt that was going to mature in 2018. We also upsized our revolving credit facility from $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion. 
During Q1, our interest expense totaled $31 million, which was higher than Q4 primarily due to the double carry. We paid off the 2018 bond in April, and our quarterly run rate for interest expense will drop to approximately $29 million by the second half of the year.
If we adjust for the bond transaction we completed on April 8, we had approximately $1.1 billion of total cash at the end of Q1. That leaves $400 million above the $700 million we target in terms of a minimum cash level. So far this year, we've paid out over $800 million in total dividends.
During the first quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $27 million.
In summary, the first quarter of 2015 demonstrated the leverage in our business model. The entire management team continues to focus on margin expansion with both top line growth and expense discipline.

And I think Channing Massey [ph] is going to meet those European counterparts in a few days here. But I think the whole topic of equivalence has been taken very seriously by both sides. And I think the -- that the issue seemed  to be centered around margining, customer margining, which is 2-day net versus 1-day gross. And I think when you're talking about the topic of equivalence, there will likely be a compromise. But I think, fundamentally, what Channing Massey [ph] said a few months ago, is the right point, that the U.S. is the gold standard. The  U.S. exchange has helped create markets in London and all over the world. And so some of the things that we have in place, if you're looking at equivalence on a line-by-line basis, you have the U.S., for example, running full margin cycle twice a day. That does not happen in Europe. So if you're talking about margin period of risk, there are actually 2 margin periods of risk within a single day in the U.S. every single day, and that doesn't happen in Europe. And you cannot loan money to your clients. That doesn't happen in Europe. You have to collect money from your clients. That doesn't happen in Europe. But that debate seems to be centered on margin itself. And the levels of margin on the client side, which is the important side, on the client side in the U.S. on a gross margining basis, can be anywhere from 2x to 4x as large and then it would be on a net basis. We've heard some noise that it might be roughly equivalent. Roughly equivalent is not true. It's 2x or more. So we expect a compromise because we expect Channing Massey [ph] to make the same point that he made a few months ago, but I think just from of a factual base, there are a lot of differences there. The U.S. has fine-tuned their approach to customer protection far longer than anybody else."

But when I actually look at the growth of our complex between ourselves and ICE, the overall story is being played out, an increasing market share of the world price discovery and certainly the question of price discovery taking place being driven by the Brent -- the TI side of the equation. If you look at the results between our energy complex versus their energy complex, I think ICE is up about 9% and we're up about 23%, 24% or so. In addition to kind of what we're seeing in the world focusing in on the TI side of the equation, we're also seeing out-performance of our options business. Our TI options, both in volumes and OI is increasing, not what you're seeing on the Brent side of the equation. So when we're actually seeing its volatile, clients tend to move their main products and we're seeing actually Brent participation down relative to TI. So we think that continues to play out and we think that the participation in our markets as we globalize our customer base has been very positive for us out of the story. And plus, if you look back at the trading, 95% of the days, TI trading is outpacing the volumes. They are trading on the ICE, Brent side. So we think that, that will continue.

There are a variety of fundamental reasons for the performance of both the rate side and the energy side. Derek touched on a few of them, but the marketplace that we have allows our clientele to basically hedge their risk and their exposures as they see fit. So you saw a lull in volume over the last week. But yesterday, late in the morning or early in the afternoon, there was more news from the Fed, and that led to a $16 million-odd day for us yesterday. This morning, we're off to good start with $4-plus million on the same lines of uncertainty that leads to hedging activity on our side. So the long-fund payroll numbers that come out tomorrow will be interesting for us to see. But what we're seeing here is exactly what we have talked about over the last few years, where the nature of the business is such that when there is uncertainty around when the Fed would take action and what kind of action they will take, our products will react as -- such as you saw yesterday, and you've seen for many days in the first quarter.

And with the portfolio margining, we saw a doubling actually of the number of clients in Q1 using the portfolio margining versus a year ago, now running 43 clients being facilitated by 11 FCMs. An interesting front is not just having new participants enter our futures and options market with the big growth we've talked about before that we've had over the last couple of years in large, open-interest holders, but in addition to that we see that the participants who are trading both in our futures and swaps and who are taking advantage of portfolio margining, their growth rates in our futures complex runs about double that of other participants.

Now, this emphasizes even more what Sean just talked about, which is portfolio margining. The more efficient a portfolio is, the less collateral that is required.

So the update is, what you're reading in the press, there is a lot of call for skin in the game.

And if those market conditions occur and those eventualities occur, what are the things that regulators should be concerned about? Skin in the game would be one of them, but I would bet you it would be 100 on a long list of things you have to deal with because the whole argument behind the guarantee fund and being a SEDCO, a nearly defined SEDCO, we are systemically important and our requirements changed dramatically a few years ago from a cover 1 standard to a cover 2. So right now, we are talking about additional skin in the game for a smaller amount of skin in the game, when the largest 2 counterparties in the world have failed.

So we continue to see increasing penetration of that. And the other thing I would say is I think that, that runway continues to be very large. If I can give you an example, the most popular trading strategy in U.S. dollar interest rate swap space is something called a swap spread. While there is no publicly available information on that particular trade, we believe that particular trade probably runs on the order $80 billion a day or on the order of 800,000 contracts a day in our treasury futures equivalent. At the moment, our EFRs in invoice spreads -- so kind of the equivalent in interest rate futures plus cleared interest rate swaps space relative to that swap spread market remains a small fraction of the swap spread market. We're running on the order of 60,000, 65,000 a day in our invoice spreads. So we continue to see a very large runway relative to that opportunity."

A couple of things: you've heard us point to the areas in which we're making investment to grow participation in our options markets, investing in functionality to accommodate some more complex spreads, increasing our sales, marketing and education and analytics tools, we're putting out there to bring more people to our market. To answer your question, the reason that we feel so strong that the investments and options drives our core is that for every options that trade, we think there is roughly between 2 and 2.5 futures the trade related to that option, traditionally, because there are a number of participants that come in the trade-offs in delta neutral. They will hedge their position in options with our futures and then dynamically reestablish and maintain those hedges and change them as price action goes on. Secondly, we are unique in that -- in every major asset class that Gill referenced. We have a referenced benchmark options business associated with that asset class. So we are bringing both the futures and options together, so we're dynamically bringing key participants to our markets. And finally, the growth in electronification, as you've seen in the futures story, continues to spot an increase of velocity with trading, both in options and our futures. So you've seen these breakdowns in the deck. Despite the fact that we're about 49% to 50% electronic, if you go inside these figures each one, you'll see that the treasury options on the following slide is close to 65% electronic. Inside the energies business, you'll see our Brent options is close to 70% electronic. And nat gas, which is in a different market structure state right now, is probably close to 5% or 10% electronic. So these investments we're making are both bringing new participants to us, creating a unique value proposition for the future and the option to hedge in the same clearing house for significant margin efficiencies, and the electronification trends has been a virtuous cycle of increased participation both on the futures and options side."

I think to your point, a lot of that turmoil that you are seeing in the marketplace is specific to OTC futures -- to OTC swaps and not futures, excuse me. So -- and as you said, it, on the one hand, helps the futures marketplace,",386,"Yes, Alex. This is Gill. I think to your point, a lot of that turmoil that you are seeing in the marketplace is specific to OTC futures -- to OTC swaps and not futures, excuse me. So -- and as you said, it, on the one hand, helps the futures marketplace, but on the other hand, where the futures marketplace is truly complementary. It may have the potential to actually hurt. Our viewpoint, though, as we have developed futures contract with more and more flexibility built into them such as the swap deliverable futures that we rolled out, the differences are becoming less and less. And so the help to futures will continue on. I think that will be a net positive for us. The issue that the banks and the others that are providing services are facing right now is the initial mispricing of the business. It's how I would say it. And I think this is one of the things that no one knew where the pain points were going to be. Capital increases were not taken into account. I think on the net, when you take these things into account, what's emerging now is a rationalization of the true cost of clearing OTC which cannot be ignored. And so those banks that have decided to get out of the business, I think it's specific to the OTC side. And so that's on the one hand, concentrates, which will be a concern that we should have. The concern that we have here, the exchange is a concentration risk where OTC is being cleared in the hands of very few folks. And the regulator should be concerned about that, too, which leads them to higher capital charges, less participation, which was not what Dodd-Frank had intended, which is a broader participation in the marketplace. So on the whole to sum up what I'm saying, and John has a few things to add here is it helps the futures marketplace. It allows us to innovate more and create more flexible futures contract that meet those marketplace needs without the expense associated with it. And the regulators would still have to start to look at the concentration issues that come about, and this leads them to the guarantee fund issues and all those other fun things. John?"

I'll just -- Alex, a couple of quick points to expand on what Gill is saying. As you're aware, the -- as customers come to the futures markets because they get better capital efficiencies, we have an opportunity to monetize the amount of collateral that they put up into our clearing house because they're able to generate value by putting their positions on in our markets. So as you look at our balance sheet, you'd see that our cash and performance bonds have increased from about $40 billion to about $45 billion. We were able to monetize that in 3 different ways: one, through IEF fees; second, through earning money on the cash float; and we've also implemented a new custody fee. So we were able to charge about $8.6 million net in Q1, which is up from net $7.2 million in Q4 for an increase of about 20%, and that's just another way we're able to help our customers get better capital treatment and then also to CME to benefit as well."

Without any question, under nearly every scenario, depending upon the type of user as well as the length of time that the user uses the products. So it's also about the strategy whether you're going long or short. Under nearly every scenario, our futures are the lower-cost alternative relative to ETFs. And we have found that very much resonating with the marketplace. In terms of liquidity, our futures complex is far, far larger, far more liquid than the ETF market. And if you look at our S&P futures for example, we tend to trade on the order of 7x the notional volume of the equivalent ETFs.

We've -- we take every one of these competitive threats very seriously. We start with the customers, and our focal point, if you heard from us over many of the last quarters' calls has been servicing our customer base, understanding their pain points and addressing that with product capital efficiencies, upper efficiencies, et cetera. We have had no shortage of exchanges come in and try to look at sort of a me-too approach to copying our list of products and our competitor's list of products. What we have found is that unless you're solving a specific customer problem, unless you're creating a solution for a pain point or bottleneck in the operational margin side of the equation, then there's -- it's a -- you've got tough haul. In addition to that, you're seeing a move into an asset class to your point was 2 very robust competitive dynamic market participants already. So what we have found in the feedback from customers is the only value prop we have heard is we're cheaper. Now, we've seen that before. We've seen no product differentiation, no technology differentiations, no margin efficiencies. So we're talking to our customers and saying, ""If we're continuing to serve your needs, we will continue to move into new areas of service for you."" So we take every one of these competitive threats seriously, but we're in the process of solving customer approaches. There is an analog here relative to a scene where NASDAQ went after a similar market, Anilex in Europe, thinking that there was an opportunity to bring together disconnected parts of the market with 2 already entrenched participants, and I think you've seen them really struggle. And there were a lot of stipends put out there to create a significant amount of volume. When those stipends disappeared, the volume disappeared. So this will keep us on our game, no question. We saw those volumes drop from over 100,000 ADV down to about 6,000 or 7,000 ADV. So we know this game. We understand the competitive threat. We take it as a form of flattery that we've got folks coming in thinking we've got fabulous products that they want as well. So we're focused on moving into servicing our clients in new ways. We're moving into new developing markets with new unique solutions like we're doing with our NBP and TTF products in CME Europe and other ways to serve our customer base. So that's -- we are absolutely acutely concerned about it. We've seen this before for the NYPC and other attacks, so we're taking it seriously."

I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since the beginning of the year in terms of our growth initiatives and our volume relative to market conditions.

I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since the beginning of the year in terms of our growth initiatives and our volume relative to market conditions. Also, our efforts on the expense side are clearly evident in our Q1 results and I applaud our team for their efforts.
During the first quarter, our ADV reached almost 15 million contracts, which is the second highest volume quarter in our history. We had record energy volume, up more than 20% and interest rates and FX volume each grew by more than 10%. Some notable quarterly records included overall options ADV of 2.8 million contracts as well as records in WTI and Brent crude, gasoline and heating oil products.
Energy volume has been very robust overall this year. We have had standout results with our WTI crude oil contracts relative to the other primary crude benchmark. Year-to-date, our WTI futures and WTI options are each up more than 60%. And combined, we have averaged 1.1 million contracts per day so far this year.
Turning to FX. Activity has been impressive and FX volumes averaged about 725,000 per day in the first half of last year. That number jumped to about 875,000 in the second half, and we saw almost 1.1 million contracts per day in March of this year. In April, we are trending up about 40% compared to last year. Certainly, you have heard about positive trends in the FX activity on several of the large banks' earnings calls. Open interest in FX continues to run at peak levels. With the upcoming election in the U.K. and the ongoing debate about what the Fed will do, we expect to continue to see some interesting activity in our FX markets.
Moving on to our interest rate quadrant. After a strong first quarter, we have seen a slowdown in activity since the dovish sentiment from the Fed meeting in mid-March, coupled with a normally slow April and Easter holiday period. Weaker economic data tends to push expectations of a Fed rate move further out, as evidenced in our Fed funds futures markets, while making the ebb and flow of the rate decision debate even more dependent on upcoming economic data in the spring and summer months. Volatility in rate products have dropped in April, which you can see in the slides. We are fortunate that we have a very diverse product set, which is important when volume fluctuates like it does every year.
As I've mentioned last quarter, we are focused on 3 primary areas of organic growth: increased penetration of global clients, attractive flow from the swaps business through clearing and exchange-traded alternatives and driving options growth across the platform, which elevates futures volume as well.
Volume from outside the U.S. continues to be impressive as we leverage our investments in global headcount, partnerships and product development. Our Q1 electronic trading volume out of Asia reached a record 570,000 contracts per day, up 22% from Q1 of last year. That was double the 10% growth we saw out of North America during the quarter. 
Energy volume led the way in terms of product line growth from Asia, followed by FX and equities, all up more than 40%. Clearly, Asian clients are comfortable trading and clearing directly with a U.S.-based exchange.
Average daily volume from Europe grew by 14% to 2.3 million contracts, led by interest rates and energy products. In addition, I'm pleased to see our European exchange is starting to expand from a small base. On April 10, we traded 10,000 contracts for the first time with contributions from FX, European national gas and cocoa.
Turning to Swaps clearing. Positive momentum continued in Q1 and we are very pleased to have a leadership position here. We continue to push on the innovation front. Relative to the other major global clearing houses in rates, we were first with coupon blending, which offers capital and operational efficiencies in a capital and a resource-constrained world. This significantly reduces the number of transactions and the notional outstanding required to maintain a given portfolio. Already, customers have reduced over 100,000 line items and over $8 trillion in notional using the service. 
In addition, we are also working with TriOptima to offer multilateral compression for interest rate swaps for FCM house accounts.
We were also first, logically so, with portfolio margining, facilitating individual client risk reduction by as much as 85%. Since the end of last year, the number of end clients utilizing this solution has more than doubled to 43 firms through 11 live clearing members. In December 2013, we expanded our offering to include clearing for the Mexican peso swaps, making our IRS product scope the broadest available on any platform, with 18 currencies. 
We now have 37 clients voluntarily clearing these Mexican peso swaps, including both dealer-to-dealer and dealer-to-client, and it is our fifth largest currency. All of these efforts have helped us to gain market share in plain vanilla fixed versus floating swaps in both dollar and non-dollar currencies.
We continue to market our interest rate futures and options to over 500 DME OTC clearing customers. During the quarter, Greenwich Associates published a total transaction cost analysis comparing the cost of swaps versus futures. Based on the detailed analytics from the 42 clients surveyed, it showed that futures are nearly always the lowest cost alternative. The Greenwich report is available on our website and we continue to educate market participants about this important comparison. 
Building on this, in March, we launched a new web tool in conjunction with ICAP and the Beast Apps called RapidRV. This robust offering provides over 15 different analytics that allow customers to explore relative value and comparative pricing of swaps, cash treasury markets and CME Group interest rate futures. With real-time pricing feeds, customers are able to view side-by-side pricing analysis and opportunity assessment across fixed income products.
For some time now, we have provided updates on statistics that we follow very closely that are potential signs of OTC clients using futures. Many of you have asked for additional data points on this transition.
Last quarter, I mentioned our treasury futures business reached the highest proportion ever of the cash treasury business at 75% of the size of the cash market. I'm pleased to say in March that number jumped to 77%. One new piece of data can be found in the slides. We have analyzed the activity of our top users of portfolio margining and we have seen futures trading growth rates almost twice that of the overall marketplace.
The third area of growth I want to touch on is our options business. We eclipsed our prior peak options volume from Q4 to set a new quarterly volume record in Q1. This was driven by continued investment in our options trading functionality and bolstered by specific sales and marketing campaigns to draw new customers to our options markets. We saw double-digit growth in interest rates, approximately 50% of our options business is traded electronically with about 40% traded on the floor, and the remainder via privately negotiated transactions.
In terms of our efforts to electronify options, we have made significant progress within Eurodollar options on Globex over the last year. The percentage of Eurodollar option volume traded on Globex has grown from 11% in 2013 to 13% in 2014, and almost to 20% in March and April of this year. This recent increase in electronic activity has been driven by growth from European participants trading in our overnight hours. In comparison, in our earnings slide deck, you can see how the electronification of treasury options, which are currently around 63%, has created meaningful growth. The referenced slide illustrate the same trend across our other product lines as well.
You can see the power of this transition, most significantly, perhaps in FX options where the average daily volume is up ninefold since 2009, powered by electronic trading. Additionally, we continue to successfully grow our energy options volumes on Globex, with 41% of our total energy options trading in -- on Globex in Q1, up from just 28% in Q1 of last year. The point here is that options growth will drive activity in the futures markets, too, since both these products are on the same platform and combination trades can be executed.
So overall, we have had a nice start to the year. We continue to focus on ways to expand our business while driving productivity improvements throughout the organization.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,288769815,801353,"CME Group Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2015",2015-04-30,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter with revenue up over 8% and expenses down 2% compared with Q1 last year, driving operating margins above 62% for the quarter, our best result in the last few years. Adj",718,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter with revenue up over 8% and expenses down 2% compared with Q1 last year, driving operating margins above 62% for the quarter, our best result in the last few years. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.98, up 18% for the quarter compared to a strong Q1 last year. We saw a nice performance in our core futures, OTC clearing and market data revenue. 
I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q1 was $0.753, up from $0.731 last quarter. The main driver of the increase was a shift in product mix, with an increased proportion of total volume coming from higher-priced commodity products. Specifically, we saw an approximate 2% shift from equity to energy products. 
Our transaction fee increase went into effect in February, and we have 2 months at the higher level in our first quarter RPC.
OTC swaps revenue totaled $20 million for the quarter, up 53% versus Q1 last year. During the first quarter, we captured $129 per IRS cleared trade, which is consistent with what we've seen in the past, but down from Q4. We cleared approximately 2,370 trades per day in Q1, the highest level we have seen so far.
Market data revenue of $98 million was up 10% versus Q1 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program, which we have discussed the last few quarters. As a reminder, we began charging $42.50 per month for professional traders, who are grandfathered. And we also captured $6 per month on average per screen for nonprofessional traders. In Q1, we accrued for approximately 150,000 new screens, with approximately 1/3 of those at the higher professional level and 2/3 came in as nonprofessionals. It will likely take a few quarters to get to a steady state in terms of market data revenue, and we may see a drop from those $98 million level this quarter as customers settle into the new pricing structure.
Adjusted expenses in Q1 were $317 million, down $8 million from Q1 last year. We are very focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization, and eliminating redundancy to improve agility and customer responsiveness. 
Virtually every expense category came down with the exception of Technology Services and volume-related license fees. At the same time, we continue to rollout significant number of new offerings, which Gill outlined.
At the end of Q1, we had 2,670 employees, down about 15 people from year-end and down 90 relative to this point last year driven by our October restructuring.
Our compensation ratio for the quarter was 15.9%, down from more than 17% the last 2 years.
Turning to taxes, the effective rate for the quarter was 36.6%. And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $1.8 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, we issued a 10-year bond totaling $750 million at 3%, replacing debt that was going to mature in 2018. We also upsized our revolving credit facility from $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion. 
During Q1, our interest expense totaled $31 million, which was higher than Q4 primarily due to the double carry. We paid off the 2018 bond in April, and our quarterly run rate for interest expense will drop to approximately $29 million by the second half of the year.
If we adjust for the bond transaction we completed on April 8, we had approximately $1.1 billion of total cash at the end of Q1. That leaves $400 million above the $700 million we target in terms of a minimum cash level. So far this year, we've paid out over $800 million in total dividends.
During the first quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $27 million.
In summary, the first quarter of 2015 demonstrated the leverage in our business model. The entire management team continues to focus on margin expansion with both top line growth and expense discipline.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue if you have further questions. Thank you."

And I think Channing Massey [ph] is going to meet those European counterparts in a few days here. But I think the whole topic of equivalence has been taken very seriously by both sides. And I think the -- that the issue seemed to be centered around margining, customer margining, which is 2-day net versus 1-day gross. And I think when you're talking about the topic of equivalence, there will likely be a compromise. But I think, fundamentally, what Channing Massey [ph] said a few months ago, is the right point, that the U.S. is the gold standard. The U.S. exchange has helped create markets in London and all over the world. And so some of the things that we have in place, if you're looking at equivalence on a line-by-line basis, you have the U.S., for example, running full margin cycle twice a day. That does not happen in Europe. So if you're talking about margin period of risk, there are actually 2 margin periods of risk within a single day in the U.S. every single day, and that doesn't happen in Europe. And you cannot loan money to your clients. That doesn't happen in Europe. You have to collect money from your clients. That doesn't happen in Europe. But that debate seems to be centered on margin itself. And the levels of margin on the client side, which is the important side, on the client side in the U.S. on a gross margining basis, can be anywhere from 2x to 4x as large and then it would be on a net basis. We've heard some noise that it might be roughly equivalent. Roughly equivalent is not true. It's 2x or more. So we expect a compromise because we expect Channing Massey [ph] to make the same point that he made a few months ago, but I think just from of a factual base, there are a lot of differences there. The U.S. has fine-tuned their approach to customer protection far longer than anybody else."

If you actually look at what's going on globally in the energy market right now, it's an oversupply story. The oversupply story is very much a TI story. But when I actually look at the growth of our complex between ourselves and ICE, the overall story is being played out, an increasing market share of the world price discovery and certainly the question of price discovery taking place being driven by the Brent -- the TI side of the equation. If you look at the results between our energy complex versus their energy complex, I think ICE is up about 9% and we're up about 23%, 24% or so. In addition to kind of what we're seeing in the world focusing in on the TI side of the equation, we're also seeing out-performance of our options business. Our TI options, both in volumes and OI is increasing, not what you're seeing on the Brent side of the equation. So when we're actually seeing its volatile, clients tend to move their main products and we're seeing actually Brent participation down relative to TI. So we think that continues to play out and we think that the participation in our markets as we globalize our customer base has been very positive for us out of the story. And plus, if you look back at the trading, 95% of the days, TI trading is outpacing the volumes. They are trading on the ICE, Brent side. So we think that, that will continue.

Derek touched on a few of them, but the marketplace that we have allows our clientele to basically hedge their risk and their exposures as they see fit. So you saw a lull in volume over the last week. But yesterday, late in the morning or early in the afternoon, there was more news from the Fed, and that led to a $16 million-odd day for us yesterday. This morning, we're off to good start with $4-plus million on the same lines of uncertainty that leads to hedging activity on our side. So the long-fund payroll numbers that come out tomorrow will be interesting for us to see.

So if you could maybe give us an update? From what we can see, there's nothing -- no official process right now with respect to changing any of the liquidity or capital requirements on the clearing houses, but if you wouldn't mind updating us on that discussion."

So the update is, what you're reading in the press, there is a lot of call for skin in the game. And I think the education process began a few weeks ago, when we issued the white paper on who brings the risk to the table, who manages that risk, who has the skin in the game, where exactly is that skin in the game, what should change, why should it change, and what market conditions are driving the current skin in the game with respect to the guarantee fund. And if those market conditions occur and those eventualities occur, what are the things that regulators should be concerned about? Skin in the game would be one of them, but I would bet you it would be 100 on a long list of things you have to deal with because the whole argument behind the guarantee fund and being a SEDCO, a nearly defined SEDCO, we are systemically important and our requirements changed dramatically a few years ago from a cover 1 standard to a cover 2. So right now, we are talking about additional skin in the game for a smaller amount of skin in the game, when the largest 2 counterparties in the world have failed. That's amazing given some massive moves in the markets across the successive classes that we have. So it's an interesting debate, and we will continue to educate anybody that wants to be educated about this. And I think that the issues will play themselves out throughout the course of the year."

We don't have, on the business side, complete clarity into each and every account, and there is a Chinese wall. So the metrics that we've given, I think we have a very strong indication that we're seeing a number of things. We're seeing an increasing number of participants in our futures market that we believe are driven by our OTC sales activities. In addition to that those folks that are taking advantage of the portfolio margin, which we can't look through to, their growth rates in our futures complex is running around double that of the folks that are otherwise. So we continue to see increasing penetration of that. And the other thing I would say is I think that, that runway continues to be very large. If I can give you an example, the most popular trading strategy in U.S. dollar interest rate swap space is something called a swap spread. While there is no publicly available information on that particular trade, we believe that particular trade probably runs on the order $80 billion a day or on the order of 800,000 contracts a day in our treasury futures equivalent. At the moment, our EFRs in invoice spreads -- so kind of the equivalent in interest rate futures plus cleared interest rate swaps space relative to that swap spread market remains a small fraction of the swap spread market. We're running on the order of 60,000, 65,000 a day in our invoice spreads. So we continue to see a very large runway relative to that opportunity."

A couple of things: you've heard us point to the areas in which we're making investment to grow participation in our options markets, investing in functionality to accommodate some more complex spreads, increasing our sales, marketing and education and analytics tools, we're putting out there to bring more people to our market. To answer your question, the reason that we feel so strong that the investments and options drives our core is that for every options that trade, we think there is roughly between 2 and 2.5 futures the trade related to that option, traditionally, because there are a number of participants that come in the trade-offs in delta neutral. They will hedge their position in options with our futures and then dynamically reestablish and maintain those hedges and change them as price action goes on. Secondly, we are unique in that -- in every major asset class that Gill referenced. We have a referenced benchmark options business associated with that asset class. So we are bringing both the futures and options together, so we're dynamically bringing key participants to our markets. And finally, the growth in electronification, as you've seen in the futures story, continues to spot an increase of velocity with trading, both in options and our futures. So you've seen these breakdowns in the deck. Despite the fact that we're about 49% to 50% electronic, if you go inside these figures each one, you'll see that the treasury options on the following slide is close to 65% electronic. Inside the energies business, you'll see our Brent options is close to 70% electronic. And nat gas, which is in a different market structure state right now, is probably close to 5% or 10% electronic. So these investments we're making are both bringing new participants to us, creating a unique value proposition for the future and the option to hedge in the same clearing house for significant margin efficiencies, and the electronification trends has been a virtuous cycle of increased participation both on the futures and options side."

I think to your point, a lot of that turmoil that you are seeing in the marketplace is specific to OTC futures -- to OTC swaps and not futures, excuse me. So -- and as you said, it, on the one hand, helps the futures marketplace, but on the other hand, where the futures marketplace is truly complementary. It may have the potential to actually hurt. Our viewpoint, though, as we have developed futures contract with more and more flexibility built into them such as the swap deliverable futures that we rolled out, the differences are becoming less and less. And so the help to futures will continue on. I think that will be a net positive for us. The issue that the banks and the others that are providing services are facing right now is the initial mispricing of the business. It's how I would say it. And I think this is one of the things that no one knew where the pain points were going to be. Capital increases were not taken into account. I think on the net, when you take these things into account, what's emerging now is a rationalization of the true cost of clearing OTC which cannot be ignored. And so those banks that have decided to get out of the business, I think it's specific to the OTC side. And so that's on the one hand, concentrates, which will be a concern that we should have. The concern that we have here, the exchange is a concentration risk where OTC is being cleared in the hands of very few folks. And the regulator should be concerned about that, too, which leads them to higher capital charges, less participation, which was not what Dodd-Frank had intended, which is a broader participation in the marketplace. So on the whole to sum up what I'm saying, and John has a few things to add here is it helps the futures marketplace. It allows us to innovate more and create more flexible futures contract that meet those marketplace needs without the expense associated with it. And the regulators would still have to start to look at the concentration issues that come about, and this leads them to the guarantee fund issues and all those other fun things. John?"

I'll just -- Alex, a couple of quick points to expand on what Gill is saying. As you're aware, the -- as customers come to the futures markets because they get better capital efficiencies, we have an opportunity to monetize the amount of collateral that they put up into our clearing house because they're able to generate value by putting their positions on in our markets. So as you look at our balance sheet, you'd see that our cash and performance bonds have increased from about $40 billion to about $45 billion. We were able to monetize that in 3 different ways: one, through IEF fees; second, through earning money on the cash float; and we've also implemented a new custody fee. So we were able to charge about $8.6 million net in Q1, which is up from net $7.2 million in Q4 for an increase of about 20%, and that's just another way we're able to help our customers get better capital treatment and then also to CME to benefit as well."

We've -- we take every one of these competitive threats very seriously. We start with the customers, and our focal point, if you heard from us over many of the last quarters' calls has been servicing our customer base, understanding their pain points and addressing that with product capital efficiencies, upper efficiencies, et cetera. We have had no shortage of exchanges come in and try to look at sort of a me-too approach to copying our list of products and our competitor's list of products. What we have found is that unless you're solving a specific customer problem, unless you're creating a solution for a pain point or bottleneck in the operational margin side of the equation, then there's -- it's a -- you've got tough haul. In addition to that, you're seeing a move into an asset class to your point was 2 very robust competitive dynamic market participants already. So what we have found in the feedback from customers is the only value prop we have heard is we're cheaper. Now we've seen that before. We've seen no product differentiation, no technology differentiations, no margin efficiencies. So we're talking to our customers and saying, ""If we're continuing to serve your needs, we will continue to move into new areas of service for you."" So we take every one of these competitive threats seriously, but we're in the process of solving customer approaches. There is an analog here relative to a scene where NASDAQ went after a similar market, Anilex in Europe, thinking that there was an opportunity to bring together disconnected parts of the market with 2 already entrenched participants, and I think you've seen them really struggle. And there were a lot of stipends put out there to create a significant amount of volume. When those stipends disappeared, the volume disappeared. So this will keep us on our game, no question. We saw those volumes drop from over 100,000 ADV down to about 6,000 or 7,000 ADV. So we know this game. We understand the competitive threat. We take it as a form of flattery that we've got folks coming in thinking we've got fabulous products that they want as well. So we're focused on moving into servicing our clients in new ways. We're moving into new developing markets with new unique solutions like we're doing with our NBP and TTF products in CME Europe and other ways to serve our customer base. So that's -- we are absolutely acutely concerned about it. We've seen this before for the NYPC and other attacks, so we're taking it seriously."

We had an impressive second quarter, and the diversity of our product offerings was evident in the results achieved. We delivered significant top line growth in transaction fees and market and data revenue, which coupled with lower expenses, resulted in a 23% increase in earnings per share. After an industry slowdown in April, our volume finished the quarter with June up 15% compared to the prior June. ADV across all 6 product areas were up in June, and 4 of them were up in double digits.
Our commodities portfolio was up 36%, while financial products increased by 12%. In terms of Q2 activity in our commodities portfolio, we saw strong results with ADV up 22% across energy, ags and metal. In ags, we delivered record quarterly volume in corn, soybeans and wheat. The surge in activity was driven by concerns about an El Nino in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, resulting in anticipated increased rain in the U.S. and Brazil, and the potential drought conditions in Australia and Southeast Asia.  The result of price movement, volatility and declining prices has sparked renewed hedging activity in both futures and options.  Energy volumes also performed extremely well in Q2, with ADV up 20%, driven by 32% growth in our crude complex, with 68% of our WTI options now trading electronically on Globex.  In June, nat gas results trended well as volume rose 30% and nat gas options were up 37% as our market share also rose.  Total energy volume and revenue were each up 20%, double that of our primary competitor. 
Within the financial product area, foreign exchange trading growth was significant during the second quarter, rising 42%. FX futures were up 38%, while FX options grew 83%. 
Interest rates volumes accelerated during the quarter from $5.1 million per day in April to $7.4 million during the rest of the quarter. Interest rate activity at CME has performed well relative to substitute products that are out there and were up 7%. Our penetration of the cash treasury market increased from 77% at the end of Q1 to 78% this quarter. In addition, the total number of large institutional open interest holders in our rates futures business grew to 1,705 at the end of the quarter, which is up 7% from the beginning of the year.
We are particularly pleased with activity in Eurodollar options ahead of a potential Fed move. Eurodollar options on Globex were up 60% to 148,000 contracts per day during the quarter and up 84% in June. Importantly, we have seen the percentage of Eurodollar options traded electronically move from 12% in Q2 last year to 18% this year and up to 22% in July.  The biggest driver has been a surge in activity coming from European traders. In addition, we had a record number of weekly treasury options traded in June at 140,000 ADV.
July remains extremely strong as well. Lastly, Fed funds futures have become popular again for the first time since the credit crisis. Volume has tripled from last year so far in 2015. ADV is about 60,000 contracts compared to 20,000 last year. 
During the quarter, our revenue and interest rate swap carrying grew by 36%, while credit swaps clearing was up 11% to total approximately $18 million. We have seen a slowdown of activity in swaps in July, due to the basis spread between CME and LCH. The basis has stabilized and tightened recently. The OTC swaps revenue trajectory for July looked similar to April based on the client mix as the decreases we have seen are mainly in lower-priced OIS trades coming from large hedge fund clients.  On the flip side, we have seen a record number of dealer-to-dealer trades, which is encouraging. 
We continue to look at opportunities to address challenges our customers are facing. There has been a decline in cash market liquidity in the government securities markets, due in part to more stringent capital, leverage and liquidity standards from banks and heightened regulatory scrutiny. And this may have contributed to the increased client use of the treasury futures product. We also had a webinar this Tuesday with a large number of market participants to discuss the concept of filling the 15-year gap between the 6.5-year tracked by our 10-year treasury contracts and the 21.5-year backed by our 30-year long bonds.
Turning to our global business. Work by our staff and volume from outside the U.S. continues to be impressive. Our Q2 electronic trading volume out of Asia jumped 22% from the second quarter last year, with the highest volume growth in our FX and equity product areas. Europe was up 10%, with ag products up 50%, and FX was also strong. North America and Latin America were each up 6%. Electronic volume from outside the U.S. was up 12%, and revenue was up 19%.
Turning to growth in our robust options markets. We continue to invest in system enhancements, new products and investor education which is driving significant usage of our diverse suite of options products. Q2 ADV rose 13% to 2.6 million contracts, with electronic volumes up 29% compared to the prior year.  In July, option volumes remains extremely strong. Overall, 53% of our options traded electronically in June, up from 50% in 2014. As I mentioned on the financial side, we have seen strong growth in Eurodollar options, weekly treasury options and also FX options.
On the commodities portfolio, we have seen strength in WTI options and agricultural products, with July running at peak levels in these commodities. I think that suggests that market participants are anticipating more volatility ahead. After some enhanced volatility in early July with the situation in Greece and large movements in the Chinese equities market, activity has returned to the normal summer vacation mode.  However, the options positioning suggests that market participants are looking ahead. So overall, we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver growth in the highly efficient rate throughout the organization.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

I'm pleased with our results this quarter. We drove double-digit organic revenue growth while our expenses decreased, driving significant operating leverage and EPS growth. Q2 revenue was up 12%, which follows",802,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter. We drove double-digit organic revenue growth while our expenses decreased, driving significant operating leverage and EPS growth. Q2 revenue was up 12%, which follows the 8% revenue growth we delivered in Q1. Volume in the second quarter started slow, but finished exceptionally strong. Our adjusted expenses for the quarter were down 1% from the same quarter last year, driven primarily by decreases in marketing and other costs and professional fees. Our variable costs, license fees and bonus increased due to our improved performance compared to last year. Our operating margins are again above 60% with an adjusted operating margin of 60.5%, which improved from 55% a year ago. Finally, our adjusted EPS grew 23% during the quarter, up from 18% growth in Q1.
I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q1 was $0.777, up from $0.753 last quarter. The largest impact was driven by favorable shift in product mix with record agricultural commodities propelling the RPC higher. The other positives include a larger proportion from higher paying nonmembers in several product areas, lower volume tier impact and lastly, our pricing change that went into effect in February. 
OTC swaps revenue totaled $18 million for the quarter, up 35% versus $13 million last year. During the second quarter, we captured $139 per IRS Cleartrade, an increase from the $130 range which we have been averaging. We cleared approximately 1,950 trades per day in Q2, up 38% from a year ago.
Market data revenue of $103 million was up 15% versus Q2 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of fee waiver program which we have discussed the last few quarters. Fortunately, we saw better-than-expected counts for both grandfathered and full-paying customers in the second quarter. We will continue to monitor the effects of the fee changes. And we currently anticipate about $100 million per quarter of market data revenue for the remainder of 2015 based on potential attrition from here.
Adjusted operating expenses in Q2 were $324 million, down $3.4 million from Q2 last year. We remain extremely focused on driving efficiencies throughout the organization and eliminating redundancy to improve agility and customer market responsiveness. At the end of Q2, we have 2,650 employees, down 20 from the end of Q1 and down 30 from the beginning of the year. In July, we eliminated an additional 60 lower-level positions related to the closure of most of our futures business in Chicago and New York. 
Within the compensation line, our base benefits were down 2% from last year and down 1% from last quarter. Stock-based compensation increased approximately $5 million sequentially. This was driven almost entirely by the performance share component of our equity program, which was based on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 and cash earnings generation during the 3-year period from 2013 through 2015.  Based on the factor tracking well above the 75th percentile of the S&P 500 and total shareholder return as well as being ahead of our cash earnings target, we expect to reach the maximum payout and we accounted for it this quarter. Our compensation ratio for the first half of the year is running an industry-leading 16.5%, down from 17.1% in 2014 and 17.4% in 2015.
Turning to taxes. The effective rate for the quarter was 36.6%. I expect the second half of the year to come in around 37%.
And up to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter and after refinancing our debt, which we covered last quarter, we had $1.33 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. That is approximately $630 million above our $700 million minimum cash target.
During the second quarter, capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowance, totaled $28 million, and we are at $55 million for the year-to-date. We expect full year 2015 CapEx to come in at $140 million, similar to last year and below our original guidance of $150 million.
For the full year, we expect adjusted expenses to be $10 million lower than we have previously guided to at $1.3 billion, down about 1% from last year despite our current double-digit revenue growth.
In summary, the third quarter of 2015 once again demonstrates the power of the CME Group business model. Broad-based volume growth and our disciplined expense management drove adjusted EPS of more than 20%. The entire management team continues to focus on driving earnings growth as they come out of this cycle and returning to maximum amount of capital to our shareholders. In the last few months, we have closed the majority of our futures bids, reduced overall headcount, consolidated data centers and reduced branding-related costs.

So in the 10-year sector, it went from around 0.25 basis point up to a peak of 2.35 basis points. Once the basis jumped, once it widened, CME Group did -- make a decision to issue its own specific CME curve for interest rate swaps. Obviously, that's very prudent from a risk management perspective and also adds massive transparency to the marketplace. We announced that on the -- on May 13. June 8, we implemented a CME-specific curve, and since then, the basis has stabilized dramatically. So since June 8, the average deviation on a daily basis is less than five hundredths of a basis point, so really completely de minimis. If you look at the last week or so, the entire range of that spread has been 1/10 of a basis point on a 10-year trading between 0.9 of a basis points and 1.0 basis points. What that means is that while the volatility was high during early May since we added transparency, since we've added CME-specific curve, the market has completely stabilized. And in terms of interest rate swaps, if you're an active trader, the level of which you get in relative to, let's say, a competitor is not nearly as important to the level we get in versus the level you get out. So what matters is the stability of the spread, and we've seen that. In addition to that with the fluidity of the spread but also with the increased interest in this, we've seen record volumes in dealer-to-dealer trading at CME Group. So we now have 25 dealers trading -- actively trading on that basis, and again it's a very tight level. The bid-offer spread in the interdealer market is again around 5/100s of a basis point. If you think about that relative to outright level of rates, that is 100th, literally 100th, the volatility of the level of outright rates since June 8. In addition to seeing the increased dealer-to-dealer activity, since May 1, we've seen 18 new clients. So we've had 18 new clients, that have never with CME Group previously, jump into the marketplace and to begin to clear swaps here. Many folks wanted to take advantage of the higher rates that they could get in our platform, in addition to that with the higher rate for certain folks, in particular, large issuers of U.S. dollar debt. This may be seen as an advantage. Hence, we've also seen an increased interest on folks that are coming -- numbers at CME Group in particular, the particular issuers of debt."

So when you look about that portfolio, now 53% of our business and options trades electronically. And all that increase in ADV growth quarter-on-quarter is all coming from Globex. Gill briefly mentioned the consistent growth in Eurodollar electronification from 12% last year to 18%. July is 23%. Other notable events, gold options for exampled tripled or doubled in volume last week with a new low in gold. And the options volume went from basically 60% electronic to 80% electronic.

Relative to the MCX move I open on Friday, we've seen this engines and other asset classes over time, whether it was DLX or CFTC or other efforts to come in and sort of on share .  As I talked about in the last call, in the absence of product differentiation, a capital efficiency story. The liquidity diversity of products outside of.

Us, but the client base for M&A from Hong Kong is because they also have touch points in the China. So that would be a very simple broad-based look at what the so-called addressable market that is outside of the U.S.. And another way to think about it is the portion of the global trade volume that the CME Group companies had several years ago is a portion of the global trade volume that we have now. And then the third dimension that I would use is the fixed asset classes and the portfolio that we have in the benchmark there that we have in each of those -- all of those asset classes have a global appeal. And so they, in that sense, make the job of selling these products around the world very easy for us and relative to other exchanges. These factors in total actually are driving the growth that you're seeing, where the quality of markets around the clock, the quality of the product, the global benchmarks and the reach of these products are past 200 countries around the world.

Well, the answer to that question is we are absolutely right company to be setting the position because we have the most at risk on the credibility by marketplace more than anybody else.

We continue to focus on that core. And in particular, how to make the market in which our clients are efficient as they possibly can. So the $18 million, as you point out, belies the fact that there are cross-margining efficiencies. belies effect that there are future-ization opportunities. And it also belies the fact that what I'll call innovation opportunities that exist. So one such innovation has been the liberal swap huge futures, which is the highest of volume traded futures up to this point in time. That innovation will continue. The cross marketing will continue, and education of our clients, which I also have an ongoing cross process. I think taken together, all of these factors will contribute to the growth of the core product. But in addition to the core, you would see a corresponding growth all of this swaps, swaps side. The advent of more liquidity on may help. There may be some DCMs that offer a swap . That might help. But as we have said in the past, many of these swap products are complicated.

In terms of innovation within the products itself, most recent innovation was Mexican peso interest rate swaps, Mexican peso interest rate swaps, now the third most important currency from a revenue perspective. From CME Group, that is the 18th currency that we have. We will be shortly adding the Brazilian reai currency as well, which will be the -- our 19th currency. And we have the broadest set of currencies relative to any of our competition. If you look at so far this year, we've had 46 billion a day in non-USD currencies, which means I think without question the deep penetration CME Group has ever had in the non-U.S. dollar interest rate derivatives market. So it's allowing us from an ecosystem perspective, while the revenues are low, from an ecosystem perspective to massively penetrate global market in new currencies in a way that we've never done before. And getting back to Gill's point, it's the portfolio margin and the growth in core. So 500 clients that we are carrying swaps for, we're on a continuous basis cross-selling them into the futures. Earlier this year, capital -- capital -- excuse me, associates issued a paper, total cost analysis, looking at interest rate swaps versus futures. And very clearly, interest rate futures came out as the low-cost alternative across the board relative to interest rate swaps. And what's that allowed us to do, as we talked about earlier, is if you look at a couple of years ago, our treasury market futures have 65% penetration of the cash conversion market. That's now running at around 78%. So from a relative perspective, we've been able to grow our treasury futures again on a relative basis from 65% to now 77%, 78%, so 13 percentage points. When you think about the size of our interest rate futures market, that's actually quite a large increase in revenues pace we've seen on the back of the cross-sell to those 500 swap participants."

And we do look at redirecting some of those savings towards investments in our growth opportunity. So you'll see, like for example, whether it's in growing our business internationally are whether or not dense investing and our OTC business or whether or not it's investing in electrifying our options, those opportunities are being able to be funded somewhat through managing our core infrastructure. So we feel good about that. In terms of our operating margin, there is no artificial constraint around how high our operating margin can go, I mean other than 100% for a longer period of time. I think our -- I think the way we look at it is we're managing -- we're pulling levers that you could pull, which is making sure we're winning the most efficient engine as we can, and we're also using pricing levers and growing our business through interfacing with our customers. So those are -- that's what we're focused on. We're not focused necessarily on how high our margins can expand. Now historically, we've been as high as 65%, and that was several years ago.

We had an impressive second quarter and the diversity of our product offerings was evident in the results achieved. We delivered significant top line growth in transaction fees and market data revenue, which, coupled with lower expenses, resulted in a 23% increase in earnings per share. After an industry slowdown in April, our volume finished the quarter with June up 15% compared to the prior June. ADV across all 6 product areas were up in June and 4 of them were up in double-digits. Our commodities portfolio was up 36%, while financial products increased by 12%. 
In terms of Q2 activity, in our commodities portfolio, we saw strong results with ADV up 22% across energy, ags and metal. In ags, we delivered record quarterly volume in corn, soybeans and wheat. The surge in activity was driven by concerns of an El Nino in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, resulting in anticipated increased rain in the U.S. and Brazil, and the potential drought conditions in Australia and Southeast Asia. The resulting price movement, volatility and declining prices has sparked renewed hedging activity in both futures and options.
Energy volumes also performed extremely well in Q2, with ADV up 20%, driven by 32% growth in our crude complex, with 68% of our WTI options now trading electronically on Globex. In June, nat gas results trended well as volume rose 30% and nat gas options were up 37% as our market share also rose. Total energy volume and revenue were each up 20%, double that of our primary competitor.
Within the financial product area, foreign exchange trading growth was significant during the second quarter, rising 42%. FX futures were up 38%, while FX options grew 83%.
Interest rates volumes accelerated during the quarter from $5.1 million per day in April to $7.4 million during the rest of the quarter. Interest rate activity at CME has performed well relative to substitute products that were out there and were up 7%. 
Our penetration of the cash treasury market increased from 77% at the end of Q1 to 78% this quarter. In addition, the total number of large institutional open interest holders in our rates futures business grew to 1,705 at the end of the quarter, which is up 7% from the beginning of the year.
We are particularly pleased with the activity in Eurodollar options ahead of a potential Fed move. Eurodollar options on Globex were up 60% to 148,000 contracts per day during the quarter and up 84% in June. Importantly, we have seen the percentage of Eurodollar options traded electronically move from 12% in Q2 last year to 18% this year and up to 22% in July. The biggest driver has been a surge in activity coming from European traders. In addition, we had a record number of weekly treasury options traded in June at 140,000 ADV. July remains extremely strong as well. 
Lastly, Fed funds futures have become popular again for the first time since the credit crisis. Volume has tripled from last year so far in 2015. ADV is above 60,000 contracts compared to 20,000 last year.
During the quarter, our revenue and interest rate swap carrying grew by 36%, while credit swaps swap clearing was up 11% to total approximately $18 million. We have seen a slowdown of activity in swaps in July due to the basis spread between CME and LCH. The basis has stabilized and tightened recently. The OTC swaps revenue trajectory for July looked similar to April based on the client mix, as the decreases we have seen are mainly in lower-priced OIS trades coming from large hedge fund clients. On the flip side, we have seen a record number of dealer-to-dealer trades, which is encouraging.
We continue to look at opportunities to address challenges our customers are facing. There has been a decline in cash market liquidity in the government securities market due in part to more stringent capital, leverage and liquidity standards for banks and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and this may have contributed to the increased client use of the treasury futures product. 
We also had a webinar this Tuesday with a large number of market participants to discuss the concept of filling the 15-year gap between the 6.5-year point tracked by our 10-year treasury contracts and the 21.5-year point tracked by our 30-year long bond.
Turning to our global business. Work by our staff and volume from outside of the U.S. continues to be impressive. Our Q2 electronic trading volume out of Asia jumped 22% from the second quarter last year, with the highest volume growth in our FX and equity product areas. Europe was up 10%, with ag products up 50% and FX was also strong. North America and Latin America were each up 6%. Electronic volume from outside the U.S. was up 12% and revenue was up 19%.
Turning to growth in our robust options market. We continue to invest in system enhancements, new products and investor education which is driving significant usage of our diverse suite of options products. Q2 ADV rose 13% to 2.6 million contracts, with electronic volumes up 29% compared to the prior year. In July, option volumes remained extremely strong. 
Overall, 53% of our options traded electronically in June, up from 50% in 2014. As I mentioned on the financial side, we have seen strong growth in Eurodollar options, weekly treasury options and also FX options.
On the commodities portfolio, we are seeing strength in WTI options and agricultural products, with July running at peak levels in these commodities. I think that suggests that market participants are anticipating more volatility ahead. After some enhanced volatility in early July with the situation in Greece and large movements in the Chinese equities market, activity has returned to the normal summer vacation mode.  However, the options positioning suggests that market participants are looking ahead. 
So overall, we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver growth in a highly efficient rate throughout the organization.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

I'm pleased with our results this quarter. We drove double-digit organic revenue growth while our expenses decreased, driving significant operating leverage and EPS growth. Q2 revenue was up 12%, which follows",812,"Thank you, Gill. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter. We drove double-digit organic revenue growth while our expenses decreased, driving significant operating leverage and EPS growth. Q2 revenue was up 12%, which follows the 8% revenue growth we delivered in Q1. Volume in the second quarter started slow, but finished exceptionally strong. Our adjusted expenses for the quarter were down 1% from the same quarter last year, driven primarily by decreases in marketing and other costs and professional fees. Our variable costs, license fees and bonus increased due to our improved performance compared to last year. Our operating margins are, again, above 60% with an adjusted operating margin of 60.5%, which improved from 55% a year ago. Finally, our adjusted EPS grew 23% during the quarter, up from 18% growth in Q1.
I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q1 was $0.777, up from $0.753 last quarter. The largest impact was driven by a favorable shift in product mix, with record agricultural commodities propelling the RPC higher. The other positives include a larger proportion from higher paying nonmembers in several product areas, lower volume tier impact and lastly, our pricing change that went into effect in February.
OTC swaps revenue totaled $18 million for the quarter, up 35% versus $13 million last year. During the second quarter, we captured $139 per IRS clear trade, an increase from the $130 range which we have been averaging. We cleared approximately 1,950 trades per day in Q2, up 38% from a year ago.
Market data revenue of $103 million was up 15% versus Q2 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program, which we have discussed the last few quarters. Fortunately, we saw better than expected screen counts for both grandfathered and full-paying customers in the second quarter. We will continue to monitor the impacts from the fee changes, and we currently anticipate about $100 million per quarter of market data revenue for the remainder of 2015 based on potential attrition from here.
Adjusted operating expenses in Q2 were $324 million, down $3.4 million from Q2 last year. We remain extremely focused on driving efficiencies throughout the organization and eliminating redundancy to improve agility in customer and market responsiveness. At the end of Q2, we had 2,650 employees, down 20 from the end of Q1 and down 30 from the beginning of the year. In July, we eliminated an additional 60 lower-level positions related to the closure of most of our futures bids in Chicago and New York.
Within the compensation line, our base and benefits were down 2% from last year and down 1% from last quarter. The stock-based compensation increased approximately $5 million sequentially. This was driven almost entirely by the performance share component of our equity program, which is based on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 and cash earnings generation during the 3-year period from 2013 through 2015.  Based on the factor, we're tracking well above the 75th percentile of the S&P 500 in total shareholder return as well as being ahead of our cash earnings target. We expect to reach the maximum payout and we accounted for it this quarter. Our compensation ratio for the first half of the year is running at an industry-leading 16.5%, down from 17.1% in 2014 and 17.4% in 2013.
Turning to taxes. The effective rate for the quarter was 36.6%. I expect the second half of the year to come in around 37%.
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter and after refinancing our debt, which we covered last quarter, we had $1.33 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. That is approximately $630 million above our $700 million minimum cash target.
During the second quarter, capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowance, just totaled $28 million, and we are at $55 million for the year-to-date. We expect full year 2015 CapEx to come in at $140 million, similar to last year and below our original guidance of $150 million.
For the full year, we expect adjusted expenses to be $10 million lower than we had previously guided to at $1.3 billion, down about 1% from last year despite our current double-digit revenue growth.
In summary, the second quarter of 2015 once again demonstrated the power of the CME Group business model. Broad-based volume growth and our disciplined expense management drove adjusted EPS of more than 20%. The entire management team continues to focus on driving earnings growth as we come out of this cycle and returning the maximum amount of capital to our shareholders. In the last few months, we have closed the majority of our futures bids, reduced overall headcount, consolidated data centers and reduced branding-related costs.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

So maybe, could you give us further details on what really is happening here? I do believe Gill mentioned that the spread has narrowed. I think our calculations for that the spread narrowed from about 2 basis points to somewhere in the 1.4 basis point range for a 30-year product. So it has narrowed, but it's still reasonably wide.

So in the 10-year sector, it went from around 0.25 basis point out to a peak of 2.35 basis points. Once the basis jumped, once it widened, CME Group did make the decision to issue its own specific CME curve for interest rate swaps. Yes, obviously, that's very prudent from a risk management perspective, but also adds massive transparency to the marketplace. We announced that on the -- on May 13. June 8, we implemented the CME-specific curve, and since then, the basis has stabilized dramatically. So since June 8, the average standard deviation on a daily basis is less than five hundredths of a basis point, so really completely de minimis. If you look at the last week or so, the entire range of that spread has been 1/10 of a basis point in the 10-year trading between 0.9 of a basis points and 1.0 basis points. What that means is that while the volatility was high during early May since we've added transparency, since we've added a CME-specific curve, the market has completely stabilized. 
And in terms of interest rate swaps, if you're an active trader, the level of which you get in relative to, let's say, a competitor is not nearly as important as the level you get in versus the level you get out. So what matters is the stability of the spread, and we've seen that. 
In addition to that, with the fluidity of the spread, but also with the increased interest in this, we have seen record volumes in dealer-to-dealer trading at CME Group. So we now have 25 dealers trading -- actively trading on that basis. And again, it's at a very tight level. The bid offer spread in the interdealer market is, again, around 5/100s of a basis point. If you think about that relative to outright level of rates, that is 100th, literally 100th the volatility of the level of outright rates since June 8. 
In addition to seeing the increased dealer-to-dealer activity, since May 1, we've seen 18 new clients. So we've had 18 new clients that had never cleared with CME Group previously jump into the marketplace and to begin to clear swaps here. Many folks wanted to take advantage of the higher rates that they could get at our platform. In addition to that, with the higher rate for certain folks, in particular large issuers of U.S. dollar debt, this may be seen as an advantage. Hence, we've also seen an increased interest on folks becoming new clearing members at CME Group, in particular, issuers of debt."

So you -- we currently expect the second half of the year to be approximately the same as the first half. 
We're not giving out any specific statistics around the number of screens, but what I can tell you is that they've been holding relatively flat. So we're pretty comfortable at the $100 million per quarter level. I'll just ask Bryan to kind of chime in, in terms of what he's hearing from the customers as it relates to market data."

I think the relationship with BVMF is extremely strong. It's one of our key relationships around the globe. We work with them across multiple projects, whether it's on the technology side, whether it's on the product side or on the strategic side. So the relationship is really good. 
We are -- globalization is a very key part of our overall strategy.

And what we've committed to work with them is we've got a 10-year commercial relationship with them by which they license our Henry Hub and WTI settlement prices, and they trade futures on the back of that that's settled to our prices. We wanted to expand that, and given the pace of change from a regulatory perspective in India, with the regulators rolling up under one single umbrella under SEBI, we wanted very much to both influence where we can, but also get closer to a strategic partner. So we've launched the commitment, started a number of work streams, one of which is to launch a joint study looking into the feasibility of setting up exchange and clearing operations in the IFSC, International Financial Service Center, in India in the state of Gujarat. 
So it's -- it looks like an interesting opportunity. India is very much opening under the Modi government, and to the point that John maybe thought about country champions.

If you look at growth outside of the U.S., I think from your perspective and you're trying to see what the addressable market is, look at the top 10 exchanges that exist now, and then dial it up back 10 years and look at the top 10 exchanges then. What you will see is a lot of growth, a lot of activity coming from, in particular, the Chinese exchanges in the various part of the globe, the Hong Kong exchange whose derivatives volumes have traditionally been very small, is not a focus for us. But the client base, the M&As from Hong Kong is because they also have touch points into China. So that would be a very simple broad-based look at what the so-called addressable market is outside of the U.S. 
And another way to think about it is that the portion of the global trade volume that the CME Group companies had several years ago was just the portion of the global trade volume that they have now. 
And then, the third dimension that I would use is the fixed asset classes and the portfolio that we have and the benchmark that we have within each of those -- all of those asset classes have a global appeal. And so they, in that sense, make the job of selling these products around the world very easy for us relative to other exchanges. 
These factors, in total, actually are driving the growth that you are seeing, where the quality of the markets around the clock, the quality of the products, global benchmarks and the reach of these products are past 200 countries around the world.

Yesterday at Bryan's meeting, a question came up. And then, I heard this through one of the staff that as a public company, are we the right person to be setting position limits? Well, the answer to that question is we are absolutely the right company to be setting the position limits because we have the most at risk on the credibility by marketplace more than anybody else.

I think if you're looking at the OTC efforts, and if you remember when we first walked down this path, we said that the OTC market was extremely complementary to the core business of CME. We continue to focus on that core. And in particular, how to make the market in which we offer our clients as efficient as we possibly can. So the $18 million, as you pointed out, belies the fact that there are cross margin efficiencies. It belies effect that there are future-ization opportunities. And it also belies the fact that there are what I would call innovation opportunities that exist. So one such innovation has been the deliverable swap, huge futures, which is the highest of volume traded futures up to this point in time. That innovation will continue. The cross margining will continue. And the education of our clients is also an ongoing process. 
I think, taken together, all of these factors will contribute to the growth of not just the core product, but in addition to the core, you would see a corresponding growth on the swaps side. 
The SEF -- the advent of more liquidity on SEF may help. There may be some DCMs that will offer a swap trading, that might help. But as we have said in the past, many of these swap products are complicated. And the way that they trade now, I think seemingly, at least to us, seems to be a rational way to actually trade. The more important thing is once you've done these trades, how can you hold them in the most efficient way possible."

In terms of innovation within the products itself, most recent innovation was Mexican peso interest rate swaps. Mexican peso interest rate swaps, now the third most important currency from a revenue perspective. For CME Group, that is the 18th currency that we have. We will be shortly adding the Brazilian real currency as well, which will be a -- our 19th currency. And we have the broadest set of currencies relative to any of our competition. 
If you look at so far this year, we've had $46 billion a day in non-USD currencies, so I think it's the -- I think, without question, the deepest penetration CME Group has ever had in the non-U.S. dollar interest rate derivatives market. So it's allowing us, from an ecosystem perspective, while the revenues are low, from an ecosystem perspective, to massively penetrate the global market in new currencies in a way that we have never done before. 
And getting back to Gill's point, it's the portfolio margin and the growth of the core. So 500 clients that we are carrying interest rate swaps for, we're, on a continuous basis, cross-selling them into the futures. Earlier this year, Greenwich Capital -- no, not Greenwich Capital, excuse me -- Greenwich Associates issued a paper of total cost analysis, looking at interest rate swaps versus futures. And very clearly, the interest rate futures came out as the lower cost alternative across the board relative to interest rate swaps. And what that's allowed us to do, as we talked about earlier, is if you look at a couple of years ago, our treasury market futures have a 65% penetration of the cash treasury market, that is now running at around 78%. So from a relative perspective, we've been able to grow our treasury futures, again, on a relative basis, from 65% to now 77%, 78%, so 13 percentage points. When you think about the size of our interest rate futures market, that's actually quite a large increase in revenues that we've seen on the back of the cross-sell to those 500 swap participants."

So those are not growth inhibitors. And we do look at redirecting some of those savings towards investments in our growth opportunity. So you'll see, like for example, whether it's growing our business internationally or whether or not it's investing in our OTC business or whether it's investing in electronifying our options, those opportunities are being able to be funded somewhat through managing our core infrastructure. So we feel good about that. 
In terms of our operating margin, we -- there is no artificial constraint around how high our operating margin can go. I mean, other than 100% for a longer period of time. I think our -- I think the way we look at it is we're managing -- we're pulling levers that we could pull, which is making sure we're running the most efficient engine as we can, and we are also using pricing levers and growing our business through interfacing with our customers. So those are the -- that's what we're focused on. We're not focused necessarily on how high our margins can expand. Now -- and historically, we've been as high as 65% and that was several years ago. So that's the way we've been approaching things."

We had an impressive second quarter and the diversity of our product offerings was evident in the results achieved. We delivered significant top line growth in transaction fees and market data revenue, which, coupled with lower expenses, resulted in a 23% increase in earnings per share. After an industry slowdown in April, our volume finished the quarter with June up 15% compared to the prior June. ADV across all 6 product areas were up in June and 4 of them were up in double digits. Our commodities portfolio was up 36%, while financial products increased by 12%. 
In terms of Q2 activity, in our commodities portfolio, we saw strong results with ADV up 22% across energy, ags and metal. In ags, we delivered record quarterly volume in corn, soybeans and wheat. The surge in activity was driven by concerns of an El Nino in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, resulting in anticipated increased rain in the U.S. and Brazil, and the potential drought conditions in Australia and Southeast Asia. The resulting price movement, volatility and declining prices has sparked a renewed hedging activity in both futures and options.
Energy volumes also performed extremely well in Q2, with ADV up 20%, driven by 32% growth in our crude complex, with 68% of our WTI options now trading electronically on Globex. In June, nat gas results trended well as volume rose 30% and nat gas options were up 37% as our market share also rose. Total energy volume and revenue were each up 20%, double that of our primary competitor.
Within the financial product area, foreign exchange trading growth was significant during the second quarter, rising 42%. FX futures were up 38%, while FX options grew 83%.
Interest rates volumes accelerated during the quarter from $5.1 million per day in April to $7.4 million during the rest of the quarter. Interest rate activity at CME has performed well relative to substitute products that were out there and were up 7%. 
Our penetration of the cash treasury market increased from 77% at the end of Q1 to 78% this quarter. In addition, the total number of large institutional open interest holders in our rates futures business grew to 1,705 at the end of the quarter, which is up 7% from the beginning of the year.
We are particularly pleased with the activity in Eurodollar options ahead of a potential Fed move. Eurodollar options on Globex were up 60% to 148,000 contracts per day during the quarter and up 84% in June. Importantly, we have seen the percentage of Eurodollar options traded electronically move from 12% in Q2 last year to 18% this year and up to 22% in July. The biggest driver has been a surge in activity coming from European traders. In addition, we had a record number of weekly treasury options traded in June at 140,000 ADV. July remains extremely strong as well. 
Lastly, Fed funds futures have become popular again for the first time since the credit crisis. Volume has tripled from last year so far in 2015. ADV is above 60,000 contracts compared to 20,000 last year.
During the quarter, our revenue and interest rate swap clearing grew by 36%, while credit swaps swap clearing was up 11% to total approximately $18 million. We have seen a slowdown of activity in swaps in July due to the basis spread between CME and LCH. The basis has stabilized and tightened recently. The OTC swaps revenue trajectory for July looked similar to April based on the client mix, as the decreases we have seen are mainly in lower-priced OIS trades coming from large hedge fund clients. On the flip side, we have seen a record number of dealer-to-dealer trades, which is encouraging.
We continue to look at opportunities to address challenges our customers are facing. There has been a decline in cash market liquidity in the government securities market due in part to more stringent capital, leverage and liquidity standards for banks and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and this may have contributed to the increased client use of the treasury futures product. 
We also had a webinar this Tuesday with a large number of market participants to discuss the concept of filling the 15-year gap between the 6.5-year point tracked by our 10-year treasury contracts and the 21.5-year point tracked by our 30-year long bond.
Turning to our global business. Work by our staff and volume from outside of the U.S. continues to be impressive. Our Q2 electronic trading volume out of Asia jumped 22% from the second quarter last year, with the highest volume growth in our FX and equity product areas. Europe was up 10%, with ag products up 50% and FX was also strong. North America and Latin America were each up 6%. Electronic volume from outside the U.S. was up 12% and revenue was up 19%.
Turning to growth in our robust options market. We continue to invest in system enhancements, new products and investor education, which is driving significant usage of our diverse suite of options products. Q2 ADV rose 13% to 2.6 million contracts, with electronic volumes up 29% compared to the prior year. In July, option volumes remained extremely strong. 
Overall, 53% of our options traded electronically in June, up from 50% in 2014. As I mentioned on the financial side, we have seen strong growth in Eurodollar options, weekly treasury options and also FX options.
On the commodities portfolio, we are seeing strength in WTI options and agricultural products, with July running at peak levels in these commodities. I think that suggests that market participants are anticipating more volatility ahead. After some enhanced volatility in early July with the situation in Greece and large movements in the Chinese equities market, activity has returned to the normal summer vacation mode.  However, the options positioning suggests that market participants are looking ahead. 
So overall, we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver growth in a highly efficient rate throughout the organization.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

I'm pleased with our results this quarter. We drove double-digit organic revenue growth while our expenses decreased, driving significant operating leverage and EPS growth. Q2 revenue was up 12%, which follows",812,"Thank you, Gill. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter. We drove double-digit organic revenue growth while our expenses decreased, driving significant operating leverage and EPS growth. Q2 revenue was up 12%, which follows the 8% revenue growth we delivered in Q1. Volume in the second quarter started slow, but finished exceptionally strong. Our adjusted expenses for the quarter were down 1% from the same quarter last year, driven primarily by decreases in marketing and other costs and professional fees. Our variable costs, license fees and bonus increased due to our improved performance compared to last year. Our operating margins are, again, above 60% with an adjusted operating margin of 60.5%, which improved from 55% a year ago. Finally, our adjusted EPS grew 23% during the quarter, up from 18% growth in Q1.
I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q1 was $0.777, up from $0.753 last quarter. The largest impact was driven by a favorable shift in product mix, with record agricultural commodities propelling the RPC higher. The other positives include a larger proportion from higher paying nonmembers in several product areas, lower volume tier impact and lastly, our pricing change that went into effect in February.
OTC swaps revenue totaled $18 million for the quarter, up 35% versus $13 million last year. During the second quarter, we captured $139 per IRS clear trade, an increase from the $130 range, which we have been averaging. We cleared approximately 1,950 trades per day in Q2, up 38% from a year ago.
Market data revenue of $103 million was up 15% versus Q2 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program, which we have discussed the last few quarters. Fortunately, we saw better than expected screen counts for both grandfathered and full-paying customers in the second quarter. We will continue to monitor the impacts from the fee changes, and we currently anticipate about $100 million per quarter of market data revenue for the remainder of 2015 based on potential attrition from here.
Adjusted operating expenses in Q2 were $324 million, down $3.4 million from Q2 last year. We remain extremely focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization and eliminating redundancy to improve agility in customer and market responsiveness. At the end of Q2, we had 2,650 employees, down 20 from the end of Q1 and down 30 from the beginning of the year. In July, we eliminated an additional 60 lower-level positions related to the closure of most of our futures bids in Chicago and New York.
Within the compensation line, our base and benefits were down 2% from last year and down 1% from last quarter. The stock-based compensation increased approximately $5 million sequentially. This was driven almost entirely by the performance share component of our equity program, which is based on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 and cash earnings generation during the 3-year period from 2013 through 2015.  Based on the factor, we're tracking well above the 75th percentile of the S&P 500 in total shareholder return as well as being ahead of our cash earnings target. We expect to reach the maximum payout and we accounted for it this quarter. Our compensation ratio for the first half of the year is running at an industry-leading 16.5%, down from 17.1% in 2014 and 17.4% in 2013.
Turning to taxes. The effective rate for the quarter was 36.6%. I expect the second half of the year to come in around 37%.
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter and after refinancing our debt, which we covered last quarter, we had $1.33 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. That is approximately $630 million above our $700 million minimum cash target.
During the second quarter, capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowance, just totaled $28 million, and we are at $55 million for the year-to-date. We expect full year 2015 CapEx to come in at $140 million, similar to last year and below our original guidance of $150 million.
For the full year, we expect adjusted expenses to be $10 million lower than we had previously guided to at $1.3 billion, down about 1% from last year despite our current double-digit revenue growth.
In summary, the second quarter of 2015 once again demonstrated the power of the CME Group business model. Broad-based volume growth and our disciplined expense management drove adjusted EPS of more than 20%. The entire management team continues to focus on driving earnings growth as we come out of this cycle and returning the maximum amount of capital to our shareholders. In the last few months, we have closed the majority of our futures bids, reduced overall headcount, consolidated data centers and reduced branding-related costs.

So in the 10-year sector, it went from around 0.25 of a basis point out to a peak of 2.35 basis points. Once the basis jumped, once it widened, CME Group did make the decision to issue its own specific CME curve for interest rate swaps. Yes, obviously, that's very prudent from a risk management perspective, but also adds massive transparency to the marketplace. We announced that on the -- on May 13. June 8, we implemented the CME-specific curve, and since then, the basis has stabilized dramatically. So since June 8, the average standard deviation on a daily basis is less than 5 hundredths of a basis point, so really completely de minimis. If you look at the last week or so, the entire range of that spread has been 1/10 of a basis point in the 10-year trading between 0.9 of a basis points and 1.0 basis points. What that means is that while the volatility was high during early May since we've added transparency, since we've added a CME-specific curve, the market has completely stabilized. 
And in terms of interest rate swaps, if you're an active trader, the level at which you get in relative to, let's say, a competitor is not nearly as important as the level you get in versus the level you get out. So what matters is the stability of the spread, and we've seen that. 
In addition to that, with the fluidity [ph] of the spread, but also with the increased interest in this, we have seen record volumes in dealer-to-dealer trading at CME Group. So we now have 25 dealers trading -- actively trading on that basis. And again, it's at a very tight level. The bid offer spread in the interdealer market is, again, around 5/100s of a basis point. If you think about that relative to outright level of rates, that is 100th, literally 100th the volatility of the level of outright rates since June 8. 
In addition to seeing the increased dealer-to-dealer activity, since May 1, we've seen 18 new clients. So we've had 18 new clients that had never cleared with CME Group previously jump into the marketplace and to begin to clear swaps here. Many folks wanted to take advantage of the higher rates that they could get at our platform. In addition to that, with the higher rate for certain folks, in particular large issuers of U.S. dollar debt, this may be seen as an advantage. Hence, we've also seen an increased interest on folks becoming new clearing members at CME Group, in particular, issuers of debt."

Our investment in education, in analytics, in technology is allowing us to not only continue to grow our business, but all the electronic -- all the growth is coming electronically right now. And so when you look at the aggregate portfolio, now 53% of our business and options trades electronically, and all that increase in ADV growth quarter-on-quarter is all coming on Globex. Gill briefly mentioned that the consistent growth in Eurodollar electronification from 12% last year to 18%, July is 23%. Other notable events, gold options, for example, tripled -- or doubled in volume last week with a new low in gold. And the options volume went from basically 60% electronic to 80% electronic.

If you look at growth outside of the U.S., I think from your perspective and you're trying to see what the addressable market is, look at the top 10 exchanges that exist now, and then dial it out back 10 years and look at the top 10 exchanges then. What you will see is a lot of growth, a lot of activity coming from, in particular, the Chinese exchanges in the various part of the globe, the Hong Kong exchange whose derivatives volumes have traditionally been very small, is not a focus for us. But the client base, the M&As from Hong Kong is because they also have touch points into China. So that would be a very simple broad-based look at what the so-called addressable market is outside of the U.S. And another way to think about it is that the portion of the global trade volume that the CME Group companies had several years ago was just the portion of the global trade volume that they have now. And then, the third dimension that I would use is the fixed asset classes and the portfolio that we have and the benchmark that we have within each of those -- all of those asset classes have a global appeal. And so they, in that sense, make the job of selling these products around the world very easy for us relative to other exchanges. These factors, in total, actually are driving the growth that you are seeing, where the quality of the markets around the clock, the quality of the products, our global benchmarks and the reach of these products are past 200 countries around the world. Bryan, anything to add?"

Because there was a CFTC advisory committee meeting yesterday on the topic.

I'm looking at what's been proposed today, how it would be very restrictive in the context and impactful, we believe, to the liquidity and performance of these markets if the current proposed language for hedge exemptions were to become finalized.

Let me just add to what Bryan said because I did put this in my testimony also yesterday to make certain that we cannot have a position limits regime that's different than the rest of the world that make the U.S. anticompetitive because one of the great benefits we have is discovering price in this country. Yesterday at Bryan's meeting, a question came up. And then, I heard this through one of the staff that as a public company, are we the right person to be setting position limits? Well, the answer to that question is we are absolutely the right company to be setting the position limits because we have the most at risk on the credibility of our marketplace more than anybody else. So we are -- we have the expertise to do it, as Bryan has outlined. And of course, the credibility issue is what we're all about.

I think if you're looking at the OTC efforts, and if you remember when we first walked down this path, we said that the OTC market was extremely complementary to the core business of CME. We continue to focus on that core. And in particular, how to make the market in which we offer our clients as efficient as we possibly can. So the $18 million, as you point out, belies the fact that there are cross margin efficiencies. It belies effect that there are futurization opportunities. And it also belies the fact that there are what I would call innovation opportunities that exist. So one such innovation has been the deliverable swap, huge futures, which is the highest of volume traded futures up to this point in time. That innovation will continue. The cross margining will continue. And the education of our clients is also an ongoing process. I think, taken together, all of these factors will contribute to the growth of not just the core product, but in addition to the core, you would see a corresponding growth on the swaps side. The SEF -- the advent of more liquidity on SEFs may help. There may be some DCMs that will offer a swap trading, that might help. But as we have said in the past, many of these swap products are complicated. And the way that they trade now, I think seemingly, at least to us, seems to be a rational way to actually trade. The more important thing is once you've done these trades, how can you hold them in the most efficient way possible."

In terms of innovation within the products itself, most recent innovation was Mexican peso interest rate swaps. Mexican peso interest rate swaps, now the third most important currency from a revenue perspective. For CME Group, that is the 18th currency that we have. We will be shortly adding the Brazilian real currency as well, which will be a -- our 19th currency. And we have the broadest set of currencies relative to any of our competition. If you look at so far this year, we've had $46 billion a day in non-USD currencies, so I think it's the -- I think, without question, the deepest penetration CME Group has ever had in the non-U.S. dollar interest rate derivatives market. So it's allowing us, from an ecosystem perspective, while the revenues are low, from an ecosystem perspective, to massively penetrate the global market in new currencies in a way that we have never done it before. And getting back to Gill's point, it's the portfolio margin and the growth of the core. So 500 clients that we are carrying interest rate swaps for, we're, on a continuous basis, cross-selling them into the futures. Earlier this year, Greenwich Capital -- no, not Greenwich Capital, excuse me -- Greenwich Associates issued a paper of total cost analysis, looking at interest rate swaps versus futures. And very clearly, the interest rate futures came out as the lower cost alternative across the board relative to interest rate swaps. And what that's allowed us to do, as we talked about earlier, is if you look at a couple of years ago, our treasury market futures have a 65% penetration of the cash treasury market. That’s now running at around 78%. So from a relative perspective, we've been able to grow our treasury futures, again, on a relative basis, from 65% to now 77%, 78%, so 13 percentage points. When you think about the size of our interest rate futures market, that's actually quite a large increase in revenues that we've seen on the back of the cross-sell to those 500 swap participants."

So those are not growth inhibitors. And we do look at redirecting some of those savings towards investments in our growth opportunity. So you'll see, like for example, whether it's growing our business internationally or whether or not it's investing in our OTC business or whether it's investing in electronifying our options, those opportunities are being able to be funded somewhat through managing our core infrastructure. So we feel good about that. In terms of our operating margin, we -- there is no artificial constraint around how high our operating margin can go. I mean, other than 100% for a longer period of time. I think our -- I think the way we look at it is we're managing -- we're pulling levers that we could pull, which is making sure we're running the most efficient engine as we can, and we are also using pricing levers and growing our business through interfacing with our customers. So those are the -- that's what we're focused on. We're not focused necessarily on how high our margins can expand. Now -- and historically, we've been as high as 65% and that was several years ago.

We had an outstanding third quarter across the board. We delivered significant topline growth in transaction fees and market data revenue, which coupled with solid expense control, resulted in a 21% increase in adjusted earnings per share.
We continue to benefit from revenue strength that is fairly balanced. 
Total transaction fee revenue growth for the third quarter was 12%.
Commodity products were 14% higher and financial products were up 10%. 
I will go through the highlights of these 2 segments for the quarter and then, I'll touch our growth initiatives.
Starting with commodities. All 3 product areas were up double-digits in terms of volume. Within energy, average daily volume was up 26%, driven by more than 30% growth in our crude business, while natural gas and refine products have done well, up 9% in total. 
Our WTI futures and options volume was up 39% in Q3, while the other major crude offering traded at a competitor was up 7%. 
Recently, the Goldman Sachs commodity index primarily re-ratings were released. The WTI tonight futures are now the largest component and represent in the 3% of the total index, which clearly reflects our clients choice in risk management tools among our crude oil liquidity pools. 
Additionally, our WTI options increased by 50% for the quarter.
Turning to AGS, we're tracking for a record volume year. During the third quarter, our ag volume was up 20% with continued strength after a record quarter in Q2. 
Some highlights include corn, which was up 40% year-over-year, and wheat, which was up 29%. Within metals, precious metals rose 12%, while the smaller base metals grew by 26%.
During the quarter, we continue to rollout innovative new commodities products. We announced at South American Short-Dated Soybean options contract offering South American producers a flexible and cost-effective tool to manage new crop price risk. 
And on the back of our success in the copper business, which is up 26% in Q3, we continue to expand our base metals products suite. 
In addition to launching zinc futures, we are also launching a global physically delivered lead contract with U.S. and European delivery points as well as new aluminum European premium futures following success with our U.S. Midwest premium futures.
On the European Energy side, we launched a suite of European power contracts to complement the European gas futures that we launch in January, which will be further enhanced by European emissions futures that we plan to launch in the next month. 
I will touch on some interesting new partnerships in a few minutes.
Moving onto our financial products. We had an impressive quarter in our equity business with volume up 27%, driven by increased volatility. 
Equity options growth during the quarter was 32%. During the month of August, we had the 2 higher days ever in our equities options products with both days above 1.9 million contracts. 
Within interest rates and FX, we have seen some slowdown in activity as a result of the expectations over Fed move being pushed out several months. We have seen that before and the opportunity remains in front of us. 
We continue to innovate and believe, we are well-positioned in those products. CME Fed funds futures volumes have tripled and open interest has doubled this year as the market has used the Fed funds futures contracts to manage risk in relation to uncertainty of fed rate hikes. 
The CME's FedWatch tools that translate Fed funds futures prices into probability of rate moves by the FOMC, gives more than 30% chance of the rate move in December and over 50% chance of a rate move by March of 2016.
From a growth perspective, a couple of important points. In early August, we were pleased to announce the licensing deal with FTSE Russell Indexes and we look forward to driving growth in these products. 
We have already launched futures on the Russell 1000, Russell 1000 growth and value, FTSE 100 emerging markets, and FTSE China 50 Indexes and other products. 
We will be rolling out the FTSE emerging markets, the FTSE developed Europe in 2016 and most importantly, the Russell 2000 in 2017. In addition, on November 16, we plan to launch S&P dividend index futures as well as introducing the so-called Bases Trade Index at close or BTIC functionality to the S&P 500, NASDAQ and Dow Jones Index futures. 
Within interest rates. Last week, we announced plans to launch the Ultra 10-year treasury note futures and options contract, which I alluded to last quarter. This contract provides hedging and spreading opportunities at the true 10-year point of the treasury yield curve. 
Market participants approached us in the first half of this year and suggested that we look at a futures contract that can provide deep liquidity and capital and margin efficiencies of the treasury futures complex to the highly traded 10-year point on the treasury yield curve. 
CME conducted an extensive market valuation process of 3 potential contract designs. We found great enthusiasm, interest and deep held views on the design and usefulness from market participants. 
The design announcement for the new Ultra 10-year futures has received a significant positive feedback from our customers.
Looking at our global business. We had the best quarter ever in terms of volume and percentage of total volume from outside the U.S. 
The total electronic average daily volume for the quarter of 3.2 million contracts was up 15% from the prior year.
In addition, the total electronic volume traded from outside of the U.S. exceeded 25% for the first time and revenue from outside of the U.S. represented 32% of the total. 
Our interest rate business has been particularly strong outside the U.S. as electronic revenue has grown from 31% in Q3 last year to 37% this quarter. 
We continue to establish global partnerships, particularly in Asia over the last few months. We announced an exclusive license arrangement with Rim Intelligence, a leading provider of pricing data in Japan, to develop and clear energy derivatives based on their LNG data. Secondly, we signed an MOU with MCX, India's leading commodity exchange elected to product development, market allegation and the licensing agreement for rupee denominated oil and gas contracts based on NYMEX prices. 
We have made 3 noteworthy announcements with Chinese entities. We announced an index development and product licensing agreement with China securities index company for commodity index development. 
We have signed an agreement with CFTC, China's largest marketplace for interest rate and foreign exchange products related to joint development and innovation of offshore, renminbi and related products.
As part of the agreement, CFTC will help facilitate China Interbank market participants to trade CME Group's products. And finally, last week, we signed an MOU with China construction bank to offer offshore Chinese RMB futures contracts with physical delivery in London for the first time, which will be offered by CME Europe. 
We believe our cooperative efforts will continue to unlock opportunities for our shareholders as we continue to grow our customer base and volume around the world.
Turning to our options business. As you know, we have invested in system enhancements, new products, and investor education, which are driving significant usage of over the pursuit of options products. Q3 options volume reached a record level of 2.9 million contracts per day. We also saw the highest percentage of this business trading electronically, which reached 55% electronic during the quarter. One of the key drivers of our continued electronic options success is on investment in enabling more complex options spread to trade on Globex. In Q3, we saw a record 45% of all option spreads trade electronically versus just 10% in 2010. And volume in the world's largest major options contracts, our Eurodollar options traded on Globex jumped by more than 60% to a record 200,000 contracts per day in Q3 and reached 21% electronic versus 14% a year ago. 
In summary, we continue to deliver strong results, but more importantly, we are intensely focus on running the business as efficiently as we can while laying the foundation for future growth in the years to come. I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."

Our adjusted operating margin of 62.7% was the highest level we",865,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. 
CME had a strong quarter, another great job by the team on both the revenue and expense side with revenue up 12% and expenses basically flat. 
Our adjusted operating margin of 62.7% was the highest level we have seen since 2011. 
Finally, our adjusted EPS grew 21% during the quarter compared to the prior year driven by organic growth.
I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.759, down from $0.777 last quarter, driven primarily, by a product shift from AGS to equities, volume discounts and a drop in the energy RPC as a result of the contract mix. In September, within energy, we saw a significant increase in our small size power contracts, which accounted for 8% of the energy volume for that month or a 161,000 contracts per day. 
During the second quarter, the power contracts accounted for less than 1 half of 1% of the volume, and for Q3 that jumped up to 5% at an average of $0.06 per contract.
Cleared swaps revenue totaled $16.3 million for the quarter. We captured a $166 per IRS cleared trade, higher than we've seen in prior quarters due to our customer mix. 
We cleared approximately 1,370 trades per day in Q3. 
Market data revenue of $99.5 million was up 13% versus Q3 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program, which we have discussed the last few quarters. This came in slightly below our guidance and we would expect it to dip slightly in Q4. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter were $317 million, down from last year. We remain extremely focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization and eliminating redundancy to continue to improve agility, and customer and market responsiveness. 
At the end of the quarter, we had 2,525 employees, down 5% from 3 months ago, driven by our futures pit closures in July and staff reductions in August. 
Our headcount is down 11% from the same quarter last year. Stock-based compensation cost came in below our normal run rate primarily, due to higher forfeiture on expenses we previously recognized. 
After some variability in our stock-based compensation in the last 2 quarters, we expect to revert to a run rate of approximately $50 million per quarter. Modest fluctuations may result in future periods, due to some changes in expectations regarding achievement of performance shared targets.
Our composition ratio year-to-date is running at an industry leading 16.1%, down from 17.1% in 2014 and 17.4% in 2013. 
During the quarter, it came in at 15.4%. 
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line, our ownership in the S&P, Dow Jones joint venture drove the $26.6 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was up 33% from the prior year. 
We remain pleased with the investment we made in the index business, while also assuring, we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME. 
Turning to taxes, the effective rate for the quarter was 36.3%. 
I expect the fourth quarter to be approximately 37% for a full year tax rate of 36.6%.
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.61 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. 
That is approximately $910 million above our $700 million minimum cash target. During the third quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances was $30 million. And year-to-date CapEx is totaled $85 million. We expect full year 2015 CapEx to be back and loaded in Q4, and should come in lower than we expected at approximately $125 million.
For the full year expenses, we initially guided to $1.31 billion, which we reduced by $10 million last quarter, and I'm going to reduce that by another $5 million to $1.295 billion. This includes absorbing a $12 million increase in license fees so far this year based on volume growth. 
The guidance would result in a 2% expense reduction in Q4 compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis. 
As we mention at this time every year, we have a large amount of marketing and customer related spend in the fourth quarter that will drive the sequential increase from Q3.
Finally, we communicated and adjusted 2016 transaction fee schedule across all 6 product areas to our customers last week. We expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 2%, assuming the same volume levels and product mix next year.
In summary, the third quarter of 2015 once again, demonstrated the power of CME Group's business model. Broad-based volume growth from our diverse product set and our disciplined expense management drove adjusted EPS up more than 20%, continuing our growth in the first half of the year. 
We also continue to generate a significant amount of excess cash, which we plan to return to our shareholders.
With that, we would like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of an issue cover us, we are that you limit yourself to 1 question, so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue if you have any further questions. Thank you."

And we'd anticipated being slightly lower again in the fourth quarter. We are keeping a strong eye on it as we go into next year. As you know, those that were grandfathered will now be paying the full, the full freight amount, which is approximately double what they are paying today. 
We don't have any guidance on that as yet. We are working with our clients to make sure that we keep that any attrition down to as low as possible. 
In terms of expenses, we're going through the budgeting process now. As you can imagine, we are focused strongly on expenses and will be giving guidance in the -- during the first quarter or -- I'm sorry, end of the year conference call in January. 
In terms of expenses, we're down about 2% based on our guidance in the fourth quarter. 
Again, we're focused on expenses going into next year. And we will be making sure that we're optimizing the entire expense base during the budgeting process. As it relates to stock-based compensation, what you saw this quarter was a an adjustment because the grant date and the vesting date for the stock awards occurs annually in September, and that, the forfeiture rates are updated at this time, and because of the actions we've taken over the last few years, we had to adjust to reflect the reduced number of employees. 
We're anticipating going back to approximately a $15 million run rate on stock-based compensation, but there will be some variability in it going into next year because of the portion of performance related stock awards will cause some fluctuation because they adjust, both based on our performance as well as performance of the S&P 500 or a group of peer companies."

I will take the first one and then Sean can comment on ultra 10-year, that's a definitely product we're excited about. Just with regard to the energy RPC with the small sized, smaller priced power contract, I can understand that the disconnects. Energy RPC fell about $0.08 compared to last quarter. The RPC again was driven by those smaller sized lower priced contracts, and the bulk of that all occurred in the month of September. 
I think when you take a look at the quarter, the ADV for power contracts this quarter was about 91,000, up from the ADV of about 5000 last quarter. So if you normalized out the RPC for those power contracts, it's about $1.25 on everything else. So that's the impact.

I think the important thing is, even with these lower sized, lower-priced contracts, our energy revenue was up 17% this quarter. So we're really pleased with how energy has been performing. And now I turn over to Sean to talk about the TN."

So in terms of TN, we are obviously very excited about that. There was an opportunity, participants came to us relative to earlier this year, the bond future jumped what we call the 5-year gap in terms of the maturity spectrum of U.S. Treasury bonds. 
So with that, the TY future now has achieved to deliver of 7 years, and the bond future has achieved to deliver of 21 year, leaving a very wide gap for additional products. So with customer feedback, we -- extensive customer feedback and excitement, we did decide to -- do that we will launch the end or a 10 year future that achieved to deliver basket of 9.5 to 10 years. So it's very positive feedback. We think it's a product that the marketplace has high demand for. Now obviously, very uncertain as to what the uptake will be, we opportunity for basis trading between that and other products. As you mentioned also and was mentioned during the script, several new equity products, right, so Russell 1000, Russell 1000 growth and value, the FTSE 100, FTSE emerging markets, FTSE China 50 have already been launched related to our agreement with FTSE Russell to be their partner in terms of this products. And then we're very excited in 2017 to launch the absolute thousand. In terms of BTIG or basis trade index close, we're excited about this. This is the first time we're going to be offering that on Globex. Previous it has been a product that has been available in terms of block trading. What this does is, it allows index driven asset managers to trade at exactly or a basis to index close every day, making it extremely efficient for matching their index. So we're very excited about, we had a very positive feedback obviously, there is uncertainty as to how much update you are going to get in the product."

The open interest down a little bit, we had a huge, if you look at last year, October of last year was an absolutely phenomenal period of time. Let's recall for example, in rates what happened. Last year, our rates complex was up 19% in terms of the ADV and if you look at October of last year, we had a number of driven; we had a surprise easing by the ECB, we had potential for Greek exit, and we had the all-time record on October 15th of last year in terms of the exchange volumes. And that was in part due to the huge open interest at that time. If you recall, interest rates future on day alone we did over 25 million contracts. So we got some very tough comps right now. 
But in addition to that, the helpfulness of our business continues to grow without question. So looking at that in terms of large open interest holders and our investor conference, we have reached an all time record in August. In terms of our FX complex, we also reached an all time record in large open interest holders in August. And the trend in large open interest holders continues to increase and penetration of alternative markets continues to increase. So if you look for example, at our treasury comp is, one thing that we do talk about pretty often is the percentage of treasury futures that trade relative to the cash bond market. Just as a collection in 2013 that was 60%, in 2014, it was 65%, in 2015, we're running at 78%. So all the indications are very healthy marketplace. So I'm focused on the financials.

So while we're seeing some short-term gyrations largely in the options side, which is fairly typical actually, it's much more volatile in the options OI, than the futures OI, we're appointing new guys to some flat on the commodities open interest holding picture here as well. Particularly on Page 23, on the energy side, if you look at year-on-year, our large open interest is up almost 7.5% year-on-year. So the quality and the number of participants holding significant positions with us is equally important to us at the short-term gyrations in the options side."

We had an outstanding third quarter across the board. We delivered significant topline growth in transaction fees and market data revenue, which, coupled with solid expense control, resulted in a 21% increase in adjusted earnings per share.
We continue to benefit from revenue strength that is fairly balanced.
Total transaction fee revenue growth for the third quarter was 12%.
Commodity products were 14% higher and financial products were up 10%.
I will go through the highlights of these 2 segments for the quarter, and then, I'll touch on our growth initiatives.
Starting with commodities. All 3 product areas were up double digits in terms of volume. Within energy, average daily volume was up 26%, driven by more than 30% growth in our crude business, while natural gas and refine products have done well, up 9% in total.
Our WTI futures and options volume was up 39% in Q3, while the other major crude offering traded at a competitor was up 70%.
Recently, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index primarily reweightings were released. The WTI futures are now the largest component and represent 23% of the total index, which clearly reflects our clients choice in risk management tools among our crude oil liquidity pools. Additionally, our WTI options increased by 50% for the quarter.
Turning to ags. We're tracking for a record volume year. During the third quarter, our ag volume was up 20% with continued strength after a record quarter in Q2.
Some highlights include corn, which was up 40% year-over-year, and wheat, which was up 29%. Within metals, precious metals rose 12%, while the smaller base metals grew by 26%.
During the quarter, we continued to roll out innovative new commodities products. We announced a South American Short-Dated Soybean Option contract, offering South American producers a flexible and cost-effective tool to manage new crop price risk.
And on the back of our success in the copper business, which is up 26% in Q3, we continue to expand our base metals product suite.
In addition to launching zinc futures, we are also launching a global physically-delivered lead contract with U.S. and European delivery points as well as new aluminum European premium futures following success with our U.S. Midwest premium futures.
On the European Energy side, we launched a suite of European power contracts to complement the European gas futures that we launch in January, which will be further enhanced by European emissions futures that we plan to launch in the next month. I will touch on some interesting new partnerships in a few minutes.
Moving onto our financial products. We had an impressive quarter in our equity business with volume up 27%, driven by increased volatility.
Equity options growth during the quarter was 32%. During the month of August, we had the 2 higher days ever in our equities option products with both days above 1.9 million contracts.
Within interest rates and FX, we have seen some slowdown in activity as a result of the expectations over Fed move being pushed out several months. We have seen that before and the opportunity remains in front of us.
We continue to innovate and believe, we are well positioned in those products. CME Fed Funds futures volumes have tripled and open interest has doubled this year as the market has used the Fed Funds futures contracts to manage risk in relation to uncertainty of Fed rate hikes.
The CME's FedWatch tool that translate Fed Funds futures prices into probability of rate moves by the FOMC gives a more than 30% chance of a rate move in December and over 50% chance of a rate move by March of 2016.
From a growth perspective, a couple of important points. In early August, we were pleased to announce the licensing deal with FTSE Russell Indexes, and we look forward to driving growth in these products.
We have already launched futures on the Russell 1000, Russell 1000 growth and value, FTSE 100 emerging markets and FTSE China 50 Indexes and other products.
We will be rolling out the FTSE emerging markets, the FTSE developed Europe in 2016, and most importantly, the Russell 2000 in 2017. In addition, on November 16, we plan to launch S&P dividend index futures as well as introducing the so-called Basis Trade Index at close or BTIC functionality to the S&P 500, NASDAQ and Dow Jones Index futures.
Within interest rates, last week, we announced plans to launch the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures and options contract, which I alluded to last quarter. This contract provides hedging and spreading opportunities at the true 10-year point of the treasury yield curve.
Market participants approached us in the first half of this year and suggested that we look at a futures contract that can provide deep liquidity and capital and margin efficiencies of the treasury futures complex to the highly traded 10-year point on the treasury yield curve.
CME conducted an extensive market valuation process of 3 potential contract designs. We found great enthusiasm, interest and deeply held views on the design and usefulness from market participants. The design announcement for the new Ultra 10-year futures has elicited a significant positive feedback from our customers.
Looking at our global business. We had the best quarter ever in terms of volume and percentage of total volume from outside the U.S.
The total electronic average daily volume for the quarter of 3.2 million contracts was up 15% from the prior year.
In addition, the total electronic volume traded from outside of the U.S. exceeded 25% for the first time and revenue from outside of the U.S. represented 32% of the total. Our interest rate business has been particularly strong outside the U.S. as electronic revenue has grown from 31% in Q3 last year to 37% this quarter.
We continue to establish global partnerships, particularly in Asia over the last few months. We announced an exclusive license arrangement with Rim Intel -- Intelligence, a leading provider of pricing data in Japan, to develop and clear energy derivatives based on their LNG data. Secondly, we signed an MOU with MCX, India's leading commodity exchange related to product development, market allegation and the licensing agreement for rupee-denominated oil and gas contracts based on NYMEX prices.
We have made 3 noteworthy announcements with Chinese entities. We announced an index development and product licensing agreement with China Securities Index Company for commodity index development. We signed an agreement with CFETS, China's largest marketplace for interest rate and foreign exchange products related to joint development and innovation of offshore renminbi and related products. As part of the agreement, CFETS will help facilitate China Interbank market participants to trade CME Group's products. And finally, last week, we signed an MOU with China Construction Bank to offer offshore Chinese RMB futures contract with physical delivery in London for the first time, which will be offered by CME Europe.
We believe our cooperative efforts will continue to unlock opportunities for our shareholders as we continue to grow our customer base and volume around the world.
Turning to our options business. As you know, we have invested in system enhancements, new products, and investor education, which are driving significant usage of over diverse suit of option products.
Q3 options volume reached a record level of 2.9 million contracts per day. We also saw the highest percentage of this business trading electronically, which reached 55% electronic during the quarter. One of the key drivers of our continued electronic options success is on investment in enabling more complex options spread to trade on Globex.
In Q3, we saw a record 45% of all option spreads trade electronically versus just 10% in 2010. And volume in the world's largest major options contracts, our Eurodollar options traded on Globex, jumped by more than 60% to a record 200,000 contracts per day in Q3 and reached 21% electronic versus 14% a year ago.
In summary, we continue to deliver strong results, but more importantly, we are intensely focused on running the business as efficiently as we can while laying the foundation for future growth in the years to come.
I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,311182172,887852,"CME Group Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. CME had a strong quarter, another great job by the team on both the revenue and expense side with revenue up 12% and expenses basically flat. Our adjusted operating margin of 62.7% was the highest level we have",860,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. CME had a strong quarter, another great job by the team on both the revenue and expense side with revenue up 12% and expenses basically flat. Our adjusted operating margin of 62.7% was the highest level we have seen since 2011. Finally, our adjusted EPS grew 21% during the quarter compared to the prior year driven by organic growth.
I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.759, down from $0.777 last quarter, driven primarily by a product shift from ags to equities, volume discounts and a drop in the energy RPC as a result of the contract mix. In September, within energy, we saw a significant increase in our small size power contracts, which accounted for 8% of the energy volume for that month or a 161,000 contracts per day.
During the second quarter, the power contracts accounted for less than 1 half of 1% of the volume, and for Q3, that jumped up to 5% at an average of $0.06 per contract.
Cleared swaps revenue totaled $16.3 million for the quarter. We captured $166 per IRS-cleared trade, higher than we've seen in prior quarters due to our customer mix. We cleared approximately 1,370 trades per day in Q3.
Market data revenue of $99.5 million was up 13% versus Q3 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program, which we have discussed the last few quarters. This came in slightly below our guidance, and we would expect it to dip slightly in Q4.
Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter were $317 million, down from last year. We remained extremely focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization and eliminating redundancy to continue to improve agility and customer and market responsiveness. At the end of the quarter, we had 2,525 employees, down 5% from 3 months ago, driven by our futures pit closures in July and staff reductions in August. Our headcount is down 11% from the same quarter last year. Stock-based compensation cost came in below our normal run rate, primarily due to higher forfeitures on expenses we previously recognized.
After some variability in our stock-based compensation in the last 2 quarters, we expect to revert to a run rate of approximately $50 million per quarter. Modest fluctuations may result in future periods due to some changes in expectations regarding achievement of performance shared targets.
Our compensation ratio year-to-date is running at an industry leading 16.1%, down from 17.1% in 2014 and 17.4% in 2013. During the quarter, it came in at 15.4%.
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line, our ownership in the S&P, Dow Jones joint venture drove the $26.6 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was up 33% from the prior year.
We remain pleased with the investment we made in the index business, while also assuring, we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME.
Turning to taxes, the effective rate for the quarter was 36.3%. I expect the fourth quarter to be approximately 37% for a full year tax rate of 36.6%.
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.61 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. That is approximately $910 million above our $700 million minimum cash target. During the third quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances was $30 million and year-to-date CapEx is totaled $85 million. We expect full year 2015 CapEx to be backend loaded in Q4 and should come in lower than we expected at approximately $125 million.
For the full year expenses, we initially guided to $1.31 billion, which we reduced by $10 million last quarter, and I'm going to reduce that by another $5 million to $1.295 billion. This includes absorbing a $12 million increase in license fees so far this year based on volume growth. The guidance would result in a 2% expense reduction in Q4 compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis.
As we mention at this time every year, we have a large amount of marketing and customer-related spend in the fourth quarter that will drive the sequential increase from Q3.
Finally, we communicated and adjusted 2016 transaction fee schedule across all 6 product areas to our customers last week. We expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 2%, assuming the same volume levels and product mix next year.
In summary, the third quarter of 2015 once again, demonstrated the power of CME Group's business model. Broad-based volume growth from our diverse product set and our disciplined expense management drove adjusted EPS up more than 20%, continuing our growth in the first half of the year.
We also continue to generate a significant amount of excess cash, which we plan to return to our shareholders.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue if you have any further questions. Thank you."

In terms of the market data, as you can imagine, forecasting attrition is not an exact science. And revenue came in slightly lower than we had guided to, and we'd anticipate it being slightly lower, again, in the fourth quarter. We are keeping a strong eye on it as we go into next year. As you know, those that were grandfathered will now be paying the full -- the full freight amount, which is approximately double what they are paying today. We don't have any guidance on that as yet. We are working with our clients to make sure that we keep that -- any attrition down to as low as possible. In terms of expenses, we're going through the budgeting process now. As you can imagine, we are focused strongly on expenses and will be giving guidance in the -- during the first quarter -- I'm sorry, end of the year conference call in January. In terms of expenses, we're down about 2% based on our guidance in the fourth quarter. Again, we're focused on expenses going into next year, and we'll be making sure that we're optimizing the entire expense base during the budgeting process. As it relates to stock-based compensation, what you saw this quarter was an adjustment because the grant date and the vesting date for the stock awards occurs annually in September, and that -- the forfeiture rates are updated at this time, and because of the actions we've taken over the last few years, we had to adjust it to reflect the reduced number of employees. We're anticipating going back to approximately a $15 million run rate on stock-based compensation, but there will be some variability in it going into next year because of the proportion of performance-related stock awards will cause some fluctuation because they adjust, both based on our performance as well as performance of the S&P 500 or a group of peer companies."

I think if there are any opportunities surrounding those types of things, either in the commodity space or in the financial space, we will explore them.

We're also looking at utilizing contract services from outside the United States where we can provision them more cost-effectively. As you take look at our headcount, I would imagine, over time, you will see more headcount growing internationally because, as Gill indicated, that's where our growth is. There is a large amount of our growth coming from overseas. So in terms of our overall margins, we have got the highest margin right now since 2011 with incremental margins above 90%. So I think there is no artificial limiter in terms of how high our margin can go. In fact, we have hit a high of over 65% in the not so distant past.

We have been focused on making sure presence in TI in the future is in the options, Brent is an area that we continue to have that 12%, 13% of. And certainly, the trends we're seeing in the natural gas market, while we don't see necessary huge change in macro trends over the next 12 months, we're continuing to build on our market share that we solidified over the last probably 12 to 15 months there. As it relates to the options business, specifically in TI, we got 72% of our options in TI trading electronically now, that business is up 50%. And options is a real differentiator for us because if you look at the magnitude of our business, I think we've got about 165,000 contracts ADV in our TI options. You compare that to your points on the competitive landscape with ICE, they got 50,000 or 60,000 contracts in. And we know that options volume perpetuates and strengthens the futures franchise. So that's an area of focus for us. And probably the last thing I'd talk about, maybe 2 other small pieces, there has been increasing movements on potential lifting of the export ban. It went through one side. We think there is a broader dialogue that, we think, is happening. So despite the fact that there is an election next year, the fact that there is part of dialogue in Washington right now, we think, is very positive, we think there's a good story there. The Chairman actually testified to that a couple of months ago in D.C. And then finally, if you look at the GSCI re-ratings preliminary announced a couple of weeks ago, we just think that speaks to really what the natural footprint of TI is in the global landscape. But as I said before, if we can provide a full suite of products to our customers, whether it's is Brent, TI, even the Omani crude in DME, that's -- it's what our customers need.

I'll take the first one and then maybe Sean can comment on ultra 10-year, that's definitely a product we're excited about. Just with regard to the energy RPC with the small sized, smaller-priced power contract, I can understand the disconnects. Energy RPC fell about $0.08 compared to last quarter. The lower RPC, again, was driven by those smaller-sized, lower-priced contracts, and the bulk of that all occurred in the month of September. I think when you take a look at the quarter, the ADV for power contracts this quarter was about 91,000, up from the ADV of about 5000 last quarter. So if you normalize out the RPC for those power contracts, it's about $1.25 on everything else. So that's the impact. I think, what we will do in the future is we will make sure on our monthly volume release that any unusual spikes in the power contract, we'll make sure to call that out. I think the important thing is even with these lower-sized, lower-priced contracts, our energy revenue was up 17% this quarter. So we're really pleased with how energy has been performing.

We had a huge -- if you look at last year, October of last year, right, was an absolutely phenomenal period of time. Let's recall for example, in rates what happened. Last year, our rates complex was up 19% in terms of the ADV. And if you look at October of last year, we had a number of events; we had a surprise easing by the ECB; we had the potential for Greek exit; and we had the all-time record on October 15 of last year in terms of the exchange volumes. And that was, in part, due to the huge open interest at that time. If you recall, interest rate futures on that day alone, we did over 25 million contracts. So we've got some very tough comps right now. But in addition to that, the helpfulness of our business continues to grow without question. So looking at that in terms of large open interest holders and our interest rate complex, we reached an all-time record in August. In terms of our FX complex, we also reached an all-time record in large open interest holders in August. And the trends in larger open interest holders continues to increase and penetration of alternative markets continues to increase. So if you look, for example, at our treasury complex, one of the things that we do talk about pretty often is the percentage of treasury futures that trade relative to the cash bond market. Just as a recollection in 2013, that was 60%; in 2014, it was 65%; in 2015, we're running at 78%. So all the indications are that it's a very healthy marketplace. So I'm focused on the financials. Now I'll turn it over to Derek to talk a bit about commodities."

And to the point that Sean made, we focus not just on the volume, but the quality of participation in our markets as well. So while we're seeing some short-term gyrations, largely in the options side, which is fairly typical actually, it's much more volatile in the options OI than the futures OI. We're pointing you guys to some clarity on the commodities open interest holding picture here as well. Particularly on Page 23, on the energy side, if you look year-on-year, our large open interest holding is up almost 7.5% year-on-year. So the quality and the number of participants holding significant positions with us is equally important to us as the short-term gyrations in the options side."

We had an outstanding third quarter across the board. We delivered significant topline growth in transaction fees and market data revenue, which, coupled with solid expense control, resulted in a 21% increase in adjusted earnings per share.
We continue to benefit from revenue strength that is fairly balanced.
Total transaction fee revenue growth for the third quarter was 12%.
Commodity products were 14% higher and financial products were up 10%.
I will go through the highlights of these 2 segments for the quarter, and then, I'll touch on our growth initiatives.
Starting with commodities. All 3 product areas were up double digits in terms of volume. Within energy, average daily volume was up 26%, driven by more than 30% growth in our crude business, while natural gas and refine products have done well, up 9% in total.
Our WTI futures and options volume was up 39% in Q3, while the other major crude offering traded at a competitor was up 7%.
Recently, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index primarily reweightings were released. The WTI futures are now the largest component and represent 23% of the total index, which clearly reflects our clients' choice in risk management tools among our crude oil liquidity pools. Additionally, our WTI options increased by 50% for the quarter.
Turning to ags. We're tracking for a record volume year. During the third quarter, our ag volume was up 20% with continued strength after a record quarter in Q2.
Some highlights include corn, which was up 40% year-over-year, and wheat, which was up 29%. Within metals, precious metals rose 12%, while the smaller base metals grew by 26%.
During the quarter, we continued to roll out innovative new commodities products. We announced a South American Short-Dated Soybean Option contract, offering South American producers a flexible and cost-effective tool to manage new crop price risk.
And on the back of our success in the copper business, which is up 26% in Q3, we continue to expand our base metals product suite.
In addition to launching zinc futures, we are also launching a global physically delivered lead contract with U.S. and European delivery points as well as new aluminum European premium futures following success with our U.S. Midwest premium futures.
On the European Energy side, we launched a suite of European power contracts to complement the European gas futures that we launch in January, which will be further enhanced by European emissions futures that we plan to launch in the next month. I will touch on some interesting new partnerships in a few minutes.
Moving onto our financial products. We had an impressive quarter in our equity business with volume up 27%, driven by increased volatility.
Equity options growth during the quarter was 32%. During the month of August, we had the 2 higher days ever in our equities option products with both days above 1.9 million contracts.
Within interest rates and FX, we have seen some slowdown in activity as a result of the expectations of a Fed move being pushed out several months. We have seen that before and the opportunity remains in front of us.
We continue to innovate and believe, we are well positioned in those products. CME Fed funds futures volumes have tripled and open interest has doubled this year as the market has used the Fed funds futures contracts to manage risk in relation to uncertainty of Fed rate hikes.
The CME's FedWatch tool that translate Fed funds futures prices into probability of rate moves by the FOMC gives a more than 30% chance of a rate move in December and over 50% chance of a rate move by March 2016.
From a growth perspective, a couple of important points. In early August, we were pleased to announce the licensing deal with FTSE Russell Indexes, and we look forward to driving growth in these products.
We have already launched futures on the Russell 1000, Russell 1000 growth and value, FTSE 100 emerging markets and FTSE China 50 Indexes and other products.
We will be rolling out the FTSE emerging markets, the FTSE developed Europe in 2016, and most importantly, the Russell 2000 in 2017. In addition, on November 16, we plan to launch S&P dividend index futures as well as introducing the so-called Basis Trade Index at close or BTIC functionality to the S&P 500, NASDAQ and Dow Jones Index futures.
Within interest rates, last week, we announced plans to launch the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures and options contract, which I alluded to last quarter. This contract provides hedging and spreading opportunities at the true 10-year point of the treasury yield curve.
Market participants approached us in the first half of this year and suggested that we look at a futures contract that can provide deep liquidity and capital and margin efficiencies of the treasury futures complex to the highly traded 10-year point on the treasury yield curve.
CME conducted an extensive market valuation process of 3 potential contract designs. We found great enthusiasm, interest and deeply held views on the design and usefulness from market participants. The design announcement for the new Ultra 10-year futures has elicited significant positive feedback from our customers.
Looking at our global business. We had the best quarter ever in terms of volume and percentage of total volume from outside the U.S.
The total electronic average daily volume for the quarter of 3.2 million contracts was up 15% from the prior year.
In addition, the total electronic volume traded from outside of the U.S. exceeded 25% for the first time and revenue from outside of the U.S. represented 32% of the total. Our interest rate business has been particularly strong outside the U.S. as electronic revenue has grown from 31% in Q3 last year to 37% this quarter.
We continue to establish global partnerships, particularly in Asia over the last few months. We announced an exclusive license arrangement with Rim Intel -- Intelligence, a leading provider of pricing data in Japan, to develop and clear energy derivatives based on their LNG data. Secondly, we signed an MOU with MCX, India's leading commodity exchange related to product development, market allegation and the licensing agreement for rupee-denominated oil and gas contracts based on NYMEX prices.
We have made 3 noteworthy announcements with Chinese entities. We announced an index development and product licensing agreement with China Securities Index Company for commodity index development. We signed an agreement with CFETS, China's largest marketplace for interest rate and foreign exchange products related to joint development and innovation of offshore renminbi and related products. As part of the agreement, CFETS will help facilitate China Interbank market participants to trade CME Group's products. And finally, last week, we signed an MOU with China Construction Bank to offer offshore Chinese RMB futures contract with physical delivery in London for the first time, which will be offered by CME Europe.
We believe our cooperative efforts will continue to unlock opportunities for our shareholders as we continue to grow our customer base and volume around the world.
Turning to our options business. As you know, we have invested in system enhancements, new products, and investor education, which are driving significant usage of our diverse suite of option products.
Q3 options volume reached a record level of 2.9 million contracts per day. We also saw the highest percentage of this business trading electronically, which reached 55% electronic during the quarter. One of the key drivers of our continued electronic options success is on investment in enabling more complex options spread to trade on Globex.
In Q3, we saw a record 45% of all option spreads trade electronically versus just 10% in 2010. And volume in the world's largest major options contracts, our Eurodollar options traded on Globex jumped by more than 60% to a record 200,000 contracts per day in Q3 and reached 21% electronic versus 14% a year ago.
In summary, we continue to deliver strong results, but more importantly, we are intensely focused on running the business as efficiently as we can while laying the foundation for future growth in the years to come.
I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you."
2004577,311182172,887925,"CME Group Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","CME Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. CME had a strong quarter, another great job by the team on both the revenue and expense side with revenue up 12% and expenses basically flat. Our adjusted operating margin of 62.7% was the highest level we have",821,"Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. CME had a strong quarter, another great job by the team on both the revenue and expense side with revenue up 12% and expenses basically flat. Our adjusted operating margin of 62.7% was the highest level we have seen since 2011. Finally, our adjusted EPS grew 21% during the quarter compared to the prior year driven by organic growth.
I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.759, down from $0.777 last quarter, driven primarily by a product shift from ags to equities, volume discounts and a drop in the energy RPC as a result of the contract mix. In September, within energy, we saw a significant increase in our small size power contracts, which accounted for 8% of the energy volume for that month or 161,000 contracts per day.
During the second quarter, the power contracts accounted for less than .005% of the volume, and for Q3, that jumped up to 5% at an average of $0.06 per contract.
Cleared swaps revenue totaled $16.3 million for the quarter. We captured $166 per IRS-cleared trade, higher than we've seen in prior quarters due to our customer mix. We cleared approximately 1,370 trades per day in Q3.
Market data revenue of $99.5 million was up 13% versus Q3 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program, which we have discussed the last few quarters. This came in slightly below our guidance, and we would expect it to dip slightly in Q4.
Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter were $317 million, down from last year. We remained extremely focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization and eliminating redundancy to continue to improve agility and customer and market responsiveness. At the end of the quarter, we had 2,525 employees, down 5% from 3 months ago, driven by our futures pit closures in July and staff reductions in August. Our headcount is down 11% from the same quarter last year. Stock-based compensation cost came in below our normal run rate, primarily due to higher forfeitures on expenses we had previously recognized.
After some variability in our stock-based compensation in the last 2 quarters, we expect to revert to a run rate of approximately $50 million per quarter. Modest fluctuations may result in future periods due to some changes in expectations regarding achievement of performance share targets.
Our compensation ratio year-to-date is running at an industry leading 16.1%, down from 17.1% in 2014 and 17.4% in 2013. During the quarter, it came in at 15.4%.
Looking at the nonoperating income and expense line, our ownership in the S&P, Dow Jones joint venture drove the $26.6 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was up 33% from the prior year.
We remain pleased with the investment we made in the index business, while also assuring we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME.
Turning to taxes, the effective rate for the quarter was 36.3%. I expect the fourth quarter to be approximately 37% for a full year tax rate of 36.6%.
And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.61 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. That is approximately $910 million above our $700 million minimum cash target. During the third quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances was $30 million and year-to-date CapEx has totaled $85 million. We expect full year 2015 CapEx to be backend loaded in Q4 and should come in lower than we expected at approximately $125 million.
For the full year expenses, we initially guided to $1.31 billion, which we reduced by $10 million last quarter, and I'm going to reduce that by another $5 million to $1.295 billion. This includes absorbing a $12 million increase in license fees so far this year based on volume growth. The guidance would result in a 2% expense reduction in Q4 compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis.
As we mention at this time every year, we have a large amount of marketing and customer-related spend in the fourth quarter that will drive the sequential increase from Q3.
Finally, we communicated an adjusted 2016 transaction fee schedule across all 6 product areas to our customers last week. We expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 2%, assuming the same volume levels and product mix next year.
In summary, the third quarter of 2015 once again demonstrated the power of CME Group's business model. Broad-based volume growth from our diverse product set and our disciplined expense management drove adjusted EPS up more than 20%, continuing our growth in the first half of the year.
We also continue to generate a significant amount of excess cash, which we plan to return to our shareholders.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

As you can imagine, we are focused strongly on expenses and will be giving guidance in the -- during the first quarter -- I'm sorry, end of the year conference call in January. In terms of expenses, we're down about 2% based on our guidance in the fourth quarter. Again, we're focused on expenses going into next year, and we'll be making sure that we're optimizing the entire expense base during the budgeting process. As it relates to stock-based compensation, what you saw this quarter was an adjustment because the grant date and the vesting date for the stock awards occurs annually in September, and that -- the forfeiture rates are updated at this time, and because of the actions we've taken over the last few years, we had to adjust it to reflect the reduced number of employees. We're anticipating going back to approximately a $15 million run rate on stock-based compensation, but there will be some variability in it going into next year because of the proportion of performance-related stock awards will cause some fluctuation because they adjust, both based on our performance as well as performance of the S&P 500 or a group of peer companies."

So we're definitely penetrating the European marketplace in a very substantial way this year, in a way that -- in addition to that, one thing I might update folks on in terms of Fed funds.

I talked a little bit about the 10-year contract a short while ago. I think if there are any opportunities surrounding those types of things, either in the commodity space or in the financial space, we will explore them. Currently, as you might know, we have a CME venture group that has placed small bets on, what I'll call, emerging trends in the marketplace that might lead to commercial arrangement that we might sign with these firms, such as the one that we introduced with Dwolla a couple of days ago.

And you've hit on one of them, which is, as we go electronic and as the market takes the option complex electronic, that has a potential to offer some cost savings. We also are looking at things like consolidating our data centers and continuing that process, optimizing our real estate footprints to make sure that we have -- to make sure that we have the optimal space for our employees. We're also looking at utilizing contract services from outside the United States where we can provision them more cost-effectively. As you take a look at our headcount, I would imagine, over time, you will see more headcount growing internationally because, as Gill indicated, that's where our growth is. There is a large amount of our growth coming from overseas. So in terms of our overall margins, we have got the highest margin right now since 2011 with incremental margins above 90%. So I think there is no artificial limiter in terms of how high our margin can go. In fact, we have hit a high of over 65% in the not so distant past. So I think, we don't look at it from the perspective of how high we can grow our margin, we look at it in terms of how efficiently we're running our expenses, what levers we have to pull to grow the topline and investing for growth.

We have been focused on making sure our presence in TI in the future is in the options. Brands is an area that we continue to have about 12%, 13% of. And certainly, the trends we're seeing in the natural gas market, while we don't see necessary huge change in macro trends over the next 12 months, we're continuing to build on our market share that we've solidified over the last probably 12 to 15 months there. As it relates to the options business, specifically in TI, we got 72% of our options in TI trading electronically now. That business is up 50%. And options is a real differentiator for us because if you look at the magnitude of our business, I think we've got about 165,000 contracts ADV in our TI options. You compare that to your points on the competitive landscape at ICE, they got 50,000 or 60,000 contracts in. And we know that options volume perpetuates and strengthens the futures franchise. So that's an area of focus for us. And probably the last thing I'd talk about, maybe 2 other small pieces, there has been increasing movements on potential lifting of the export ban. It went through one side. We think there is a broader dialogue that, we think, is happening. So despite the fact that there is an election next year, the fact that it's part of dialogue in Washington right now, we think, is very positive, we think there's a good story there. The Chairman actually testified to that a couple of months ago in D.C. And then finally, if you look at the GSCI re-ratings preliminarily announced a couple of weeks ago, we just think that speaks to really what the natural footprint of TI is in the global landscape. But as I said before, if we can't provide a full suite of products to our customers, whether it's Brent, TI, even the Omani crude in DME, that's -- it's what our customers need.

I'll take the first one and then maybe Sean can comment on ultra 10-year, that's definitely a product we're excited about. Just with regard to the energy RPC with the small sized, smaller-priced power contract, I can understand the disconnects. Energy RPC fell about $0.08 compared to last quarter. The lower RPC, again, was driven by those smaller-sized, lower-priced contracts, and the bulk of that all occurred in the month of September. I think when you take a look at the quarter, the ADV for power contracts this quarter was about 91,000, up from the ADV of about 5,000 last quarter. So if you normalized out the RPC for those power contracts, it's about $1.25 on everything else. So that's the impact. I think, what we will do in the future is we will make sure on our monthly volume release that any unusual spikes in the power contract, we'll make sure to call that out. I think the important thing is even with these lower-sized, lower-priced contracts, our energy revenue was up 17% this quarter. So we're really pleased with how energy has been performing.

We had a huge -- if you look at last year, October of last year, right, was an absolutely phenomenal period of time. Let's recall for example, in rates what happened. Last year, our rates complex was up 19% in terms of the ADV. And if you look at October of last year, we had a number of events; we had a surprise easing by the ECB; we had the potential for Greek exit; and we had the all-time record on October 15 of last year in terms of the exchange volumes. And that was, in part, due to the huge open interest at that time. If you recall, interest rate futures on that day alone, we did over 25 million contracts. So we've got some very tough comps right now. But in addition to that, the healthfulness of our business continues to grow without question. So looking at that in terms of large open interest holders and our interest rate complex, we reached an all-time record in August. In terms of our FX complex, we also reached an all-time record in large open interest holders in August. And the trends in larger open interest holders continues to increase and our penetration of alternative markets continues to increase. So if you look, for example, at our treasury complex, one of the things that we do talk about pretty often is the percentage of treasury futures that trade relative to the cash bond market. Just as a recollection in 2013, that was 60%; in 2014, it was 65%; in 2015, we're running at 78%. So all the indications are that it's a very healthy marketplace. So I'm focused on the financials.

So while we're seeing some short-term gyrations, largely in the options side, which is fairly typical actually, it's much more volatile in the options OI than the futures OI. We're pointing you guys to some clarity on the commodities open interest holding picture here as well.
