Look, we still see the global environment as really positive with a lot of volatility. GE had a strong fourth quarter with some elements better than we indicated in December. Operating EPS was $0.56 up 6%, led by ind",1121,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everybody. Look, we still see the global environment as really positive with a lot of volatility. GE had a strong fourth quarter with some elements better than we indicated in December. Operating EPS was $0.56 up 6%, led by industrial EPS which grew by 23%. Orders grew by 3%, which was 5% organically, and our backlog expanded to a new record. Industrial organic growth was up 9% and margins expanded by 50 basis points. 
Our initiatives continued to deliver results. Industrial CFOA was $7.2 billion up 64% reported in the quarter or 30% exited 2013 NBCU taxes. Capital's quarter was consistent with our expectations. The U.S. continue to strengthen as in Asia. Some businesses are seeing more momentum like Aviation and Healthcare. Our oil and gas team executed well despite volatility. Their underlying performance was revenue flat and earnings up 6%, and we believe that our diverse and integrated model work for investors in the quarter as it will in 2015. 
We delivered on our key commitments for the year. Industrial segment profits grew by 10%, driven by 7% organic growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion. GE Capital reduced DNI by $17 billion and hit their earnings plan. CFOA was in the middle of the range of $15.2 billion. Free cash flow was $11.2 billion, up 6% for the year. Our capital allocation choices were in line with expectations. On the M&A front, Alstom strategic driver, Appliances is well priced and down a good point in the cycle and the Synchrony spend will result in a substantial reduction in GE shares. We're executing a valuable pivot at GE, one that improves our business mix while delivering EPS growth and expanding returns. 
Now for orders. Total orders grew by 3%, which is pretty good in the environment. As I said earlier, organically, this is 5% in total with 3% in equipment and 8% growth in services. Orders grew by 7% for the year. We have strengthened services, which was up 6% in the quarter and 10% for the year, and we grew backlog by $17 billion year-over-year. Power & Water had a solid quarter but costs are impacted by huge Algerian deal in 2013. Without that, orders were up 13% in the quarter. And we now have 15 H orders with another 30 technical selections. Oil & Gas orders were down 4% organically consistent with our expectations. Turbomachinery actually saw orders grow by 16% in the quarter. Aviation orders grew by 15% and may end the year with a record backlog. Aviation commercial spares grew by 37% in the quarter. Importantly the U.S. Healthcare equipment orders grew by 17%, demonstrating renewed strength in our biggest market. 
Our success with the Tier 4 locomotives continues. We took 1,355 orders in 2014 and are positioned for record shipments in 2015. The U.S. was strong with orders growing by 18% in the fourth quarter following a 25% growth in the third quarter, and growth markets were mixed. For instance, Middle East and North Africa was negative in the quarter due to the Algerian order I talked about earlier but was up 20% for the year, and Asian growth market orders grew by 21%. We closed 2014 with a backlog of $261 billion, and in December, we called out a 2015 organic growth range of 2% to 5%, and we still feel good about this range. For execution, our team really executed well in the quarter with organic growth up 9% and margins up 50 basis points. For the year, Industrial segment profit was up 10% with 7% organic revenue growth and 50 basis points of margin enhancement. 
Our initiatives are driving growth ahead of our peers. Our product lineup is  quite strong. The H turbine is winning in the market. Our Aviation wins is huge with 79% LEAP shared to date. The Tier 4 continues to win. Our Healthcare products are gaining share in CT MRN Ultrasound. Aviation commercial spares shipments grew by 24% and Power Gen Services grew revenue by 14%. As I said earlier, growth market revenues expanded by 7% in '14 with 5 of 9 regions growing. Also an update on a few of our adjacencies. Life Sciences grew earnings by 15% for the year. Water hit it at 10% at operating profit rate in the quarter with 26% earnings growth for the year, and we won that Boeing 777X onboard computing system. This is a huge win and positions GE as a Tier 1 Avionics supplier. Margins continue to be a good story, up 50 basis points for the year. Simplification and services again are the big drivers. We hit 14% of structural cost as a percentage of sales for the year with another $1.2 billion of cost out in corporate costs x gains, restructuring and NBCU declined by more than $900 million. We're seeing the impact of analytics on service productivity. Service margins grew by 270 basis points in the quarter, and we have momentum in every business, and with an intensifying focus on gross margins and product costs, we're on track for another year of margin growth in 2015. 
Now on to cash for the quarter. Our industrial cash grew by 64% to $7.2 billion. This is consistent with our expectations for the quarter and the year. We finished the year by shipping a tremendous amount of volume, and oru teams did a great job on working capital, which reduced by $2 billion in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow for the year was $11.2 billion up 6%, and the GE Capital dividend was $3 billion below the $6 billion they delivered in 2013. 
We ended the year with substantial liquidity and financial strength. GE Capital ended the year with Tier 1 common ratio of 12.7%, substantially above the regulatory guidelines. We returned about $11 billion to investors in dividends and buybacks, and we remain on track for $12 billion to $15 billion for free cash flow in dispositions in 2015. We allocated our capital in line with the discussion we had in December, our priorities to execute on Alstom, fund organic growth and continue to grow the dividend. 
Remember that Synchrony at the current pricing should return $18 billion to $20 billion for investors in the share exchange. In any environment where we have an uncertain macroeconomy, it's important to talk about execution. In 2014, in our performance, you can see the tangible results of how we're running GE. Our underlying business has significant operational momentum supported by the changes to how we're running GE day to day with more transparency and more accountability. This was an excellent execution quarter for the team, and now Jeff will give you the business details"
177031,274778648,748551,"General Electric Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2015",2015-01-23,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. We had revenues of $42 billion up 4% in the quarter. Industrial sales of $31 billion were up 8% and GE Capital capital revenues from $11.5 billion were up 4%. Operating earnings of $5.6 billion wer",4003,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. We had revenues of $42 billion up 4% in the quarter. Industrial sales of $31 billion were up 8% and GE Capital capital revenues from $11.5 billion were up 4%. Operating earnings of $5.6 billion were higher by 4%. Operating earnings per share of $0.56 were up 6% with industrial EPS up 23% and GE Capital EPS down 17%. Continuing EPS of $0.52  includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. We had $0.01 impact in discontinued operations this quarter associated with WMC. This was driven by reserve increase of $142 million to reflect WMC's current assessment of its loan loss exposure based on recent settlement activity and negotiations. WMC ended the quarter with $809 million of reserves flat with fourth quarter of '13. As Jeff said, CFOA for the year was $15.2 billion. We had industrial CFOA of $12.2 billion and received $3 billion of dividends from GE Capital. In the quarter, industrial generated $7.2 billion of CFOA, up 64% on a reported basis and up 30% excluding the impact of NBCU taxes from last year. 
The GE tax rate for the quarter was 13%, bringing the year-to-date rate to 17%. In the quarter, we benefited from the passage of the Extenders [ph] Bill and the deductions from higher restructuring impairments. The GE Capital tax rate was 5% in the quarter and 2% for the year consistent with the low single-digit estimate that we've previously communicated. 
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were up 6% reported and up 9% organically, reflecting about 2 points of headwind from foreign exchange and 1 point from acquisitions and dispositions. Foreign exchange was approximately $600 million drag on Industrial segment revenue and about $180 million impact on our profit in the quarter. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 9%. GE Capital earnings were down 19%, primarily driven by lower gains and tax benefits associated with the Swiss and the [indiscernible] transactions from the fourth quarter of last year. I'll cover the dynamics of these in the segments in a couple of pages. 
First, I'll start with the other items page for the quarter. We have $0.04 of restructuring and other charges at corporate but with $0.02 of that related to ongoing industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to take actions to improve the industrial cost structure. At $353 million pretax, this was approximately $75 million higher than the plan, that reflects the acceleration of some restructuring opportunities from 2015. We also had a $217 million pretax charge with an impairment related to a strategic investment in the energy space. This investment has underperformed in the market but we continue to expect that it will be a long-term value in the asset. 
In November of 2013, I reviewed with our investors our plan to invest $1 billion to $1.5 billion of restructuring to accelerate the repositioning of our industrial cost footprint that position us to grow earnings with the pivot in 2015 and '16. On the bottom of the page of the profile of those restructuring and other charges that we took in 2014 by quarter and the ones that gain associated with the Wayne disposition. For the total year, net chargeswere  $0.11 per share or $1.7 billion pretax.
Next I'll give you an update on industrial cost dynamics. On SG&A, we've made a lot of progress. We ended the year with 14% SG&A to sales, which is down almost 2 points from 2013. This is driven by a combination of cost-out efforts in the industrial segments and corporate. For the year, we took out $1.2 billion of structural cost, in line with the $1 billion plus we've been communicating with you. 
On the bottom left, you can see Industrial segment gross margins excluding corporate. For the year, segment gross margins were down 80 basis points, which is driven entirely by negative mix as we grew equipment revenues faster than services particularly in wind, GEnx and thermal. As we discussed in the December outlook meeting, Dan, Jamie Miller and I are driving a focused initiative to improve industrial gross margins through an intense focus on product costs similar to our programmatic approach around SG&A. We are targeting to improve gross margins by 50 basis points in 2015. 
On the right side, you can see the corporate operating cost. The bar graph excludes gains, restructuring and NBCU operations from 2013 so you can see our true operating expenses. We've taken significant actions on corporate cost with about $950 million reduction for the year. This includes functional headquarter cost improvements, lower global and growth spend, operating pension and retiree health cost improvements and nonrepeating charges in 2013 principally the EBX charge we took in the second quarter of 2013. The focus on reducing corporate costs will continue into 2015 and we expect corporate costs to be about $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion for the year. We'll continue to reduce corporate costs but this will be partly offset by higher pension expenses as Jeff outlined during the outlook meeting in December. 
Now I'll go into the segments and start with Power & Water. Orders in the fourth quarter totaled $9.5 billion, down 8%. Orders were higher by 13% excluding the Algerian mega deal in the fourth quarter of last year. Equipment orders were down 12% driven by Thermal down 62% as a result of a difficult comparison to last year's 270% increase, including Algeria. We had orders for 41 gas turbines in the quarter, flat with last year excluding the Algerian deal. In the fourth quarter, we received an order for 2 H turbines, bringing units in backlog to 15 Hs, and we've been selected for another 30  units on projects and are bidding an additional 61 units as we speak. Total gas turbine order count for the year finished at 105 units, representing 18 gigawatts of power. Partially offsetting thermals orders decline power was Distributed Power, which was higher by 66% and Renewables was up 47% in the quarter. Distributed Power growth was driven by turbines up over 100%, partly offset by a decline in engines. The turbine strength was attributed to a large win in Egypt of consisting of 20 trailer mounted units, 14 LM 6000s and some balance of plan. The 20 TMs and 6 of the 14 LMs converted to sales in the quarter. For the year, DP recorded orders for 167 turbines versus 174 in 2013.
Renewables equipment orders were up 47% reflecting orders for 1,251 turbines. The U.S. was up 16%, including 138 safe harbor units associated with the PTC extension and we saw a significant growth in Latin America, the Middle East and in regions we took no orders in the fourth quarter of '13, including China and India. Service orders were down 2% also driven by no repeat of the Algerian deal. Excluding Algeria, service orders grew 9% on strong transactional upgrades and outages. AGPs in the quarter were 26 versus 25 last year, bringing the total year AGP count to 80. Power & Water revenues of $9.4 billion in the quarter were up 22% with very strong equipment revenues up 37% and service revenues up 7%. Equipment revenue was driven by strength in Thermal up 64%, with sales of 44 gas turbines versus 28 last year and renewables up 20% on 206 more wind turbines and DP up 33% in the quarter.
Operating profit in the quarter totaled $2.1 billion, up 13% versus fourth quarter of '13, and earnings were driven by higher volume and cost productivity, partially offset by negative value principally priced and unfavorable mix with higher equipment sales versus services. SG&A in the quarter was down 12% year-over-year and margins in the quarter were down 190 basis points.
As you look into 2015, we expect to continue to grow services, including upgrades, and we anticipate a flat gas turbine market but expect to gain share. We're planning for wind to deliver 3,000 to 3,200 units, and Distributed Power will continue to be pressured as we look into '15.
Next, Oil & Gas. Oil & Gas orders at $4.9 billion were down 10% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effects of FX and a winning disposition, orders were down 4%. Notwithstanding the volatility of oil prices in the fourth quarter, we believe the relative impact was a modest with more impact expected in 2015. Equipment orders of $2.5 billion were down 15% reported down 9% organically. The Subsea orders were down 38% with no repeat of large fourth quarter of last year orders with Petrobras and ENI. Downstream technology orders were down 46%, driven by a large Shell order in the fourth quarter of last year in our distributed gas solutions business partially offset by strong growth of 7% in the downstream product platform. Measurement & Control equipment orders were up 6% organically as we continue to see improvement in end flow and process markets. Drilling & Surface orders were down 2% with drilling down 72% as expected, partly offset by 7% growth in our service business. Turbomachinery was up 60% on natural gas orders in North America, the Middle East and in Russia.
Service orders were down 4% but up 1% organically. The TMS orders were down on lower installations in the quarter partly offset by 6% organic growth in M&C, downstream technology growth of 16% and Drilling & Surface higher BAY 11%. For the year, total orders were flat with backlog up 1%. Oil & Gas revenues in the quarter of $5 billion were down 6% reported and flat organically driven by 3 points of FX and 3 points of disposition impact. Equipment revenues were down 5% with Subsea down 10% but flat excluding exchange. M&C was higher by 3% organically and downstream technology and Drilling & Surface were up 10% and 11%, respectively. Service revenues were down 6% primarily driven by TMS down 11% and M&C down 5%, but M&C was up 12% organically.
Operating profit in the quarter was higher by 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year and up 6% organically driven by strong value gap and cost productivity offset by the effects of foreign exchange. Margins expanded 110 basis points in the quarter and 100 basis points for the year. As we outlined in the December outlook meeting, 2015 will be a challenging year for our Oil & Gas business. The management and the team are focused on executing the cost actions offset volatility and deliver on their commitments.
Next up is Aviation. Aviation demand continues to be strong, with revenue [indiscernible] November year-to-date up 6.1% on international routes and up 5.3% on domestic routes. Freight growth was 4.4% November year-to-date. Orders for Aviation was strong up 15% in the quarter equipment orders were $4.4 billion were higher by 8%, and service orders grew by 25%. Equipment orders were principally driven by commercial engines. GEnx orders of $1.2 billion were up 23% on large orders from American and Air France. GE90 orders were up 2.5x to $900 million in the quarter, and LEAP and CFM reported $1.2 billion of orders. Our total win rate for the LEAP since launch is now at 79% on narrow-body aircraft. Military equipment orders were down 59% driven by the slow military environment. Service orders up 25% were driven by strong commercial spares orders at $35.6 million a day, up 37% and stronger military spares. Orders for total year 2014 grew 8% and backlog grew 7% for the year to $134 billion. Revenues in the fourth quarter were higher by 4% to $6.4 billion driven by commercial equipment revenues up 8%, services up 3% and military equipment down 3%. Commercial spares were strong, up 24%. We shipped 77 GEnx units in the quarter and 287 for the year. Leverage and operating profit were strong with 12% growth in volume and positive value gap, partly offset by mix and higher R&D. Op margins improved 140 basis points in the quarter. Overall, the Aviation team had a strong quarter and year and we expect strong performance to continue into 2015.
Next is Healthcare. Healthcare had a better quarter than headline results would suggest. Orders were up 1% in the quarter but up 4% excluding foreign exchange, and the U.S. was quite strong up 9%. Latin America and China were both up 2% offset by Europe down 1% but up 5% organically. Japan was down 23% driven by the consumption tax and reimbursement reform, and the Middle East was down 26% mostly driven by Saudi. Healthcare system orders were down 3% but up 2% organically, driven by U.S. imaging and ultrasound equipment orders, which were up 12% in the quarter. We saw growth across most modalities with particular strength in CT, up 22% from our new Revolution CT introduction and ultrasound up 15% from a new volume product in the women's health diagnostic space. This was offset by softer orders in Japan, Russia and the Middle East. China orders were up 2%, reflecting delays in government tenders we've seen over the last several quarters. Life science orders, up 13%, driven by bio process up 60% on very strong demand in the U.S. and Europe offset partially by core imaging down 7%. Revenues of $5.1 billion were flat but higher by 3% x foreign exchange, and the HCS revenue were down 3% but up 2% organically and Life Sciences revenues were up 9% and up 6% organically. Operating profit was down 4% but was up 1% organically with strong cost execution including 5% lower SG&A cost was more than offset by price and foreign exchange. 
Looking forward, we expect the U.S. market to continue to improve. Although final industry figures have yet to be published, we believe we are winning this year in key modalities in the U.S. and China should grow modestly as we look into 2015. The business will continue to write structural product cost as we move forward. 
Next Transportation, which had a strong orders quarter up 62%, with equipment orders up 107% and services higher by 19%. In 2014, Transportation had the strongest orders year ever at $9.6 billion, up 89%. Locomotive orders in the quarter were 284 units versus 70 last year, driven by North America where we took orders for 235 additional Tier 4 compliant units. For the total year 2014, we received orders for 1,355 [ph] Tier 4 compliant locomotives. Backlog for the year grew 43% to $21 billion with equipment higher by 148% and services higher by 22%. Carloads grew strongly in North America up 4.4% in 2014 led by Intermodal up 5.4%. Commodities, including agriculture, were up 3.7% and petroleum was up 12.5% for the year. In the fourth quarter, petroleum volumes continue to grow up 16% year-over-year. 
Revenues in the quarter were up 8% driven by locomotives up 8%. Service is up 14%, partly offset by mining down by 31%. For the total year, revenue was down 4% largely driven by mining.
Operating profit in the quarter was up 13% on higher locomotive volume, materials inflation and cost productivity, partly offset by lower mining volume. The Transportation team has executed well and is positioned the business to capitalize on the new Tier 4 requirements in 2015. 
Next energy management, which earned more in the fourth quarter that it earned in the entirety of 2013. Orders in the quarter were down 2% largely driven by softer marine orders and Power Conversion, which was down about 16%, partially offset by Digital Energy, up strongly at 17% and Industrial Solutions up 5%. Backlog grew 9% to $5 billion.
Revenues were down 2% but up 2% organically. Power Conversion revenues grew 6%, Digital Energy grew 1%, Industrial Solutions was down 6%. Operating profit of about $113 million was higher by 2.5x on strong value gap and cost execution. For the year, we are in $246 million of operating profit, up 124%. Execution continues to improve and we expect substantial improvements again in 2015.
Appliances & Lighting revenue in the quarter was up 5%. Appliances revenues were up 8% driven by strong volume. Industry core units were up 8% with both retail and contract markets up 8% as well. Lighting revenues were down 1% on lower traditional product demand, which was down 15% and more than offset the strong LED lighting growth of 72% in the quarter. LED now makes up 27% of lighting revenues up from 16% in the fourth quarter of last year. Operating profit of $188 million was up 32% in the quarter and margins expanded by 160 basis points.
Next, I'll cover our GE Capital. GE Capital's revenue of $11.5 billion was up 4%, primarily from lower marks and impairments. Net income of $1.9 billion was down 19% principally driven by lower gains and tax benefits, including those related to last year's portfolio exits, including the Swiss and BAY bank transactions. Partially offset by lower credit cost, marks and impairments. ENI, excluding liquidity of $363 billion, was down $17 billion or 5% from last year and down and $2 billion sequentially. Nonstrategic ENI was down $12 billion to $132 billion or 8% versus last year. Net interest margin in the quarter at 5% was essentially flat. 
GE Capital's Tier 1 common ratio on the Basel 1 basis remains in a strong position and ended the year at 12.7%. This is up approximately 60 basis points from the third quarter and 150 basis points year-over-year. Our liquidity levels are strong, ending the quarter at $76 billion. This includes $13 billion attributable to Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remains stable at $25 billion and we have $10 billion of long-term debt issuance for the year excluding the activity related to Synchrony. In 2015, we've already issued $7 billion of long-term debt as part of our total year plan of around $20 billion. 
On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be stable with significant improvements in our mortgage portfolio driven primarily by the sale of $0.5 billion nonperforming loan portfolio in our U.K. home lending business, which generated a small gain during the quarter and the move of our Hungarian bank [indiscernible] . We expect to complete the exit of the Hungary bank during the first half of 2015. 
In terms of segment performance, Commercial Lending & Leasing business ended the quarter with $172 billion of assets, down 1% to last year, largely driven by foreign exchange. Global output volume was $12 billion, down 10%. However, we continue to see strengthening in the U.S. largely in equipment finance with volume up 4%. New business returns in both lending and equipment were largely in line with the first 3 quarters of the year. Earnings of $549 million were up 109% driven by lower marks and impairments. In 2014, the CLO business were at $2.3 billion, up 16%. 
The Consumer segment ended the quarter with $136 billion of assets up 3% from last year with earnings up $1.9 billion down 45%. Our share of Synchrony earnings was $451 million, down 3% driven by minority interest and partially offset by core growth. Consistent with last quarter as a now publicly traded company, the CEO [indiscernible] and the team of post their own investor call later this horny. Separation efforts remain on track. Excluding Synchrony, assets were down 17% as we continue to reduce our presence in nonstrategic portfolios. Earnings excluding Synchrony were at $686 million, down 57% driven by the non-repeat of gains and tax benefits recorded last year for the Swiss and bw transactions partially offset by a $594 million gain associated with the sale of the Nordics consumer platform. Just as a reminder, as the result of the accounting guidelines roughly 1/2 that gain was recognized in prior quarters as tax benefits in benefits GE Capital Corporate. These benefits were reversed in the fourth quarter, and the gain was taken in the Consumer segment resulting in a net gain at GE Capital of $300 million in the fourth quarter. In 2014, the Consumer segment earned $3 billion, down 30%. 
In Real Estate, assets of $34 billion were down 11% versus prior year. The equity book is down 35% from a year ago to $9 billion. Net income of $299 million was up 134% driven by higher gains and portfolio earnings partially offset by higher impairments. In the current quarter, we sold 350 properties from our Real Estate equity book with a book value of about $2.1 billion for a $328 million in gain. In 2014, the Real Estate business earned $1 billion down 42% on lower gains.
In the verticals, GECAS are in $218 million, up 207%, driven by lower impairments partially offset by lower gains and lower assets. Overall, the portfolio is in great shape, and we finished the quarter with 0 delinquencies and 3 aircraft on the ground. New volume remained strong at $2 billion up 50% with attractive returns in line with the first 3 quarters of the year. For the year, GECAS earned $1 billion was up 17% from prior year. The milestone acquisition continues to progress, and we expect to close during the first quarter of 2015 pending regulatory approvals. 
Energy finance earned $111 million down 5% in the quarter in line with lower assets. EFS volume was up 31% year-over-year and had very attractive returns. In 2014, EFS business earned $401 million down 2%. Overall, key for the team continued to execute the portfolio of strategy to deliver solid operating results. As we look forward to 2015, we expect GE Capital to generate about $0.60 on an EPS basis as Jeff discussed last month during the annual outlook meeting. We expect GE Capital to earn approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter of the year.
Lastly, I wanted to spend a minute and talk about the framework for 2015 and cover 4 points. On the left, you have our segment outlook as Jeff shared in December. Overall, there's no change in their framework. On the right side, first, positively, we are seeing strength in the U.S. Healthcare market. Orders were strong, up 9% and equipment orders were up 17% with particular strength in imaging and ultrasound. Orders have been on a positive trend in the U.S. since the first quarter of 2014, and then after the final fourth quarter results, we are more encouraged that this trend will continue into 2015.
Second is Aviation, which we feel is stronger. Spares orders grew 25% in 2014, and we're targeting high single-digit growth in 2015. Revenue pass kilometers and freight Miles continued to be strong and low jet should be a meaningful positive for our customers in the space. 
When you think about currency, we plan 2015 assuming a stronger dollar, but we see some continued strength since the December meeting. Assuming the euro at today's rate for the entire year, foreign exchange would have a modest impact about $0.01 a share. So very manageable in the context of the total company.
In December, we also outlined our expectations for Oil & Gas with a backdrop of oil at $60 to $65 a barrel. Since then, prices have fallen further. When we plan the year, we relied a multiple scenarios, including our further fall in oil prices. Lorenzo and the team are laser focused on executing against their backlog and their costs. The team is reducing employment, executing restructuring and simplification projects to materially reduce their cost structure all predicated and on a tougher scenario. Additionally, across the company, we expect to realize some incremental benefits and directly to other logistical and variable costs as a result of lower fuel costs.
Oil & Gas represented about 15% of our Industrial segment earnings in 2014. We believe that within the context of the company portfolio, the potentially tougher Oil & Gas scenario is manageable and consisted within our framework. With that, I like to pass it back over to Jeff."

We expect the industrial EPS of between $1.10 and $1.20 behind solid organic growth and margin expansion. Corporate cost will be substantially lower. Remember we funded $0.11 of uncovered restructuring in 2014. In 2015, we will offset restructuring with gains. In addition, we should have the impact from 6 months of Alstom. Capital results were on track with Synchrony timing the main variable. Free cash flow and dispositions are on track for the $12 billion to $15 billion we spoke about in the year. And again, cash returned to investors depends on Synchrony timing but would be substantial if we do the split this year.
So closing the year, and since the outlook meeting, the GE world remains balanced. There are always puts and takes in the global economy. For instance, the U.S. is quite strong, which has a positive impact in businesses like Healthcare and Aviation, and the price of oil has declined even further since December.
Our job is to manage the company through volatility and while we see the potential for risk to Oil & Gas based on current oil prices, we're aggressively working offsets through cost actions and positive opportunities elsewhere in GE. We're also seeing stronger momentum at several other businesses. In total, this demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach. Looking back in 2014, out of 8 industrial businesses, 3 beat their plan, 3 met their plan and 2 missed the plan, but together, we did what we set out to do, growing core earnings by 10%.
In addition, let me give you more insight to the plan I gave you in December. We have an internal plan that is above the midpoint of the range I gave you. The business results that delivered that plan are embedded in our team's new incentive compensation for the year. In other words, our leaders achieved their IC when we hit an EPS that is above the midpoint of this range. Now I want you to have transparency on how we think about the world and manage our team. Our targets encompass a thoughtful approach to the environment and a broad range of macrodynamics. So let me reiterate. We feel comfortable with our framework. 2015 is an important year for the company and we plan to deliver for you. And now Matt, back to you, and let's take some questions."

Scott, I mean, the way we've thought about it, particularly when we went through it with December with you, is we've evaluated multiple scenarios, including a general expectation of that point that will be down 0% to 5%, but we evaluated scenarios that are down beyond that of lower oil prices. And when we talked about the range with you of $1.70, $1.80 and total dollar $10, $20 industrially, we included in that our view of what those downside scenarios are. So I think you got to step back and look at it. Oil & Gas is 15% [ph] of our segment earnings in industrial. Being down beyond 5%, I think, is manageable within the context of the industrial portfolio, and I think importantly, Lorenzo and the team are like laser focused on driving the cost and the productivity in their business, and the programs they launched were the programs needed to support a lower downside scenario than what we even talked about in December.

The second was we originally agreed to about a 5-year use of the Alstom brand. We extended that and this agreement to 25 years. That was about $85 million associated with that. And then there were some other very small items. I think you'll hear Alstom talk about EUR 400 million. They're accounting about $100 million of the interest that they contemplated owing us on cash that they used over the course of the year. We never modeled that, we never counted that.

So there'll be some volatility associated with currency, but I think my point was that in the context of the company, we're not at a point yet where we think it's something that's not manageable across our portfolio. We do have natural hedging. We have the ability in some of our businesses to move our manufacturing base globally, which allows us to take advantage of changes in currency, and in a couple of our businesses where that matters, we are actively looking at our bill plan to make sure we take as much as advantage of that as possible. I would say, in the short run here, we've seen very little, but I'm aware, very little impact on our order performance as a result of currency.

And then the resource from these countries I think are going to be mixed depending on what your cost position is and things like that.

I would say most of the pricing impact that we see in the fourth quarter is more mix-driven than anything else. For instance, in power, you've got -- most of the heavy-duty gas turbine action is in the H. That is really not a base yet but those are higher bigger priced units. You have more competitiveness on aeros, not a lot to talk about. Oil & Gas, we really have not seen it yet nor have we seen -- there's some initial letters and stuff like that on pricing, but no real action. I think that's all. Again, I don't think we've seen it in the fourth quarter. We haven't seen it yet, but this is early days. So I think there's going to be -- there's going to be chatter out there. So I don't really take all the stuff that's happened necessarily in the fourth quarter as what's going to happen throughout the rest of '15. I just think we have to be ready on all fronts, and I would say no conversation all around currency and anything, alone that yet. We'll see how that plays out. In terms of Healthcare, I think you're right. This has been the historical business model, but I also think kind of what we're doing with, Steve, with Jeff and Jamie is we're ripping apart the critical access and gross margins across each one of these businesses, and I think in Healthcare, managing the pricing is going to be a key part of how we get enhanced gross margin gross improvement in that specific business."

Look, we still see the global environment as really positive with a lot of volatility. GE had a strong fourth quarter with some elements better than we indicated in December. Operating EPS was $0.56, up 6% led by ind",1130,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everybody. Look, we still see the global environment as really positive with a lot of volatility. GE had a strong fourth quarter with some elements better than we indicated in December. Operating EPS was $0.56, up 6% led by industrial EPS, which grew by 23%. Orders grew by 3%, which was 5% organically, and our backlog expanded to a new record. Industrial organic growth was up 9% and margins expanded by 50 basis points. 
Our initiatives continued to deliver results. Industrial CFOA was $7.2 billion, up 64% reported in the quarter or 30% x the 2013 NBCU taxes. Capital's quarter was consistent with our expectations. 
The U.S. continued to strengthen as did Asia. Some businesses are seeing more momentum, like Aviation and Healthcare. Our Oil and Gas team executed well despite volatility. Their underlying performance was revenue flat and earnings up 6%. And we believe that our diverse and integrated model worked for investors in the quarter as it will in 2015.
We delivered on our key commitments for the year. Industrial segment profits grew by 10%, driven by 7% organic growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion. GE Capital reduced DNI by $17 billion and hit their earnings plan. CFOA was in the middle of the range at $15.2 billion. Free cash flow was $11.2 billion, up 6% for the year. Our capital allocation choices were in line with expectations. On the M&A front, Alstom should be a financial and strategic driver. Appliances is well priced and down in a good point in the cycle and the Synchrony spend will result in a substantial reduction in GE shares. We're executing a valuable pivot at GE, one that improves our business mix while delivering EPS growth and expanding returns. 
Now for orders. Total orders grew by 3%, which is pretty good in the environment. As I said earlier, organically, this is 5% in total with 3% in equipment and 8% growth in services. Orders grew by 7% for the year. We have strengthened services, which was up 6% in the quarter and 10% for the year, and we grew backlog by $17 billion year-over-year. 
Power & Water had a solid quarter but comps were impacted by the huge Algerian deal in 2013. Without that, orders were up 13% in the quarter. And we now have 15 H orders with another 30 technical selections. 
Oil & Gas orders were down 4% organically, consistent with our expectations. Turbomachinery actually saw orders grow by 16% in the quarter. Aviation orders grew by 15% and may end the year with a record backlog. Aviation commercial spares grew by 37% in the quarter. Importantly the U.S. Healthcare equipment orders grew by 17%, demonstrating renewed strength in our biggest market. 
Our success with the Tier 4 locomotive continues. We took 1,355 orders in 2014 and are positioned for record shipments in 2015. The U.S. was strong with orders growing by 18% in the fourth quarter following a 25% growth in the third quarter, and growth markets were mixed. For instance, Middle East and North Africa was negative in the quarter due to the Algerian order I talked about earlier but was up 20% for the year, and Asian growth market orders grew by 21%. We closed 2014 with a backlog of $261 billion. And in December, we called out a 2015 organic growth range of 2% to 5%, and we still feel good about this range. 
For execution, our team really executed well in the quarter, with organic growth, up 9%; and margins, up 50 basis points. For the year, Industrial segment profit was up 10%, with 7% organic revenue growth and 50 basis points of margin enhancement. 
Our initiatives are driving growth ahead of our peers. Our product lineup is quite strong. The H turbine is winning in the market. Our Aviation wins are huge with 79% LEAP share to date. The Tier 4 continues to win. Our Healthcare products are gaining share in CT, MR and ultrasound. Aviation commercial spares shipments grew by 24% and Power Gen Services grew revenue by 14%. 
As I said earlier, growth market revenues expanded by 7% in '14 with 5 of the 9 regions growing. Also an update on a few of our adjacencies. Life Sciences grew earnings by 15% for the year. Water hit a 10% operating profit rate in the quarter with 26% earnings growth for the year, and we won the Boeing 777X onboard computing system. This is a huge win and positions GE as a Tier 1 avionics supplier. 
Margins continue to be a good story, up 50 basis points for the year. Simplification and services again are the big drivers. We hit 14% of structural cost as a percentage of sales for the year, with another $1.2 billion of cost out. In corporate costs, x gains, restructuring and NBCU, declined by more than $900 million. 
We're seeing the impact of analytics on service productivity. Service margins grew by 270 basis points in the quarter and we have momentum in every business. And with an intensifying focus on gross margins and product cost, we're on track for another year of margin growth in 2015. 
Now on to cash for the quarter. Our Industrial cash grew by 64% to $7.2 billion. This is consistent with our expectations for the quarter and the year. We finished the year by shipping a tremendous amount of volume, and our teams did a great job on working capital, which reduced by $2 billion in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow for the year was $11.2 billion, up 6%, and the GE Capital dividend was $3 billion below the $6 billion they delivered in 2013. 
We ended the year with substantial liquidity and financial strength. GE Capital ended the year with Tier 1 common ratio of 12.7%, substantially above the regulatory guidelines. We returned about $11 billion to investors in dividends and buyback, and we remain on track for $12 billion to $15 billion for free cash flow in dispositions in 2015. 
We allocate our capital in line with the discussion we had in December. Our priority is to execute on Alstom, fund organic growth and continue to grow the dividend. Remember that Synchrony, at the current pricing, should return $18 billion to $20 billion for investors in the share exchange. 
In any environment where we have an uncertain macroeconomy, it's important to talk about execution. In 2014, in our performance, you can see the tangible results of how we're running GE. Our underlying business has significant operational momentum supported by the changes to how we're running GE day to day, with more transparency and more accountability. This was an excellent execution quarter for the team, and now Jeff will give you the business details."
177031,274778648,748655,"General Electric Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2015",2015-01-23,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. We had revenues of $42 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial sales of $31 billion were up 8%. And GE Capital revenues of $11.5 billion were up 4%. Operating earnings of $5.6 billion were higher",3996,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. We had revenues of $42 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial sales of $31 billion were up 8%. And GE Capital revenues of $11.5 billion were up 4%. Operating earnings of $5.6 billion were higher by 4%. Operating earnings per share of $0.56 were up 6%, with industrial EPS, up 23%; and GE Capital EPS, down 17%. Continuing EPS of $0.52 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. 
We had $0.01 impact in discontinued operations this quarter associated with WMC. This was driven by a reserve increase of $142 million to reflect WMC's current assessment of its loan loss exposure based on recent settlement activity and negotiations. WMC ended the quarter with $809 million of reserves, flat with fourth quarter of '13. 
As Jeff said, CFOA for the year was $15.2 billion. We had Industrial CFOA of $12.2 billion and received $3 billion of dividends from GE Capital. In the quarter, Industrial generated $7.2 billion of CFOA, up 64% on a reported basis and up 30% excluding the impact of NBCU taxes from last year. 
The GE tax rate for the quarter was 13%, bringing the year-to-date rate to 17%. In the quarter, we benefited from the passage of the extenders bill and deductions from higher restructuring impairments. The GE Capital tax rate was 5% in the quarter and 2% for the year, consistent with the low single-digit estimate that we've previously communicated. 
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were up 6% reported and up 9% organically, reflecting about 2 points of headwind from foreign exchange and 1 point from acquisitions and dispositions. Foreign exchange was approximately $600 million drag on Industrial segment revenue and about $180 million impact on our profit in the quarter. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 9%. 
GE Capital earnings were down 19%, primarily driven by lower gains and tax benefits associated with the Swiss and the BAY transactions in the fourth quarter of last year. I'll cover the dynamics of each of the segments in a couple of pages. 
First, I'll start with the other items page for the quarter. We have $0.04 of restructuring and other charges at corporate, but with $0.02 of that related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items, as we continue to take actions to improve the Industrial cost structure. At $353 million pretax, this was approximately $75 million higher than the plan. It reflects the acceleration of some restructuring opportunities from 2015. We also had a $217 million pretax charge, with an impairment related to a strategic investment in the energy space. This investment has underperformed in the market but we continue to expect there to be long-term value in the asset. 
In November of 2013, I reviewed with investors our plan to invest $1 billion to $1.5 billion of restructuring to accelerate the repositioning of our industrial cost footprint and position us to grow earnings, with a pivot in 2015 and '16. On the bottom of the page are the profile of those restructuring and other charges that we took in 2014 by quarter and the ones that gain associated with the Wayne disposition. For the total year, net charges were $0.11 per share or $1.7 billion pretax.
Next, I'll give you an update on Industrial cost dynamics. On SG&A, we've made a lot of progress. We ended the year at 14% SG&A to sales, which is down almost 2 points from 2013. This was driven by a combination of cost-out efforts in the Industrial segments and corporate. For the year, we took out $1.2 billion of structural costs, in line with the $1 billion plus we've been communicating with you. 
On the bottom left, you can see Industrial segment gross margins, excluding corporate. For the year, segment gross margins were down 80 basis points, which was driven entirely by negative mix as we grew equipment revenues faster than services, particularly in Wind, GEnx and Thermal. 
As we discussed at the December outlook meeting, Dan Henson, Jamie Miller and I are driving a focused initiative to improve Industrial gross margins through an intense focus on product costs, similar to our programmatic approach around SG&A. We're targeting to improve gross margins by 50 basis points in 2015. 
On the right side, you can see the corporate operating costs. The bar graph excludes gains, restructuring and NBCU operations from 2013, so you can see our true operating expenses. We've taken significant actions on corporate costs, with about $950 million reduction for the year. This includes functional headquarter cost improvements, lower global and growth spend, operating pension and retiree health cost improvements and non-repeating charges in 2013, principally the EBX charge we took in the second quarter of 2013. The focus on reducing corporate costs will continue into 2015 and we expect corporate costs to be about $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion for the year. We'll continue to reduce corporate costs, but this will be partly offset by higher pension expenses, as Jeff outlined during the outlook meeting in December. 
Now I'll go into the segments and start with Power & Water. Orders in the fourth quarter totaled $9.5 billion, down 8%. Orders were higher by 13%, excluding the Algerian mega deal in the fourth quarter of last year. Equipment orders were down 12%, driven by Thermal, down 62% as a result of a difficult comparison to last year's 270% increase, including Algeria. We had orders for 41 gas turbines in the quarter, flat with last year, excluding the Algerian deal. In the fourth quarter, we received an order for 2 H turbines, bringing units in backlog to 15 Hs, and we've been selected for another 30 units on projects and are bidding on an additional 61 units as we speak. Total gas turbine order count for the year finished at 105 units, representing 18 gigawatts of power. 
Partially offsetting Thermals orders decline was Distributed Power, which was higher by 66%, and Renewables was up 47% in the quarter. Distributed Power equipment growth was driven by turbines, up over 100%, partly offset by a decline in engines. The turbine strength was attributed to a large win in Egypt consisting of 20 trailer-mounted units, 14 LM6000s and some balance of plan. The 20 TMs and 6 of the 14 LMs converted to sales in the quarter. For the year, DP recorded orders for 167 turbines versus 174 in 2013.
Renewables equipment orders were up 47%, reflecting orders for 1,251 turbines. The U.S. was up 16%, including 138 safe harbor units associated with the PTC extension. And we saw significant growth in Latin America, the Middle East and in regions we took no orders in the fourth quarter of '13, including China and India. 
Service orders were down 2%, also driven by no repeat of the Algerian deal. Excluding Algeria, service orders grew 9% on strong transactional upgrades and outages. AGPs in the quarter were 26 versus 25 last year, bringing the total year AGP count to 80. 
Power & Water revenues of $9.4 billion in the quarter were up 22%, with very strong equipment revenues, up 37%; and service revenues, up 7%. Equipment revenue was driven by strength in Thermal, up 64%, with sales of 44 gas turbines versus 28 last year; and Renewables, up 20% on 206 more wind turbines; and DP, up 33% in the quarter.
Operating profit in the quarter totaled $2.1 billion, up 13% versus fourth quarter of '13. And earnings were driven by higher volume and cost productivity, partially offset by negative value principally priced and unfavorable mix with higher equipment sales versus services. SG&A in the quarter was down 12% year-over-year and margins in the quarter were down 190 basis points.
As you look into 2015, we expect to continue to grow services, including upgrades, and we anticipate a flat gas turbine market but expect to gain share. We're planning for Wind to deliver 3,000 to 3,200 units, and Distributed Power will be -- continue to be pressured as we look into '15.
Next, Oil & Gas. Oil & Gas orders at $4.9 billion, were down 10% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effects of FX and the Wayne disposition, orders were down 4%. Notwithstanding the volatility of oil prices in the fourth quarter, we believe the relative impact was modest, with more impact expected in 2015. Equipment orders of $2.5 billion were down 15%, reported; down 9%, organically. The Subsea orders were down 38%, with no repeat of large -- fourth quarter of last year orders with Petrobras and ENI. Downstream technology orders were down 46%, driven by a large Shell order in the fourth quarter of last year in our distributed gas solutions business, partially offset by strong growth of 7% in the downstream products platform. 
Measurement & Control equipment orders were up 6% organically as we continue to see improvement in end flow and process markets. Drilling & Surface orders were down 2% with drilling, down 72% as expected, partly offset by 7% growth in our Surface business. Turbomachinery was up 60% on natural gas orders in North America, the Middle East and in Russia.
Service orders were down 4% but up 1% organically. The TMS orders were down 10% on lower installations in the quarter, partly offset by 6% organic growth in M&C, downstream technology growth of 16% and Drilling & Surface, higher by 11%. For the year, total orders were flat, with backlog, up 1%. 
Oil & Gas revenues in the quarter of $5 billion were down 6%, reported, and flat organically, driven by 3 points of FX and 3 points of disposition impact. Equipment revenues were down 5%, with Subsea down 10% but flat excluding exchange. M&C was higher by 3% organically. And downstream technology and Drilling & Surface were up 10% and 11%, respectively. Service revenues were down 6%, primarily driven by TMS, down 11%; and M&C, down 5%, but M&C was up 12% organically.
Operating profit in the quarter was higher by 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year and up 6% organically, driven by strong value gap and cost productivity, offset by the effects of foreign exchange. Margins expanded 110 basis points in the quarter and 100 basis points for the year. 
As we outlined in the December outlook meeting, 2015 will be a challenging year for our Oil & Gas business. The management and the team are focused on executing the cost-out actions to offset volatility and deliver on their commitments.
Next up is Aviation. Aviation demand continues to be strong, with revenue passenger kilometers, November year-to-date, up 6.1% on international routes and up 5.3% on domestic routes. Freight growth was 4.4% November year-to-date. Orders for Aviation was strong, up 15% in the quarter. Equipment orders of $4.4 billion were higher by 8%, and service orders grew 25%. Equipment orders were principally driven by commercial engines. GEnx orders of $1.2 billion were up 23% on large orders from American and Air France. GE90 orders were up 2.5x to $900 million in the quarter, and LEAP and CFM recorded $1.2 billion of orders. Our total win rate for the LEAP since launch is now at 79% on narrow-body aircraft. Military equipment orders were down 59%, driven by the slow military environment. Service orders, up 25% were driven by strong commercial spares orders at $35.6 million a day, up 37%, and stronger military spares. Orders for total year 2014 grew 8% and backlog grew 7% for the year to $134 billion. Revenues in the fourth quarter were higher by 4% to $6.4 billion driven by commercial equipment revenues, up 8%; services, up 3%; and military equipment, down 3%. Commercial spares were strong, up 24%. We shipped 77 GEnx units in the quarter and 287 for the year. Leverage and operating profit were strong, with 12% growth in volume and positive value gap, partly offset by mix and higher R&D. Op margins improved 140 basis points in the quarter. Overall, the Aviation team had a strong quarter and year and we expect strong performance to continue into 2015.
Next is Healthcare. Healthcare had a better quarter than the headline results would suggest. Orders were up 1% in the quarter, but up 4% excluding foreign exchange. And the U.S. was quite strong, up 9%. Latin America and China were both up 2%, offset by Europe, down 1% but up 5% organically. Japan was down 23%, driven by the consumption tax and reimbursement reform. And the Middle East was down 26%, mostly driven by Saudi. 
Healthcare system orders were down 3% but up 2% organically, driven by U.S. imaging and ultrasound equipment orders, which were up 12% in the quarter. We saw growth across most modalities with particular strength in CT, up 22% from our new Revolution CT introduction; and ultrasound, up 15% from our new Voluson product in the women's health diagnostic space. This was offset by softer orders in Japan, Russia and the Middle East. China orders were up 2%, reflecting delays in government tenders we've seen over the last several quarters. Life Science orders, up 13%, driven by bioprocess, up 60% on very strong demand in the U.S. and Europe, offset partially by core imaging, down 7%. 
Revenues of $5.1 billion were flat but higher by 3% x foreign exchange. And the HCS revenue were down 3% but up 2% organically and Life Sciences revenues were up 9% and up 6% organically. Operating profit was down 4% but was up 1% organically. The strong cost execution, including 5% lower SG&A, was more than offset by price and foreign exchange. 
Looking forward, we expect the U.S. market to continue to improve. Although final industry figures have yet to be published, we believe we are winning this year in key modalities in the U.S. and China should grow modestly as we look into 2015. The business will continue to write structural and product cost out as we move forward. 
Next, Transportation, which had a strong orders quarter, up 62%; with equipment orders, up 107%; and services higher by 19%. In 2014, Transportation had its strongest orders year ever at $9.6 billion, up 89%. Locomotive orders in the quarter were 284 units versus 70 last year, driven by North America where we took orders for 235 additional Tier 4-compliant units. For the total year 2014, we received orders for 1,355 Tier 4-compliant locomotives. Backlog for the year grew 43% to $21 billion, with equipment higher by 148% and services higher by 22%. Carloads grew strongly in North America, up 4.4% in 2014, led by intermodal, up 5.4%. Commodities, including agriculture, were up 3.7% and petroleum was up 12.5% for the year. In the fourth quarter, petroleum volumes continue to grow, up 16% year-over-year. 
Revenues in the quarter were up 8%, driven by locomotives, up 8%. Service is up 14%, partly offset by mining, down by 31%. For the total year, revenue was down 4% largely driven by mining.
Operating profit in the quarter was up 13% on higher locomotive volume, material deflation and cost productivity, partly offset by lower mining volume. The Transportation team has executed well and has positioned the business to capitalize on the new Tier 4 requirements in 2015. 
Next, Energy Management, which earned more in the fourth quarter than it earned in the entirety of 2013. Orders in the quarter were down 2%, largely driven by softer marine orders and Power Conversion, which was down about 16%, partially offset by Digital Energy, up strongly at 17%; and Industrial Solutions, up 5%. Backlog grew 9% to $5 billion.
Revenues were down 2% but up 2% organically. Power Conversion revenues grew 6%. Digital Energy grew 1%. Industrial Solutions was down 6%. Operating profit of $113 million was higher by 2.5x on strong value gap and cost execution. For the year, we are in $246 million of operating profit, up 124%. Execution continues to improve and we expect substantial improvements again in 2015.
Appliances & Lighting revenue in the quarter was up 5%. Appliance revenues were up 8% driven by strong volume. Industry core units were up 8% with both retail and contract markets, up 8% as well. Lighting revenues were down 1% on lower traditional product demand, which was down 15% and more than offset the strong LED lighting growth of 72% in the quarter. LED now makes up 27% of Lightings revenues, up from 16% in the fourth quarter of last year. Operating profit of $188 million was up 32% in the quarter and margins expanded by 160 basis points.
Next, I'll cover GE Capital. GE Capital's revenue of $11.5 billion was up 4%, primarily from lower marks and impairments. Net income of $1.9 billion was down 19% principally driven by lower gains and tax benefits, including those related to last year's portfolio exits, including the Swiss and BAY bank transactions, partially offset by lower credit cost, marks and impairments. ENI, excluding liquidity of $363 billion, was down $17 billion or 5% from last year and down $2 billion sequentially. Nonstrategic ENI was down $12 billion to $132 billion or 8% versus last year. Net interest margin in the quarter at 5% was essentially flat. 
GE Capital's Tier 1 common ratio on the Basel I basis remains in a strong position and ended the year at 12.7%. This is up approximately 60 basis points from the third quarter and 150 basis points year-over-year. Our liquidity levels are strong, ending the quarter at $76 billion. This includes $13 billion attributable to Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remains stable at $25 billion and we have $10 billion of long-term debt issuance for the year, excluding the activity related to Synchrony. In 2015, we've already issued $7 billion of long-term debt as part of our total year plan of around $20 billion. 
On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be stable with significant improvements in our mortgage portfolio, driven primarily by the sale of a $0.5 billion nonperforming loan portfolio in our U.K. home lending business, which generated a small gain during the quarter and the move of our Hungarian bank to held for sale. We expect to complete the exit of the Hungary bank during the first half of 2015. 
In terms of segment performance, Commercial Lending & Leasing business ended the quarter with $172 billion of assets, down 1% to last year, largely driven by foreign exchange. Global on-book volume was $12 billion, down 10%. However, we continue to see strengthening in the U.S., largely in equipment financing with volume up 4%. New business returns in both lending and equipment were largely in line with the first 3 quarters of the year. Earnings of $549 million were up 109% driven by lower marks and impairments. In 2014, the CLO business earned $2.3 billion, up 16%. 
The Consumer segment ended the quarter with $136 billion of assets, up 3% from last year, with earnings of $1.9 billion, down 45%. Our share of Synchrony earnings was $451 million, down 3%, driven by minority interest and partially offset by core growth. Consistent with last quarter as a now publicly traded company, CEO, Margaret Keane and the team will host their own investor call later this morning. Separation efforts remain on track. 
Excluding Synchrony, assets were down 17% as we continue to reduce our presence in nonstrategic portfolios. Earnings, excluding Synchrony, were at $686 million, down 57%, driven by the non-repeat of gains and tax benefits recorded last year for the Swiss and BAY transactions, partially offset by $594 million gain associated with the sale of the Nordics consumer platform. 
Just as a reminder, as the result of the accounting guidelines, roughly 1/2 that gain was recognized in prior quarters as tax benefits in benefits GE Capital corporate. These benefits were reversed in the fourth quarter, and the gain was taken in the Consumer segment resulting in a net gain in GE Capital of $300 million in the fourth quarter. In 2014, the Consumer segment earned $3 billion, down 30%. 
In Real Estate, assets of $34 billion were down 11% versus prior year. The equity book is down 35% from a year ago to $9 billion. Net income of $299 million was up 134%, driven by higher gains and portfolio earnings partially offset by higher impairments. In the current quarter, we sold 350 properties from our Real Estate equity book, with a book value of about $2.1 billion, for $328 million in gain. In 2014, the Real Estate business earned $1 billion, down 42% on lower gains.
In the verticals, GECAS earned $218 million, up 207%, driven by lower impairments partially offset by lower gains and lower assets. Overall, the portfolio is in great shape, and we finished the quarter with 0 delinquencies and 3 aircraft on the ground. New volume remains strong at $2 billion, up 50% with attractive returns in line with the first 3 quarters of the year. For the year, GECAS earned $1 billion, was up 17% from prior year. The milestone acquisition continues to progress, and we expect to close during the first quarter of 2015 pending regulatory approvals. 
Energy finance earned $111 million, down 5% in the quarter in line with lower assets. EFS's volume was up 31% year-over-year at a very attractive returns. In 2014, EFS business earned $401 million, down 2%. 
Overall, key for the team is continue to execute the portfolio strategy and deliver solid operating results. As we look forward to 2015, we expect GE Capital to generate about $0.60 on an EPS basis as Jeff discussed last month during the annual outlook meeting. We expect GE Capital to earn approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter of the year.
Lastly, I wanted to spend a minute and talk about the framework for 2015 and cover 4 points. On the left, you have our segment outlook, as Jeff shared in December. Overall, there's no change in that framework. 
On the right side, first, positively, we are seeing strength in the U.S. health care market. Orders were strong, up 9%, and equipment orders were up 17% with particular strength in imaging and ultrasound. Orders have been on a positive trend in the U.S. since the first quarter of 2014. And then after the final fourth quarter results, we are more encouraged that this trend will continue into 2015.
Second is Aviation, which we feel is stronger. Spares orders grew 25% in 2014, and we're targeting high single-digit growth in 2015. Revenue passenger kilometers and freight miles continued to be strong, and low Jet A should be a meaningful positive for our customers in the space. 
When you think about currency, we plan 2015 assuming a stronger dollar, but we see some continued strengthening since the December meeting. Assuming the euro at today's rate for the entire year, foreign exchange would have a modest impact, about $0.01 a share. So very manageable in the context of the total company.
In December, we also outlined our expectations for Oil & Gas, with a backdrop of oil at $60 to $65 a barrel. Since then, prices have fallen further. When we planned the year, we relied on multiple scenarios, including a further fall in oil prices. Lorenzo and the team are laser-focused on executing against their backlog and their costs. The team is reducing employment, executing restructuring and simplification projects to materially reduce their cost structure, all predicated and on a tougher scenario. Additionally, across the company, we expect to realize some incremental benefits in direct retail and other logistical and variable costs as a result of lower fuel costs.
Oil & Gas represented about 15% of our Industrial segment earnings in 2014. We believe that within the context of the company portfolio, the potentially tougher oil and gas scenario is manageable and consistent within our framework. 
With that, I'd like to pass it back over to Jeff."

We expect the Industrial EPS of between $1.10 and $1.20 behind solid organic growth and margin expansion. Corporate costs will be substantially lower. Remember, we funded $0.11 of uncovered restructuring in 2014. In 2015, we will offset restructuring with gains. In addition, we should have the impact from 6 months of Alstom. Capital results were on track, with Synchrony timing the main variable. Free cash flow and dispositions are on track for the $12 billion to $15 billion we spoke about in the year. And again, cash returned to investors depends on Synchrony timing but would be substantial if we do the split this year.
So closing the year, and since the outlook meeting, the GE world remains balanced. There are always puts and takes in the global economy. For instance, the U.S. is quite strong, which has a positive impact in businesses like Healthcare and Aviation, and the price of oil has declined even further since December.
Our job is to manage the company through volatility. And while we see the potential for risk to Oil & Gas based on current oil prices, we're aggressively working offsets through cost actions and positive opportunities elsewhere in GE. We're also seeing stronger momentum at several other businesses. In total, this demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach. Looking back in 2014, out of 8 industrial businesses, 3 beat their plan, 3 met their plan and 2 missed their plan, but together, we did what we set out to do, growing core earnings by 10%.
In addition, let me give you more insight to the plan I gave you in December. We have an internal plan that is above the midpoint of the range I gave you. The business results that delivered that plan are embedded in our team's new incentive compensation for the year. In other words, our leaders achieve their IC when we hit an EPS that is above the midpoint of this range. Now I want you to have transparency on how we think about the world and manage our team. Our targets encompass a thoughtful approach to the environment and a broad range of macro dynamics. So let me reiterate. We feel comfortable with our framework. 2015 is an important year for the company, and we plan to deliver for you. 
And now Matt, back to you, and let's take some questions."

Scott, I mean, the way we've thought about it, particularly when we went through it in December with you, is we evaluated multiple scenarios, including a general expectation at that point that we'd be down 0% to 5%, but we evaluated scenarios that we're down beyond that on lower oil prices. And when we talked about the range with you of $1.70, $1.80 in total, $1.10 and $1.20 industrially, we included in that our view of what those downside scenarios are. So I think you got to step back and look at it. Oil & Gas is 15% of our segment earnings in Industrial. Being down beyond 5%, I think, is manageable within the context of the Industrial portfolio. And I think importantly, Lorenzo and the team are like laser-focused on driving the cost -- the productivity in their business, and the programs they launched were the programs needed to support a lower downside scenario than what we even talked about in December. So I think we feel reasonably comfortable, as comfortable as you can be, that within the context of what we've shared with you, that we can manage this inside the portfolio, our Industrial portfolio."

So effectively, what we -- there were several points within the contract that were opened and negotiated post the signing. We made a couple of adjustments. It's about EUR 250 million more that we will play at closing. Part of that was a payment we're making at our request. We wanted to -- the legal entities, we want to restructure and buy into. We want it to change a bit for our benefit long term in terms of taxes and other ways. And so part of that EUR 250 million was a payment to ask them to close differently from a legal entity perspective than what was originally contemplated. The second was we originally agreed to about a 5-year use of the Alstom brand. We extended that in this agreement to 25 years. That was about $85 million associated with that, and then there were some other very small items. I think you'll hear Alstom talk about EUR 400 million. They're accounting about $100 million of the interest that they contemplated owing us on cash that they used over the course of the year. We never modeled that. We never counted that. So we see it as about a EUR 250 million adjustment to the purchase price, but we get a lot of long-term value as a result of that legal entity restructuring."

We hedge all our transaction exposure to the extent we can. We are subject to some translation, and we do very short-term hedging around earnings in a quarter. So there'll be some volatility associated with currency, but I think my point was that in the context of the company, we're not at a point yet where we think it's something that's not manageable across our portfolio. We do have natural hedging. We have the ability in some of our businesses to move our manufacturing base globally, which allows us to take advantage of changes in currency. And in a couple of our businesses where that matters, we are actively looking at our bill plan for the year to make sure we take as much advantage of that as possible. I would say in the short run here, we've seen very little that I'm aware of, very little impact on our order performance as a result of currency. That may play out more in 2015, but through fourth quarter of this year, we've seen very little of that."

And then what we call rising Asia, Nigel, which is really China, India, ASEAN, stuff like that, those are actually quite positive for us right now from an order standpoint. And then the resource-rich countries, I think, are going to be mixed depending on what your cost position is and things like that.

But clearly, places that are marginal producers like Iraq or Venezuela, things like that, those are going to be places that we're not counting on much business in 2015. So it's kind of a mixed bag.

That will be a high-tax transaction, which will bump the rate up to low 20s for next year. And I think that's consistent with what we've communicated. The trend will probably be higher in the early part of the year, lower in the later part of the year on Industrial tax. On restructuring, same discussion. We're going to do restructuring next year. It's critical to delivering on everything we've talked about. We've assumed the gains. The Appliances signaling transaction will happen midyear. We will do restructuring in the first half of the year, before those gains manifest themselves. But we still believe that for the total year, our restructuring and gains and to some degree, the impact of mortality are all going to offset. We're not going to be doing, today anyway, naked restructuring."

We reversed that in the fourth quarter, and the full effect of the disposition took place in the fourth quarter in the Retail segment. So within the fourth quarter, about $300 million, $600 million for the year. In addition, I talked about -- we sold a nonperforming loan portfolio in our U.K. home lending business for about $0.5 billion, had a very small gain associated with it, about $20 million, but a big deal for our U.K. portfolio. I talked about $2.1 billion of Real Estate sales in the quarter that -- led by Japan multifamily that we sold.

Any of that coming through?

I would say most of the pricing impact that we see in the fourth quarter is more mix-driven than anything else. For instance, in Power, you've got -- most of the heavy-duty gas turbine action is in the H. That really is not in the base yet, but those are higher-priced, bigger units. You get a little bit more competitiveness on aeros, but not a lot to talk about. Oil & Gas, we really haven't seen it yet nor have we seen -- there's some initial letters and stuff like that on pricing, but no real action. I think that's all. Again, I don't think we've seen it in the fourth quarter. We haven't seen it yet, but this is early days. So I think there's going to be -- there's certainly going to be chatter out there. So I don't really take all the stuff that's happened necessarily in the fourth quarter as what's going to happen throughout the rest of '15. I just think we have to be ready on all fronts. And I would say no conversation all around currency and anything along that yet. We'll see how that plays out. In terms of Healthcare, look, I think you're right. This has been the historical business model, but I also think kind of what we're doing with, Steve, with Jeff and Jamie and Dan Heintzelman is we're ripping apart the critical access in gross margins across each one of these businesses. And I think in Healthcare, managing the pricing is going to be a key part of how we get enhanced gross margin improvement in that specific business."

So look, I would just echo back, Andrew, the comment I made in December. We like the Oil & Gas business. We like how we're positioned in it, and we think these cycles give us an opportunity to pick up market position similar to what we did in the Aviation business and the Power business and other businesses. But short of going through private conversations with customers, I can just say that we still think with a lot of the NOCs -- or a certain segment of the NOCs, there's still potentially going to be some good business to be done in 2015."

And that's where we are today. Jamie, in parallel with that, is continuing to drive and support the businesses with ERP, which is a big part of giving them visibility and driving our ability to consolidate, et cetera. So we are in the process right now of building very detailed, action-oriented plans that have every dollar of cost between sales and the gross margin line owned by somebody with a plan. So that's where we are today. I would say this is going to accelerate throughout the year. We're early in the process now, but I'm quite confident if we get out of the way we have programmatically around SG&A, I think we can make a big difference here. And I think there's a lot of opportunity, as Jeff said earlier, particularly around original equipment margins."

Look, we still see the global environment as generally positive with a lot of volatility. GE had a strong fourth quarter with some elements better than we indicated in December. Operating EPS was $0.56, up 6% led by",1129,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everybody. Look, we still see the global environment as generally positive with a lot of volatility. GE had a strong fourth quarter with some elements better than we indicated in December. Operating EPS was $0.56, up 6% led by industrial EPS, which grew by 23%. Orders grew by 3%, which was 5% organically, and our backlog expanded to a new record. Industrial organic growth was up 9% and margins expanded by 50 basis points. 
Our initiatives continued to deliver results. Industrial CFOA was $7.2 billion, up 64% reported in the quarter or 30% x the 2013 NBCU taxes. Capital's quarter was consistent with our expectations. 
The U.S. continued to strengthen as did Asia. Some businesses are seeing more momentum, like Aviation and Healthcare. Our Oil and Gas team executed well despite volatility. Their underlying performance was revenue flat and earnings up 6%. And we believe that our diverse and integrated model worked for investors in the quarter as it will in 2015.
We delivered on our key commitments for the year. Industrial segment profits grew by 10%, driven by 7% organic growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion. GE Capital reduced DNI by $17 billion and hit their earnings plan. CFOA was in the middle of the range at $15.2 billion. Free cash flow was $11.2 billion, up 6% for the year. Our capital allocation choices were in line with expectations. On the M&A front, Alstom should be a financial and strategic driver. Appliances is well priced and done at a good point in the cycle and the Synchrony spin will result in a substantial reduction in GE shares. We're executing a valuable pivot at GE, one that improves our business mix while delivering EPS growth and expanding returns. 
Now for orders. Total orders grew by 3%, which is pretty good in the environment. As I said earlier, organically, this is 5% in total with 3% in equipment and 8% growth in services. Orders grew by 7% for the year. We have strengthened services, which was up 6% in the quarter and 10% for the year, and we grew backlog by $17 billion year-over-year. 
Power & Water had a solid quarter but comps were impacted by the huge Algerian deal in 2013. Without that, orders were up 13% in the quarter. And we now have 15 H orders with another 30 technical selections. 
Oil & Gas orders were down 4% organically, consistent with our expectations. Turbomachinery actually saw orders grow by 16% in the quarter. Aviation orders grew by 15% and may end the year with a record backlog. Aviation commercial spares grew by 37% in the quarter. Importantly, the U.S. Healthcare equipment orders grew by 17%, demonstrating renewed strength in our biggest market. 
Our success with the Tier 4 locomotive continues. We took 1,355 orders in 2014 and are positioned for record shipments in 2015. The U.S. was strong with orders growing by 18% in the fourth quarter, following a 25% growth in the third quarter, and growth markets were mixed. For instance, Middle East and North Africa was negative in the quarter due to the Algerian order I talked about earlier but was up 20% for the year, and Asian growth market orders grew by 21%. We closed 2014 with a backlog of $261 billion. And in December, we called out a 2015 organic growth range of 2% to 5%, and we still feel good about this range. 
For execution, our team really executed well in the quarter, with organic growth up 9% and margins up 50 basis points. For the year, Industrial segment profit was up 10%, with 7% organic revenue growth and 50 basis points of margin enhancement. 
Our initiatives are driving growth ahead of our peers. Our product lineup is quite strong. The H turbine is winning in the market. Our Aviation wins are huge with 79% LEAP share to date. The Tier 4 continues to win. Our Healthcare products are gaining share in CT, MR and ultrasound. Aviation commercial spares shipments grew by 24% and Power Gen Services grew revenue by 14%. 
As I said earlier, growth market revenues expanded by 7% in '14 with 5 of the 9 regions growing. Also an update on a few of our adjacencies. Life Sciences grew earnings by 15% for the year. Water hit a 10% operating profit rate in the quarter with 26% earnings growth for the year, and we won the Boeing 777X onboard computing system. This is a huge win and positions GE as a Tier 1 avionics supplier. 
Margins continue to be a good story, up 50 basis points for the year. Simplification and services again are the big drivers. We hit 14% of structural cost as a percentage of sales for the year, with another $1.2 billion of cost out. In corporate costs, x gains, restructuring and NBCU, declined by more than $900 million. 
We're seeing the impact of analytics on service productivity. Service margins grew by 270 basis points in the quarter and we have momentum in every business. And with an intensifying focus on gross margins and product cost, we're on track for another year of margin growth in 2015. 
Now on to cash. For the quarter, our Industrial cash grew by 64% to $7.2 billion. This is consistent with our expectations for the quarter and the year. We finished the year by shipping a tremendous amount of volume, and our teams did a great job on working capital, which reduced by $2 billion in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow for the year was $11.2 billion, up 6%; and the GE Capital dividend was $3 billion, below the $6 billion they delivered in 2013. 
We ended the year with substantial liquidity and financial strength. GE Capital ended the year with Tier 1 common ratio of 12.7%, substantially above the regulatory guidelines. We returned about $11 billion to investors in dividends and buyback, and we remain on track for $12 billion to $15 billion for free cash flow in dispositions in 2015. 
We will allocate our capital in line with the discussion we had in December. Our priority is to execute on Alstom, fund organic growth and continue to grow the dividend. Remember that Synchrony, at the current pricing, should return $18 billion to $20 billion for investors in the share exchange. 
In any environment where we have an uncertain macroeconomy, it's important to talk about execution. In 2014, in our performance, you can see the tangible results of how we're running GE. Our underlying business has significant operational momentum supported by the changes to how we're running GE day-to-day, with more transparency and more accountability. This was an excellent execution quarter for the team, and now Jeff will give you the business details."
177031,274778648,748702,"General Electric Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2015",2015-01-23,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. We had revenues of $42 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial sales of $31 billion were up 8%. And GE Capital revenues of $11.5 billion were up 4%. Operating earnings of $5.6 billion were higher",3993,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. We had revenues of $42 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial sales of $31 billion were up 8%. And GE Capital revenues of $11.5 billion were up 4%. Operating earnings of $5.6 billion were higher by 4%. Operating earnings per share of $0.56 were up 6%, with industrial EPS up 23% and GE Capital EPS down 17%. Continuing EPS of $0.52 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. 
We had $0.01 impact in discontinued operations this quarter associated with WMC. This was driven by a reserve increase of $142 million to reflect WMC's current assessment of its loan loss exposure based on recent settlement activity and negotiations. WMC ended the quarter with $809 million in reserves, flat with fourth quarter of '13. 
As Jeff said, CFOA for the year was $15.2 billion. We had Industrial CFOA of $12.2 billion and received $3 billion of dividends from GE Capital. In the quarter, Industrial generated $7.2 billion of CFOA, up 64% on a reported basis and up 30% excluding the impact of NBCU taxes from last year. 
The GE tax rate for the quarter was 13%, bringing the year-to-date rate to 17%. In the quarter, we benefited from the passage of the extenders bill and deductions from higher restructuring and impairments. The GE Capital tax rate was 5% for the quarter and 2% for the year, consistent with the low single-digits estimate that we previously communicated. 
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were up 6% reported and up 9% organically, reflecting about 2 points of headwind from foreign exchange and 1 point from acquisitions and dispositions. Foreign exchange was approximately $600 million drag on Industrial segment revenue and about $180 million impact on op profit in the quarter. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 9%. 
GE Capital earnings were down 19%, primarily driven by lower gains and tax benefits associated with the Swiss and the BAY transactions in the fourth quarter of last year. I'll cover the dynamics of each of the segments in a couple of pages. 
First, I'll start with the other items page for the quarter. We have $0.04 of restructuring and other charges at corporate, but with $0.02 of that related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items, as we continue to take actions to improve the Industrial cost structure. At $353 million pretax, this was approximately $75 million higher than the plan and reflects the acceleration of some restructuring opportunities from 2015. We also had a $217 million pretax charge, with an impairment related to a strategic investment in the energy space. This investment has underperformed in the market but we continue to expect there to be long-term value in the asset. 
In November of 2013, I reviewed with investors our plan to invest $1 billion to $1.5 billion in restructuring to accelerate the repositioning of our industrial cost footprint and position us to grow earnings, with a pivot in 2015 and '16. On the bottom of the page are the profile of those restructuring and other charges that we took in 2014 by quarter and the $0.01 gain associated with the Wayne disposition. For the total year, net charges were $0.11 per share or $1.7 billion pretax.
Next, I'll give you an update on Industrial cost dynamics. On SG&A, we've made a lot of progress. We ended the year at 14% SG&A to sales, which is down almost 2 points from 2013. This was driven by a combination of cost-out efforts in the Industrial segments and corporate. For the year, we took out $1.2 billion of structural costs, in line with the $1 billion plus we've been communicating with you. 
On the bottom left, you can see Industrial segment gross margins, excluding corporate. For the year, segment gross margins were down 80 basis points, which was driven entirely by negative mix as we grew equipment revenues faster than services, particularly in Wind, GEnx and Thermal. 
As we discussed at the December outlook meeting, Dan Heintzelman, Jamie Miller and I are driving a focused initiative to improve Industrial gross margins through an intense focus on product costs, similar to our programmatic approach around SG&A. We're targeting to improve gross margins by 50 basis points in 2015. 
On the right side, you can see the corporate operating costs. The bar graph excludes gains, restructuring and NBCU operations from 2013, so you can see our true operating expenses. We've taken significant actions on corporate costs, with about $950 million reduction for the year. This includes functional headquarter cost improvements, lower global and growth spend, operating pension and retiree health cost improvements and non-repeating charges in 2013, principally the EBX charge we took in the second quarter of 2013. The focus on reducing corporate costs will continue into 2015 and we expect corporate costs to be about $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion for the year. We'll continue to reduce corporate costs, but this will be partly offset by higher pension expenses, as Jeff outlined during the outlook meeting in December. 
Now I'll go into the segments and start with Power & Water. Orders in the fourth quarter totaled $9.5 billion, down 8%. Orders were higher by 13%, excluding the Algerian mega deal in the fourth quarter of last year. Equipment orders were down 12%, driven by Thermal, down 62%, as a result of a difficult comparison to last year's 270% increase, including Algeria. We had orders for 41 gas turbines in the quarter, flat with last year, excluding the Algerian deal. In the fourth quarter, we received an order for 2 H turbines, bringing units in backlog to 15 Hs, and we've been selected for another 30 units on projects and are bidding on an additional 61 units as we speak. Total gas turbine order count for the year finished at 105 units, representing 18 gigawatts of power. 
Partially offsetting Thermals orders decline was Distributed Power, which was higher by 66%, and Renewables was up 47% in the quarter. Distributed Power equipment growth was driven by turbines, up over 100%, partly offset by a decline in engines. The turbine strength was attributed to a large win in Egypt consisting of 20 trailer-mounted units, 14 LM6000s and some balance of plan [ph]. The 20 TMs and 6 of the 14 LMs converted to sales in the quarter. For the year, DP recorded orders for 167 turbines versus 174 in 2013.
Renewables equipment orders were up 47%, reflecting orders for 1,251 turbines. The U.S. was up 16%, including 138 safe harbor units associated with the PTC extension. And we saw significant growth in Latin America, the Middle East and in regions we took no orders in the fourth quarter of '13, including China and India. 
Service orders were down 2%, also driven by no repeat of the Algerian deal. Excluding Algeria, service orders grew 9% on strong transactional upgrades and outages. AGPs in the quarter were 26 versus 25 last year, bringing the total year AGP count to 80. 
Power & Water revenues of $9.4 billion in the quarter were up 22%, with very strong equipment revenues up 37% and service revenues up 7%. Equipment revenue was driven by strength in Thermal, up 64%, with sales of 44 gas turbines versus 28 last year; and Renewables up 20% on 206 more wind turbines; and DP up 33% in the quarter.
Operating profit in the quarter totaled $2.1 billion, up 13% versus fourth quarter of '13. And earnings were driven by higher volume and cost productivity, partially offset by negative value gap, principally price, and unfavorable mix with higher equipment sales versus services. SG&A in the quarter was down 12% year-over-year and margins in the quarter were down 190 basis points.
As you look into 2015, we expect to continue to grow services, including upgrades, and we anticipate a flat gas turbine market but expect to gain share. We're planning for Wind to deliver 3,000 to 3,200 units, and Distributed Power will be -- continue to be pressured as we look into '15.
Next, Oil & Gas. Oil & Gas orders at $4.9 billion, were down 10% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effects of FX and the Wayne disposition, orders were down 4%. Notwithstanding the volatility of oil prices in the fourth quarter, we believe the relative impact was modest, with more impact expected in 2015. Equipment orders of $2.5 billion were down 15%, reported, down 9% organically. The Subsea orders were down 38%, with no repeat of large -- fourth quarter of last year orders with Petrobras and ENI. Downstream technology orders were down 46%, driven by a large Shell order in the fourth quarter of last year in our distributed gas solutions business, partially offset by strong growth of 7% in the downstream products platform. 
Measurement & Control equipment orders were up 6% organically as we continue to see improvement in end, flow and process markets. Drilling & Surface orders were down 2% with drilling, down 72% as expected, partly offset by 7% growth in our Surface business. Turbomachinery was up 60% on natural gas orders in North America, the Middle East and in Russia.
Service orders were down 4% but up 1% organically. The TMS orders were down 10% on lower installations in the quarter, partly offset by 6% organic growth in M&C, downstream technology growth of 16% and Drilling & Surface higher by 11%. For the year, total orders were flat, with backlog up 1%. 
Oil & Gas revenues in the quarter of $5 billion were down 6%, reported, and flat organically, driven by 3 points of FX and 3 points of disposition impact. Equipment revenues were down 5%, with Subsea down 10% but flat excluding exchange. M&C was higher by 3% organically. And downstream technology and Drilling & Surface were up 10% and 11%, respectively. Service revenues were down 6%, primarily driven by TMS, down 11%, and M&C down 5%, but M&C was up 12% organically.
Operating profit in the quarter was higher by 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year and up 6% organically, driven by strong value gap and cost productivity, offset by the effects of foreign exchange. Margins expanded 110 basis points in the quarter and 100 basis points for the year. 
As we outlined in the December outlook meeting, 2015 will be a challenging year for our Oil & Gas business. Lorenzo and the team are focused on executing on the cost-out actions to offset volatility and deliver on their commitments.
Next up is Aviation. Aviation demand continues to be strong, with revenue passenger kilometers, November year-to-date, up 6.1% on international routes and up 5.3% on domestic routes. Freight growth was 4.4% November year-to-date. Orders for Aviation were strong, up 15% in the quarter. Equipment orders of $4.4 billion were higher by 8%, and service orders grew 25%. Equipment orders were principally driven by commercial engines. GEnx orders of $1.2 billion were up 23% on large orders from American and Air France. GE90 orders were up 2.5x to $900 million in the quarter, and LEAP and CFM recorded $1.2 billion of orders. Our total win rate for the LEAP since launch is now at 79% on narrow-body aircraft. Military equipment orders were down 59%, driven by the slow military environment. Service orders, up 25%, were driven by strong commercial spares orders at $35.6 million a day, up 37%, and stronger military spares. Orders for total year 2014 grew 8% and backlog grew 7% for the year to $134 billion. Revenues in the fourth quarter were higher by 4% to $6.4 billion, driven by commercial equipment revenues, up 8%; services, up 3%; and military equipment, down 3%. Commercial spares were strong, up 24%. We shipped 77 GEnx units in the quarter and 287 for the year. Leverage and operating profit were strong, with 12% growth in volume and positive value gap, partly offset by mix and higher R&D. Op margins improved 140 basis points in the quarter. Overall, the Aviation team had a strong quarter and year, and we expect strong performance to continue into 2015.
Next is Healthcare. Healthcare had a better quarter than the headline results would suggest. Orders were up 1% in the quarter, but up 4% excluding foreign exchange. And the U.S. was quite strong, up 9%. Latin America and China were both up 2%, offset by Europe, down 1% but up 5% organically. Japan was down 23%, driven by the consumption tax and reimbursement reform. And the Middle East was down 26%, mostly driven by Saudi. 
Healthcare system orders were down 3% but up 2% organically, driven by U.S. imaging and ultrasound equipment orders, which were up 12% in the quarter. We saw growth across most modalities with particular strength in CT, up 22% from our new Revolution CT introduction, and ultrasound up 15% from our new Voluson product in the women's health diagnostic space. This was offset by softer orders in Japan, Russia and the Middle East. China orders were up 2%, reflecting delays in government tenders we've seen over the last several quarters. Life Science orders, up 13%, driven by bioprocess, up 60%, on very strong demand in the U.S. and Europe, offset partially by core imaging, down 7%. 
Revenues of $5.1 billion were flat but higher by 3% x foreign exchange. And the HCS revenues were down 3% but up 2% organically and Life Sciences revenues were up 9% and up 6% organically. Operating profit was down 4% but was up 1% organically. The strong cost execution, including 5% lower SG&A, was more than offset by price and foreign exchange. 
Looking forward, we expect the U.S. market to continue to improve. Although final industry figures have yet to be published, we believe we are winning share in key modalities in the U.S., and China should grow modestly as we look into 2015. The business will continue to write structural and product cost out as we move forward. 
Next, Transportation, which had a strong orders quarter, up 62%, with equipment orders up 107% and services higher by 19%. In 2014, Transportation had its strongest orders year ever at $9.6 billion, up 89%. Locomotive orders in the quarter were 284 units versus 70 last year, driven by North America where we took orders for 235 additional Tier 4-compliant units. For the total year 2014, we received orders for 1,355 Tier 4-compliant locomotives. Backlog for the year grew 43% to $21 billion, with equipment higher by 148% and services higher by 22%. Carloads grew strongly in North America, up 4.4% in 2014, led by intermodal, up 5.4%. Commodities, including agriculture, were up 3.7% and petroleum was up 12.5% for the year. In the fourth quarter, petroleum volumes continue to grow, up 16% year-over-year. 
Revenues in the quarter were up 8%, driven by locomotives, up 8%. Services up 14%, partly offset by mining, down by 31%. For the total year, revenue was down 4%, largely driven by mining.
Operating profit in the quarter was up 13% on higher locomotive volume, material deflation and cost productivity, partly offset by lower mining volume. The Transportation team has executed well and has positioned the business to capitalize on the new Tier 4 requirements in 2015. 
Next, Energy Management, which earned more in the fourth quarter than it earned in the entirety of 2013. Orders in the quarter were down 2%, largely driven by softer marine orders and Power Conversion, which was down about 16%, partially offset by Digital Energy, up strongly at 17%; and Industrial Solutions, up 5%. Backlog grew 9% to $5 billion.
Revenues were down 2% but up 2% organically. Power Conversion revenues grew 6%. Digital Energy grew 1%. Industrial Solutions was down 6%. Operating profit of $113 million was higher by 2.5x on strong value gap and cost execution. For the year, we earned $246 million of operating profit, up 124%. Execution continues to improve and we expect substantial improvements again in 2015.
Appliances & Lighting revenue in the quarter was up 5%. Appliance revenues were up 8%, driven by strong volume. Industry core units were up 8%, with both retail and contract markets up 8% as well. Lighting revenues were down 1% on lower traditional product demand, which was down 15% and more than offset the strong LED lighting growth of 72% in the quarter. LED now makes up 27% of Lightings revenues, up from 16% in the fourth quarter of last year. Operating profit of $188 million was up 32% in the quarter and margins expanded by 160 basis points.
Next, I'll cover GE Capital. GE Capital's revenue of $11.5 billion was up 4%, primarily from lower marks and impairments. Net income of $1.9 billion was down 19%, principally driven by lower gains and tax benefits, including those related to last year's portfolio exits, including the Swiss and BAY bank transactions, partially offset by lower credit cost, marks and impairments. ENI, excluding liquidity of $363 billion, was down $17 billion or 5% from last year and down $2 billion sequentially. Nonstrategic ENI was down $12 billion to $132 billion or 8% versus last year. Net interest margin in the quarter at 5% was essentially flat. 
GE Capital's Tier 1 common ratio on the Basel I basis remains in a strong position and ended the year at 12.7%. This is up approximately 60 basis points from the third quarter and 150 basis points year-over-year. Our liquidity levels are strong, ending the quarter at $76 billion. This includes $13 billion attributable to Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remains stable at $25 billion and we had $10 billion of long-term debt issuance for the year, excluding the activity related to Synchrony. In 2015, we've already issued $7 billion of long-term debt as part of our total year plan of around $20 billion. 
On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be stable with significant improvements in our mortgage portfolio, driven primarily by the sale of a $0.5 billion nonperforming loan portfolio in our U.K. home lending business, which generated a small gain during the quarter, and the move of our Hungarian bank to held for sale. We expect to complete the exit of the Hungary bank during the first half of 2015. 
In terms of segment performance, Commercial Lending & Leasing business ended the quarter with $172 billion of assets, down 1% to last year, largely driven by foreign exchange. Global on-book volume was $12 billion, down 10%. However, we continue to see strengthening in the U.S., largely in equipment financing with volume up 4%. New business returns in both lending and equipment were largely in line with the first 3 quarters of the year. Earnings of $549 million were up 109% driven by lower marks and impairments. In 2014, the CLL business earned $2.3 billion, up 16%. 
The Consumer segment ended the quarter with $136 billion of assets, up 3% from last year, with earnings of $1.1 billion, down 45%. Our share of Synchrony earnings was $451 million, down 3%, driven by minority interest and partially offset by core growth. Consistent with last quarter as a now publicly traded company, CEO Margaret Keane and the team will host their own investor call later this morning. Separation efforts remain on track. 
Excluding Synchrony, assets were down 17% as we continue to reduce our presence in nonstrategic portfolios. Earnings, excluding Synchrony, were at $686 million, down 57%, driven by the non-repeat of gains and tax benefits recorded last year for the Swiss and BAY transactions, partially offset by $594 million gain associated with the sale of the Nordics consumer platform. 
Just as a reminder, as a result of the accounting guidelines, roughly 1/2 that gain was recognized in prior quarters as tax benefits in GE Capital corporate. These benefits were reversed in the fourth quarter, and the gain was taken in the Consumer segment, resulting in a net gain in GE Capital of $300 million in the fourth quarter. In 2014, the Consumer segment earned $3 billion, down 30%. 
In Real Estate, assets of $34 billion were down 11% versus prior year. The equity book is down 35% from a year ago to $9 billion. Net income of $299 million was up 134%, driven by higher gains and portfolio earnings, partially offset by higher impairments. In the current quarter, we sold 350 properties from our Real Estate equity book, with a book value of about $2.1 billion, for $328 million in gain. In 2014, the Real Estate business earned $1 billion, down 42% on lower gains.
In the verticals, GECAS earned $218 million, up 207%, driven by lower impairments, partially offset by lower gains and lower assets. Overall, the portfolio is in great shape, and we finished the quarter with 0 delinquencies and 3 aircraft on the ground. New volume remains strong at $2 billion, up 50% with attractive returns in line with the first 3 quarters of the year. For the year, GECAS earned $1 billion and was up 17% from prior year. The milestone acquisition continues to progress, and we expect to close during the first quarter of 2015 pending regulatory approvals. 
Energy finance earned $111 million, down 5% in the quarter, in line with lower assets. EFS's volume was up 31% year-over-year at a very attractive returns. In 2014, EFS business earned $401 million, down 2%. 
Overall, Keith and the team continue to execute the portfolio strategy and deliver solid operating results. As we look forward to 2015, we expect GE Capital to generate about $0.60 on an EPS basis, as Jeff discussed last month during the annual outlook meeting. We expect GE Capital to earn approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter of the year.
Lastly, I wanted to spend a minute and talk about the framework for 2015 and cover 4 points. On the left, you have our segment outlook, as Jeff shared in December. Overall, there's no change in that framework. 
On the right side, first, positively, we are seeing strength in the U.S. health care market. Orders were strong, up 9%, and equipment orders were up 17%, with particular strength in imaging and ultrasound. Orders have been on a positive trend in the U.S. since the first quarter of 2014. And after the final fourth quarter results, we are more encouraged that this trend will continue into 2015.
Second is Aviation, which we feel is stronger. Spares orders grew 25% in 2014, and we're targeting high single-digit growth in 2015. Revenue passenger kilometers and freight miles continue to be strong, and low Jet A should be a meaningful positive for our customers in the space. 
When you think about currency, we planned 2015 assuming a stronger dollar, but we've seen some continued strengthening since the December meeting. Assuming the euro at today's rate for the entire year, foreign exchange would have a modest impact, about $0.01 a share. So very manageable in the context of the total company.
In December, we also outlined our expectations for Oil & Gas, with a backdrop of oil at $60 to $65 a barrel. Since then, prices have fallen further. When we planned the year, we relied on multiple scenarios, including a further fall in oil prices. Lorenzo and the team are laser-focused on executing against their backlog and their costs. The team is reducing employment, executing restructuring and simplification projects to materially reduce their cost structure, all predicated and on a tougher scenario. Additionally, across the company, we expect to realize some incremental benefits in direct retail and other logistical and variable costs as a result of lower fuel costs.
Oil & Gas represented about 15% of our Industrial segment earnings in 2014. We believe that within the context of the company portfolio, the potentially tougher oil and gas scenario is manageable and consistent within our framework. 
With that, I'd like to pass it back over to Jeff."
177031,274778648,748702,"General Electric Company, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2015",2015-01-23,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff.

We expect the Industrial EPS of between $1.10 and $1.20 behind solid organic growth and margin expansion. Corporate costs will be substantially lower. Remember, we funded $0.11 of uncovered restructuring in 2014. In 2015, we will offset restructuring with gains. In addition, we should have the impact from 6 months of Alstom. Capital results are on track, with Synchrony timing the main variable. Free cash flow and dispositions are on track for the $12 billion to $15 billion we spoke about in the year. And again, cash returned to investors depends on Synchrony timing but would be substantial if we do the split this year.
So closing the year, and since the outlook meeting, the GE world remains balanced. There are always puts and takes in the global economy. For instance, the U.S. is quite strong, which has a positive impact in businesses like Healthcare and Aviation, and the price of oil has declined even further since December.
Our job is to manage the company through volatility. And while we see the potential for risk to Oil & Gas based on current oil prices, we're aggressively working offsets through cost actions and positive opportunities elsewhere in GE. We're also seeing stronger momentum at several of our other businesses. In total, this demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach. Looking back in 2014, out of 8 industrial businesses, 3 beat their plan, 3 met their plan and 2 missed their plan, but together, we did what we set out to do, growing core earnings by 10%.
In addition, let me give you more insight to the plan I gave you in December. We have an internal plan that is above the midpoint of the range I gave you. The business results that deliver that plan are embedded in our team's new incentive compensation for the year. In other words, our leaders achieve their IC when we hit an EPS that is above the midpoint of this range. Now I want you to have transparency on how we think about the world and manage our team. Our targets encompass a thoughtful approach to the environment and a broad range of macro dynamics. So let me reiterate: we feel comfortable with our framework. 2015 is an important year for the company, and we plan to deliver for you. 
And now Matt, back to you, and let's take some questions."

Scott, I mean, the way we've thought about it, particularly when we went through it in December with you, is we evaluated multiple scenarios, including a general expectation at that point that we'd be down 0% to 5%, but we evaluated scenarios that were down beyond that on lower oil prices. And when we talked about the range with you of $1.70, $1.80 in total, $1.10 and $1.20 industrially, we included in that our view of what those downside scenarios are. So I think you got to step back and look at it. Oil & Gas is 15% of our segment earnings in Industrial. Being down beyond 5%, I think, is manageable within the context of the Industrial portfolio. And I think importantly, Lorenzo and the team are like laser-focused on driving the cost and the productivity in their business, and the programs they launched were the programs needed to support a lower downside scenario than what we even talked about in December. So I think we feel reasonably comfortable, as comfortable as you can be, that within the context of what we've shared with you, that we can manage this inside the portfolio, our Industrial portfolio."

So effectively, what we -- there were several points within the contract that were open to negotiate post the signing. We made a couple of adjustments. It's about EUR 250 million more that we will pay at closing. Part of that was a payment we're making at our request. We wanted to -- the legal entities we want to restructure and buy into, we wanted to change a bit, for our benefit long term in terms of taxes and otherwise. And so part of that EUR 250 million was a payment to ask them to close differently from a legal entity perspective than what was originally contemplated. The second was we originally agreed to about a 5-year use of the Alstom brand. We extended that in this agreement to 25 years. That was about $85 million associated with that, and then there were some other very small items. I think you'll hear Alstom talk about EUR 400 million. They're counting about $100 million of interest that they contemplated owing us on cash that they used over the course of the year. We never modeled that. We never counted that. So we see it as about a EUR 250 million adjustment to the purchase price, but we get a lot of long-term value as a result of that legal entity restructuring."

We hedge all our transactional exposure to the extent we can. We are subject to some translation, and we do very short-term hedging around earnings in a quarter. So there'll be some volatility associated with currency, but I think my point was that in the context of the company, we're not at a point yet where we think it's something that's not manageable across our portfolio. We do have natural hedging. We have the ability in some of our businesses to move our manufacturing base globally, which allows us to take advantage of changes in currency. And in a couple of our businesses where that matters, we are actively looking at our build plan for the year to make sure we take as much advantage of that as possible. I would say in the short run here, we've seen very little that I'm aware of, very little impact on our order performance as a result of currency. That may play out more in 2015, but through fourth quarter of this year, we've seen very little of that."

And then what we call rising Asia, Nigel, which is really China, India, ASEAN, stuff like that, those are actually quite positive for us right now from an order standpoint. And then the resource-rich countries, I think, are going to be mixed depending on what your cost position is and things like that. So we still, I would say, on an underlying basis, see pretty good kind of underlying demand in the Middle East. But clearly, places that are marginal producers like Iraq or Venezuela, things like that, those are going to be places that we're not counting on much business in 2015. So it's kind of a mixed bag. And then Europe, Europe for us is flattish. I'd say if you look at the organic and if the stimulus increases European demand, that's a good thing for us."

So the way I would look at this, Dean, is on the Industrial side, I think the team's -- the world is in front of them. Their incentives are in line. They know exactly what they need to do. We've got Alstom coming in, Appliances going out, and that is -- that team is laser-like focused, between Dave Joyce and Lorenzo and Steve Bolze, and those guys know exactly what they need to do in this environment. And on the GE Capital side, look, we're just going to make it smaller if we can as time goes on. We're going to execute on Synchrony, and that's what the Capital team is doing. And so I think you got to look at it in terms of -- every team knows exactly what their piece of how we need to execute here. There is no -- absolutely no confusion on the Industrial side. In Financial Services, we're just going to look for opportunities to continue to make it smaller.

It's critical to delivering on everything we've talked about. We've assumed the gains. The Appliances signaling transaction will happen midyear. We will do restructuring in the first half of the year, before those gains manifest themselves.

So within the fourth quarter, about $300 million, $600 million for the year. In addition, I talked about -- we sold a nonperforming loan portfolio in our U.K. home lending business for about $0.5 billion, had a very small gain associated with it, about $20 million, but a big deal for our U.K. portfolio. I talked about $2.1 billion of Real Estate sales in the quarter that -- led by Japan multifamily that we sold.

You get a little bit more competitiveness on aeros, but not a lot to talk about. Oil & Gas, we really haven't seen it yet nor have we seen -- there's some initial letters and stuff like that on pricing, but no real action. I think that's all. Again, I don't think we've seen it in the fourth quarter. We haven't seen it yet, but this is early days. So I think there's going to be -- there's certainly going to be chatter out there. So I don't really take all the stuff that's happened necessarily in the fourth quarter as what's going to happen throughout the rest of '15. I just think we have to be ready on all fronts. And I would say no conversation all around currency and anything along that yet. We'll see how that plays out. In terms of Healthcare, look, I think you're right. This has been the historical business model, but I also think kind of what we're doing with, Steve, with Jeff and Jamie and Dan Heintzelman is we're ripping apart the critical access [ph] in gross margins across each one of these businesses.

So look, I would just echo back, Andrew, to a comment I made in December. We like the Oil & Gas business. We like how we're positioned in it, and we think these cycles give us an opportunity to pick up market position similar to what we did in the Aviation business and the Power business and other businesses.

Jamie, in parallel with that, is continuing to drive and support the businesses with ERP, which is a big part of giving them visibility and driving our ability to consolidate, et cetera.

GE had a good quarter and a slow growth in a volatile environment, just to give you an economic brief from the world of GE. We see the U.S. getting a little bit better every day. Europe is slightly improving. Overall, China remains good for GE. Resource-rich markets are mixed. We expect to have positive revenue in places like the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Meanwhile, Russia and Australia will be tough. We're seeing the world that we planned for. 
Industrial EPS grew by 14% despite having $0.03 of uncovered restructuring. Operating EPS was $0.31 excluding the impact of the capital announcement. Organically, orders were up 1% and revenue grew 3%. Industrial segment profit grew by 9% or 12% organically with margins up 120 basis points. Oil & Gas had a solid first quarter. Organically, they were positive in orders with revenue flat. Profit was up 11% organically. The oil and gas market remains volatile with some segments under pressure. However, our diversified Oil & Gas platforms delivered in the first quarter. We're on track for our targets in 2015. 
We're running the company well. We spent a bit of time last week discussing capital allocation. I would only reiterate that we were on full execution of our GE Capital plan. All of our CFOA targets and capital allocation goals are in line with our framework. We remain on track for industrial EPS of $1.10 to $1.20. Orders were up 1% organically and we finished the quarter with $263 billion of backlog. Again, Oil & Gas orders were up 2% organically as they closed a few big subsea deals. Orders pricing declined slightly. Service orders were up 3% organically with broad-based strength. Aviation spares grew by 31% and remain robust. We remain on track for strong orders and productivity in 2015. new installed orders for Healthcare, IT grew substantially in the first quarter. We launched asset performance management in the manufacturing space. Orders for transportation, software and solutions plan to be up [ph] 50% for the year, and we expect consistent growth for wind power up and AGPs for the year. 
We saw some encouraging signs in the quarter. Aviation remains very strong, recording $800 million on LEAP quarters. The LEAP has won 79% of all Neo and MAX orders. LEAP engines for Neo and C919 are flying, and the LEAP for Boeing is in the test plane and flying soon. The engine is ahead of schedule. The LEAP engine has been one of our most successful product launches in history. [indiscernible] equipment orders grew by 5% in the U.S. Transportation continued to record global wins, and they received a $350 million order in Angola. Power Conversion grew orders by 10% and we have solid orders performance in China of 54%, and we expected power to have tough comps in the first quarter. In addition, they saw several orders slip into the second quarter. But overall, we see good demand for units in North America, Japan, Saudi, North Africa, Mexico and Brazil, and we anticipate a strong power orders recovery in the second quarter. Our order support our organic growth target for the year. 
Our businesses executed well in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was up 3%. Geographic growth is balanced. U.S. is up 2% and growth markets were up 6%. We saw strength in China up 6%; Middle East, up 19%; Africa, up 11%; and Latin America, up 13%. From a business standpoint, we had organic growth in 6 of 7 segments and we have forecast organic growth of up 2.5% and remain on track for that. 
Margins continue to be good story with growth of 120 basis points. We've targeted 50 basis points of gross margin expansion for the year, and we hit 90 basis points in the first quarter. We have favorable mix, value gap and productivity in the quarter. Meanwhile, simplification continues to drive good results and we're seeing more benefits ahead. One of the goals for 2015 is to expand margins in both equipment and service. We grew equipment margins by 120 basis points and service by 70 basis points in the quarter. We're making progress on margins as a company. 
Industrial CFOA was $900 million. It was less than expected. Our shortfall was driven by some Aviation supply chain disruptions and Power & Water orders timing. We will recover this in the second quarter. At the half, we plan on CFOA to be significantly higher than a year ago, and we're on track for our CFOA goals for the year. 
Our balance sheet remains quite strong. In the future, we will continue to look at ways to achieve a more efficient balance sheet. From a capital allocation standpoint, Alstom remains on track for the second half close. We always expected that this deal would get a second look in the U.S. and Europe. Also, it's impacted by several more volatile market dynamics as GE. But we continue to see this as a good strategic and financial fit for us and we intend on completing a deal that is good for investors. Now over to Jeff."
177031,282791819,790119,"General Electric Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the first quarter summary. As we discussed last week, we took a significant day 1 charge related to the exit of the nonvertical assets for GE Capital. On this page, I will start with the underlying financial performance of th",3268,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the first quarter summary. As we discussed last week, we took a significant day 1 charge related to the exit of the nonvertical assets for GE Capital. On this page, I will start with the underlying financial performance of the company excluding those charges. And then on the next page, I'll walk you back to our reported financials. 
We had revenues of $33.1 billion, which were down 3% in the quarter, driven by GE Capital, which was down 7%. Industrial sales of $23.8 billion were down 1%. Operating earnings of $3.1 billion were down 5% on lower GE Capital earnings. Operating earnings per share of $0.31 were down 6% with industrial EPS up 14% and GE Capital EPS down 21%. Continuing EPS of $0.27 includes the impact of nonoperating pension and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. 
As Jeff said, CFOA for the quarter was $1.3 billion. We had industrial CFOA of $900 million and received $450 million of dividends expectations driven by timing of progress collections, particularly in Power & Water, and the impact of an Aviation supply chain issue on inventory. These timing issues will reverse in the second and third quarter, and our expectation is that the industrial cash flow will be stronger in 2Q and will be up substantially for the first half versus last year. 
The GE Capital exit significantly impacts our tax rates for the quarter. As a result, we're providing both the reported tax provisions and tax rates on the bottom left side of the chart. The GE Capital tax rate for the quarter was 23% in line with guidance we provided. The reported GE Capital tax rate is not meaningful as the charges to shrink the company cause there to be a $6.2 billion tax expense while there is a significant pretax loss. As we noted, previously GE Capital have a higher tax rate going forward and we expect variability in the tax rate as we transition the business for the next few years. 
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and up 3% organically, reflecting about 4 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was approximately $940 million drag on Industrial segment revenue and about $120 million impact on op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 9%. 
GE Capital earnings were down 21%, primarily driven by lower Synchrony earnings due to the minority interest and lower assets. I'll cover the dynamics of these 2 segments in a couple of pages, but first I want to walk these results to our reported financials. 
Starting with the first column on the left and working down. As we said, Industrial operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 14%; and GE Capital earnings were $1.5 billion for a total operating earnings of $3.1 billion. Including nonoperating pension, continuing earnings were $2.7 billion. We had an approximately $80 million benefit in discontinued operation associated with the sale of our consumer mortgage business in Australia to bring net earnings to $2.8 billion. 
The next column is the impact of GE Capital exit announcement as we reviewed with you last week. As we discussed, we took a $14 billion charge associated with classifying business as an asset that's held for sale and a $6 billion tax charge. We also took a $2.3 billion disc ops charge principally reflecting the Real Estate transaction. After adjusting first quarter operations for these items, the reported amounts are shown in the third column. So $2.8 billion of operations net earnings offset by $16.4 billion of GE Capital charges works to the reported $13.6 billion net earnings loss for the first quarter or a loss of $1.35 a share. As we move to the execution of the plan we shared with you last week, there will be adjustments, and we will continue to keep you updated on progress and the impact of those actions. 
Next on other items, we don't have a long list this quarter. We had $0.03 related to ongoing industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to take actions to improve the cost structure of the company. This was $422 million on a pretax basis, and about 1/3 of that related to restructuring Oil & Gas. As we discussed before, we're taking aggressive actions to reduce our costs footprint given the challenging environment. And the rest of the team are laser focused on execution. For the year, we'll continue to execute our restructuring projects with urgency. As you're aware, we're expecting some gains hear from appliances and signaling transactions. In the profile in the bottom of the page, we've assumed the appliance gain in the second quarter and the signaling gain in the second half, but both are subject to regulatory approval. Although there will be quarterly variability in gains and restructuring time, we expect still equal restructuring for the year on an EPS basis. 
Next I'll give an update on Power & Water. Orders for the quarter of $4.5 billion were down 21% driven by equipment orders down 29% and services down 15%. Orders were lighter than expected due to financing delays in timing of agreements, but not competitive losses. For example, we signed a deal for 2 7.5 [ph] gas turbines this week that we expected to sign in the first quarter. Our framework for wind and thermal orders have not changed for the year. We expect second quarter orders to be up double digits. In the first quarter, we booked 21 gas turbines versus 31 a year ago and 376 wind turbines versus 422 turbines in the first quarter of 2014. 
In terms of H technology, we put another order for a 9HA in Latin America, and this brings the backlog to 16 units. In addition, we've been technically selected on the additional 37 units and are bidding an incremental 50 units beyond that. Distributed Power equipment orders were down 53% driven by 9 fewer turbines. We expect Distributed Power turbines orders to be roughly flat for the year. Gas engine orders were lower by 39% in the quarter driven by softer demand in gas compression. Overall, DP will continue to be soft for the year. 
Service orders were down 15% with PGS down 20%, driven by no repeat of a large upgrade in Japan a year ago and lower new unit installs. AGP orders were 16 down 1 year-over-year. No change in outlook for AGPs or services for the total year. 
Revenue of $5.7 billion was higher by 4% but was up 9% x foreign exchange. Equipment revenues were up 1% on very strong thermal volume. We shipped 39 gas turbines versus 17 a year ago. That was partially offset by Distributed Power down 37% and renewables down 30% on lower unit shipments of 15 and 174, respectively. 
Service revenues were higher by 7%, driven by higher upgrades, including AGP upgrades, 21 versus 17 a year ago. Operating profit of $871 million was down 2%. That's flat x foreign exchange, driven by higher volume offset by negative productivity in supply chain and engineering associated with the H ramp and negative product mix due to lower Distributed Power. Now GAAP in the quarter was a positive $12 million. Op profit margins were down 90 basis points in the quarter. We remain on track with the outlook we provided, and we expect 100  to 105 gas turbine orders in shipments this year with a good pipeline of activity. We still expect wind shipments of around 3,000 and 3,200 turbines, and AGP upgrades remain on track and Distributed Power will remain pressured throughout the year. 
Next I'll cover Oil & Gas. Oil & Gas orders of $4.3 billion were down 6% reported but up 2% organically. Equipment orders of $2.2 billion were down 10% flat organically. Service orders were down 27% on weak North American activity, and TMS orders were down 23% with no repeat of 2 large LNG orders we took in the first quarter of last year. There was still decent orders order for TMS, which booked more than $700 million of new orders in the quarter. Subsea and drilling orders were up 74% on large deals we booked in Ghana and Brazil. Service orders of $2.1 billion were down 3% and up 4% organically. Service was lower by 21% and TMS was down 8% largely due to foreign exchange. Subsea was strong, up 21%. M&C was down 1% organically. Revenues of just under $4 billion 8% reported. Reported negative 8% includes 7 points of foreign exchange and 1 point of disposition. Equipment revenues were down 13% with TMS down 9% reported but up 22% x foreign exchange, and Subsea down 8% reported but up 6% x exchange. M&C was down 8% organically in the quarter and service revenues were down 2% reported but up 4% organic with surplus down 23% and M&C up 11% organically. 
Operating profit was up 11% organically, down 3% reported driven by negative FX offset by strong productivity on both base cost and product and service cost. Price was a $5 million drag in the first quarter but the business delivered positive value gap. Margins improved 50 basis points reported and were 120 basis points better x the impact of exchange and earnings. This will be a challenging year in Oil & Gas but the team has been aggressive on remaking the cost structure of the business and we believe that we remain within the scenarios that supported our total year industrial guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 a share. 
Next I'll cover Aviation. Air travel continues to be very robust. Global passenger kilometers grew 5.3% through February 2015 versus the same period last year with the Middle East up 8.8%, Asia Pacific up 7.3%. Through February, freight traffic grew 7.5% compared with a year ago with very strong double-digit growth in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Orders in the quarter of $7.5 billion were up 36%. Equipment orders of $3.9 billion were up 64% on higher commercial engine orders of $3.3 billion up over 2x versus prior year. This was driven by $1.2 billion of GE 9Z engine orders up 10x versus last year from Kuwait Airlines, Emirates and includes a GE9X order for Cathay. GE NX we see $360 million in orders up 3x, and we also recorded $800 million of orders from LEAP up 3x. Our total win rate for the LEAP since program launch for the next GEN new body aircraft is 79%. Commercial engine backlog was up 35% year-over-year. Military equipment orders were down 61%, driven by no repeat of 2 large orders from Sikorsky and Qatar Air Force from the first quarter of last year as expected. Service orders were up 14% on strong commercial spare parts, which were up 31% and $38.9 million a day. The military spares were down 11%. 
Revenues of $5.7 billion were down 2%. Equipment revenues were down 8% with commercial equipment revenue down 1% on lower GEnx shipments. We shipped 19 fewer units than last year, 51 versus 70, and 29 less units than our plan as a result of a supply chain disruption. Military equipment revenue was down 32% on lower shipments and service revenue was up 4% with commercial spare parts up 28% and military services up 3%. 
Op profit was up 18% on very strong value gap. We have cost productivity in favor with G&A mix partially offset by lower volume and higher R&D. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter. The impact for the lower GEnx shipments improved the margin rate by about 90 basis points. This is net of some cost to remediate the disruption. We're working to issue and we expect to ship most of the delayed units in 2Q and be back on plan for the full year of 275  to 300 GEnx units. 
Aviation had another strong quarter growing equipment and service backlog by 23% and 9% respectively. The business continues to exit on new technology introductions, service offerings, and cost-out. Aviation could perform better than we outlined than the December outlook meeting. 
Next Healthcare orders of $4.2 billion were down 1% but up 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw continued growth in the U.S. up 5%. Europe was down 4% but up 11% x FX. Japan was down 18%, down 6% x FX. The Middle East was down 43% driven by Saudi, and China was down 4%. Health care system orders were down 5% flat excluding the impact of foreign exchange. U.S. imaging and ultrasound was up 7% with strong growth in MR up 41% in the quarter, partially driven by the new pen MR released in the summer. This was offset by softer orders in Japan, Russia and the Middle East. 
Life Sciences order were up 10%, up 17% excluding foreign exchange, driven by strong bioprocess orders. This was offset with core imaging down 3% and services. Revenues of $4.1 billion were down 3% but up 2% x foreign exchange. Health care system revenues were down 6% flat organically. And Life Sciences revenues were up 4%. Operating profit was up 3% with 80 basis points of margin expansion driven by strong cost execution partially offset by lower price. Looking forward, we expect similar market dynamic. We believe we're gaining share in key modalities in the U.S. and we expect the market to continue to improve. While China has slowed, we expect orders to grow for the remainder of the year in China. Life science growth will persist and the business team continues to execute on its cost-out programs. 
In Transportation, North American carloads were up 1.8% with intermodal traffic up 2.1%, which was impacted by the West Coast port strike. Commodities have seen broad-based increases with agriculture up 4.6% and chemicals and petroleum products up 3.2%. Coal volumes were down 2.5% in the quarter. Transportation orders were down 38% with equipment orders down 56% and services were higher by 13%. Equipment orders were lower driven by locomotives primarily due to not repeating the large South Africa deal we had in the first quarter of last year. Revenues in the quarter were up 7% driven by strong equipment growth. We shipped 215 locos in the quarter versus 178 a year earlier. Overall, mining continues to be soft, down 23%. Operating profit in the quarter was up 11% on higher locomotive volume, material deflation and cost productivity. Margins in the quarter expanded by 70 basis points. We now have 16 preproduction Tier 4 units out with our customers running on the rails. They are performing in actual operating conditions as part of our validation process. We had about 1,200 Tier 4 locos in backlog for the end of the first quarter of '15, and we expect to ship about half of those this year. 
In energy management orders of $2.1 billion were down 2% and up 2% organically. Power Conversion orders were up 10% in the quarter. Industrial solutions was up 4% and digital energy was down 38% from no repeat of a large domestic order from last year. Power Conversion saw strong growth in renewables vertical up 2x on solar inverters and the Marine vertical was up 15% on a large Canadian propulsion dynamic positioning deal in Canada offset partially by softer Oil & Gas orders. Backlog for our energy management business grew 3%. Revenues were up 1% and up 8% organically driven by foreign exchange with Power Conversion up 6%, Digital Energy and industrial systems were both about flat. Op profit was $28 million, up from $5 million last year on a reported basis. The business continues to benefit from restructuring with strong base cost productivity driven by SG&A reductions and positive value gap offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Margin rates in the quarter were up 140 basis points. We expect program execution and margin rate improvement to continue throughout 2015. 
And then finally, Appliances & Lighting. Revenue in the quarter was up 5%. Appliance revenues were up 8% driven by strong volume. Industry core units were flat with retail down 1% and contract up 4%. The industry volume was well below the first quarter expectation of plus 8% due to the harsh weather across the U.S. We believe GE increased our share by 2 points in the first quarter. Lighting revenues were down 3% on lower traditional product demand, which was down 18%. This was partially offset by continued strong LED performance, which grew 76% in the quarter. LED now makes up 30-plus percent of lighting revenues and that's up from 17% of lighting revenues from the first quarter of 2014. Op profit in the quarter was $103 million. 
Now GE Capital. Before we start with the GE Capital results, I'd just like to take a moment and highlight the incredible work done by Keith and the GE Capital team. Keith led an enormous and complicated effort in a very challenging window of time to get the company to this very important strategic pivot. This is a transformational change for our company that will create real value for investors long term. As I've covered, the impact of last week's announcement is reflected in GE Capital's first quarter reported financials. On the page, we have provided [indiscernible] starting with the earnings from the vertical businesses, which generated $352 million for the quarter. Operating earnings from the remainder of our businesses in continuing operations amounted to $1.1 billion, which was more than offset by $14 billion day 1 accounting adjustments related to last week's announcement. Earnings from continuing operations amounted to a net loss of $12.5 billion. 
Discontinued operations generated additional losses of $2.2 billion, which reflect the charges associated with our Commercial Real Estate business. Overall, GE Capital reported a $14.7 billion loss, including $6 billion of tax expenses. We ended the quarter at $303 billion of ENI excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter at $76 billion including $14 billion attributable to Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remained at $25 billion and we had $8 billion of long-term debt issuance for the quarter. As discussed last week, we do not anticipate additional issuances over the next 5 years, and we expect GE Capital CP balance to decrease to $5 billion by the end of the year. 
Starting this quarter, we are transitioning the capital accuracy reporting from Basel I  to Basel III in line with industry practice. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 10.6% inclusive of the day 1 charges. We expect this ratio to improve as we dispose of risk-weighted assets over the course of the year. As I mentioned last Friday, we will operate through the transition in a safe and sound manner, working with our regulators in determining the appropriate capital levels. Going forward, the team will be very focused on executing the portfolio of transformation. As we discussed last week, we have signed deals on close to 50% of the planned ENI reduction for the year and we are receiving very strong inbound interest on many of our portfolios since the discussion last week. We are prioritizing transaction in a way that allows us to maximize franchise value. And as I said last week, we will be very transparent as we execute through this process. Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team delivered a strong operational quarter in line with our prior guidance and are now fully focused on delivering on the portfolio of transformation that we shared with you last week. With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We remain on track for 2015 operating framework, but we will adjust our guidance milestones to reflect last week's announcement on capital. Industrial EPS is on track for $1.10 to $1.20, and we're running our businesses to the high end of that range. We're generating solid organic growth and margin expansion. Corporate costs are being well managed with gains equal to restructuring, and Oil & Gas is performing to our expectations. We continue to invest in industrial growth. Between research and development, industrial and plant equipment and information technology and the potential for bolt-on industrial M&A, we invest $10 billion to $15 billion each year in our industrial program. We can do this and still return significant capital to investors. The GE Capital verticals are tracking to $0.15 per share, and as Jeff said, we're focused on the verticals and we'll keep them top of mind. We've set a target of $90 billion in asset sales and this is part of our guidance. We already have approximately 50% announced and have a robust pipeline to achieve this by year-end. Again, we will update this at EPG. 
The cash flow remains on track to $12 billion to $15 billion. Dispositions and CFOA are on track, and we expect GE Capital to dividend between $500 million and $7 billion in line with what we talked about last week, and we will update this as we go through the year. We will continue to drive investor-friendly capital allocation. The dividend remains a top priority. We're still expecting the Synchrony split to return $20 billion to you in the form of a share exchange. And as you saw last week, our board has authorized a $50 billion buyback based on the proceeds from the GE Capital sale. So between Synchrony, the buyback and dividends, we can return $90 billion to investors over the next few years. The company is executing well operationally and strategically. Our compensation plans have aligned us with investors, and we expect to have a solid second quarter and total year. Matt, now back to you for some questions."

Lorenzo and the team are executing like crazy on a substantial cost plan and they are right on track, actually slightly ahead of schedule. They're going to take out close to $600 million of cost this year, both base cost and product and service cost. So when we take a look at where we ended here in the first quarter with Oil & Gas and how we think about the balances in the next 3 quarters and, very importantly, with all the restructuring that we're doing, the benefits of that largely in the second half of the year, we feel like today based on everything we know that those scenarios and that guidance we gave you remains intact."

But we thought that the bulk of this work would be done by the end of '16. Now we're going to try to outperform that. There's no question that I think that when we think about the risks associated with it, including price and value, speed is the single biggest mitigant. We have a market today that is incredibly receptive these kinds of assets, so we need to be able to capitalize on that. There is no question, we've got a balance from an execution standpoint. The nature of the buyer and the size of the transaction to the extent that we're relying on maybe a back-end regulatory approval by the buyer. We are doing smaller transactions that maybe, maybe not, maybe better from a price perspective doing several large big bold deals. I think my guess is Keith and the team will run almost a parallel process there. We'll evaluate on both tracks, platform by platform, portfolio by portfolio, the level of interest there versus a couple several maybe much larger deals. They try to sweep up many of those platforms simultaneously. So we're completely of exactly what you're asking and we have a process, and we'll make sure that we evaluate it [indiscernible] but speed is the key."

Just to give you an economic read from the world of GE, we see the U.S. getting a little bit better every day. Europe is slightly improving. Overall, China remains good for GE. Resource-rich markets are mixed. We expect to have positive revenue in places like the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Meanwhile, Russia and Australia will be tough. We're seeing the world that we planned for.
Industrial EPS grew by 14% despite having $0.03 of uncovered restructuring. Operating EPS was $0.31, excluding the impact of the capital announcement. Organically, orders were up 1% and revenue grew 3%. Industrial segment profit grew by 9% or 12% organically with margins up 120 basis points. 
Oil & Gas had a solid first quarter. Organically, they were positive in orders with revenue flat. Profit was up 11% organically. The oil and gas market remains volatile with some segments under pressure. However, our diversified Oil & Gas platforms delivered in the first quarter. We're on track for our targets in 2015. 
We're running the company well. We spent a bit of time last week discussing capital allocation. I would only reiterate that we're on full execution of our GE Capital plan. All of our CFOA targets and capital allocation goals are in line with our framework. We remain on track for Industrial EPS of $1.10 to $1.20. 
Orders were up 1% organically and we finished the quarter with $263 billion of backlog. Again, Oil & Gas orders were up 2% organically as they closed a few big subsea deals. Orders pricing declined slightly. Service orders were up 3% organically with broad-based strength. Aviation spares grew by 31% and remain robust. We remain on track for strong orders in Predictivity in 2015. New install orders for Healthcare IT grew substantially in the first quarter. We launched asset performance management in the manufacturing space. Orders for transportation, software and solutions are planned to be up 50% for the year, and we expect consistent growth for wind power up and AGPs for the year. 
We saw some encouraging signs in the quarter. Aviation remains very strong, recording $800 million on LEAP quarters. The LEAP has won 79% of all Neo and MAX orders. LEAP engines for Neo and C919 are flying, and the LEAP for Boeing is in the test plane and flying soon. The engine is ahead of schedule. The LEAP engine has been one of our most successful product launches in history. Healthcare equipment orders grew by 5% in the U.S. Transportation continued to record global wins, and they received a $350 million order in Angola. 
Power Conversion grew orders by 10% and we have solid orders performance in China of 54%. We expected Power to have tough comps in the first quarter. In addition, they saw several orders slip into the second quarter. But overall, we see good demand for units in North America, Japan, Saudi, North Africa, Mexico and Brazil. And we anticipate a strong Power orders recovery in second quarter. Our orders support our organic growth target for the year. 
Our businesses executed well in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was up 3%. Geographic growth is balanced. U.S. was up 2% and growth markets were up 6%. We saw strength in China, up 6%; Middle East, up 19%; Africa, up 11%; and Latin America, up 13%. From a business standpoint, we had organic growth in 6 of 7 segments and we have forecast organic growth of up  2% to 5% and remain on track for that. 
Margins continue to be good story with growth of 120 basis points. We've targeted 50 basis points of gross margin expansion for the year, and we hit 90 basis points in first quarter. We have favorable mix, value gap and productivity in the quarter. Meanwhile, simplification continues to drive good results and we're seeing more benefits ahead. One of the goals for 2015 is to expand margins in both equipment and service. We grew equipment margins by 120 basis points and service by 70 basis points in the quarter. We're making progress on margins as a company. 
Industrial CFOA was $900 million. It was less than expected. Our shortfall was driven by some Aviation supply chain disruptions and Power & Water orders timing. We will recover this in the second quarter. At the half, we plan on CFOA to be significantly higher than a year ago, and we're on track for our CFOA goals for the year. 
Our balance sheet remains quite strong. In the future, we will continue to look at ways to achieve a more efficient balance sheet. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, Alstom remains on track for a second half close. We always expected that this deal would get a second look in the U.S. and Europe. Alstom is impacted by similar volatile market dynamics as GE, but we continue to see this as a good strategic and financial fit for us. And we intend on completing a deal that is good for investors. 
Now over to Jeff."
177031,282791819,790213,"General Electric Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a first quarter summary. As we discussed last week, we took a significant day 1 charge related to the exit of the non-vertical assets of GE Capital. On this page, I will start with the underlying financial performance of the",3268,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a first quarter summary. As we discussed last week, we took a significant day 1 charge related to the exit of the non-vertical assets of GE Capital. On this page, I will start with the underlying financial performance of the company excluding those charges. And then on the next page, I'll walk you back to our reported financials. 
We had revenues of $33.1 billion, which were down 3% in the quarter, driven by GE Capital, which was down 7%. Industrial sales of $23.8 billion were down 1%. Operating earnings of $3.1 billion were down 5% on lower GE Capital earnings. Operating earnings per share of $0.31 were down 6%, with Industrial EPS, up 14% and GE Capital EPS, down 21%. Continuing EPS of $0.27 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. 
As Jeff said, CFOA for the quarter was $1.3 billion. We had Industrial CFOA of $900 million and received $450 million of dividends expectations [ph] driven by timing on progress collections, particularly in Power & Water, and the impact of an Aviation supply chain issue on inventory. These timing issues will reverse in the second and third quarter, and our expectation is that the Industrial cash flow will be stronger in 2Q and will be up substantially for the first half versus last year. 
The GE Capital exit significantly impacts our tax rates for the quarter. As a result, we're providing both the reported tax provisions and tax rates on the bottom left side of the chart. The GE tax rate for the quarter was 23% in line with guidance we provided. The reported GE Capital tax rate is not meaningful as the charges to shrink the company caused there to be a $6.2 billion tax expense while there is a significant pretax loss. As we noted, previously, GE Capital will have a higher tax rate going forward and we expect variability in the tax rate as we transition the business through the next few years. 
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and up 3% organically, reflecting about 4 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was approximately $940 million drag on Industrial segment revenue and about $120 million impact on op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 9%. 
GE Capital earnings were down 21%, primarily driven by lower Synchrony earnings due to the minority interest and lower assets. I'll cover the dynamics of each of the segments in a couple of pages. But first, I want to walk these results to our reported financials. 
Starting with the first column on the left and working down. As we said, Industrial operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 14%; and GE Capital earnings were $1.5 billion, for a total operating earnings of $3.1 billion. Including nonoperating pension, continuing earnings were $2.7 billion. We had an approximately $80 million benefit in discontinued operation associated with the sale of our consumer mortgage business in Australia, to bring net earnings to $2.8 billion. 
The next column is the impact of the GE Capital exit announcement as we reviewed with you last week. As we discussed, we took a $14 billion charge associated with classifying business as an asset that's held for sale and a $6 billion tax charge. We also took a $2.3 billion disc ops charge principally reflecting the Real Estate transaction. 
After adjusting first quarter operations for these items, the reported amounts are shown in the third column. So $2.8 billion of operations net earnings offset by $16.4 billion of GE Capital charges works to the reported $13.6 billion net earnings loss for the first quarter or a loss of $1.35 a share. As we move to the execution of the plan we shared with you last week, there'll be adjustments. And we will continue to keep you updated on progress and the impact of those actions. 
Next on other items, we don't have a long list this quarter. We had $0.03 related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to take actions to improve the cost structure of the company. This was $422 million on a pretax basis, with about 1/3 of that related to restructuring Oil & Gas. As we discussed before, we're taking aggressive actions to reduce our costs footprint given the challenging environment. And Lorenzo and the team are laser-focused on execution. For the year, we'll continue to execute on restructuring projects with urgency. 
As you're aware, we are expecting some gains this year from Appliances and signaling transactions. In the profile on the bottom of the page, we've assumed that Appliance gain in the second quarter and the signaling gain in the second half, but both are subject to regulatory approval. Although there will be quarterly variability in gains and restructuring time, we expect gains to equal restructuring for the year on an EPS basis. 
Next, I'll give an update on Power & Water. Orders for the quarter were $4.5 billion were down 21%, driven by equipment orders, down 29%; and services, down 15%. Orders were lighter than expected due to financing delays and timing of agreements, but not competitive losses. For example, we signed a deal for 2 7F gas turbines this week that we expected to sign in the first quarter. Our framework for wind and thermal orders has not changed for the year. We expect second quarter orders to be up double digits. In the first quarter, we booked 21 gas turbines versus 31 a year ago and 376 wind turbines versus 422 turbines in the first quarter of 2014. 
In terms of H technology, we booked another order for a 9HA in Latin America, and this brings the backlog to 16 units. In addition, we've been technically selected on an additional 37 units and are bidding an incremental 50 units beyond that. 
Distributed Power equipment orders were down 53% driven by 9 fewer turbines. We expect Distributed Power turbines orders to be roughly flat for the year. Gas engine orders were lower by 39% in the quarter, driven by softer demand in gas compression. Overall, DP will continue to be soft for the year. 
Service orders were down 15% with PGS, down 20%, driven by no repeat of a large upgrade in Japan a year ago and lower new unit installs. AGP orders were 16, down 1 year-over-year. No change in outlook for AGPs or services for the total year. 
Revenue of $5.7 billion was higher by 4% but was up 9% x foreign exchange. Equipment revenues were up 1% on very strong thermal volume. We shipped 39 gas turbines versus 17 a year ago. That was partially offset by Distributed Power, down 37%; and renewables, down 30% on lower unit shipments of 15 and 174, respectively. 
Service revenues were higher by 7%, driven by higher upgrades, including AGP upgrades, 21 versus 17 a year ago. Operating profit of $871 million was down 2%. That's flat x foreign exchange, driven by higher volume offset by negative productivity in supply chain and engineering associated with the H ramp and negative product mix due to lower Distributed Power. Value gap in the quarter was a positive $12 million. Op profit margins were down 90 basis points in the quarter. 
 
We remain on track with the outlook we provided, and we expect 100 to 105 gas turbine orders and shipments this year with a good pipeline of activity. We still expect wind shipments of around 3,000 to 3,200 turbines. And AGP upgrades remain on track and Distributed Power will remain pressured throughout the year. 
Next I'll cover Oil & Gas. Oil & Gas orders of $4.3 billion were down 6% reported but up 2% organically. Equipment orders of $2.2 billion were down 10%, flat organically. Service orders were down 27% on weak North American activity, and TMS orders were down 23% with no repeat of 2 large LNG orders we took in the first quarter of last year. It was still a decent orders quarter for TMS, which booked more than $700 million of new orders in the quarter. Subsea and drilling orders were up 74% on large deals we booked in Ghana and Brazil. Service orders of $2.1 billion were down 3% but up 4% organically. Surface was lower by 21% and TMS was down 8% largely due to foreign exchange. Subsea was strong, up 21%. M&C was down 1% organically. Revenues of just under $4 billion 
[Audio Gap] 
8% reported. Reported negative 8% includes 7 points of foreign exchange and 1 point of disposition. Equipment revenues were down 13%, with TMS, down 9% reported but up 22% x foreign exchange; and Subsea, down 8% reported but up 6% x exchange. M&C was down 8% organically in the quarter. And service revenues were down 2% reported but up 4% organic, with Surface, down 23%; and M&C, up 11% organically. 
Operating profit was up 11% organically, down 3% reported, driven by negative FX offset by strong productivity on both base cost and product and service cost. Price was a $5 million drag in the first quarter but the business delivered positive value gap. Margins improved 50 basis points reported and were 120 basis points better x the impact of exchange on earnings. This will be a challenging year in Oil & Gas but the team has been aggressive on remaking the cost structure of the business and we believe that we remain within the scenarios that supported our total year industrial guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 a share. 
Next I'll cover Aviation. Air travel continues to be very robust. Global passenger kilometers grew 5.3% through February 2015 versus the same period last year with the Middle East, up 8.8%; Asia Pacific, up 7.3%. Through February, freight traffic grew 7.5% compared with a year ago with very strong double-digit growth in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Orders in the quarter of $7.5 billion were up 36%. Equipment orders of $3.9 billion were up 64% on higher commercial engine orders of $3.3 billion, up over 2x versus prior year. This is driven by $1.2 billion of GE9Z [ph] engine orders, up 10x versus last year, from Kuwait airlines (sic) [Kuwait Airways], Emirates and includes a GE9X order for Cathay. GEnx received $360 million in orders, up 3x, and we also recorded $800 million of orders for LEAP, up 3x. Our total win rate for the LEAP since program launch for next-gen narrow-body aircraft is 79%. Commercial engine backlog was up 35% year-over-year. Military equipment orders were down 61%, driven by no repeat of 2 large orders from Sikorsky and Qatar Air Force from the first quarter of last year as expected. Service orders were up 14% on strong commercial spare parts, which were up 31% at $38.9 million a day. The military spares were down 11%. 
Revenues of $5.7 billion were down 2%. Equipment revenues were down 8% with commercial equipment revenue, down 1% on lower GEnx shipments. We shipped 19 fewer units than last year, 51 versus 70, and 29 less units than our plan as a result of a supply chain disruption. Military equipment revenue was down 32% on lower shipments and service revenue was up 4% with commercial spare parts up 28% and military services up 3%. 
Op profit was up 18% on very strong value gap. We have a cost productivity in favor with GEnx mix partially offset by lower volume and higher R&D. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter. The impact for the lower GEnx shipments improved the margin rate by about 90 basis points. This is net of some cost to remediate the disruption. We're working the issue and we expect to ship most of the delayed units in 2Q and be back on plan for the full year of 275 to 300 GEnx units. 
Aviation had another strong quarter growing equipment and service backlog by 23% and 9%, respectively. The business continues to execute on new technology introductions, service offerings, and cost out. Aviation could perform better than we outlined at the December outlook meeting. 
Next, Healthcare orders of $4.2 billion were down 1% but up 4%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw continued growth in the U.S., up 5%. Europe was down 4% but up 11% x FX. Japan was down 18%, down 6% x FX. The Middle East was down 43%, driven by Saudi, and China was down 4%. Health care system orders were down 5% flat, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. U.S. imaging and ultrasound was up 7% with strong growth in MR, up 41% in the quarter, partially driven by the new PET/MR released in December. This is offset by softer orders in Japan, Russia and the Middle East. 
Life Sciences order were up 10%, up 17% excluding foreign exchange, driven by strong bioprocess orders. This was offset with core imaging down 3% and services. Revenues of $4.1 billion were down 3% but up 2% x foreign exchange. Health care system revenues were down 6%, flat organically, and Life Sciences revenues were up 4%. Operating profit was up 3%, with 80 basis points of margin expansion driven by strong cost execution partially offset by lower price. 
Looking forward, we expect similar market dynamic. We believe we're gaining share in key modalities in the U.S. and we expect the market to continue to improve. While China has slowed, we expect orders growth for the remainder of the year in China. Life Science growth will persist and the business team continues to execute on its cost-out programs. 
In Transportation, North American carloads were up 1.8% with intermodal traffic, up 2.1%, which was impacted by the West Coast port strike. Commodities received broad-based increases with agriculture, up 4.6% and chemicals and petroleum products, up 3.2%. Coal volumes were down 2.5% in the quarter. Transportation orders were down 38% with equipment orders, down 56%. And services were higher by 13%. Equipment orders were lower driven by locomotives, primarily due to not repeating the large South Africa deal we had in the first quarter of last year. 
Revenues in the quarter were up 7%, driven by strong equipment growth. We shipped 215 locos in the quarter versus 178 a year earlier. Overall, mining continues to be soft, down 23%. Operating profit in the quarter was up 11% on higher locomotive volume, material deflation and cost productivity. Margins in the quarter expanded by 70 basis points. 
We now have 16 preproduction Tier 4 units out with our customers running on the rails. They are performing in actual operating conditions as part of our validation process. We had about 1,200 Tier 4 locos in backlog at the end of the first quarter of '15, and we expect to ship about half those this year. 
In Energy Management, orders of $2.1 billion were down 2% and up 2% organically. Power Conversion orders were up 10% in the quarter. Industrial Solutions was up 4% and Digital Energy was down 38% from no repeat of a large domestic meter order from last year. Power Conversion saw strong growth in renewables vertical, up 2x on solar inverters; and the marine vertical was up 15% on a large Canadian propulsion dynamic positioning deal in Canada offset partially by softer Oil & Gas orders. Backlog for Energy Management business grew 3%. 
Revenues were up 1% and up 8% organically, driven by foreign exchange, with Power Conversion, up 6%; Digital Energy and industrial systems were both about flat. Op profit was $28 million, up from $5 million last year on a reported basis. The business continues to benefit from restructuring, with strong base cost productivity driven by SG&A reductions and positive value gap offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Margin rates in the quarter were up 140 basis points. We expect program execution and margin rate improvement to continue throughout 2015. 
And then finally, Appliances & Lighting. Revenue in the quarter was up 5%. Appliance revenues were up 8% driven by strong volume. Industry core units were flat with retail, down 1% and contract, up 4%. The industry volume was well below the first quarter expectation of plus 8% due to the harsh weather across the U.S. We believe GE increased our share by 2 points in the first quarter. Lighting revenues were down 3% on lower traditional product demand, which was down 18%. This was partially offset by continued strong LED performance, which grew 76% in the quarter. LED now makes up 30-plus percent of lighting revenues and that's up from 17% of lighting revenues in the first quarter of 2014. Op profit in the quarter was $103 million. 
Now GE Capital. Before we start with the GE Capital results, I'd just like to take a moment and highlight the incredible work done by Keith and the GE Capital team. Keith led an enormous and complicated effort in a very challenging window of time to get the company to this very important strategic pivot. This is a transformational change for our company that will create real value for investors long term. 
As I've covered, the impact of last week's announcement is reflected in GE Capital's first quarter reported financials. On the page, we have provided a walk starting with the earnings from our vertical businesses, which generated $352 million for the quarter. Operating earnings from the remainder of our businesses in continuing operations amounted to $1.1 billion, which was more than offset by $14 billion day 1 accounting adjustments related to last week's announcement. Earnings from continuing operations amounted to a net loss of $12.5 billion. 
Discontinued operations generated additional losses of $2.2 billion, which reflect the charges associated with our commercial Real Estate business. Overall, GE Capital reported a $14.7 billion loss, including $6 billion of tax expenses. We ended the quarter at $303 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter at $76 billion, including $14 billion attributable to Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remained at $25 billion and we had $8 billion of long-term debt issuance for the quarter. As discussed last week, we do not anticipate additional issuances over the next 5 years, and we expect GE Capital CB balance to decrease to $5 billion by the end of the year. 
Starting this quarter, we are transitioning the capital accuracy reporting from Basel I to Basel 3 in line with industry practice. Our Basel 3 Tier 1 common ratio was 10.6% inclusive of the day 1 charges. We expect this ratio to improve as we dispose of risk-weighted assets over the course of the year. As I mentioned last Friday, we will operate through the transition in a safe and sound manner, working with our regulators in determining the appropriate capital level. Going forward, the team will be very focused on executing the portfolio of transformation. 
As we discussed last week, we have signed deals on close to 50% of the planned ENI reduction for the year and we are receiving very strong inbound interest on many of our portfolios since the discussion last week. We are prioritizing transaction in a way that allows us to maximize franchise value. And as I said last week, we'll be very transparent as we execute through this process. 
Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team delivered a strong operational quarter in line with our prior guidance and are now fully focused on delivering on the portfolio of transformation that we shared with you last week. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We remain on track for our 2015 operating framework, but we'll adjust our guidance milestones to reflect last week's announcement on Capital. Industrial EPS is on track for $1.10 to $1.20, and we're running our businesses to the high end of that range. We're generating solid organic growth and margin expansion. Corporate costs are being well managed with gains equal to restructuring, and Oil & Gas is performing to our expectations. We continue to invest in industrial growth. Between research and development, investment in plant equipment and information technology and the potential for bolt-on industrial M&A, we'll invest $10 billion to $15 billion each year in our industrial growth. We can do this and still return significant capital to investors. 
The GE Capital verticals are tracking to $0.15 per share, and as Jeff said, we're focused on the verticals and we'll keep them top of mind. We've set a target of $90 billion in asset sales and this is part of our guidance. We already have approximately 50% announced and have a robust pipeline to achieve this by year-end. Again, we will update this at EPG. 
Free cash flow remains on track to $12 billion to $15 billion. Dispositions and CFOA are on track, and we expect GE Capital to dividend between $500 million and $7 billion in line with what we talked about last week, and we will update this as we go through the year. We will continue to drive investor-friendly capital allocation. The dividend remains a top priority. We're still expecting the Synchrony split to return $20 billion to you in the form of a share exchange. And as you saw last week, our board has authorized a $50 billion buyback based on the proceeds from the GE Capital sale. So between Synchrony, the buyback and dividends, we can return $90 billion to investors over the next few years. 
The company is executing well operationally and strategically. Our compensation plans have aligned us with investors, and we expect to have a solid second quarter and total year. Matt, now back to you for some questions."

GE had a good quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. Just to give you an economic read from the world of GE, we see the U.S. getting a little bit better every day. Europe is slightly improving. Overall, China remains good for GE.",850,"Thanks, Matt. GE had a good quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. Just to give you an economic read from the world of GE, we see the U.S. getting a little bit better every day. Europe is slightly improving. Overall, China remains good for GE. Resource-rich markets are mixed. We expect to have positive revenue in places like the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Meanwhile, Russia and Australia will be tough. We're seeing the world that we planned for.
Industrial EPS grew by 14% despite having $0.03 of uncovered restructuring. Operating EPS was $0.31, excluding the impact of the capital announcement. Organically, orders were up 1% and revenue grew 3%. Industrial segment profit grew by 9% or 12% organically, with margins up 120 basis points. Oil & Gas had a solid first quarter. Organically, they were positive in orders with revenue flat. Profit was up 11% organically. The oil and gas market remains volatile with some segments under pressure. However, our diversified Oil & Gas platforms delivered in the first quarter. We're on track for our targets in 2015. We're running the company well. We spent a bit of time last week discussing capital allocation. I would only reiterate that we're in full execution of our GE Capital plan. All of our CFOA targets and capital allocation goals are in line with our framework. We remain on track for Industrial EPS of $1.10 to $1.20. 
Orders were up 1% organically and we finished the quarter with $263 billion of backlog. Again, Oil & Gas orders were up 2% organically as they closed a few big subsea deals. Orders pricing declined slightly. Service orders were up 3% organically with broad-based strength. Aviation spares grew by 31% and remain robust. We remain on track for strong orders in Predictivity in 2015. New install orders for Healthcare IT grew substantially in the first quarter. We launched asset performance management in the manufacturing space. Orders for transportation, software and solutions are planned to be up 50% for the year, and we expect consistent growth for wind power up and AGPs for the year. 
We saw some encouraging signs in the quarter. Aviation remains very strong, recording $800 million on LEAP quarters. The LEAP has won 79% of all Neo and MAX orders. LEAP engines for Neo and C919 are flying, and the LEAP for Boeing is in the test plane and flying soon. The engine is ahead of schedule. The LEAP engine has been one of our most successful product launches in history. Healthcare equipment orders grew by 5% in the U.S. Transportation continued to record global wins, and they received a $350 million order in Angola. Power Conversion grew orders by 10% and we have solid orders performance in China of 54%. We expected Power to have tough comps in the first quarter. In addition, they saw several orders slip into the second quarter. But overall, we see good demand for units in North America, Japan, Saudi, North Africa, Mexico and Brazil. And we anticipate a strong Power orders recovery in second quarter. Our orders support our organic growth target for the year. 
Our businesses executed well in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was up 3%. Geographic growth is balanced. U.S. was up 2% and growth markets were up 6%. We saw strength in China, up 6%; Middle East, up 19%; Africa, up 11%; and Latin America, up 13%. From a business standpoint, we had organic growth in 6 of 7 segments and we have forecast organic growth of up  2% to 5% and remain on track for that. Margins continue to be good story with growth of 120 basis points. We've targeted 50 basis points of gross margin expansion for the year, and we hit 90 basis points in first quarter. We have favorable mix, value gap and productivity in the quarter. Meanwhile, simplification continues to drive good results and we're seeing more benefits ahead. One of the goals for 2015 is to expand margins in both equipment and service. We grew equipment margins by 120 basis points and service by 70 basis points in the quarter. We're making progress on margins as a company. 
Industrial CFOA was $900 million. It was less than expected. Our shortfall was driven by some Aviation supply chain disruptions and Power & Water orders timing. We will recover this in the second quarter. At the half, we plan on CFOA to be significantly higher than a year ago, and we're on track for our CFOA goals for the year. Our balance sheet remains quite strong. In the future, we will continue to look at ways to achieve a more efficient balance sheet.  From a capital allocation standpoint, Alstom remains on track for a second half close. We always expected that this deal would get a second look in the U.S. and Europe. Alstom is impacted by similar volatile market dynamics as GE, but we continue to see this as a good strategic and financial fit for us. And we intend on completing a deal that is good for investors. 
Now over to Jeff."
177031,282791819,790252,"General Electric Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a first quarter summary. As we discussed last week, we took a significant day 1 charge related to the exit of the non-vertical assets of GE Capital. On this page, I will start with the underlying financial performance of the",3263,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a first quarter summary. As we discussed last week, we took a significant day 1 charge related to the exit of the non-vertical assets of GE Capital. On this page, I will start with the underlying financial performance of the company excluding those charges. And then on the next page, I'll walk you back to our reported financials. 
We had revenues of $33.1 billion, which were down 3% in the quarter, driven by GE Capital, which was down 7%. Industrial sales of $23.8 billion were down 1%. Operating earnings of $3.1 billion were down 5% on lower GE Capital earnings. Operating earnings per share of $0.31 were down 6%, with Industrial EPS, up 14% and GE Capital EPS, down 21%. Continuing EPS of $0.27 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. 
As Jeff said, CFOA for the quarter was $1.3 billion. We had Industrial CFOA of $900 million and received $450 million of dividends with expectations driven by timing on progress collections, particularly in Power & Water, and the impact of an Aviation supply chain issue on inventory. These timing issues will reverse in the second and third quarter, and our expectation is that the Industrial cash flow will be stronger in 2Q and will be up substantially for the first half versus last year. 
The GE Capital exit significantly impacts our tax rates for the quarter. As a result, we're providing both the reported tax provisions and tax rates on the bottom left side of the chart. The GE tax rate for the quarter was 23% in line with guidance we provided. The reported GE Capital tax rate is not meaningful as the charges to shrink the company caused there to be a $6.2 billion tax expense while there is a significant pretax loss. As we noted previously, GE Capital will have a higher tax rate going forward and we expect variability in the tax rate as we transition the business through the next few years. 
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and up 3% organically, reflecting about 4 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was approximately $940 million drag on Industrial segment revenue and about $120 million impact on op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 9%.  GE Capital earnings were down 21%, primarily driven by lower Synchrony earnings due to the minority interest and lower assets. I'll cover the dynamics of each of the segments in a couple of pages. But first, I want to walk these results to our reported financials. 
Starting with the first column on the left and working down. As we said, Industrial operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 14%; and GE Capital earnings were $1.5 billion, for a total operating earnings of $3.1 billion. Including nonoperating pension, continuing earnings were $2.7 billion. We had an approximately $80 million benefit in discontinued operation associated with the sale of our consumer mortgage business in Australia, to bring net earnings to $2.8 billion. 
The next column is the impact of the GE Capital exit announcement as we reviewed with you last week. As we discussed, we took a $14 billion charge associated with classifying business as an asset that's held for sale and a $6 billion tax charge. We also took a $2.3 billion disc ops charge principally reflecting the Real Estate transaction. After adjusting first quarter operations for these items, the reported amounts are shown in the third column. So $2.8 billion of operations net earnings offset by $16.4 billion of GE Capital charges works to the reported $13.6 billion net earnings loss for the first quarter or a loss of $1.35 a share. As we move to the execution of the plan we shared with you last week, there'll be adjustments. And we will continue to keep you updated on progress and the impact of those actions. 
Next on other items, we don't have a long list this quarter. We had $0.03 related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to take actions to improve the cost structure of the company. This was $422 million on a pretax basis, with about 1/3 of that related to restructuring Oil & Gas. As we discussed before, we're taking aggressive actions to reduce our costs footprint given the challenging environment. And Lorenzo and the team are laser-focused on execution. For the year, we'll continue to execute on restructuring projects with urgency. 
As you're aware, we are expecting some gains this year from Appliances and signaling transactions. In the profile on the bottom of the page, we've assumed that Appliance gain in the second quarter and the signaling gain in the second half, but both are subject to regulatory approval. Although there will be quarterly variability in gains and restructuring time, we expect gains to equal restructuring for the year on an EPS basis. 
Next, I'll give an update on Power & Water. Orders for the quarter were $4.5 billion, were down 21%, driven by equipment orders, down 29%; and services, down 15%. Orders were lighter than expected due to financing delays and timing of agreements, but not competitive losses. For example, we signed a deal for 2 7F gas turbines this week that we expected to sign in the first quarter. Our framework for wind and thermal orders has not changed for the year. We expect second quarter orders to be up double digits. In the first quarter, we booked 21 gas turbines versus 31 a year ago and 376 wind turbines versus 422 turbines in the first quarter of 2014.  In terms of H technology, we booked another order for a 9HA in Latin America, and this brings the backlog to 16 units. In addition, we've been technically selected on an additional 37 units and are bidding an incremental 50 units beyond that. 
Distributed Power equipment orders were down 53% driven by 9 fewer turbines. We expect Distributed Power turbines orders to be roughly flat for the year. Gas engine orders were lower by 39% in the quarter, driven by softer demand in gas compression. Overall, DP will continue to be soft for the year. Service orders were down 15% with PGS, down 20%, driven by no repeat of a large upgrade in Japan a year ago and lower new unit installs. AGP orders were 16, down 1 year-over-year. No change in outlook for AGPs or services for the total year. 
Revenue of $5.7 billion was higher by 4% but was up 9% x foreign exchange. Equipment revenues were up 1% on very strong thermal volume. We shipped 39 gas turbines versus 17 a year ago. That was partially offset by Distributed Power, down 37%; and renewables, down 30% on lower unit shipments of 15 and 174, respectively. Service revenues were higher by 7%, driven by higher upgrades, including AGP upgrades, 21 versus 17 a year ago. Operating profit of $871 million was down 2%. That's flat x foreign exchange, driven by higher volume offset by negative productivity in supply chain and engineering associated with the H ramp and negative product mix due to lower Distributed Power. Value gap in the quarter was a positive $12 million. Op profit margins were down 90 basis points in the quarter. 
 
We remain on track with the outlook we provided, and we expect 100 to 105 gas turbine orders and shipments this year with a good pipeline of activity. We still expect wind shipments of around 3,000 to 3,200 turbines. And AGP upgrades remain on track and Distributed Power will remain pressured throughout the year. 
Next I'll cover Oil & Gas. Oil & Gas orders of $4.3 billion were down 6% reported but up 2% organically. Equipment orders of $2.2 billion were down 10%, flat organically. Service orders were down 27% on weak North American activity, and TMS orders were down 23% with no repeat of 2 large LNG orders we took in the first quarter of last year. It was still a decent orders quarter for TMS, which booked more than $700 million of new orders in the quarter. Subsea and drilling orders were up 74% on large deals we booked in Ghana and Brazil. Service orders of $2.1 billion were down 3% but up 4% organically. Surface was lower by 21% and TMS was down 8% largely due to foreign exchange. Subsea was strong, up 21%. M&C was down 1% organically. Revenues of just under $4 billion, or 8% reported. Reported negative 8% includes 7 points of foreign exchange and 1 point of disposition. Equipment revenues were down 13%, with TMS, down 9% reported but up 22% x foreign exchange; and Subsea, down 8% reported but up 6% x exchange. M&C was down 8% organically in the quarter. And service revenues were down 2% reported but up 4% organic, with Surface, down 23%; and M&C, up 11% organically. 
Operating profit was up 11% organically, down 3% reported, driven by negative FX offset by strong productivity on both base cost and product and service cost. Price was a $5 million drag in the first quarter but the business delivered positive value gap. Margins improved 50 basis points reported and were 120 basis points better x the impact of exchange on earnings. This will be a challenging year in Oil & Gas but the team has been aggressive on remaking the cost structure of the business and we believe that we remain within the scenarios that supported our total year industrial guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 a share. 
Next I'll cover Aviation. Air travel continues to be very robust. Global passenger kilometers grew 5.3% through February 2015 versus the same period last year with the Middle East, up 8.8%; Asia Pacific, up 7.3%. Through February, freight traffic grew 7.5% compared with a year ago with very strong double-digit growth in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Orders in the quarter of $7.5 billion were up 36%. Equipment orders of $3.9 billion were up 64% on higher commercial engine orders of $3.3 billion, up over 2x versus prior year. This was driven by $1.2 billion of GE90 engine orders, up 10x versus last year, from Kuwait airlines (sic) [Kuwait Airways], Emirates and includes a GE9X order for Cathay. 
GEnx received $360 million in orders, up 3x, and we also recorded $800 million of orders for LEAP, up 3x. Our total win rate for the LEAP since program launch for the next-gen narrow-body aircraft is 79%. Commercial engine backlog was up 35% year-over-year. Military equipment orders were down 61%, driven by no repeat of 2 large orders from Sikorsky and Qatar Air Force from the first quarter of last year, as expected. Service orders were up 14% on strong commercial spare parts, which were up 31% at $38.9 million a day. And military spares were down 11%. 
Revenues of $5.7 billion were down 2%. Equipment revenues were down 8% with commercial equipment revenue, down 1% on lower GEnx shipments. We shipped 19 fewer units than last year, 51 versus 70, and 29 less units than our plan as a result of a supply chain disruption. Military equipment revenue was down 32% on lower shipments and service revenue was up 4% with commercial spare parts up 28% and military services up 3%. 
Op profit was up 18% on very strong value gap, variable cost productivity and favorable GEnx mix, partially offset by lower volume and higher R&D. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter. The impact for the lower GEnx shipments improved the margin rate by about 90 basis points. This is net of some costs to remediate the disruption. We're working the issue and we expect to ship most of the delayed units in 2Q and be back on plan for the full year of 275 to 300 GEnx units.  Aviation had another strong quarter, growing equipment and service backlog by 23% and 9%, respectively. The business continues to execute on new technology introductions, service offerings and cost out. Aviation could perform better than we outlined at the December outlook meeting. 
Next, Healthcare orders of $4.2 billion were down 1% but up 4%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw continued growth in the U.S., up 5%. Europe was down 4% but up 11% x FX. Japan was down 18%, down 6% x FX. The Middle East was down 43%, driven by Saudi, and China was down 4%. Health care system orders were down 5% flat, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. U.S. imaging and ultrasound was up 7% with strong growth in MR, up 41% in the quarter, partially driven by the new PET/MR release in December. This was offset by softer orders in Japan, Russia and the Middle East. 
Life Sciences orders were up 10%, up 17% excluding foreign exchange, driven by strong bioprocess orders. This was offset with core imaging down 3% and services. Revenues of $4.1 billion were down 3% but up 2% x foreign exchange. Health care system revenues were down 6%, flat organically, and Life Sciences revenues were up 4%. Operating profit was up 3%, with 80 basis points of margin expansion driven by strong cost execution partially offset by lower price. 
Looking forward, we expect similar market dynamic. We believe we're gaining share in key modalities in the U.S. and we expect the market to continue to improve. While China has slowed, we expect orders growth for the remainder of the year in China. Life Science growth will persist and the business team continues to execute on its cost-out programs. In Transportation, North American carloads were up 1.8% with intermodal traffic, up 2.1%, which was impacted by the West Coast port strike. Commodities received broad-based increases with agriculture, up 4.6% and chemicals and petroleum products, up 3.2%. Coal volumes were down 2.5% in the quarter. Transportation orders were down 38% with equipment orders down 56%, and services were higher by 13%. Equipment orders were lower driven by locomotives, primarily due to not repeating the large South Africa deal we had in the first quarter of last year. 
Revenues in the quarter were up 7%, driven by strong equipment growth. We shipped 215 locos in the quarter versus 178 a year earlier. Overall, mining continues to be soft, down 23%. Operating profit in the quarter was up 11% on higher locomotive volume, material deflation and cost productivity. Margins in the quarter expanded by 70 basis points.  We now have 16 preproduction Tier 4 units out with our customers running on the rails. They are performing in actual operating condition as part of our validation process. We had about 1,200 Tier 4 locos in backlog at the end of the first quarter of '15, and we expect to ship about half those this year. 
In Energy Management, orders of $2.1 billion were down 2% and up 2% organically. Power Conversion orders were up 10% in the quarter. Industrial Solutions was up 4% and Digital Energy was down 38% from no repeat of a large domestic meter order from last year. Power Conversion saw strong growth in renewables vertical, up 2x on solar inverters; and the marine vertical was up 15% on a large Canadian propulsion dynamic positioning deal in Canada, offset partially by softer Oil & Gas orders. Backlog for Energy Management business grew 3%. 
Revenues were up 1% and up 8% organically, driven by foreign exchange, with Power Conversion, up 6%; Digital Energy and industrial systems were both about flat. Op profit was $28 million, up from $5 million last year on a reported basis. The business continues to benefit from restructuring, with strong base cost productivity driven by SG&A reductions and positive value gap offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Margin rates in the quarter were up 140 basis points. We expect program execution and margin rate improvement to continue throughout 2015. 
And then finally, Appliances & Lighting. Revenue in the quarter was up 5%. Appliance revenues were up 8% driven by strong volume. Industry core units were flat with retail, down 1% and contract, up 4%. The industry volume was well below the first quarter expectation of plus 8% due to the harsh weather across the U.S. We believe GE increased our share by 2 points in the first quarter. Lighting revenues were down 3% on lower traditional product demand, which was down 18%. This was partially offset by continued strong LED performance, which grew 76% in the quarter. LED now makes up 30-plus percent of lighting revenues and that's up from 17% of lighting revenues in the first quarter of 2014. Op profit in the quarter was $103 million. 
Now GE Capital. Before we start with the GE Capital results, I'd just like to take a moment and highlight the incredible work done by Keith and the GE Capital team. Keith led an enormous and complicated effort in a very challenging window of time to get the company to this very important strategic pivot. This is a transformational change for our company that will create real value for investors long term. 
As I've covered, the impact of last week's announcement is reflected in GE Capital's first quarter reported financials. On the page, we have provided a walk starting with the earnings from our vertical businesses, which generated $352 million for the quarter. Operating earnings from the remainder of our businesses in continuing operations amounted to $1.1 billion, which was more than offset by $14 billion day 1 accounting adjustments related to last week's announcement. Earnings from continuing operations amounted to a net loss of $12.5 billion. 
Discontinued operations generated additional losses of $2.2 billion, which reflect the charges associated with our commercial Real Estate business. Overall, GE Capital reported a $14.7 billion loss, including $6 billion of tax expenses. We ended the quarter at $303 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter at $76 billion, including $14 billion attributable to Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remained at $25 billion and we had $8 billion of long-term debt issuance for the quarter. As discussed last week, we do not anticipate additional issuances over the next 5 years, and we expect GE Capital CB balance to decrease to $5 billion by the end of the year. 
Starting this quarter, we are transitioning the capital accuracy reporting from Basel I to Basel III in line with industry practice. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 10.6% inclusive of the day 1 charges. We expect this ratio to improve as we dispose of risk-weighted assets over the course of the year. As I mentioned last Friday, we will operate through the transition in a safe and sound manner, working with our regulators in determining the appropriate capital level. Going forward, the team will be very focused on executing the portfolio transformation. 
As we discussed last week, we have signed deals on close to 50% of the planned ENI reduction for the year and we are receiving very strong inbound interest on many of our portfolios since the discussion last week. We are prioritizing transaction in a way that allows us to maximize franchise value. And as I said last week, we'll be very transparent as we execute through this process. Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team delivered a strong operational quarter in line with our prior guidance and are now fully focused on delivering on the portfolio of transformation that we shared with you last week. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We remain on track for our 2015 operating framework, but we'll adjust our guidance milestones to reflect last week's announcement on Capital. Industrial EPS is on track for $1.10 to $1.20, and we're running our businesses to the high end of that range. We're generating solid organic growth and margin expansion. Corporate costs are being well managed with gains equal to restructuring, and Oil & Gas is performing to our expectations. We continue to invest in industrial growth. Between research and development, investment in plant equipment and information technology and the potential for bolt-on industrial M&A, we'll invest $10 billion to $15 billion each year in our industrial growth. We can do this and still return significant capital to investors. 
The GE Capital verticals are tracking to $0.15 per share, and as Jeff said, we're focused on the verticals and we'll keep them top of mind. We've set a target of $90 billion in asset sales and this is part of our guidance. We already have approximately 50% announced and have a robust pipeline to achieve this by year-end. Again, we will update this at EPG. 
Free cash flow remains on track to $12 billion to $15 billion. Dispositions and CFOA are on track, and we expect GE Capital to dividend between $500 million and $7 billion, in line with what we talked about last week, and we will update this as we go through the year. We will continue to drive investor-friendly capital allocation. The dividend remains a top priority. We're still expecting the Synchrony split to return $20 billion to you in the form of a share exchange. And as you saw last week, our board has authorized a $50 billion buyback based on the proceeds from the GE Capital sale. So between Synchrony, the buyback and dividends, we can return $90 billion to investors over the next few years. 
The company is executing well operationally and strategically. Our compensation plans have aligned us with investors, and we expect to have a solid second quarter and total year. Matt, now back to you for some questions."

There's no question that most of the forecasts are that the aviation industry globally are probably having its most profitable year in history this year. I think IATA's estimating almost $25 billion of profit. And the airlines are, no question, stocking inventory. You'll recall that 2012 there was a really large destocking that went on. And since that destocking in 2012, spares have improved each of the last couple of years. So it may be that the airlines, based on the profitability of operations, are more aggressively replenishing some of that destocking that happened a few years ago, but very strong. Now we don't expect the -- that rate of 31% to persist for the year. We -- I think we talked about double digits and we're probably talking about mid-double digits, mid-teens maybe, but it's not going to be 31% for the year."

We have a market today that's incredibly receptive to these kinds of assets, and so we need to be able to capitalize on that.  There is no question, we've got to balance from an execution standpoint, the nature of the buyer and the size of the transaction, to the extent that we're relying on maybe a back-end regulatory approval by the buyer, with doing smaller transactions that maybe, maybe not, may be better from a price perspective than doing several large big bulk deals. I think my guess is that Keith and the team will run almost a parallel process there where we'll evaluate on both tracks, platform by platform, portfolio by portfolio, the level of interest there versus a couple, several maybe, much larger deals then try to sweep up many of those platforms simultaneously.

Just to give you an economic read from the world of GE, we see the U.S. getting a little bit better every day. Europe is slightly improving. Overall, China remains good for GE. Resource-rich markets are mixed. We expect to have positive revenue in places like the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Meanwhile, Russia and Australia will be tough. We're seeing the world that we planned for.
Industrial EPS grew by 14% despite having $0.03 of uncovered restructuring. Operating EPS was $0.31, excluding the impact of the capital announcement. Organically, orders were up 1% and revenue grew 3%. Industrial segment profit grew by 9% or 12% organically, with margins up 120 basis points. Oil & Gas had a solid first quarter. Organically, they were positive in orders with revenue flat. Profit was up 11% organically. The oil and gas market remains volatile with some segments under pressure. However, our diversified Oil & Gas platforms delivered in the first quarter. We're on track for our targets in 2015. We're running the company well. We spent a bit of time last week discussing capital allocation. I would only reiterate that we're in full execution of our GE Capital plan. All of our CFOA targets and capital allocation goals are in line with our framework. We remain on track for Industrial EPS of $1.10 to $1.20. 
Orders were up 1% organically and we finished the quarter with $263 billion of backlog. Again, Oil & Gas orders were up 2% organically as they closed a few big subsea deals. Orders pricing declined slightly. Service orders were up 3% organically with broad-based strength. Aviation spares grew by 31% and remain robust. We remain on track for strong orders in Predictivity in 2015. New install orders for Healthcare IT grew substantially in the first quarter. We launched asset performance management in the manufacturing space. Orders for transportation, software and solutions are planned to be up 50% for the year, and we expect consistent growth for wind power up and AGPs for the year. 
We saw some encouraging signs in the quarter. Aviation remains very strong, recording $800 million on LEAP quarters. The LEAP has won 79% of all Neo and MAX orders. LEAP engines for Neo and C919 are flying, and the LEAP for Boeing is in the test plane and flying soon. The engine is ahead of schedule. The LEAP engine has been one of our most successful product launches in history. Healthcare equipment orders grew by 5% in the U.S. Transportation continued to record global wins, and they received a $350 million order in Angola. Power Conversion grew orders by 10% and we have solid orders performance in China of 54%. We expected Power to have tough comps in the first quarter. In addition, they saw several orders slip into the second quarter. But overall, we see good demand for units in North America, Japan, Saudi, North Africa, Mexico and Brazil. And we anticipate a strong Power orders recovery in second quarter. Our orders support our organic growth target for the year. 
Our businesses executed well in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was up 3%. Geographic growth is balanced. U.S. was up 2% and growth markets were up 6%. We saw strength in China, up 6%; Middle East, up 19%; Africa, up 11%; and Latin America, up 13%. From a business standpoint, we had organic growth in 6 of 7 segments and we have forecast organic growth of up 2% to 5% and remain on track for that. Margins continue to be good story with growth of 120 basis points. We've targeted 50 basis points of gross margin expansion for the year, and we hit 90 basis points in first quarter. We have favorable mix, value gap and productivity in the quarter. Meanwhile, simplification continues to drive good results and we're seeing more benefits ahead. One of the goals for 2015 is to expand margins in both equipment and service. We grew equipment margins by 120 basis points and service by 70 basis points in the quarter. We're making progress on margins as a company. 
Industrial CFOA was $900 million. It was less than expected. Our shortfall was driven by some Aviation supply chain disruptions and Power & Water orders timing. We will recover this in the second quarter. At the half, we plan on CFOA to be significantly higher than a year ago, and we're on track for our CFOA goals for the year. Our balance sheet remains quite strong. In the future, we will continue to look at ways to achieve a more efficient balance sheet. From a capital allocation standpoint, Alstom remains on track for a second half close. We always expected that this deal would get a second look in the U.S. and Europe. Alstom is impacted by similar volatile market dynamics as GE, but we continue to see this as a good strategic and financial fit for us. And we intend on completing a deal that is good for investors. 
Now over to Jeff."
177031,282791819,790698,"General Electric Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2015",2015-04-17,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a first quarter summary. As we discussed last week, we took a significant day 1 charge related to the exit of the non-vertical assets of GE Capital. On this page, I will start with the underlying financial performance of the",3264,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a first quarter summary. As we discussed last week, we took a significant day 1 charge related to the exit of the non-vertical assets of GE Capital. On this page, I will start with the underlying financial performance of the company excluding those charges. And then on the next page, I'll walk you back to our reported financials. 
We had revenues of $33.1 billion, which were down 3% in the quarter, driven by GE Capital, which was down 7%. Industrial sales of $23.8 billion were down 1%. Operating earnings of $3.1 billion were down 5% on lower GE Capital earnings. Operating earnings per share of $0.31 were down 6%, with Industrial EPS, up 14% and GE Capital EPS, down 21%. Continuing EPS of $0.27 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. 
As Jeff said, CFOA for the quarter was $1.3 billion. We had Industrial CFOA of $900 million and received $450 million of dividends with expectations driven by timing on progress collections, particularly in Power & Water, and the impact of an Aviation supply chain issue on inventory. These timing issues will reverse in the second and third quarter, and our expectation is that the Industrial cash flow will be stronger in 2Q and will be up substantially for the first half versus last year. 
The GE Capital exit significantly impacts our tax rates for the quarter. As a result, we're providing both the reported tax provisions and tax rates on the bottom left side of the chart. The GE tax rate for the quarter was 23% in line with guidance we provided. The reported GE Capital tax rate is not meaningful as the charges to shrink the company caused there to be a $6.2 billion tax expense while there is a significant pretax loss. As we noted previously, GE Capital will have a higher tax rate going forward and we expect variability in the tax rate as we transition the business through the next few years. 
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and up 3% organically, reflecting about 4 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was approximately $940 million drag on Industrial segment revenue and about $120 million impact on op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 9%. GE Capital earnings were down 21%, primarily driven by lower Synchrony earnings due to the minority interest and lower assets. I'll cover the dynamics of each of the segments in a couple of pages. But first, I want to walk these results to our reported financials. 
Starting with the first column on the left and working down. As we said, Industrial operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 14%; and GE Capital earnings were $1.5 billion, for a total operating earnings of $3.1 billion. Including nonoperating pension, continuing earnings were $2.7 billion. We had an approximately $80 million benefit in discontinued operation associated with the sale of our consumer mortgage business in Australia, to bring net earnings to $2.8 billion. 
The next column is the impact of the GE Capital exit announcement as we reviewed with you last week. As we discussed, we took a $14 billion charge associated with classifying business as an asset that's held for sale and a $6 billion tax charge. We also took a $2.3 billion disc ops charge principally reflecting the Real Estate transaction. After adjusting first quarter operations for these items, the reported amounts are shown in the third column. So $2.8 billion of operations net earnings offset by $16.4 billion of GE Capital charges works to the reported $13.6 billion net earnings loss for the first quarter or a loss of $1.35 a share. As we move to the execution of the plan we shared with you last week, there'll be adjustments. And we will continue to keep you updated on progress and the impact of those actions. 
Next on other items, we don't have a long list this quarter. We had $0.03 related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to take actions to improve the cost structure of the company. This was $422 million on a pretax basis, with about 1/3 of that related to restructuring Oil & Gas. As we discussed before, we're taking aggressive actions to reduce our costs footprint given the challenging environment. And Lorenzo and the team are laser-focused on execution. For the year, we'll continue to execute on restructuring projects with urgency. 
As you're aware, we are expecting some gains this year from Appliances and signaling transactions. In the profile on the bottom of the page, we've assumed that Appliance gain in the second quarter and the signaling gain in the second half, but both are subject to regulatory approval. Although there will be quarterly variability in gains and restructuring time, we expect gains to equal restructuring for the year on an EPS basis. 
Next, I'll give an update on Power & Water. Orders for the quarter were $4.5 billion, were down 21%, driven by equipment orders, down 29%; and services, down 15%. Orders were lighter than expected due to financing delays and timing of agreements, but not competitive losses. For example, we signed a deal for 2 7F gas turbines this week that we expected to sign in the first quarter. Our framework for wind and thermal orders has not changed for the year. We expect second quarter orders to be up double digits. In the first quarter, we booked 21 gas turbines versus 31 a year ago and 376 wind turbines versus 422 turbines in the first quarter of 2014. In terms of H technology, we booked another order for a 9HA in Latin America, and this brings the backlog to 16 units. In addition, we've been technically selected on an additional 37 units and are bidding an incremental 50 units beyond that. 
Distributed Power equipment orders were down 53% driven by 9 fewer turbines. We expect Distributed Power turbines orders to be roughly flat for the year. Gas engine orders were lower by 39% in the quarter, driven by softer demand in gas compression. Overall, DP will continue to be soft for the year. Service orders were down 15% with PGS, down 20%, driven by no repeat of a large upgrade in Japan a year ago and lower new unit installs. AGP orders were 16, down 1 year-over-year. No change in outlook for AGPs or services for the total year. 
Revenue of $5.7 billion was higher by 4% but was up 9% x foreign exchange. Equipment revenues were up 1% on very strong thermal volume. We shipped 39 gas turbines versus 17 a year ago. That was partially offset by Distributed Power, down 37%; and renewables, down 30% on lower unit shipments of 15 and 174, respectively. Service revenues were higher by 7%, driven by higher upgrades, including AGP upgrades, 21 versus 17 a year ago. Operating profit of $871 million was down 2%. That's flat x foreign exchange, driven by higher volume offset by negative productivity in supply chain and engineering associated with the H ramp and negative product mix due to lower Distributed Power. Value gap in the quarter was a positive $12 million. Op profit margins were down 90 basis points in the quarter. 
 
We remain on track with the outlook we provided, and we expect 100 to 105 gas turbine orders and shipments this year with a good pipeline of activity. We still expect wind shipments of around 3,000 to 3,200 turbines. And AGP upgrades remain on track and Distributed Power will remain pressured throughout the year. 
Next I'll cover Oil & Gas. Oil & Gas orders of $4.3 billion were down 6% reported but up 2% organically. Equipment orders of $2.2 billion were down 10%, flat organically. Service orders were down 27% on weak North American activity, and TMS orders were down 23% with no repeat of 2 large LNG orders we took in the first quarter of last year. It was still a decent orders quarter for TMS, which booked more than $700 million of new orders in the quarter. Subsea and drilling orders were up 74% on large deals we booked in Ghana and Brazil. Service orders of $2.1 billion were down 3% but up 4% organically. Surface was lower by 21% and TMS was down 8% largely due to foreign exchange. Subsea was strong, up 21%. M&C was down 1% organically. Revenues of just under $4 billion 
[Audio Gap] 
8% reported. Reported negative 8% includes 7 points of foreign exchange and 1 point of disposition. Equipment revenues were down 13%, with TMS, down 9% reported but up 22% x foreign exchange; and Subsea, down 8% reported but up 6% x exchange. M&C was down 8% organically in the quarter. And service revenues were down 2% reported but up 4% organic, with Surface, down 23%; and M&C, up 11% organically. 
Operating profit was up 11% organically, down 3% reported, driven by negative FX offset by strong productivity on both base cost and product and service cost. Price was a $5 million drag in the first quarter but the business delivered positive value gap. Margins improved 50 basis points reported and were 120 basis points better x the impact of exchange on earnings. This will be a challenging year in Oil & Gas but the team has been aggressive on remaking the cost structure of the business and we believe that we remain within the scenarios that supported our total year industrial guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 a share. 
Next I'll cover Aviation. Air travel continues to be very robust. Global passenger kilometers grew 5.3% through February 2015 versus the same period last year with the Middle East, up 8.8%; Asia Pacific, up 7.3%. Through February, freight traffic grew 7.5% compared with a year ago with very strong double-digit growth in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Orders in the quarter of $7.5 billion were up 36%. Equipment orders of $3.9 billion were up 64% on higher commercial engine orders of $3.3 billion, up over 2x versus prior year. This was driven by $1.2 billion of GE90 engine orders, up 10x versus last year, from Kuwait airlines (sic) [Kuwait Airways], Emirates and includes a GE9X order for Cathay. 
GEnx received $360 million in orders, up 3x, and we also recorded $800 million of orders for LEAP, up 3x. Our total win rate for the LEAP since program launch for the next-gen narrow-body aircraft is 79%. Commercial engine backlog was up 35% year-over-year. Military equipment orders were down 61%, driven by no repeat of 2 large orders from Sikorsky and Qatar Air Force from the first quarter of last year, as expected. Service orders were up 14% on strong commercial spare parts, which were up 31% at $38.9 million a day. And military spares were down 11%. 
Revenues of $5.7 billion were down 2%. Equipment revenues were down 8% with commercial equipment revenue, down 1% on lower GEnx shipments. We shipped 19 fewer units than last year, 51 versus 70, and 29 less units than our plan as a result of a supply chain disruption. Military equipment revenue was down 32% on lower shipments and service revenue was up 4% with commercial spare parts up 28% and military services up 3%. 
Op profit was up 18% on very strong value gap, variable cost productivity and favorable GEnx mix, partially offset by lower volume and higher R&D. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter. The impact for the lower GEnx shipments improved the margin rate by about 90 basis points. This is net of some costs to remediate the disruption. We're working the issue and we expect to ship most of the delayed units in 2Q and be back on plan for the full year of 275 to 300 GEnx units. Aviation had another strong quarter, growing equipment and service backlog by 23% and 9%, respectively. The business continues to execute on new technology introductions, service offerings and cost out. Aviation could perform better than we outlined at the December outlook meeting. 
Next, Healthcare orders of $4.2 billion were down 1% but up 4%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw continued growth in the U.S., up 5%. Europe was down 4% but up 11% x FX. Japan was down 18%, down 6% x FX. The Middle East was down 43%, driven by Saudi, and China was down 4%. Health care system orders were down 5% flat, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. U.S. imaging and ultrasound was up 7% with strong growth in MR, up 41% in the quarter, partially driven by the new PET/MR release in December. This was offset by softer orders in Japan, Russia and the Middle East. 
Life Sciences orders were up 10%, up 17% excluding foreign exchange, driven by strong bioprocess orders. This was offset with core imaging down 3% and services. Revenues of $4.1 billion were down 3% but up 2% x foreign exchange. Health care system revenues were down 6%, flat organically, and Life Sciences revenues were up 4%. Operating profit was up 3%, with 80 basis points of margin expansion driven by strong cost execution partially offset by lower price. 
Looking forward, we expect similar market dynamic. We believe we're gaining share in key modalities in the U.S. and we expect the market to continue to improve. While China has slowed, we expect orders growth for the remainder of the year in China. Life Science growth will persist and the business team continues to execute on its cost-out programs. In Transportation, North American carloads were up 1.8% with intermodal traffic, up 2.1%, which was impacted by the West Coast port strike. Commodities received broad-based increases with agriculture, up 4.6% and chemicals and petroleum products, up 3.2%. Coal volumes were down 2.5% in the quarter. Transportation orders were down 38% with equipment orders down 56%, and services were higher by 13%. Equipment orders were lower driven by locomotives, primarily due to not repeating the large South Africa deal we had in the first quarter of last year. 
Revenues in the quarter were up 7%, driven by strong equipment growth. We shipped 215 locos in the quarter versus 178 a year earlier. Overall, mining continues to be soft, down 23%. Operating profit in the quarter was up 11% on higher locomotive volume, material deflation and cost productivity. Margins in the quarter expanded by 70 basis points. We now have 16 preproduction Tier 4 units out with our customers running on the rails. They are performing in actual operating condition as part of our validation process. We had about 1,200 Tier 4 locos in backlog at the end of the first quarter of '15, and we expect to ship about half those this year. 
In Energy Management, orders of $2.1 billion were down 2% and up 2% organically. Power Conversion orders were up 10% in the quarter. Industrial Solutions was up 4% and Digital Energy was down 38% from no repeat of a large domestic meter order from last year. Power Conversion saw strong growth in renewables vertical, up 2x on solar inverters; and the marine vertical was up 15% on a large Canadian propulsion dynamic positioning deal in Canada, offset partially by softer Oil & Gas orders. Backlog for Energy Management business grew 3%. 
Revenues were up 1% and up 8% organically, driven by foreign exchange, with Power Conversion, up 6%; Digital Energy and industrial systems were both about flat. Op profit was $28 million, up from $5 million last year on a reported basis. The business continues to benefit from restructuring, with strong base cost productivity driven by SG&A reductions and positive value gap offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Margin rates in the quarter were up 140 basis points. We expect program execution and margin rate improvement to continue throughout 2015. 
And then finally, Appliances & Lighting. Revenue in the quarter was up 5%. Appliance revenues were up 8% driven by strong volume. Industry core units were flat with retail, down 1% and contract, up 4%. The industry volume was well below the first quarter expectation of plus 8% due to the harsh weather across the U.S. We believe GE increased our share by 2 points in the first quarter. Lighting revenues were down 3% on lower traditional product demand, which was down 18%. This was partially offset by continued strong LED performance, which grew 76% in the quarter. LED now makes up 30-plus percent of lighting revenues and that's up from 17% of lighting revenues in the first quarter of 2014. Op profit in the quarter was $103 million. 
Now GE Capital. Before we start with the GE Capital results, I'd just like to take a moment and highlight the incredible work done by Keith and the GE Capital team. Keith led an enormous and complicated effort in a very challenging window of time to get the company to this very important strategic pivot. This is a transformational change for our company that will create real value for investors long term. 
As I've covered, the impact of last week's announcement is reflected in GE Capital's first quarter reported financials. On the page, we have provided a walk starting with the earnings from our vertical businesses, which generated $352 million for the quarter. Operating earnings from the remainder of our businesses in continuing operations amounted to $1.1 billion, which was more than offset by $14 billion day 1 accounting adjustments related to last week's announcement. Earnings from continuing operations amounted to a net loss of $12.5 billion. 
Discontinued operations generated additional losses of $2.2 billion, which reflect the charges associated with our commercial Real Estate business. Overall, GE Capital reported a $14.7 billion loss, including $6 billion of tax expenses. We ended the quarter at $303 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter at $76 billion, including $14 billion attributable to Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remained at $25 billion and we had $8 billion of long-term debt issuance for the quarter. As discussed last week, we do not anticipate additional issuances over the next 5 years, and we expect GE Capital CB balance to decrease to $5 billion by the end of the year. 
Starting this quarter, we are transitioning the capital accuracy reporting from Basel I to Basel III in line with industry practice. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 10.6% inclusive of the day 1 charges. We expect this ratio to improve as we dispose of risk-weighted assets over the course of the year. As I mentioned last Friday, we will operate through the transition in a safe and sound manner, working with our regulators in determining the appropriate capital level. Going forward, the team will be very focused on executing the portfolio transformation. 
As we discussed last week, we have signed deals on close to 50% of the planned ENI reduction for the year and we are receiving very strong inbound interest on many of our portfolios since the discussion last week. We are prioritizing transaction in a way that allows us to maximize franchise value. And as I said last week, we'll be very transparent as we execute through this process. Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team delivered a strong operational quarter in line with our prior guidance and are now fully focused on delivering on the portfolio of transformation that we shared with you last week. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We remain on track for our 2015 operating framework, but we'll adjust our guidance milestones to reflect last week's announcement on Capital. Industrial EPS is on track for $1.10 to $1.20, and we're running our businesses to the high end of that range. We're generating solid organic growth and margin expansion. Corporate costs are being well managed with gains equal to restructuring, and Oil & Gas is performing to our expectations. We continue to invest in industrial growth. Between research and development, investment in plant equipment and information technology and the potential for bolt-on industrial M&A, we'll invest $10 billion to $15 billion each year in our industrial growth. We can do this and still return significant capital to investors. 
The GE Capital verticals are tracking to $0.15 per share, and as Jeff said, we're focused on the verticals and we'll keep them top of mind. We've set a target of $90 billion in asset sales and this is part of our guidance. We already have approximately 50% announced and have a robust pipeline to achieve this by year-end. Again, we will update this at EPG. 
Free cash flow remains on track to $12 billion to $15 billion. Dispositions and CFOA are on track, and we expect GE Capital to dividend between $500 million and $7 billion, in line with what we talked about last week, and we will update this as we go through the year. We will continue to drive investor-friendly capital allocation. The dividend remains a top priority. We're still expecting the Synchrony split to return $20 billion to you in the form of a share exchange. And as you saw last week, our board has authorized a $50 billion buyback based on the proceeds from the GE Capital sale. So between Synchrony, the buyback and dividends, we can return $90 billion to investors over the next few years. 
The company is executing well operationally and strategically. Our compensation plans have aligned us with investors, and we expect to have a solid second quarter and total year. Matt, now back to you for some questions."

So he has prioritized the focus based on that first. You're correct, I would say the second order of priority would be, we think in the U.S., our ability to execute quickly and then scale is very favorable today and it is a big part of the discussion around the SIFI status. So having said that, it's not as though we're not going to do anything outside the U.S. We're going to be working the international platform in parallel here as well."

Like I said earlier, like Jeff said, we're pleased with where Oil & Gas finished in the first quarter. But that market is extremely volatile right now and we just want to see how we continue to progress, what happens in the marketplace and let's see what happens. There's plenty of chance to make other changes as the year goes through, but let's see how we do quarter-by-quarter. And beyond that, look, I think we are -- we've got a good diversified set of businesses that are doing well in the industries they're in, and we need to see how the world continues to evolve."

The team had a strong quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. We're executing both organic growth and cost initiatives, specifically Industrial EPS grew by 18% and earnings of the combine -- a combination of Industrial and the cap",897,"Thanks, Matt. The team had a strong quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. We're executing both organic growth and cost initiatives, specifically Industrial EPS grew by 18% and earnings of the combine -- a combination of Industrial and the capital verticals, which is the way we think about GE going forward, grew by 19%. Organic growth and earnings performance was very strong. Orders were up 13%, revenue was up 5% and property would've grown by 11% organically. Our operations were strong. Margins expanded by 70 basis points with gross margins up 60 basis points and Industrial CFOA grew by 79%. 
Our Oil & Gas business met expectations for the quarter for orders revenue and profit. Organic profit was up 5% and we continue to grow margins despite a tougher environment. 
We end the half with our goals on track. Meanwhile, we have a number of portfolio actions underway. GE Capital asset sales were robust and we will achieve $100 billion of deals closed in 2015. We still expect the Synchrony split to take place by the end of this year. Appliances and Alstom are in the middle of regulatory reviews, but we still expect both deals to close by the end of the year. We remain committed to doing good deals for investors. In all, we're confident enough with our performance to raise the low end of our range for Industrial guidance to $1.13 to $1.20 EPS. So overall, we had a very good quarter. 
Orders were very strong, up 8% or 13% organically. We saw solid growth in both equipment and service. Orders pricing was up slightly and we grew backlog to a record $272 billion. Power & Water was up 22% behind strength in Power GEN products and Wind. We now have won 61 technical selections for the H turbine up 8 in the quarter. Oil & Gas had a solid equipment orders and turbine machinery and downstream consistent with our expectations. Power Conversion orders grew by 33% as we're winning big in Renewable energy markets. Aviation had large order growth and LEAP and GEnx, and meanwhile, spares order rates grew by 33%. Tough care HCS equipment orders grew by 6% in the U.S. as that market continues to rebound. U.S. was particularly strong, but we also saw growth in many parts of the world. The U.S. was up 10%, Europe up 4% and growth markets up 2%. First half Industrial net orders were 1.9 billion, up 83% and we expect total solution orders for the year of $6 billion, up 30%. Service growth was robust at 7%, ex FX and backlog reached $200 billion for the first time. Our strong backlog in orders position GE to achieve our long-term organic growth targets of 5%. Organic revenue was up 5%. Growth was broad-based with 6 to 7 segments up. Our real highlight was the $19 billion of commitments at the Paris Air Show. For the first half, U.S. revenue grew by 3% and 4 of 9 growth markets were up, and China grew by 12%. We have some excellent performances in Service. PowerGen service was up 9%, Aviation service was up 6% and Transportation service was up 6%. We're gaining share in Healthcare with U.S. Healthcare HCS equipment revenue growing 16%. We closed a big Healthcare deal in Kenya worth more than $200 million and international low-cost grew by 128% with big wins in Brazil and South Africa. A few adjacencies were particularly strong. Wind grew by 49% and LEDs grew by 77%, and our Power Conversion business is innovating in solar and wind energy recording $300 million in orders in those markets alone. We have a strong pipeline of products and services that are winning versus competition. And we're having success in software and analytics. We launched GE's Digital Wind Farm, providing customers with up to 20% more capacity. We announced a major collaboration with BP for SM monitoring and Oil & Gas and we closed another Class 1 railroad that will utilize GE's planner and a deal worth more than $100 million. Margins expanded with 70 basis points of growth. Gross margins were up 60 basis points for strength in value gap and productivity. We're making progress broadly with Fiber 7 segments having margin growth. Simplification continues to deliver results and our SG&A targets are on track. 
First half margins were up 100 basis points and Service margins were particularly strong, up 130 basis points year-to-date as the impact of our analytical tools are being felt. Equipment margins meanwhile are up 30 basis points year-to-date. So we're running the company well. 
Cash is a good story. Industrial CFOA is up 79% year-to-date. And free cash flow is up 54%. We now receive a capital of dividend a quarter but we're hopeful to get an additional dividend through the parent in the year. As we said, our assets sales are ahead of plan and GE Capital has substantial strength to remain safe and secure. We expect to complete the Synchrony split by the end of '15. And at the current stock price, our share of Synchrony is worth about $24 billion. The balance sheet is very strong with $70 billion of cash at the parent and our cash generation is on track for the year and we remain committed to our capital allocation plans. 
Now over to Jeff to review the businesses."
177031,291819527,834242,"General Electric Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2015",2015-07-17,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the second quarter summary. We have revenues of $32.8 billion, which were up 2% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, included Corporate, were up 1% to $26.9 billion. You can see on the right that the Industrial segments were",3255,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the second quarter summary. We have revenues of $32.8 billion, which were up 2% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, included Corporate, were up 1% to $26.9 billion. You can see on the right that the Industrial segments were flat on revenue for the quarter, but up 5% organically. Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.31, which was up 19% year-over-year. That's driven by Industrial up 18% and the Verticals up 25%. The operating EPS number of $0.28 as in other continuing GE Capital activity, including the Consumer segment. Headquarter runoff and other exit related items, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. 
Continuing EPS of $0.24 includes the impact of nonoperating pension and net EPS of negative $0.13 include the impact of discontinuing operations. The total [indiscernible] impact in the quarter was negative $3.7 billion, which included a $4.3 billion noncash charge related to moving the majority of our GE Capital CLL business to held for sale. We disclosed this earlier in the market. Partly offsetting the charge was income associated with CLL and Real Estate. This charge was included in the total $23 billion GE Capital estimated exit impact that we communicated in April, but earlier than we originally planned based on accelerated sales activity. As Jeff said, we have a strong performance on cash with CFOA for the half up $3.9 billion or 17%. Industrial CFOA was $3.5 billion at the half, which was up 79%. In the first quarter, we had $450 million of GE Capital dividends and we did not receive a dividend from GE Capital in the second quarter. The consolidated tax rate from the quarter was 27%. The GE rate was 21%, in line with guidance we have provided. The GE Capital reported rate was 45%, driven by tax charges associated with the exit plan and the vertical tax rate in the quarter was 6%. 
On the right side, you can see the segment results. As I mentioned earlier, Industrial segment revenues were flat on a reported basis, but up 5% organically, reflecting 5 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was $1.3 billion drag on Industrial segment revenue and about a $215 million impact on Industrial segment's op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 5% and organically, the industrial segments were up 11%. GE Capital vertical earnings of $531 million in the quarter were up 19%. 
Before we get into the traditional pages, I wanted to first walk the different elements of our earnings for the course of the dynamics clear given all the moving pieces of GE Capital. Starting with the first column on the left and working down, Industrial operating income was $2.6 billion and Vertical income was $0.5 billion for total Industrial plus Vertical's operating earnings of $3.2 billion. The GE Capital Consumer segment earned $459 million during the quarter, which is comprised of $463 million for Synchrony, offset by our nonstrategic global consumer portfolio. We incurred $772 million of cost driven by exit related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter runoff operating expenses, excess interest and preferred dividends in the quarter. As a result, total operating earnings were $2.8 billion. Including non-operating pension cost, continuing earnings were $2.4 billion. In discontinued operations, you can see the $4.3 billion held-for-sale charge for CLL as well as the impact of CLL Real Estate earnings in the quarter. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were negative $1.4 billion. 
In the center of far right column, you can see the associated EPS impact and the variance versus prior year. 
Next, on Industrial other items in the quarter. We had $0.03 of charges related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to drive the cost competitiveness of the company. Charges were about $400 million on a pretax basis and $280 million after-tax. About 40% of that related to restructuring Oil & Gas as we continue to execute on an aggressive cost out program in that business. We also had $0.03 of gains in the quarter, primarily related to the NBC new settlement that we disclosed in June. We also had a small gain related to a disposition in Oil & Gas. Both of these transactions were both in corporate. On a pretax basis, gains and settlements totaled about $500 million, but given the high tax rate on these transaction, the after-tax impact was $295 million in the quarter. As you're aware, we're expecting gains in the second half from the Appliances and Signaling transactions. We expect gains and restructuring to be balance on an EPS basis of for the year. We have increased our expected restructuring from about $0.09 to about $0.12 due to the hurricanes we expect in the year and additional attractive restructuring opportunities we see. 
Now I'll go through the segments starting with Power & Water. Orders of $7.8 billion were up 22% in the quarter, up 27% ex foreign exchange. Equipment orders were higher by 29% with Distributed Power up 68%, Thermal was up 25% and Renewables higher by 24%. Distributable Power was driven by domestic orders for LMS 100 units with 2 customers. Reciprocating engines for gas compression remained weak and were lowered by 37%. In Thermal, we bought 18 gas turbines versus 10 last year, including an H turbine in Korea. This brings our H units to 17 in backlog and an additional 44 technical winds. Renewables orders totaled 888 wind turbines versus 715 a year ago. Our 2 new MPI products of 2.0 and 2.3-megawatt platforms received additional orders for 200 units in the second quarter of this year. We also launched a Digital Wind Farm software solution featuring new 2-megawatt modular turbine connected to the Industrial Internet and built on our Predix platform. This application will drive up to 20% more annual energy production for our customers. Service orders were up 17% on strong PGS growth in Evian and the Middle East, North Africa, and AGP orders were 39 versus 19 last year. Revenues in the quarter were higher by 8%. Revenues were higher by 15% organically. Equipment revenues were up 10% driven by renewables up 53% on shipments of 806 wind turbines versus 510 last year, partially offset by Distributed Power down 20% on lower turbine and engine shipments, and Thermal down 3%. We shipped 24 gas turbines, 3 higher than the second quarter of last year, but with reduced scope and a mix of more 7Fs than 9Fs [ph]. Service revenues were up 6% with PGS up 9% on higher installations, strong upgrades, including AGP sales of 26 versus 19 last year. Operating profit in the quarter was up 8% reported and up 14% organically. Growth was driven by volume, price and base cost productivity more than offsetting H turbine ramp cost negative mix driven by Wind and Distributed Power and foreign exchange. Operating margins in the quarter were flat at 18%. 
The framework for Power & Water remains intact. We expect 100 to 105 gas turbine orders and shipments, 3,000 to 3200 wind shipments and AGP upgrades of 90 to 100. Distributed Power we think will remain challenging for the year. 
Next, on Oil & Gas, the business performed as we expected in the second quarter on orders and revenue. It performed slightly better than we expected on operating profit. I'll start with orders. 
Orders were down 20% reported and down 11% organically. Equipment orders were down 14% and flat organically. Turbomachinery was higher by 40% driven by new LNG orders and downstream was higher by 53% from strength in sub-Saharan African and Middle East. The strength in Turbomachinery and downstream were offset by Subsea, which was down 48% on tough comparisons and Service was down 31% on weak North American demand. Service orders in the quarter were down 26% and down 20% organically. Turbomachinery in Subsea were down 36% and 30%, respectively. M&C was down 22%, principally driven by the Wind disposition and the software market. Downstream was up 23%. Revenues of just under $4.1 billion were down 15% reported and down 4% organically driven by foreign exchange and the Wind disposition. Equipment revenues were down 20% reported, down 8% organically, principally driven by Turbomachinery down 20% or 7% organically and Service down 24%. M&C was stronger by 10% organically and Service revenues were down 9%, but up 1% organically. Operating profit was down 12% to $583 million in the quarter, but was up 5% versus last year organically. Foreign exchange translation was $115 million headwind in the quarter. Margins grew 40 basis points and were up 140 basis points organically. The business executed well delivering our manufacturing productivity positive value gap and executed structure. Through the first half, Oil & Gas revenues were down 12% reported and down 2% organically. Operating profit was down 9% reported, but was up 8% organically. Margins improved 40 basis points reported and 120 basis points organically for the half. The business seems ahead of their plan to take out $600 million of cost this year. The framework we laid out for you at EPG of operating profit down 5% to 10% reported and down 0% to 5% organically is unchanged. 
Next up is Aviation. Global air travel continues to grow robustly. Passenger traffic grew 6.3% year-to-date through May with strength in both domestic and international travel. Most regions saw strength. And airfreight volumes grew 4% year-to-date. Aviation had very strong orders performance in the second quarter with $7.6 billion of orders up 30%. Equipment orders grew 37% to $4 billion driven by commercial engine orders growth of 71%. GE90 and NYNEX orders of $2 billion were higher by 12x with key orders from United Gurion a Eric Carter and a NA. G&A orders were higher by 3x. Commercial engine backlog grew 43% in the quarter to $29 billion. Military equipment orders were down 31%, more or less as expected. Service orders were up 23% with commercial spares up strongly at 33% or $37.9 million a day and military service orders were up 73%. Services backlog ended in $107 billion, up 7%. Revenues in the quarter of $6.3 billion were up 3% with commercial equipment higher by 7%. The business shipped 86 GEnx engines versus 75 a year ago, which includes 15 units delayed from the first quarter. Military equipment was lower by 12%. Service revenue was up 6% and commercial spare parts higher by 30% and military was higher by 15%. That was partially offset by lower commercial prime and material shop business. Operating profit was 6% higher than the second quarter of '14 driven by strong value gap and base cost productivity. Margins expanded 60 basis points in the quarter. The Aviation team continues to deliver operationally and Wind commercially as of they execute multiple new product introduction. At this year's of Paris Air Show, we announced $19 billion of orders and commitment. LEAP testing and performance remains on track and the first LEAP installed engines will go into service in the mid-2016. 
On Healthcare. Orders up $4.7 billion were down 3%, but up 4% organically. Orders in the U.S. grew 3%. Europe was down 13%, but up 7% organically. And Japan was up 12% organically with Africa higher by 40%. Offsetting these strong organic results was the Middle East down 6% driven by Saudi and China down 7% on continued slow public. In terms of business line, Healthcare Systems orders were down 3% reported, but up 3% organically. U.S. imaging and ultrasound were up strongly at 8% with MRI higher by 17% and ultrasound up 7%. Japan was up 1% and up 19% ex the impact of the yen. Africa was up 42% on a large municipal health deal in Kenya and China was soft. It was down 9% in the quarter. Life Science orders were down 2% reported, but up 7% organic with bio process continuing to grow up 13% organically. Revenues in the quarter were down 3%, up 3% organically. Healthcare Systems revenues were up 3% organic and Life Sciences grew 8% organically. Operating profit was down 3% reported, but up 2% ex foreign exchange. Volume growth and productivity was partially offset by foreign exchange and price. Margin rates were flat in the quarter. Though the U.S. market continues to grow, Europe appears stable. We believe we continue to take share in most of the markets we operate in. China remains a challenge with slow tenders, but we do not think there's an underlying demand problem. We really like the outlook in the growth trajectory for the bioprocess business within Life Science. 
Next up is Transportation. Rail volumes were down 1.8% in the second quarter with carloads down 7% driven by coal petroleum and agriculture, and that was partially offset by a 4.4% increase in intermodal traffic. Rail volumes for the half were essentially flat with last year. Transportation orders were down 5% in the quarter driven by lower equipment orders, down 19%, partly offset by 6% growth in services. Locomotive orders in North America were lower by 99 units partly offset by strong international orders. Service strength was driven by $115 million order for movement planner and our solutions software business and very good spare parts demand. Backlog grew 32% year-over-year to $21 billion. Revenues were up 9%, principally driven by equipment growth of 13% and Service is higher by 6%. We shipped 191 locomotives in the quarter versus 165 in the second quarter of 2014. Operating profit was up strongly at 23% driven by higher locomotive and parts volume, strong productivity, partly offset by mining mix and Tier 4 ramp [ph] costs. Margins improved in the quarter 260 basis points versus last year. We currently have 18 preproduction Tier 4 units and revenue service with customers and we will begin shipping our first production units this month. The launch remains on track. In energy management, orders were $2 billion in the quarter, up 5%. Orders were higher by 13%, including the effects of FX. The business saw strength in Power Conversion higher by 33%, partly offset by Digital Energy down 5% and Industrial Solutions down 6%, but roughly flat organically. Strength in Power Conversion is driven by higher penetration of Renewables market where the business has grown each year of 50% in the last year. This was partially offset by weakness in Oil & Gas related Marines space. Backlog grew 10% to $5.5 billion in the quarter. Revenues of $1.8 billion were down 5%, but up 4% organically. Organically, Power Conversion was higher by 13%, Digital Energy up 2% and Industrial System was down 2%. Operating profit was up 19% versus last year and up 40% organically. Growth was driven by strong productivity, more than offsetting foreign exchange. Margins improved 90 basis points in the second quarter. Through the first half, energy management operating management was up 49% reported and up 96% organically. 
Finally, with Appliances & Lighting. Revenue was up 5% in the quarter with Appliances up 7% on strong volume and lighting was up 2%. The U.S. Appliance industry units were higher by 6% with retail up 5% and contract up 12% on robust housing starts. And lighting revenue growth was driven by LED, which was up 77%, partially offset by a 17% decline in traditional products. LED now accounts for 36% of lighting revenue, up 15 points from last year. We believe we're on track for approximately $1 billion of LED revenue in 2015. Operating profit was higher by 62% in the second quarter driven by higher volumes and strong productivity. Since has been reported, the U.S. Antitrust Authorities have filed suit to challenge the sale of GE Appliances to Electrolux and we plan to vigorously defend the transaction in court. We expect the trial to begin in the fourth quarter and our goal remains to close this deal this year.
We are confident that transaction is good for customers and consumers and that acquiring that GE Appliances brand will help Electrolux compete in an increasingly global and intensely competitive industry. 
And finally, I'll cover GE Capital. As I discussed earlier, our vertical businesses earned $531 million this quarter, up 19% from prior year on strong performances across Aviation, Energy and Healthcare. Portfolio of quality is stable and GECAS finished the quarter with only 1 aircraft on the ground. The verticals generated $2.2 billion of volume in the quarter, up 4% and 80% of the GECAS volume and commitments were powered by GE CFM equipment. Energy finance arranged deals of the quarter that will fund over 180 GE wind turbines. 
Working down the page, Consumer earned $459 million during the quarter, down 3% driven by Synchrony's minority interest. Our share of the Synchrony earnings was $463 million. In the quarter, the Synchrony team filed for separation with the Federal Reserve and we continue to target year-end subject to regulatory approvals. As in prior quarters, CEO Margaret Keane will host Synchrony's earnings call later today. Corporate generated $772 million charge in the quarter, driven by exit related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter runoff operating expenses, excess interest and our preferred dividend of $160 million in the quarter. Discontinued operations ended the quarter with a $3.7 billion loss. Results were driven by our commercial lending and leasing business as the majority of that business was moved to discontinued operations in the second quarter as you would've seen from our 8-K published in early July. As part of our accelerating our timeline, we recognized $4.3 billion held-for-sale loss, which includes the write-off of $8 billion of goodwill. This charge is included in the $23 billion total cost construct we shared with you in April. On an economic basis, we expect the CLO portfolios to generate a gain versus our tangible equity. Other earnings from discontinued operations were $582 million for the quarter and are primarily driven by CLL operations. Overall, GE Capital reported a $3.5 billion loss and we ended the quarter with $179 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. That's down $124 billion from the prior quarter. Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter at $85 billion, including $14 billion attributable to Synchrony and our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 11.4%. That's up 80 basis points from the first quarter. We expect this ratio to continue to improve as we dispose the risk weighted assets. 
In terms of portfolio sales, the team continue to make good progress. During the quarter, we signed deals representing approximately $23 billion of ENI, bringing our year-to-date total to $68 billion. There continues to be strong interest in our portfolios and we have $80 billion of additional ENI in the market currently. By year-end, we are on track to close approximately $100 billion and sign between $120 million and $150 billion in total. We expect to be largely complete with our exit plan by year-end 2016, a year earlier than our original plan that we shared with you in April. 
At the bottom of the page is the 2015 dividend matrix we shared with you on April 10 when we announced the GE Capital exit. We are operating the business through the process and at 14% Tier 1 common. As I discussed earlier, we ended the quarter 11.4% Tier 1 common. We expect to improve the ratio to 14% or better by year-end as we close $100 billion of estimated deals. Overall, key to GE Capital team delivered strong personal quarter and remained focused on delivering on the portfolio of transformation. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We're increasing the low end of the range with new expectations of $1.13 to $1.20. So far this year, organic growth and margin expansion are trending towards the higher level of expectations and we expect this to continue. We're still planning for our transactions to close by the end of the year. The verticals will remain on track for $0.15 EPS and the accounting around capital exits are consistent with our plan. We think it's slightly that the Synchrony's split occurs this year. GE Capital asset sales closings are tracking towards a $100 billion of ENI and we expect signings in excess of that number. Free cash flow is on track for $12 billion to $15 billion and we're hoping to expand the GE Capital dividend based on faster asset sales. And just for perspective, Appliances represents about $2 billion of the disposition cash. 
We [indiscernible] a range of $10 billion to $30 billion of cash return to investors. Our capital allocation plan is on track. And if Synchrony occurs this year, we will be at the high end of this range. 
So the GE team is executing despite managing a substantial portfolio pivot, our operating execution remains excellent. We're gaining momentum towards our long-term goals and going forward, we can give investors strong industrial EPS growth while returning significant cash through dividends and buybacks. And we've created a premier industry company well positioned to win in this environment. 
So, Matt, let's take some questions."

Part of that is the higher G&A shipments and it's also a function of higher Wind shipments and lower Distributed Power quarter-to-quarter. So that's what happened on the mix line. Value gap got substantially better. Value gap in the second quarter was about $193 million. It's $221 million for the half. So up substantially from $28 million of value gap in the first quarter and we can deliver cost productivity on product and service. And so the second quarter we have 50 basis points of margin improvement in the gross margin line and then 70 in our profits. So the net of simplification and other inflation added 10 basis points below gross margins. So that gave us first half of 70 basis points improvement in the gross margin line and 100 in all profit.

And I guess specifically thinking about the quarter, it sounds like only about 40% of the restructuring spend is actions that might have some kind of payback as opposed to mortality and other kind of loose ends cleanup. Is that correct and how do we think about that going forward?"

So we think we have a number of opportunities to increase the amount of restructuring to get ourselves positioned for '16 and beyond particularly around competitiveness. As I said earlier, if for some reason we didn't close Appliances, we may take a harder look at that. Of the restructuring we spent in the quarter, about $140 million of that was in Oil & Gas and we see very good paybacks around that. All the projects we're working on today are all inside the 1.5 year payback kind of benchmark that we shared with you over time. The nature of the restructuring has changed pretty dramatically though. There's about less than 1/3 of what we're doing today is SG&A related and more like 70%, 75% of it is product and services as we really focus on gross margins product and service cost competitiveness. I think we're on track to invest at very good returns in restructuring this year. And they are critical to delivering not only the year but setting us up to deliver on 2016 and beyond."

The team had a strong quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. We're executing both organic growth and cost initiatives. Specifically, Industrial EPS grew by 18% and earnings at the -- a combination of Industrial and the capital verticals, which is the way we think about GE going forward, grew by 19%. Organic growth and earnings performance was very strong. Orders were up 13%, revenue was up 5% and profit would've grown by 11% organically. Operations were strong. Margins expanded by 70 basis points with gross margins up 60 basis points, and Industrial CFOA grew by 79%. Our Oil & Gas business met expectations for the quarter for orders, revenue and profit. Organic profit was up 5% and we continue to grow margins despite a tougher environment. 
We end the half with our goals on track. Meanwhile, we have a number of portfolio actions underway. GE Capital asset sales were robust and we will achieve $100 billion of deals closed in 2015. We still expect the Synchrony split to take place by the end of this year. Appliances and Alstom are in the middle of regulatory reviews, but we still expect both deals to close by the end of the year. We remain committed to doing good deals for investors. In all, we're confident enough in our performance to raise the low end of our range for Industrial guidance to $1.13 to $1.20 EPS. So overall, we had a very good quarter. 
Orders were very strong, up 8% or 13% organically. We saw solid growth in both equipment and service. Orders pricing was up slightly and we grew backlog to a record $272 billion. Power & Water was up 22% behind strength in Power Gen Products and Wind. We now have won 61 technical selections for the H turbine, up 8 in the quarter. Oil & Gas had solid equipment orders in turbomachinery and downstream, consistent with expectations. Power Conversion orders grew by 33% as we're winning big in renewable energy markets. Aviation had large orders growth in LEAP and GEnx, and meanwhile, spares order rates grew by 33%. Healthcare HCS equipment orders grew by 6% in the U.S. as that market continues to rebound. The U.S. was particularly strong, but we also saw growth in many parts of the world. The U.S. was up 10%; Europe, up 4%; and growth markets, up 2%. First half Industrial Internet orders were 1.9 billion, up 83%; and we expect total software and solution orders for the year of $6 billion, up 30%. Service growth was robust at 7%, ex FX, and backlog reached $200 billion for the first time. Our strong backlog in orders position GE to achieve our long-term organic growth targets of 5%. 
Organic revenue was up 5%. Growth was broad-based with 6 or 7 segments up. Our real highlight was the $19 billion of commitments at the Paris Air Show. For the first half, U.S. revenue grew by 3% and 4 of 9 growth markets were up, and China grew by 12%. We had some excellent performances in service. Power Gen Service was up 9%, Aviation Service was up 6% and Transportation service was up 6%. We're gaining share in Healthcare with U.S. Healthcare HCS equipment revenue growing 16%. We closed a big Healthcare deal in Kenya worth more than $200 million, and international locals [ph] grew by 128% with big wins in Brazil and South Africa. 
A few adjacencies were particularly strong. Wind grew by 49% and LEDs grew by 77%. And our Power Conversion business is innovating in solar and wind energy, recording $300 million in orders in those markets alone. We have a strong pipeline of products and services that are winning versus competition. And we're having success in software and analytics. We launched GE's Digital Wind Farm, providing customers with up to 20% more capacity. We announced a major collaboration with BP for asset monitoring in Oil & Gas, and we closed another Class 1 railroad that will utilize GE's Movement Planner in a deal worth more than $100 million. 
Margins expanded with 70 basis points of growth. Gross margins were up 60 basis points with strength in value gap and productivity. We're making progress broadly with 5 or 7 segments having margin growth. Simplification continues to deliver results and our SG&A targets are on track. 
First half margins were up 100 basis points and service margins were particularly strong, up 130 basis points year-to-date as the impact of our analytical tools are being felt. Equipment margins, meanwhile, were up 30 basis points year-to-date. So we're running the company well. 
Cash is a good story. Industrial CFOA is up 79% year-to-date and free cash flow is up 54%. We'll not receive a capital dividend in the quarter but we're hopeful to get an additional dividend to the parent in the year. As we said, our assets sales are ahead of plan and GE Capital has substantial strength to remain safe and secure. We expect to complete the Synchrony split by the end of '15. And at the current stock price, our share of Synchrony is worth about $24 billion. 
The balance sheet is very strong with $70 billion of cash at the parent. And our cash generation is on track for the year and we remain committed to our capital allocation plans. 
Now over to Jeff to review the businesses."
177031,291819527,834384,"General Electric Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2015",2015-07-17,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the second quarter summary. We have revenues of $32.8 billion, which were up 2% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, included corporate, were up 1% to $26.9 billion. You can see on the right that the Industrial segments were",3252,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the second quarter summary. We have revenues of $32.8 billion, which were up 2% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, included corporate, were up 1% to $26.9 billion. You can see on the right that the Industrial segments were flat on revenue for the quarter, but up 5% organically. Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.31, which was up 19% year-over-year. That's driven by Industrial, up 18%; and the verticals, up 25%; the operating EPS number of $0.28, as in other continuing GE Capital activity, including the Consumer segment; headquarter runoff and other exit-related items, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. 
Continuing EPS of $0.24 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS of negative $0.13 includes the impact of discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact in the quarter was negative $3.7 billion, which included a $4.3 billion noncash charge related to moving the majority of our GE Capital CLL business to held for sale. We disclosed this earlier in the month. Partly offsetting the charge was income associated with CLL and Real Estate. This charge was included in the total $23 billion GE Capital estimated exit impact that we communicated in April, but earlier than we originally planned based on accelerated sales activity. 
As Jeff said, we had a strong performance on cash with CFOA for the half, up $3.9 billion or 17%. Industrial CFOA was $3.5 billion at the half, which was up 79%. In the first quarter, we had $450 million of GE Capital dividends and we did not receive a dividend from GE Capital in the second quarter. 
The consolidated tax rate for the quarter was 27%. The GE rate was 21%, in line with guidance we provided. The GE Capital reported rate was 45%, driven by tax charges associated with the exit plan. And the vertical tax rate in the quarter was 6%. 
On the right side, you can see the segment results. As I mentioned earlier, Industrial segment revenues were flat on a reported basis, but up 5% organically, reflecting 5 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was $1.3 billion drag on Industrial segment revenue and about a $215 million impact on Industrial segment's op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 5% and organically, the Industrial segments were up 11%. GE Capital vertical earnings of $531 million in the quarter were up 19%. 
Before we get into the traditional pages, I wanted to first walk the different elements of our earnings for the quarter so the dynamics are clear given all the moving pieces of GE Capital. Starting with the first column on the left and working down. Industrial operating income was $2.6 billion and vertical income was $0.5 billion, for a total Industrial plus verticals operating earnings of $3.2 billion. The GE Capital Consumer segment earned $459 million during the quarter, which is comprised of $463 million for Synchrony, offset by our nonstrategic global Consumer portfolio. We incurred $772 million of cost driven by exit-related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter runoff operating expenses, excess interest and preferred dividends in the quarter. As a result, total operating earnings were $2.8 billion. Including nonoperating pension costs, continuing earnings were $2.4 billion. In discontinued operations, you can see the $4.3 billion held-for-sale charge for CLL as well as the impact of CLL Real Estate earnings in the quarter. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were negative $1.4 billion. In the center and far right columns, you can see the associated EPS impacts and the variance versus prior year. 
Next, on Industrial other items in the quarter. We had $0.03 of charges related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to drive the cost competitiveness of the company. Charges were about $400 million on a pretax basis and $280 million after tax. About 40% of that related to restructuring Oil & Gas as we continue to execute on an aggressive cost-out program in that business. We also had $0.03 of gains in the quarter, primarily related to the NBCU settlement that we disclosed in June. We also had a small gain related to a disposition in Oil & Gas. Both of these transactions were booked in corporate. On a pretax basis, gains and settlements totaled about $500 million, but given the high tax rate on these transaction, the after-tax impact was $295 million in the quarter. As you're aware, we're expecting gains in the second half from the Appliances and signaling transactions. We expect gains and restructuring to be balance on an EPS basis for the year. We have increased our expected restructuring from about $0.09 to about $0.12 due to the higher gains we expect in the year and additional attractive restructuring opportunities we see. 
Now I'll go through the segments, starting with Power & Water. Orders of $7.8 billion were up 22% in the quarter, up 27% ex foreign exchange. Equipment orders were higher by 29% with Distributed Power, up 68%; Thermal was up 25%; and Renewables, higher by 24%. Distributed Power was driven by domestic orders for LMS100 units from 2 customers. Reciprocating engines for gas compression remain weak and were lower by 37%. In Thermal, we booked 18 gas turbines versus 10 last year, including an H turbine in Korea. This brings our H units to 17 in backlog and an additional 44 technical wins. Renewables orders totaled 888 wind turbines versus 715 a year ago. Our 2 new NPI products of 2.0 and the 2.3-megawatt platforms received additional orders for 200 units in the second quarter of this year. We also launched the Digital Wind Farm software solution featuring a new 2-megawatt modular turbine connected to the Industrial Internet and built on our Predix platform. This application will drive up to 20% more annual energy production for our customers. 
Service orders were up 17% on strong PGS growth in Avian [ph] in the Middle East, North Africa. And AGP orders were 39 versus 19 last year. 
Revenues in the quarter were higher by 8%. Revenues were higher by 15% organically. Equipment revenues were up 10%, driven by renewables, up 53% on shipments of 806 wind turbines versus 510 last year, partially offset by Distributed Power, down 20% on lower turbine and engine shipments; and Thermal, down 3%. We shipped 24 gas turbines, 3 higher than the second quarter of last year, but with reduced scope and a mix of more 7Fs than 9Fs. Service revenues were up 6%, with PGS, up 9% on higher installations, strong upgrades, including AGP sales of 26 versus 19 last year. 
Operating profit in the quarter was up 8% reported and up 14% organically. Growth was driven by volume, price and base cost productivity more than offsetting H turbine ramp cost; negative mix, driven by Wind and Distributed Power; and foreign exchange. Operating margins in the quarter were flat at 18%. 
The framework for Power & Water remains intact. We expect 100 to 105 gas turbine orders and shipment, 3,000 to 3,200 Wind shipments and AGP upgrades of 90 to 100. Distributed Power, we think will remain challenging for the year. 
Next, on Oil & Gas. The business performed as we expected in the second quarter on orders and revenue and performed slightly better than we expected on operating profit. I'll start with orders. 
Orders were down 20% reported and down 11% organically. Equipment orders were down 14% and flat organically. Turbomachinery was higher by 40%, driven by new LNG orders; and downstream was higher by 53% from strength in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. The strength in turbomachinery and downstream were offset by Subsea, which was down 48% on tough comparisons and surface was down 31% on weak North American demand. Service orders in the quarter were down 26% and down 20%, organically. Turbomachinery and Subsea were down 36% and 30%, respectively. M&C was down 22%, principally driven by the Wayne disposition and a softer market. Downstream was up 23%. Revenues of just under $4.1 billion were down 15% reported and down 4% organically, driven by foreign exchange and the Wayne disposition. Equipment revenues were down 20% reported, down 8% organically, principally driven by turbomachinery, down 20% or 7% organically; and surface, down 24%. M&C was stronger by 10% organically and service revenues were down 9%, but up 1% organically. Operating profit was down 12% to $583 million in the quarter, but was up 5% versus last year organically. Foreign exchange translation was a $115 million headwind in the quarter. Margins grew 40 basis points and were up 140 basis points organically. The business executed well delivering a manufacturing productivity positive value gap and [indiscernible]. Through the first half, Oil & Gas revenues were down 12% reported and down 2% organically. Operating profit was down 9% reported but was up 8% organically. Margins improved 40 basis points reported and 120 basis points organically for the half. The business seems ahead of their plan to take out $600 million of cost this year. The framework we laid out for you at EPG of operating profit, down 5% to 10% reported and down 0% to 5% organically, is unchanged. 
Next up is Aviation. Global air travel continues to grow robustly. Passenger traffic grew 6.3% year-to-date through May with strength in both domestic and international travel. Most regions saw strength. And airfreight volumes grew 4% year-to-date. Aviation had very strong orders performance in the second quarter with $7.6 billion of orders, up 30%. Equipment orders grew 37% to $4 billion, driven by commercial engine orders growth of 71%. GE90 and 9X orders of $2 billion were higher by 12x with key orders from United, Korean Air, Cutter and ANA. GEnx orders were higher by 3x. Commercial engine backlog grew 43% in the quarter to $29 billion. Military equipment orders were down 31%, more or less as expected. Service orders were up 23% with commercial spares up strongly at 33% or $37.9 million a day, and military service orders were up 73%. Services backlog ended in $107 billion, up 7%. Revenues in the quarter of $6.3 billion were up 3% with commercial equipment higher by 7%. The business shipped 86 GEnx engines versus 75 a year ago, which includes 15 units delayed from the first quarter. Military equipment was lower by 12%. Service revenue was up 6%, and commercial spare parts higher by 30% and military was higher by 15%. That was partially offset by lower commercial time and material shop visits. Operating profit was 6% higher than the second quarter of '14, driven by strong value gap and base cost productivity. Margins expanded 60 basis points in the quarter. 
The Aviation team continues to deliver operationally and win commercially as they execute on multiple new product introductions. At this year's Paris Air Show, we announced $19 billion of orders and commitment. LEAP testing and performance remains on track and the first LEAP installed engines will go into service in mid-2016. 
On Healthcare. Orders of $4.7 billion were down 3%, but up 4% organically. Orders in the U.S. grew 3%. Europe was down 13%, but up 7% organically. And Japan was up 12% organically, with Africa higher by 40%. Offsetting these strong organic results was the Middle East, down 6%, driven by Saudi; and China, down 7% on continued slow public tenders. In terms of business line, Healthcare Systems orders were down 3% reported, but up 3% organically. U.S. imaging and ultrasound were up strongly at 8%, with MRI higher by 17% and ultrasound, up 7%. Japan was up 1% and up 19% ex the impact of the yen. Africa was up 42% on a large Ministry of Health deal in Kenya, and China was soft. It was down 9% in the quarter. Life Science orders were down 2% reported, but up 7% organic, with bioprocess continuing to grow up 13% organically. Revenues in the quarter were down 3%, up 3% organically. Healthcare Systems revenues were up 3% organic and Life Sciences grew 8% organic. Operating profit was down 3% reported, but up 2% ex foreign exchange. Volume growth and productivity was partially offset by foreign exchange and price. Margin rates were flat in the quarter. 
Though the U.S. market continues to grow, Europe appears stable. We believe we continue to take share in most of the markets we operate in. China remains a challenge with slow tenders, but we do not think there's an underlying demand problem. We really like the outlook and the growth trajectory for the bioprocess business within Life Science. 
Next up is Transportation. Rail volumes were down 1.8% in the second quarter with carloads, down 7%, driven by coal, petroleum and agriculture. And that was partially offset by a 4.4% increase in intermodal traffic. Rail volumes for the half were essentially flat with last year. Transportation orders were down 5% in the quarter, driven by lower equipment orders, down 19%, partly offset by 6% growth in services. Locomotive orders in North America were lower by 99 units, partly offset by strong international orders. Service strength was driven by $115 million order for Movement Planner and our solutions software business and very good spare parts demand. Backlog grew 32% year-over-year to $21 billion. Revenues were up 9%, principally driven by equipment growth of 13%, and service is higher by 6%. We shipped 191 locomotives in the quarter versus 165 in the second quarter of 2014. Operating profit was up strongly at 23%, driven by higher locomotive and parts volume, strong productivity, partly offset by mining mix and Tier 4 ramp costs. Margins improved in the quarter, 260 basis points versus last year. We currently have 18 preproduction Tier 4 units in revenue service with customers, and we will begin shipping our first production units this month. The launch remains on track. 
In Energy Management, orders were $2 billion in the quarter, up 5%. Orders were higher by 13%, excluding the effects of FX. The business saw strength in Power Conversion, higher by 33%; partly offset by Digital Energy, down 5%; and Industrial Solutions, down 6%; but roughly flat organically. Strength in Power Conversion was driven by higher penetration of renewables market where the business has grown each year, 50% in the last year. This was partially offset by weakness in oil and gas-related marine space. Backlog grew 10% to $5.5 billion in the quarter. Revenues of $1.8 billion were down 5%, but up 4% organically. Organically, Power Conversion was higher by 13%; Digital Energy, up 2%; and Industrial System was down 2%. Operating profit was up 19% versus last year and up 40% organically. Growth was driven by strong productivity more than offsetting foreign exchange. Margins improved 90 basis points in the second quarter. Through the first half, Energy Management operating profit is up 49% reported and up 96% organically. 
Finally, with Appliances & Lighting. Revenue was up 5% in the quarter with Appliances, up 7% on strong volume, and Lighting was up 2%. The U.S. appliance industry units were higher by 6% with retail, up 5%, and contract, up 12% on robust housing starts. And Lighting revenue growth was driven by LED, which was up 77%, partially offset by a 17% decline in traditional products. LED now accounts for 36% of Lighting revenue, up 15 points from last year. We believe we're on track for approximately $1 billion of LED revenue in 2015. Operating profit was higher by 62% in the second quarter, driven by higher volumes and strong productivity. 
As has been reported the, U.S. antitrust authorities have filed suit to challenge the sale of GE Appliances to Electrolux, and we plan to vigorously defend the transaction in court. We expect the trial to begin in the fourth quarter, and our goal remains to close this deal this year. We are confident that transaction is good for customers and consumers and that acquiring the GE Appliances brand would help Electrolux compete in an increasingly global and intensely competitive industry. 
And finally, I'll cover GE Capital. As I discussed earlier, our vertical businesses earned $531 million this quarter, up 19% from prior year on strong performances across Aviation, Energy and Healthcare. Portfolio quality is stable and GECAS finished the quarter with only 1 aircraft on the ground. The verticals generated $2.2 billion of volume in the quarter, up 4%. And 80% of the GECAS volume and commitments were powered by GE CFM equipment. Energy finance arranged deals in the quarter that will fund over 180 GE wind turbines. 
Working down the page, Consumer earned $459 million during the quarter, down 3%, driven by Synchrony's minority interest. Our share of the Synchrony earnings was $463 million. In the quarter, the Synchrony team filed for separation with the Federal Reserve and we continue to target year-end subject to regulatory approval. As in prior quarters, CEO Margaret Keane will host Synchrony's earnings call later today. Corporate generated a $772 million charge in the quarter, driven by exit-related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter runoff operating expenses, excess interest and our preferred dividend of $160 million in the quarter. Discontinued operations ended the quarter with a $3.7 billion loss. Results were driven by our commercial lending and leasing business as the majority of that business was moved to discontinued operations in the second quarter as you will have seen from our 8-K published in early July. As part of accelerating our time line, we recognized $4.3 billion held-for-sale loss, which includes the write off of $8 billion of goodwill. This charge is included in the $23 billion total cost construct we shared with you in April. On an economic basis, we expect the CLO portfolios to generate a gain versus our tangible equity. Other earnings from discontinued operations were $582 million for the quarter and are primarily driven by CLL operations. Overall, GE Capital reported a $3.5 billion loss and we ended the quarter with $179 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. That's down $124 billion from the prior quarter. Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter at $85 billion, including $14 billion attributable to Synchrony, and our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 11.4%. That's up 80 basis points from the first quarter. We expect this ratio to continue to improve as we dispose of risk-weighted assets. 
In terms of portfolio sales, the team continues to make good progress. During the quarter, we signed deals representing approximately $23 billion of ENI, bringing our year-to-date total to $68 billion. There continues to be strong interest in our portfolios and we have $80 billion of additional ENI in the market currently. By year-end, we are on track to close approximately $100 billion and sign between $120 million and $150 billion in total. We expect to be largely complete with our exit plan by year-end 2016, a year earlier than our original plan that we shared with you in April. 
At the bottom of the page is the 2015 dividend matrix we shared with you on April 10 when we announced the GE Capital exit. We are operating the business through the process at 14% Tier 1 common. As I discussed earlier, we ended the quarter at 11.4% Tier 1 common. We expect to improve the ratio to 14% or better by year-end as we close $100 billion of estimated deals. Overall, key to the GE Capital team delivered a strong operational quarter and remained focused on delivering on the portfolio of transformation. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We're increasing the low end of the range with new expectations of $1.13 to $1.20. So far this year, organic growth and margin expansion are trending towards the high end of our expectations and we expect this to continue. We're still planning for our transactions to close by the end of the year. The verticals will remain on track for $0.15 EPS and the accounting around capital exits are consistent with our plan. We think it's likely that the Synchrony split occurs this year. 
GE Capital asset sales closings are tracking towards $100 billion of ENI and we expect signings in excess of that number. Free cash flow is on track for $12 billion to $15 billion, and we're hoping to expand the GE Capital dividend based on faster asset sales. And just for perspective, Appliances represents about $2 billion of the disposition cash. 
We've shared a range of $10 billion to $30 billion of cash return to investors. Our capital allocation plan is on track. And if Synchrony occurs this year, we will be at the high end of this range. 
So the GE team is executing. Despite managing a substantial portfolio pivot, our operating execution remains excellent. We're gaining momentum towards our long-term goals and going forward, we can give investors strong Industrial EPS growth while returning significant cash through dividends and buyback. And we've created a premier industrial company, well positioned to win in this environment. 
So Matt, let's take some questions."

As we said in the first quarter, we expected mix to turn around a little bit here in the second quarter and it, in fact, did. And you're correct: part of that is the higher GEnx shipments and it's also a function of higher Wind shipments and lower Distributed Power quarter-to-quarter. So that's what happened on the mix line. Value gap got substantially better. Value gap in the second quarter was about $193 million. It's $221 million for the half. So up substantially from $28 million of value gap in the first quarter, and we continue to deliver cost productivity on product and service. And so the second quarter, we had 60 basis points of margin improvement in the gross margin line and then 70 in op profits. So the net of simplification and other inflation added 10 basis points below gross margins. So that gave us a first half of 70 basis points improvement in the gross margin line and 100 in op profit. So those are really the dynamics. I think mix turned around like we thought it would versus an extremely strong first quarter, and value gap got substantially better."

All the projects we're working on today are all inside of the 1.5 year payback kind of benchmark that we've shared with you over time. The nature of the restructuring has changed pretty dramatically though. There's about less than 1/3 of what we're doing today is SG&A related and more like 70%, 75% of it is product and services.

The team had a strong quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. We're executing both organic growth and cost initiatives. Specifically, Industrial EPS grew by 18% and earnings at the -- a combination of Industrial and the Capital verticals, which is the way we think about GE going forward, grew by 19%. Organic growth and earnings performance was very strong. Orders were up 13%, revenue was up 5% and profit would've grown by 11% organically. Operations were strong. Margins expanded by 70 basis points with gross margins up 60 basis points, and Industrial CFOA grew by 79%. Our Oil & Gas business met expectations for the quarter for orders, revenue and profit. Organic profit was up 5%, and we continue to grow margins despite a tougher environment. 
We end the half with our goals on track. Meanwhile, we have a number of portfolio actions underway. GE Capital asset sales were robust and we will achieve $100 billion of deals closed in 2015. We still expect the Synchrony split to take place by the end of this year. Appliances and Alstom are in the middle of regulatory reviews, but we still expect both deals to close by the end of the year. We remain committed to doing good deals for investors. In all, we're confident enough in our performance to raise the low end of our range for Industrial guidance to $1.13 to $1.20 EPS. So overall, we had a very good quarter. 
Orders were very strong, up 8% or 13% organically. We saw solid growth in both equipment and service. Orders pricing was up slightly and we grew backlog to a record $272 billion. Power & Water was up 22% behind strength in Power Gen Products and Wind. We now have won 61 technical selections for the H turbine, up 8 in the quarter. Oil & Gas had solid equipment orders in turbomachinery and downstream, consistent with expectations. Power Conversion orders grew by 33%, as we're winning big in renewable energy markets. Aviation had large orders growth in LEAP and GEnx, and meanwhile, spares order rates grew by 33%. Healthcare HCS equipment orders grew by 6% in the U.S. as that market continues to rebound. The U.S. was particularly strong, but we also saw growth in many parts of the world. The U.S. was up 10%; Europe, up 4%; and growth markets, up 2%. First half Industrial Internet orders were $1.9 billion, up 83%; and we expect total software and solution orders for the year of $6 billion, up 30%. Service growth was robust at 7%, x FX, and backlog reached $200 billion for the first time. Our strong backlog in orders position GE to achieve our long-term organic growth targets of 5%. 
Organic revenue was up 5%. Growth was broad-based with 6 of 7 segments up. Our real highlight was the $19 billion of commitments at the Paris Air Show. For the first half, U.S. revenue grew by 3% and 4 of 9 growth markets were up, and China grew by 12%. We had some excellent performances in service. Power Gen Service was up 9%, Aviation Service was up 6% and Transportation service was up 6%. We're gaining share in Healthcare with U.S. Healthcare HCS equipment revenue growing 16%. We closed a big Healthcare deal in Kenya worth more than $200 million, and international locos [ph] grew by 128% with big wins in Brazil and South Africa. 
A few adjacencies were particularly strong. Wind grew by 49% and LEDs grew by 77%. And our Power Conversion business is innovating in solar and wind energy, recording $300 million in orders in those markets alone. We have a strong pipeline of products and services that are winning versus competition. And we're having success in software and analytics. We launched GE's Digital Wind Farm, providing customers with up to 20% more capacity. We announced a major collaboration with BP for asset monitoring in Oil & Gas, and we closed another Class 1 railroad that will utilize GE's Movement Planner in a deal worth more than $100 million. 
Margins expanded with 70 basis points of growth. Gross margins were up 60 basis points with strength in value gap and productivity. We're making progress broadly with 5 of 7 segments having margin growth. Simplification continues to deliver results and our SG&A targets are on track. 
First half margins were up 100 basis points and service margins were particularly strong, up 130 basis points year-to-date as the impact of our analytical tools are being felt. Equipment margins, meanwhile, are up 30 basis points year-to-date. So we're running the company well. 
Cash is a good story. Industrial CFOA is up 79% year-to-date and free cash flow is up 54%. We'll not receive a capital dividend in the quarter but we're hopeful to get an additional dividend to the parent in the year. As we said, our assets sales are ahead of plan and GE Capital has substantial strength to remain safe and secure. We expect to complete the Synchrony split by the end of '15. And at the current stock price, our share of Synchrony is worth about $24 billion. 
The balance sheet is very strong with $17 billion of cash at the parent. And our cash generation is on track for the year and we remain committed to our capital allocation plans. 
Now over to Jeff to review the businesses."

You can see on the right that the Industrial segments were",3256,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the second quarter summary. We have revenues of $32.8 billion, which were up 2% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, included corporate, were up 1% to $26.9 billion. You can see on the right that the Industrial segments were flat on revenue for the quarter, but up 5% organically. Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.31, which was up 19% year-over-year. That's driven by Industrial, up 18%; and the verticals, up 25%; the operating EPS number of $0.28, as in other continuing GE Capital activity, including the Consumer segment; headquarter runoff and other exit-related items, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. 
Continuing EPS of $0.24 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS of negative $0.13 includes the impact of discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact in the quarter was negative $3.7 billion, which included a $4.3 billion noncash charge related to moving the majority of our GE Capital CLL business to held for sale. We disclosed this earlier in the month. Partly offsetting the charge was income associated with CLL and Real Estate. This charge was included in the total $23 billion GE Capital estimated exit impact that we communicated in April, but earlier than we originally planned based on accelerated sales activity. 
As Jeff said, we had a strong performance on cash with CFOA for the half up $3.9 billion or 17%. Industrial CFOA was $3.5 billion at the half, which was up 79%. In the first quarter, we had $450 million of GE Capital dividends and we did not receive a dividend from GE Capital in the second quarter. 
The consolidated tax rate for the quarter was 27%. The GE rate was 21%, in line with guidance we provided. The GE Capital reported rate was 45%, driven by tax charges associated with the exit plan. And the vertical tax rate in the quarter was 6%. 
On the right side, you can see the segment results. As I mentioned earlier, Industrial segment revenues were flat on a reported basis, but up 5% organically, reflecting 5 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was a $1.3 billion drag on Industrial segment revenue and about a $215 million impact on Industrial segment's op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 5% and organically, the Industrial segments were up 11%. GE Capital vertical earnings of $531 million in the quarter were up 19%. 
Before we get into the traditional pages, I wanted to first walk the different elements of our earnings for the quarter so the dynamics are clear given all the moving pieces of GE Capital. Starting with the first column on the left and working down. Industrial operating income was $2.6 billion and vertical income was $0.5 billion, for a total Industrial plus verticals operating earnings of $3.2 billion. The GE Capital Consumer segment earned $459 million during the quarter, which is comprised of $463 million for Synchrony, offset by our nonstrategic global Consumer portfolio. We incurred $772 million of cost driven by exit-related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter runoff operating expenses, excess interest and preferred dividends in the quarter. As a result, total operating earnings were $2.8 billion. Including nonoperating pension costs, continuing earnings were $2.4 billion. In discontinued operations, you can see the $4.3 billion held-for-sale charge for CLL as well as the impact of CLL Real Estate earnings in the quarter. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were negative $1.4 billion. In the center and far right columns, you can see the associated EPS impacts and the variance versus prior year. 
Next, on Industrial other items in the quarter. We had $0.03 of charges related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to drive the cost competitiveness of the company. Charges were about $400 million on a pretax basis and $280 million after tax. About 40% of that related to restructuring Oil & Gas as we continue to execute on an aggressive cost-out program in that business. We also had $0.03 of gains in the quarter, primarily related to the NBCU settlement that we disclosed in June. We also had a small gain related to a disposition in Oil & Gas. Both of these transactions were booked in corporate. On a pretax basis, gains and settlements totaled about $500 million, but given the high tax rate on these transactions, the after-tax impact was $295 million in the quarter. As you're aware, we're expecting gains in the second half from the Appliances and signaling transactions. We expect gains and restructuring to be balanced on an EPS basis for the year. We have increased our expected restructuring from about $0.09 to about $0.12 due to the higher gains we expect in the year and additional attractive restructuring opportunities we see. 
Now I'll go through the segments, starting with Power & Water. Orders of $7.8 billion were up 22% in the quarter, up 27% x foreign exchange. Equipment orders were higher by 29%, with Distributed Power, up 68%; Thermal was up 25%; and Renewables, higher by 24%. Distributed Power was driven by domestic orders for LMS100 units from 2 customers. Reciprocating engines for gas compression remain weak and were lower by 37%. In Thermal, we booked 18 gas turbines versus 10 last year, including an H turbine in Korea. This brings our H units to 17 in backlog and an additional 44 technical wins. Renewables orders totaled 888 wind turbines versus 715 a year ago. Our 2 new NPI products, the 2.0 and the 2.3-megawatt platforms, received additional orders for 200 units in the second quarter of this year. We also launched the Digital Wind Farm software solution featuring a new 2-megawatt modular turbine connected to the Industrial Internet and built on our Predix platform. This application will drive up to 20% more annual energy production for our customers. 
Service orders were up 17% on strong PGS growth in Avion [ph] in the Middle East, North Africa. And AGP orders were 39 versus 19 last year. 
Revenues in the quarter were higher by 8%. Revenues were higher by 15% organically. Equipment revenues were up 10%, driven by renewables, up 53% on shipments of 806 wind turbines versus 510 last year, partially offset by Distributed Power, down 20% on lower turbine and engine shipments, and Thermal, down 3%. We shipped 24 gas turbines, 3 higher than the second quarter of last year, but with reduced scope and a mix of more 7Fs than 9Fs. Service revenues were up 6%, with PGS up 9% on higher installations, strong upgrades, including AGP sales of 26 versus 19 last year. 
Operating profit in the quarter was up 8% reported and up 14% organically. Growth was driven by volume, price and base cost productivity more than offsetting H turbine ramp cost; negative mix, driven by Wind and Distributed Power; and foreign exchange. Operating margins in the quarter were flat at 18%. 
The framework for Power & Water remains intact. We expect 100 to 105 gas turbine orders and shipment, 3,000 to 3,200 Wind shipments and AGP upgrades of 90 to 100. Distributed Power, we think will remain challenging for the year. 
Next, on Oil & Gas. The business performed as we expected in the second quarter on orders and revenue, and performed slightly better than we expected on operating profit. I'll start with orders. 
Orders were down 20% reported and down 11% organically. Equipment orders were down 14% and flat organically. Turbomachinery was higher by 40%, driven by new LNG orders; and downstream was higher by 53% from strength in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. The strength in turbomachinery and downstream were offset by Subsea, which was down 48% on tough comparisons, and surface was down 31% on weak North American demand. Service orders in the quarter were down 26% and down 20%, organically. Turbomachinery and Subsea were down 36% and 30%, respectively. M&C was down 22%, principally driven by the Wayne disposition and a softer market. Downstream was up 23%. Revenues of just under $4.1 billion were down 15% reported and down 4% organically, driven by foreign exchange and the Wayne disposition. Equipment revenues were down 20% reported, down 8% organically, principally driven by turbomachinery, down 20% or 7% organically; and surface, down 24%. M&C was stronger by 10% organically and service revenues were down 9%, but up 1% organically. Operating profit was down 12% to $583 million in the quarter, but was up 5% versus last year organically. Foreign exchange translation was a $115 million headwind in the quarter. Margins grew 40 basis points and were up 140 basis points organically. The business executed well, delivering on manufacturing productivity, positive value gap and executing on the restructuring [ph]. Through the first half, Oil & Gas revenues were down 12% reported and down 2% organically. Operating profit was down 9% reported but was up 8% organically. Margins improved 40 basis points reported and 120 basis points organically for the half. The business seems ahead of their plan to take out $600 million of cost this year. The framework we laid out for you at EPG of operating profit, down 5% to 10% reported and down 0% to 5% organically, is unchanged. 
Next up is Aviation. Global air travel continues to grow robustly. Passenger traffic grew 6.3% year-to-date through May with strength in both domestic and international travel. Most regions saw strength. And airfreight volumes grew 4% year-to-date. Aviation had very strong orders performance in the second quarter with $7.6 billion of orders, up 30%. Equipment orders grew 37% to $4 billion, driven by commercial engine orders growth of 71%. GE90 and 9X orders of $2 billion were higher by 12x, with key orders from United, Korean Air, Cutter and ANA. GEnx orders were higher by 3x. Commercial engine backlog grew 43% in the quarter to $29 billion. Military equipment orders were down 31%, more or less as expected. Service orders were up 23% with commercial spares up strongly at 33% or $37.9 million a day, and military service orders were up 73%. Services backlog ended in $107 billion, up 7%. Revenues in the quarter of $6.3 billion were up 3%, with commercial equipment higher by 7%. The business shipped 86 GEnx engines versus 75 a year ago, which includes 15 units delayed from the first quarter. Military equipment was lower by 12%. Service revenue was up 6%, and commercial spare parts higher by 30% and military was higher by 15%. That was partially offset by lower commercial time and material shop visits. Operating profit was 6% higher than the second quarter of '14, driven by strong value gap and base cost productivity. Margins expanded 60 basis points in the quarter. 
The Aviation team continues to deliver operationally and win commercially as they execute on multiple new product introductions. At this year's Paris Air Show, we announced $19 billion of orders and commitment. LEAP testing and performance remains on track and the first LEAP installed engines will go into service in mid-2016. 
On Healthcare. Orders of $4.7 billion were down 3%, but up 4% organically. Orders in the U.S. grew 3%. Europe was down 13%, but up 7% organically. And Japan was up 12% organically, with Africa higher by 40%. Offsetting these strong organic results was the Middle East, down 6%, driven by Saudi; and China, down 7% on continued slow public tenders. In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems orders were down 3% reported, but up 3% organically. U.S. imaging and ultrasound were up strongly at 8%, with MRI higher by 17% and ultrasound, up 7%. Japan was up 1% and up 19% x the impact of the yen. Africa was up 42% on a large Ministry of Health deal in Kenya, and China was soft. It was down 9% in the quarter. Life Science orders were down 2% reported, but up 7% organic, with bioprocess continuing to grow, up 13% organically. Revenues in the quarter were down 3%, up 3% organically. Healthcare Systems revenues were up 3% organic and Life Sciences grew 8% organic. Operating profit was down 3% reported, but up 2% x foreign exchange. Volume growth and productivity was partially offset by foreign exchange and price. Margin rates were flat in the quarter. 
Though the U.S. market continues to grow, Europe appears stable. We believe we continue to take share in most of the markets we operate in. China remains a challenge with slow tenders, but we do not think there's an underlying demand problem. We really like the outlook and the growth trajectory for the bioprocess business within Life Science. 
Next up is Transportation. Rail volumes were down 1.8% in the second quarter, with carloads down 7%, driven by coal, petroleum and agriculture. And that was partially offset by a 4.4% increase in intermodal traffic. Rail volumes for the half were essentially flat with last year. Transportation orders were down 5% in the quarter, driven by lower equipment orders, down 19%, partly offset by 6% growth in services. Locomotive orders in North America were lower by 99 units, partly offset by strong international orders. Service strength was driven by $115 million order for Movement Planner in our solutions software business and very good spare parts demand. Backlog grew 32% year-over-year to $21 billion. Revenues were up 9%, principally driven by equipment growth of 13%, and service is higher by 6%. We shipped 191 locomotives in the quarter versus 165 in the second quarter of 2014. Operating profit was up strongly at 23%, driven by higher locomotive and parts volume, strong productivity, partly offset by mining mix and Tier 4 ramp costs. Margins improved in the quarter, 260 basis points versus last year. We currently have 18 preproduction Tier 4 units in revenue service with customers, and we will begin shipping our first production units this month. The launch remains on track. 
In Energy Management, orders were $2 billion in the quarter, up 5%. Orders were higher by 13%, excluding the effects of FX. The business saw strength in Power Conversion, higher by 33%; partly offset by Digital Energy, down 5%; and Industrial Solutions, down 6%; but roughly flat organically. Strength in Power Conversion was driven by higher penetration of renewables market where the business has grown each year, 50% in the last year. This was partially offset by weakness in oil and gas-related marine space. Backlog grew 10% to $5.5 billion in the quarter. Revenues of $1.8 billion were down 5%, but up 4% organically. Organically, Power Conversion was higher by 13%; Digital Energy, up 2%; and Industrial System was down 2%. Operating profit was up 19% versus last year and up 40% organically. Growth was driven by strong productivity more than offsetting foreign exchange. Margins improved 90 basis points in the second quarter. Through the first half, Energy Management operating profit is up 49% reported and up 96% organically. 
Finally, with Appliances & Lighting. Revenue was up 5% in the quarter, with Appliances up 7% on strong volume, and Lighting was up 2%. The U.S. appliance industry units were higher by 6%, with retail up 5%, and contract up 12% on robust housing starts. And Lighting revenue growth was driven by LED, which was up 77%, partially offset by a 17% decline in traditional products. LED now accounts for 36% of Lighting revenue, up 15 points from last year. We believe we're on track for approximately $1 billion of LED revenue in 2015. Operating profit was higher by 62% in the second quarter, driven by higher volumes and strong productivity. 
As has been reported, the U.S. antitrust authorities have filed suit to challenge the sale of GE Appliances to Electrolux, and we plan to vigorously defend the transaction in court. We expect the trial to begin in the fourth quarter, and our goal remains to close this deal this year. We are confident the transaction is good for customers and consumers and that acquiring the GE Appliances brand would help Electrolux compete in an increasingly global and intensely competitive industry. 
And finally, I'll cover GE Capital. As I discussed earlier, our vertical businesses earned $531 million this quarter, up 19% from prior year on strong performances across Aviation, Energy and Healthcare. Portfolio quality is stable and GECAS finished the quarter with only 1 aircraft on the ground. The verticals generated $2.2 billion of volume in the quarter, up 4%. And 80% of the GECAS volume and commitments were powered by GE CFM equipment. Energy finance arranged deals in the quarter that will fund over 180 GE wind turbines. 
Working down the page, Consumer earned $459 million during the quarter, down 3%, driven by Synchrony's minority interest. Our share of the Synchrony earnings was $463 million. In the quarter, the Synchrony team filed for separation with the Federal Reserve and we continue to target year-end, subject to regulatory approval. As in prior quarters, CEO Margaret Keane will host Synchrony's earnings call later today. Corporate generated a $772 million charge in the quarter, driven by exit-related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter runoff operating expenses, excess interest and our preferred dividend of $160 million in the quarter. Discontinued operations ended the quarter with a $3.7 billion loss. Results were driven by our commercial lending and leasing business, as the majority of that business was moved to discontinued operations in the second quarter as you will have seen from our 8-K published in early July. As part of accelerating our time line, we recognized a $4.3 billion held-for-sale loss, which includes the write-off of $8 billion of goodwill. This charge is included in the $23 billion total cost construct we shared with you in April. On an economic basis, we expect the CLL portfolios to generate a gain versus our tangible equity. Other earnings from discontinued operations were $582 million for the quarter and are primarily driven by CLL operations. Overall, GE Capital reported a $3.5 billion loss and we ended the quarter with $179 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. That's down $124 billion from the prior quarter. Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter at $85 billion, including $14 billion attributable to Synchrony, and our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 11.4%. That's up 80 basis points from the first quarter. We expect this ratio to continue to improve as we dispose of risk-weighted assets. 
In terms of portfolio sales, the team continues to make good progress. During the quarter, we signed deals representing approximately $23 billion of ENI, bringing our year-to-date total to $68 billion. There continues to be strong interest in our portfolios and we have $80 billion of additional ENI in the market currently. By year-end, we are on track to close approximately $100 billion and sign between $120 billion and $150 billion in total. We expect to be largely complete with our exit plan by year-end 2016, a year earlier than our original plan that we shared with you in April. 
At the bottom of the page is the 2015 dividend matrix we shared with you on April 10 when we announced the GE Capital exit. We are operating the business through the process at 14% Tier 1 common. As I discussed earlier, we ended the quarter at 11.4% Tier 1 common. We expect to improve the ratio to 14% or better by year-end as we close $100 billion of estimated deals. Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team delivered a strong operational quarter and remained focused on delivering on the portfolio transformation. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We're increasing the low end of the range with new expectations of $1.13 to $1.20. So far this year, organic growth and margin expansion are trending towards the high end of our expectations, and we expect this to continue. We're still planning for our transactions to close by the end of the year. The verticals will remain on track for $0.15 EPS and the accounting around capital exits are consistent with our plan. We think it's likely that the Synchrony split occurs this year. 
GE Capital asset sales closings are tracking towards $100 billion of ENI, and we expect signings in excess of that number. Free cash flow is on track for $12 billion to $15 billion, and we're hoping to expand the GE Capital dividend based on faster asset sales. And just for perspective, Appliances represents about $2 billion of the disposition cash. 
We've shared a range of $10 billion to $30 billion of cash return to investors. Our capital allocation plan is on track. And if Synchrony occurs this year, we will be at the high end of this range. 
So the GE team is executing. Despite managing a substantial portfolio pivot, our operating execution remains excellent. We're gaining momentum towards our long-term goals and going forward, we can give investors strong Industrial EPS growth while returning significant cash through dividends and buyback. And we've created a premier industrial company, well positioned to win in this environment. 
So Matt, let's take some questions."

There were good productivity opportunities from the start. We'll take out $600 million-ish of cost this year. That will be more next year. So we've been able to do a good job on cost. And I think the combination of those things and the kind of mix of businesses we have, I think gives us the perspective that we should be able to hold our margins going forward despite a more challenging market."

As we said in the first quarter, we expected mix to turn around a little bit here in the second quarter and it, in fact, did. And you're correct, part of that is the higher GEnx shipments and it's also a function of higher Wind shipments and lower Distributed Power quarter-to-quarter. So that's what happened on the mix line. Value gap got substantially better. Value gap in the second quarter was about $193 million. It's $221 million for the half. So up substantially from $28 million of value gap in the first quarter, and we continue to deliver cost productivity on products and service. And so the second quarter, we had 60 basis points of margin improvement in the gross margin line and then 70 in op profits. So the net of simplification and other inflation added 10 basis points below gross margin. So that gave us a first half of 70-basis-points improvement in the gross margin line and 100 in op profit. So those are really the dynamics. I think mix turned around like we thought it would versus an extremely strong first quarter, and value gap got substantially better."

So we think we have a number of opportunities to increase the amount of restructuring to get ourselves positioned for '16 and beyond, particularly around competitiveness. As I said earlier, if for some reason we didn't close Appliances, we may take a harder look at that. Of the restructuring we spent in the quarter, about $140 million of that was in Oil & Gas and we see very good paybacks around that. All the projects we're working on today are all inside of the 1.5-year payback kind of benchmark that we've shared with you over time. The nature of the restructuring has changed pretty dramatically though. There's about less than 1/3 of what we're doing today is SG&A related and more like 70%, 75% of it is product and services. We really focus on gross margins and product and service cost competitiveness. So I think we're on track to invest at very good returns in restructuring this year.

And then on the service side, I think our analytics are starting to play through, both from a pricing standpoint and also from a productivity standpoint. So that's another example of technology and what it can drive. So I think that..."

The GE team had a good quarter and slow growth in a volatile environment. Organic performance was strong. Industrial revenue growth was up 4%, profit was up 9%, year-to-date industrial sale prorated is up 23%, and industrial segment margins are up 100 basis points.
Let me make a few comments on how we are seeing our markets more broadly. The U.S. is still okay, and Europe is appreciably better. Meanwhile, growth markets are facing some headwinds in resource, pricing and currency. Nonetheless, we are positioned to win some big fourth quarter deals in these markets in locomotives and power, Aviation and Power Conversion, which should support our growth objectives. And service provides a great buffer in times of uncertainty.
We made substantial progress on GE's portfolio transformation in the quarter. Alstom has been approved by the European Commission, and we expect this to close soon. The Fed has approved the Synchrony separation, and we expect to commence the share exchange next week. The net effect of this should be to return about $20 billion to investors in the form of share reduction.
Our GE Capital portfolio sales are ahead of plan. And with the wells announcement, we now expect 2015 signings of $140 billion to $150 billion. And we believe this will facilitate an incremental dividend from GE Capital of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter or $3 billion for the year.
So if you look at our execution, we're tracking to meet or beat all of our critical goals. We're reconfirming our earnings outlook that we gave in the second quarter when we boosted the low end of our range. And our CFOA and cash return to investors will be at the high end of our framework. So Keith and I will now take you through a deeper dive on the portfolio moves.
For Alstom, all the major regulators have now approved GE's purchase of Alstom with remedies. We're comfortable with the outcome as the economic and strategic impact of the deal remains intact. We will divest to Ansaldo the GT26 new units and the GT36 technology and 34 of 720 service contracts in the installed base. We will retain the ability to do service for competitive units through PSM. Financially, we still expect to achieve $3 billion of synergies with $0.05 to $0.08 of earnings accretion in '16 and $0.15 to $0.20 by 2018. Alstom grows GE's installed base by 50%. [ph] In addition, they will substantially improve our position in renewables and grid. Alstom will achieve a strong return for investors, and we will give you more operating details on Alstom at a special meeting we plan to hold at late November.
Now over to Keith to give you an update on the GE Capital portfolio moves."

As Jeff mentioned, we have received formal approval from the Federal Reserve to move forward with the split-off of Synchrony Financial as a stand-alone company.

As Jeff mentioned, we have received formal approval from the Federal Reserve to move forward with the split-off of Synchrony Financial as a stand-alone company. This is the final step in a project which we started 2 years ago and is a key component in the transformation GE Capital.
We can't talk about the specific financial terms of this exchange until we launch. However, to provide some context, on the left side of the page, we show the time line and mechanics for the exchange. We plan to launch the split exchange next week, subject to market conditions. The offer period remains open for 20 business days from the time of launch. And at launch, we're going to set the offer terms with exchange, meaning the split discount that holders will receive in Synchrony stock when they exchange their GE shares, plus the exchange cap ratio, which is the maximum discount between GE and Synchrony share set at the time of the launch. The pricing for the split exchange will happen on day 16 to 18, and the offer closes on day 20, which would occur the week of November 16.
Based on precedents from other exchanges that have taken place and the current stock prices of GE and Synchrony, we anticipate to receive proceeds of between $18 billion and $21 billion, which translates to a buyback of 650 million to 750 million shares of GE. The range of outcomes is determined by the split discount, the exchange ratio and the movement of GE and Synchrony shares prior to and during the exchange up to pricing. We anticipate that we'll record a gain in GE Capital in discontinued operations, and that gain the size of which is dependent on the spinal split discount, will be embedded in the proceeds for the buyback, so will not have any impact on GECC capital ratios. I would really like to thank Margaret Keane and her team for the terrific work they've done to position Synchrony for this separation. In the next 30 days, we plan to retire 6% to 7% of GE shares.
Next, I'll give you an update on our progress executing the plan that we announced on April 10. On the top left of this chart is an update on the portfolio of sales. We are ahead of plan. And in the first 6 months since the announcement, we signed deals on $126 billion worth of any. Since 2Q, we signed $58 billion worth of transactions, the largest being the $30 billion sale of our distribution finance, vendor finance and direct line of businesses to Wells Fargo, which we announced earlier this week. We gave previous guidance that we would sign $120 billion to $150 billion of deals by year end, and we're a now raising the low end of that range to $140 billion given the progress we've made. We have closed $60 billion of sales to date, and we're on track to close $100 billion by year end.
On the bottom left, you can see our current view versus the goals that we established back on April 10. We're ahead on plan on asset sales, and we expect to largely be done with the exits by year end '16 instead of '17. Overall, we're on track to deliver the $35 billion of capital back to the parent. You can see on the top right that our pricing to date on the $126 billion is slightly ahead of plan at 1.4x price to tangible book. And the deal that we announced at Wells earlier this week will also at approximately 1.4x price to tangible book. As a result of the accelerated sales, we're giving up some the future income from the Hubble plan, but overall with our asset liability management actions, including the debt exchange that we completed, our current estimate of capital to be returned is still $35 billion.
In terms of timing of dividends, as we closed sales transactions in the fourth quarter, we expect our Tier 1 common ratio to exceed 14%, and we plan to pay a dividend of approximately $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, subject to our governance process. That would result in $3 billion for 2015, which is $2 billion higher than the original plan. In addition, we are on track for the $18 billion of dividends that we previously said would come in 2016. Our goal is to apply for CCD designation, which based on our view of transaction closings, our target is to file in the first quarter of '16. If you combine the Synchrony split with the 2015 transaction closings, we expect to end 2015 with around $175 billion of ENI, around $200 billion lower than year end 2014.
I'd really like to thank the GE Capital employees who have accomplished a lot in the last 6 months, and the team is focused on substantially completing the business exits by the end of 2016.
Let me turn it back to Jeff."

And now I'll briefly go through GE's industrial operations. Our year-to-date orders are down 4% organically.

And now I'll briefly go through GE's industrial operations. Our year-to-date orders are down 4% organically. We faced some tough comps in orders compared to third quarter '14 when total orders grew by 22% and equipment orders grew by 31%. Organically, developed markets are up 18% year-to-date with growth markets down 7%, excluding a large onetime GE9X order.
Our year-to-date orders in China are up 1%. Service grew by 6% organically, and our progress was broad-based. Power Gen services grew by 10%, Aviation spares grew by 28% and Healthcare was up by 4% organically. Power & Water, Energy Management and Healthcare orders were up 9% organically. However, Aviation and Transportation had significant onetime orders placed in the third quarter of '14 with the GE9X in Tier 4. These 2 products alone had $6 billion of orders in the third quarter of '14. Oil & Gas orders reflect the impact of industry dynamics. Our organic orders decline was 32%. It is not unexpected. We continue to compete well in the market and have not seen cancellations. Importantly, there's substantial equipment orders where we've been selected technically, but they've been delayed. So we're confident in our market position.
Across the company, we have a strong funnel of orders for the fourth quarter, and we expect orders performance to improve. On execution, the GE team executed very well in the quarter. Our organic revenue growth was up 4% with 6 to 7 segments up. Our relative position, both in product and geographic diversity, has never been stronger. Globally, revenue in the U.S. was up 5%, and Europe organic growth was up substantially, while growth markets declined by 7%. Year-to-date revenue was positive in the Asean, China, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Middle East and North Africa. Meanwhile, regions like Russia, Canada and Australia have been hard hit by natural resource dynamics. Services were up 8% organically. Growth for software and analytics was up 16%, [ph] gaining momentum from our digital investments. At Minds & Machines, we launched Predix and now have more than 20,000 developers. We're expanding partnerships with important customers like Boeing, Exelon and BP. Service growth was broad-based with Power up 9%, Aviation up 17%, Transportation up 10%, and Healthcare up 3% organically. We're winning with new products. The H turbine has 67 technical selections with 21 in backlog. Power Conversion revenue grew by 15%, behind multiple new product launches. Our aviation engines are achieving market leadership by meeting customer commitments with superior execution. We now have 10,000 LEAP engines in backlog. Life Sciences had 8% organic growth in the quarter, and we have 2 important wins for bioprocess manufacturing in China. We launched Current as a way to capitalize on 72% LED growth and the opportunity to build a strong presence in the C&I energy efficiency space. Margins continue to be a great GE story. Segment op margins grew by 100 basis points with growth in gross margins of 80 basis points, and we've expanded our value gap by $300 million year-to-date and expect this to continue.
Our product margins are expanding, and analytics continue to drive productivity and services. Restructuring is delivering substantial benefits. And in all, we think our margins can continue to grow. This is our 10th straight quarter of margin expansion, so we have real momentum.
I would like to highlight the work of our Oil & Gas team as a good example of our execution. In a tough environment with organic revenue declining by 7%, they grew margins by 100 basis points organically and held earnings. This will position them well in a volatile industry.
Our cash is also good story for the year. Industrial CFOA is up 23% year-to-date. Industrial free cash flow was up 53%. And as is typical, we expect a strong fourth quarter, where we expect a $2 billion reduction in working capital similar to last year.
The great portfolio execution mentioned by Keith will allow for upside in our cash performance. Based on accelerated progress in capital asset sales, we should be able to dividend an additional $2.5 billion to the parent in the fourth quarter, and this should be $3 billion for the year. This will put the company at the high end of our CFOA range. And an effective Synchrony execution should return about $20 billion to investors through a share exchange, and this will put us at about $30 billion of cash return to investors for the year through dividend and buyback.
We still expect appliances to close in the quarter. This is not a complicated transaction. Appliances is a highly competitive industry with at least 7 manufacturers and 21 brands. Electrolux wants to close and is working hard to do so.
So the GE balance sheet is very strong, and we will finish the year with substantial liquidity. And now over to Jeff to go through operations."
177031,307086030,877424,"General Electric Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2015",2015-10-16,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the third quarter summary. We have revenues of $31.7 billion, which were down 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including corporate, were down 2% to $25.8 billion. Industrial operating, plus vertical EPS, was $0.",2933,"Great. Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the third quarter summary. We have revenues of $31.7 billion, which were down 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including corporate, were down 2% to $25.8 billion. Industrial operating, plus vertical EPS, was $0.29, up 16% year-over-year, with industrial up 9% and verticals up 15%. Operating EPS number of $0.32 adds in other continuing GE Capital activity, including the consumer segment, headquarter runoff and other exit-related items, which I'll cover in more detail on the GE Capital page.
Continuing EPS of $0.28 includes the impact of nonoperating pension and net EPS of $0.25 includes the impact of discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact for the quarter was a negative $347 million, which included $1 billion of exit-related noncash charges. These charges are within the framework of the $23 billion exit impact that we communicated in April. Partly offsetting the charge was income associated with operations in CLL and real estate, which were moved to disc ops early in the year. As Jeff said, we generated $6.5 billion of CFOA year-to-date, which was down 9% [indiscernible] by lower GE Capital dividends. However, industrial CFOA was $6.1 billion year-to-date, up 23%. The GE tax rate was 17%, bringing the year-to-date rate to 20%, which is in line with our current estimate for the total year rate. The GE Capital reported rate was a negative 6% in the quarter, which includes tax benefits associated with the plan to shrink GE Capital. The vertical tax rate was 0%. As we communicated previously, as we complete the GE Capital restructuring, we expect the vertical tax rate to be low double digits.
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% on a reported basis but up 4% organically, reflecting about 5 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was a $1.2 billion drag on industrial segment revenue and $165 million impact on industrial segment op profit. Despite this headwind, industrial segment operating profit was up 5%. And organically, the industrial segments were up 9%. GE Capital vertical earnings of $351 million in the quarter were up 55%.
Next, I'll go through the earnings walk. Consistent with last quarter, we included a walk of the different elements of our earnings so that the dynamics are clear, given all the moving pieces with GE Capital. Starting with the first column on the left and working down. Industrial operating net income was $2.6 billion, and vertical income was $351 million for a total industrial plus vertical's operating earnings of $2.9 billion. The GE Capital consumer segment earned $795 million during the quarter, which I'll cover later. On the other GE Capital line, we incurred $411 million of cost driven by exit-related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter runoff, operating expenses and excess interest. As a result, total operating earnings were $3.3 billion, including nonoperating pension costs, continuing earnings for $2.9 billion. Discontinued operations were a charge of $347 million, which I discussed in the previous page. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were $2.5 million. [ph] In the center and far right columns, you can see the associated EPS numbers and a variance versus prior year.
Next page, on onetime items. We had $0.02 of charges related to ongoing industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to drive the cost competitiveness of the company. Charges were $346 million on a pretax basis and $244 million after tax. About 45% of those charges related to restructuring in our Oil & Gas business as we continue to execute on our cost-out program. We had no industrial gains in the quarter.
On the bottom of the page, you can see the fourth quarter estimate. We're expecting gains from Appliances signaling and embedded systems transactions in the quarter. For the year, we continue to expect gains in restructuring to be balanced on an EPS basis. We have increased our expected restructuring from $0.11 to about $0.14 due to the hard gains we expect for the year. We have additional attractive restructuring opportunities including Alstom, which allows us the higher gains.
Now I'll go through each of the segments, including Power & Water. Orders in the quarter were up 8% and up 13% organically. Equipment orders were up 7% to $3.5 billion on strength in distributed power, higher by 61%; renewables up 2%, partly offset by Thermal down 6%. Distributed Power was higher driven by 2 fast-track power deals in Indonesian Ghana and our first order for first 6 LM 6000 plus [ph] units in Thailand. The new LM 6000 PF plus contains 56 combined cycle efficiency, which is the highest in its class. It takes half the time to install versus its predecessor and can start up to full power in about 10 minutes.
Renewables orders were up 2%, up 14% excluding FX on strong international orders. Unit volumes were lower at 821 versus 839 a year ago, but megawatts were up 9%. Thermal orders were down 6%, down 2% ex FX. We took orders for 22 gas turbines versus 23 last year. The business booked 4 H orders in the quarter, 2 in Pakistan, 1 Korean and 1 in the U.S. This brings our total H units in backlog to 21 with an additional 47 technical ones, a 7-unit increase from the second quarter.
Service orders grew 8% to $3.4 billion, driven by strength of PGS, up 10%. We continue to see success in our upgrade campaigns including AGP's, dry load our flex, all of which enhance the performance of our machines. In the quarter, we booked 22 AGPs, up 4 from the third quarter of last year. Revenues in the quarter were up 1% and higher by 7% organically. Equipment revenue was down 6% driven by Thermal down 10% on 16 gas turbine shipments versus 26 a year ago. And Distributed Power was down 13% on lower engine volume, principally driven by weak demand in the gas compression market. Renewables revenue were up 8% and up 19%, excluding exchange on higher shipments of 735 wind turbines versus 642 last year.
Service revenues were strong, up 9% led by PGF, up 13%, driven principally by upgrade sales. AGPs totaled 22 in the quarter versus 18 a year ago. All profit was higher by 7% and up 10% organically. Margins improved 100 basis points driven by service growth and cost productivity.
As we look to the fourth quarter, no change of the framework we've given you on gas turbines and Distributed Power. Wind is turning to the low end of the range we've given you previously of 3,000 to 3,200 turbines.
Next, Oil & Gas. The business continues to perform in a very difficult environment. Orders in the quarter were down 38% and down 32% organically. All segments on lower orders given the constrained CapEx environment and project delays. Equipment orders were down 60% with TMS down 57%, driven by large Canadian LNG pushout. Subsea was down 81%, with softness in both drilling and low stream. Downstream was down 58%. Surface was down 49% on lower rig counts, and M&C was down 22% on softness in flow and process technology.
Service orders for the quarter were down 13% but down 4% organically, principally driven by Subsea and Surface down 26% and 39%, respectively. And that was partly offset by TMS, which was up 4% and up 20% organically on higher installations. Backlog in the third quarter ended at $22.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year. Revenues in the quarter were down 16% to $3.9 billion and down 7% organically. Foreign exchange had a $400 million impact on revenue.
Equipment revenues were down 18% and down 8% organically, driven by Surface, down 36%; and Subsea lower by 12%, down 3% ex foreign exchange. Organically, TMS was down 3%, and downstream was up 12%. Service revenues were down 14% and down 5% organic with MNC down 2%. All profit was lowered by 12% versus last year and flat organically. Foreign exchange was a $75 million headwind in the quarter. The business continues to execute on cost of material deflation. Value gap was positive with a very modest price impact. Margins improved 70 basis points and 100 basis points, excluding the effects of exchange. Through 3 quarters, revenues are down 13% and down 4% organically. Operating profit is down 10% reported and up 5% organically. We expect volume pressure to persist into the fourth quarter. However, given the strong execution on cost out, we believe that for total year, organic all profit, we will be about flat year-over-year or slightly better versus the flat to down 5% guidance we provided earlier. The team is making strong progress in achieving the $600 million of cost-out goals for 2015 and is well positioned to deliver $1 billion plus cumulatively of cost out through 2016. In aviation, underlying travel demand continues to grow robustly, higher by 6.6% year-to-date August, with strength domestically and internationally. The Middle East and Asia Pacific continue to be particularly strong. Airfreight volumes grew 2.6% through August. Orders in the third quarter of $6.5 billion were down 35%. The third quarter of 2014 included large orders received in the Farnborough Airshow. Equipment orders were down 58%, driven by commercial orders. Last year, we booked $3.8 billion of GE9X orders versus $600 million of GE99x orders this quarter. GEnx orders of $600 million were up 3x, driven by strength in China, and we had $800 million of LEAP CFM orders in the quarter. Commercial engines backlog of just under $30 billion is higher by 22% versus last year. Military orders were down significantly on non-repeat of international campaigns last year and soft U.S. demand. Services were very strong. Service orders grew 13% on strong commercial experience growth of 28% at $39.5 million a day, and military services were higher by 76%. This was probably offset by overall volume being down. Revenue in the quarter was up 5% to $6 billion. Equipment revenues were down 6%, with commercial down 1% and military down 20%. We shipped 64 GEnx units versus 65 last year. And services revenues was up 17% with commercial experience higher by 22% and military up 16%.
Operating profit was up 7% driven by strong services volume and value gap. Margins expanded 30 basis points in the quarter. So another solid quarter from the Aviation team. The LEAP testing performance remains on track with the first new installs expected to be in service in mid-2016.
Next up is Healthcare. Orders of $4.5 billion were down 4% reported but up 3% organically. Geographically, the U.S. was down 1%. Europe was up strongly, ex foreign exchange, by 11%, and down 5% reported. China was flat, and the Middle East grew 15%.
In terms of product lines, Healthcare systems orders were down 7% but up 1%, ex foreign exchange. In the U.S., orders were up 2% driven by strength in CT and MR, which were higher by 10% and 15%, respectively, partially offset by weak x-ray. The U.S. appears to have performed in line with the market. Europe were strong again, up 7% organically, and that's the fifth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth for us in Europe. The Middle East grew 22%. China was down 14% as orders continue to be impacted by lower public tenders. The private sector orders are growing at double-digit rates in China but up a much smaller base than the public market.
Life Sciences orders grew 11% organically and 4% reported. Bioprocess grew 23%, excluding FX, with very strong demand in Europe, up 42%; and in China, up 162%. Healthcare revenues were down 5% in the quarter, up 2% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Healthcare systems was up 1%, and Life Sciences grew 8%, excluding FX.
Operating profit in the quarter was down 10% and down 4% organically. Negative leverage was driven by lower value gap and higher new product spend, which more than offset the cost productivity in the business. Margins contracted 90 basis points in the quarter. The third quarter was impacted by lower-than-expected volume in the growth markets and accelerated new product spread to drive future growth. The business has seen strong customer interest in productivity analytics, and as a result, has accelerated their migration to the Predix platform and development of Predictivity applications. In the fourth quarter, we expect this level of higher product investment to continue, and we expect growth markets to remain challenging and developed markets to continue to show positive organic growth.
In Transportation, North American carloads were down 2.2%, primarily driven by lower coal and petroleum, down about 9%. That was partly offset by 2% intermodal growth. Year-to-date, rail volume is down about 1%. Orders in the quarter were down 77% or about $3 billion, as we expected, driven by locomotives. In the third quarter of '14, we took a threefold increase or about 1,100 units in order for Tier 4. 2014 large order intake, combined with the current global commodity cycle, is pressuring demand for incremental locomotive power. However, we are working on several large opportunities and expect fourth quarter locomotive orders to be much stronger.
Revenues in the quarter grew 3%, driven by services, up 10%. And locomotive equipment revenues are up 11%, partially offset by mining. Operating profit was up 11% driven by volume, productivity and deflation, more than offsetting Tier 4 ramp cost. Margins improved 160 basis points.
In Energy Management, orders of $2.1 billion were up 2% and up 8% organically, driven by strength in renewables in our Power Conversion business, which grew order 16%, up 26% organically. Power Conversion's renewable orders were up over 4x on deals won in conjunction with both GE and Alstom, which offset the weak Oil & Gas Marine segment.
Digital Energy orders were up 20%, and industrial solutions was down 13%. Revenues in the quarter were down 2% reported but up 6% ex exchange. Organically, Power Conversion was up 15%, Digital Energy was up 8% and Industrial Solutions was flat.
Operating profit was higher by more than 2x to $127 million in the quarter. Higher earnings driven by strong cost productivity and value gap, partly offset by negative FX. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter.
And in appliances and lighting. For the segment, revenues grew 8% in the quarter with appliances up 10% on strong volume and lighting up 5%. The U.S. appliance industry was up 8% with retail up 9% and contract up 7%. Lighting continue to grow LEDs. LED revenue grew 65%, partially offset by a 15% decline in traditional products. LEDs now account for 39% of lighting revenue, up from 25% a year ago. All profit in the quarter was up 88% driven by material deflation and cost productivity.
Next, I'll cover GE Capital. Our vertical businesses earned $351 million this quarter. That's up 55% from prior year, driven by transactional gains and lower annual impairments in our Aviation business, partially offset by Oil & Gas impairments in our energy business. Portfolio quality remains stable as GE Capital finished the quarter with 0 delinquencies and no AOGs.
Working down the page. Consumer earned $795 million during the quarter, up 20% on gains related to portfolio exits from the international platform, partially offset by Synchrony minority interest. Our share of Synchrony earnings was $493 million, as in prior quarters, CEO, Margaret Keane, will hold Synchrony's earnings call later today. As Keith covered, we received approval from the Federal Reserve to proceed with the Synchrony separation and intend to launch the share exchange next week, subject to market conditions.
GE Capital corporate generated $411 million loss in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit-related tax and restructuring charges, excess interest expense and headquarters operating cost. Discontinued operations end of the quarter was $347 million loss, driven by $1 billion noncash charge associated with the execution of our portfolio exit strategy, partially offset by operating results in the underlying businesses. These charges are in line with $23 billion total cost construct we shared with you in April.
Overall, GE Capital reported $387 million of earnings, and we ended the quarter with $176 billion of continuing ENI, excluding liquidity. The verticals ended the quarter with $78 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain strong, and we ended the quarter with $97 billion, including $15 billion attributable to Synchrony. As part of GE Capital's internal reorganization, we launched a debt exchange to capitalize our international entity and to better align our assets and liabilities from a maturing liquidity perspective. The exchange was oversubscribed. We accepted $36 billion of new bonds, which were priced on October 5. And we'll settle the transactions on October 26. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 13.7%, which is up 230 basis points from the second quarter. We expect the GE 14% Tier 1 common ratio by year end inclusive of the additional $2.5 billion dividend that Keith mentioned previously.
Just some highlights on the right-hand side of the page. The verticals are on track to deliver $1.5 billion of earnings in 2015. Asset sales are ahead of plan with $126 billion signed and $60 billion closed. Once completed, the Synchrony exchange will trigger the consumer segment to move to discontinued operations. Given our significant progress, we plan to apply for CPT designation in the first quarter of 2016. In the last 6 months, Keith and the GE Capital team have continued to deliver operationally and are well ahead of the plan on the portfolio transformation we shared with you in April.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

If appliances close, we will be closer to the high end of this range, and our execution on our organic growth, margins and corporate cost remain strong. We expect the GE Capital verticals to be at least $0.15 with more strength in GE cash, and capital asset sale should be at least $100 billion, with more coming in the first quarter. CFOA should be about $16 billion, and free cash flows plus divestitures will be about $15 billion, assuming that appliances closes. And we expect to return $30 billion to investors about, reflecting the impact of Synchrony. GE is executing on its investor commitments and is on track for its 2015 goals. Our portfolio transformation is happening at an unprecedented pace. We have a focused infrastructure business with leading positions in our markets, and we're positioned to grow faster than our competitors with a strong dividend. We're growing operating and gross profit margins and making corporate smaller, with nearly a $200 billion backlog of services that positions the company well for any cycle, and we're transforming GE into the world's premier digital industrial company in a unique position to drive outcomes for customers and grow margins.
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the work of the GE team. Last quarter, we completed our largest industrial acquisition, completely repositioned GE Capital and launched one of the largest-ever IPOs. At the same time, we're winning in the market and delivering strong financial results. I'm very proud of their work.
Now Matt, back to you for questions."

Europe is appreciably better. But clearly, the growth markets are highly differentiated in terms of their performance and have some headwinds as it pertains to oil prices and things like that. On balance, Scott, we see as much activity as we've ever seen. So the quoting activity, the deal activity, things like that is still quite robust. Business for us in China is still pretty good, which is a big market. And so we still see a fair amount of opportunities out there, even amongst the volatility. So I really believe that we can still accomplish our long-term goals in the world we see today. And then I will just remind you that we got $200 billion backlog of services at 70% or 80% of our earnings. It's growing organically 8%. So we've got a pretty robust underpinning of the total company as we go forward. But the quote activity is as robust today as it was 6 months ago or a year ago."

I mean, our plan -- we can't guarantee exactly what the macro environment is going to be. But between the GE Capital actions, buyback stock, organic growth, integrating Alstom, you got a leadership team that knows precisely what we need to do for investors over the next 3 years, and that is a place we haven't been and certainly since the financial crisis.

So I don't see us changing that until we ultimately earn under that same framework. Right now, as you know, we ended the third quarter at 13 7. Having where the asset sales in the fourth quarter, we'll go up above 14. We expect the dividend $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter based on those assets sales in our governance process. And then we're on track for what we said we do in '16. But I don't -- I don't see that threshold really changing until you have a different regulatory environment. That's what it's so important for us to continue to shrink. That's why it's important for us to target applying to not be a SIFI in the first quarter. I think that's going to take some time. And then when we get it done with that, we still have our international regulators. So I think you should assume that that's the threshold for some period of time for us, and we need to continue to exit the businesses in a rapid pace and build a capital so that we can distribute it back to the parent."

The GE team had a good quarter and a slow growth in a volatile environment. Organic performance was strong. Industrial revenue growth was up 4%, profit was up 9%, year-to-date industrial sale prorated is up 23%, and industrial segment margins are up 100 basis points.
Let me make a few comments on how we are seeing our markets more broadly. The U.S. is still okay, and Europe is appreciably better. Meanwhile, growth markets are facing some headwinds in resource pricing and currency. Nonetheless, we're positioned to win some big fourth quarter deals in these markets, in locomotives and Power, Aviation and Power Conversion, which should support our growth objectives. And Service provides a great buffer in times of uncertainty.
We made substantial progress on GE's portfolio transformation in the quarter. Alstom has been approved by the European Commission, and we expect this to close soon. The Fed has approved the Synchrony separation, and we expect to commence the share exchange next week. The net effect of this should be to return about $20 billion to investors in the form of share reduction.
Our GE Capital portfolio sales are ahead of plan. And with the Wells announcement, we now expect 2015 signings of $140 billion to $150 billion. And we believe this will facilitate an incremental dividend from GE Capital of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter or $3 billion for the year.
So if you look at our execution, we're tracking to meet or beat all of our critical goals. We're reconfirming our earnings outlook that we gave in the second quarter when we boosted the low end of our range. And our CFOA and cash return to investors will be at the high end of our framework. So Keith and I will now take you through a deeper dive on the portfolio moves.
For Alstom, all the major regulators have now approved GE's purchase of Alstom with remedies. We're comfortable with the outcome as the economic and strategic impact of the deal remains intact. We will divest to Ansaldo the GT26 new units and the GT36 technology and 34 of 720 service contracts in the installed base. We will retain the ability to do service for competitive units through PSM. 
Financially, we still expect to achieve $3 billion of synergies, with $0.05 to $0.08 of earnings accretion in '16 and $0.15 to $0.20 by 2018. Alstom grows GE's installed base by 50%. In addition, they will substantially improve our position in renewables and grid. Alstom will achieve a strong return for investors, and we will give you more operating details on Alstom at a special meeting we plan to hold at late November.
Now over to Keith to give you an update on the GE Capital portfolio moves."
177031,307086030,877471,"General Electric Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2015",2015-10-16,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we have received formal approval from the Federal Reserve to move forward with the split-off of Synchrony Financial as a stand-alone company. This is the final step in a project which we started",833,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we have received formal approval from the Federal Reserve to move forward with the split-off of Synchrony Financial as a stand-alone company. This is the final step in a project which we started 2 years ago and is a key component in the transformation of GE Capital.
We can't talk about the specific financial terms of this exchange until we launch. However, to provide some context, on the left side of the page, we show the time line and mechanics for the exchange. We plan to launch the split exchange next week, subject to market conditions. The offer period remains open for 20 business days from the time of launch. And at launch, we're going to set the offer terms for the exchange, meaning the split discount that holders will receive on Synchrony stock when they exchange their GE shares plus the exchange cap ratio, which is the maximum discount between GE and Synchrony share set at the time of the launch. The pricing for the split exchange will happen on days 16 to 18, and the offer closes on day 20, which would occur the week of November 16.
Based on precedents from other exchanges that have taken place and the current stock prices of GE and Synchrony, we anticipate to receive proceeds of between $18 billion and $21 billion, which translate to a buyback of 650 million to 750 million shares in GE. The range in outcomes is determined by the split discount, the exchange ratio and the movement of GE and Synchrony shares prior to and during the exchange up to pricing. 
We anticipate that we'll record a gain in GE Capital in discontinued operations. And that gain, the size of which is dependent on the final split discount, will be embedded in the proceeds for the buyback, so it will not have any impact on GECC capital ratios. I'd really like to thank Margaret Keane and her team for the terrific work they've done to position Synchrony for this separation. In the next 30 days, we plan to retire 6% to 7% of GE shares.
Next, I'll give you an update on our progress executing the plan that we announced on April 10. On the top left of this chart is an update on the portfolio of sales. We are ahead of plan. And in the first 6 months since the announcement, we signed deals on $126 billion worth of ENI. Since 2Q, we signed $58 billion worth of transactions, the largest being the $30 billion sale of our distribution finance, vendor finance and direct lending businesses to Wells Fargo, which we announced earlier this week. 
We gave previous guidance that we would sign $120 billion to $150 billion of deals by year-end, and we're now raising the low end of that range to $140 billion given the progress we've made. We have closed $60 billion of sales to date, and we're on track to close $100 billion by year-end.
On the bottom left, you can see our current view versus the goals that we established back on April 10. We're ahead of plan on asset sales, and we expect to largely be done with our exits by year-end '16 instead of '17. Overall, we're on track to deliver the $35 billion of capital back to the parent. You can see on the top right that our pricing to date on the $126 billion is slightly ahead of plan at 1.4x price to tangible book. And the deal that we announced with Wells earlier this week was also at approximately 1.4x price to tangible book. 
As a result of the accelerated sales, we are giving up some of the future income from the Hubble plan, but overall, with our asset and liability management actions, including the debt exchange that we completed, our current estimated capital to be returned is still $35 billion.
In terms of timing of dividends, as we closed sales transactions in the fourth quarter, we expect our Tier 1 common ratio to exceed 14%, and we plan to pay a dividend of approximately $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, subject to our governance process. That would result in $3 billion for 2015, which is $2 billion higher than the original plan. 
In addition, we're on track for the $18 billion of dividends that we previously said would come in 2016. Our goal is to apply for SIFI de-designation, which, based on our view of transaction closings, our target is to file in the first quarter '16. If you combine the Synchrony split with the 2015 transaction closings, we expect to end 2015 with around $175 billion of ENI, around $200 billion lower than year-end 2014.
I'd really like to thank the GE Capital employees who have accomplished a lot in the last 6 months, and the team is focused on substantially completing the business exits by the end of 2016.
Let me turn it back to Jeff."

And now I'll briefly go through GE's industrial operations. Our year-to-date orders are down 4% organically. We faced some tough comps in orders compared to third quarter '14 when total orders grew by 22%, and equipment orders grew by 31%.",814,"Thanks, Keith. And now I'll briefly go through GE's industrial operations. Our year-to-date orders are down 4% organically. We faced some tough comps in orders compared to third quarter '14 when total orders grew by 22%, and equipment orders grew by 31%. Organically, developed markets are up 18% year-to-date, with growth markets down 7%, excluding a large onetime GE9X order.
Our year-to-date orders in China are up 1%. Service grew by 6% organically, and our progress was broad-based. Power Gen Services grew by 10%, Aviation spares grew by 28%, and Healthcare was up by 4% organically. Power & Water, Energy Management and Healthcare orders were up 9% organically. However, Aviation and Transportation had significant onetime orders placed in the third quarter of '14 with the GE9X in Tier 4. These 2 products alone had $6 billion of orders in the third quarter of '14. 
Oil & Gas orders reflect the impact of industry dynamics. Our organic orders decline was 32%. It is not unexpected. We continue to compete well in the market and have not seen cancellations. Importantly, there are substantial equipment orders where we've been selected technically, but they have been delayed. So we're confident in our market position.
Across the company, we have a strong funnel of orders for the fourth quarter, and we expect our orders performance to improve. 
On execution, the GE team executed very well in the quarter. Our organic revenue growth was up 4%, with 6 to 7 segments up. Our relative position, both in product and geographic diversity, has never been stronger. Globally, revenue in the U.S. was up 5%, and Europe organic growth was up substantially, while growth markets declined by 7%. 
Year-to-date revenue was positive in ASEAN, China, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Middle East and North Africa. Meanwhile, regions like Russia, Canada and Australia have been hard hit by natural resource dynamics. 
Services were up 8% organically. Growth for Software & Analytics was up 16%, gaining momentum from our digital investments. 
At Minds & Machines, we launched Predix and now have more than 20,000 developers. We're expanding partnerships with important customers like Boeing, Exelon and BP. Service growth was broad-based, with Power up 9%, Aviation up 17%, Transportation up 10% and Healthcare up 3% organically. 
We're winning with new products. The H turbine has 67 technical selections, with 21 in backlog. Power Conversion revenue grew by 15%, behind multiple new product launches. Our aviation engines are achieving market leadership by meeting customer commitments with superior execution. We now have 10,000 LEAP engines in backlog. 
Life Sciences had 8% organic growth in the quarter, and we have 2 important wins for bioprocess manufacturing in China. We launched Current as a way to capitalize on 72% LED growth and the opportunity to build a strong presence in the C&I energy efficiency space. 
Margins continue to be a great GE story. Segment op margins grew by 100 basis points, with growth in gross margins of 80 basis points. And we've expanded our value gap by $300 million year-to-date and expect this to continue.
Our product margins are expanding, and analytics continue to drive productivity and services. Restructuring is delivering substantial benefits. And in all, we think our margins can continue to grow. This is our 10th straight quarter of margin expansion, so we have real momentum.
I would like to highlight the work of our Oil & Gas team as a good example of our execution. In a tough environment, with organic revenue declining by 7%, they grew margins by 100 basis points organically and held earnings. This will position them well in a volatile industry.
Our cash is also a good story for the year. Industrial CFOA is up 23% year-to-date. Industrial free cash flow was up 53%. And as is typical, we expect a strong fourth quarter where we expect a $2 billion reduction in working capital, similar to last year.
The great portfolio execution mentioned by Keith will allow for upside in our cash performance. Based on accelerated progress in capital asset sales, we should be able to dividend an additional $2.5 billion to the parent in the fourth quarter, and this should be $3 billion for the year. This will put the company at the high end of our CFOA range. And an effective Synchrony execution should return about $20 billion to investors through a share exchange, and this will put us about $30 billion of cash returned to investors for the year through dividend and buyback.
We still expect appliances to close in the quarter. This is not a complicated transaction. Appliances is a highly competitive industry with at least 7 manufacturers and 21 brands. Electrolux wants to close and is working hard to do so.
So the GE balance sheet is very strong, and we will finish the year with substantial liquidity. 
And now over to Jeff to go through operations."
177031,307086030,877471,"General Electric Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2015",2015-10-16,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the third quarter summary. We have revenues of $31.7 billion, which were down 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including corporate, were down 2% to $25.8 billion. Industrial operating, plus Vertical EPS, was $0.",2928,"Great. Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the third quarter summary. We have revenues of $31.7 billion, which were down 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including corporate, were down 2% to $25.8 billion. Industrial operating, plus Vertical EPS, was $0.29, up 16% year-over-year, with Industrial up 9% and the Verticals up 50%. Operating EPS number of $0.32 adds in other continuing GE Capital activity, including the consumer segment, headquarter runoff and other exit-related items, which I'll cover in more detail on the GE Capital page.
Continuing EPS of $0.28 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS of $0.25 includes the impact of discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact for the quarter was a negative $347 million, which included $1 billion of exit-related noncash charges. These charges are within the framework of the $23 billion exit impact that we communicated in April. Partly offsetting the charge was income associated with operations in CLL and real estate, which were moved to disc ops earlier in the year. 
As Jeff said, we generated $6.5 billion of CFOA year-to-date, which was down 9% driven by lower GE Capital dividends. However, industrial CFOA was $6.1 billion year-to-date, up 23%. 
The GE tax rate was 17%, bringing the year-to-date rate to 20%, which is in line with our current estimate for the total year rate. The GE Capital reported rate was a negative 6% in the quarter, which includes tax benefits associated with the plan to shrink GE Capital. 
The Vertical tax rate was 0%. As we communicated previously, as we complete the GE Capital restructuring, we expect the Verticals tax rate to be low double digits.
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% on a reported basis but up 4% organically, reflecting about 5 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was a $1.2 billion drag on Industrial segment revenue and $165 million impact on Industrial segment op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 5%, and organically, the Industrial segments were up 9%. GE Capital Vertical earnings of $351 million in the quarter were up 55%.
Next, I'll go through the earnings walk. Consistent with last quarter, we included a walk of the different elements of our earnings so that the dynamics are clear, given all the moving pieces with GE Capital. 
Starting with the first column on the left and working down. Industrial operating net income was $2.6 billion, and Vertical income was $351 million for a total Industrial plus Verticals operating earnings of $2.9 billion. The GE Capital Consumer segment earned $795 million during the quarter, which I'll cover later. 
On the other GE Capital line, we incurred $411 million of cost driven by exit-related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter runoff, operating expenses and excess interest. As a result, total operating earnings were $3.3 billion. Including nonoperating pension costs, continuing earnings were $2.9 billion. 
Discontinued operations were a charge of $347 million, which I discussed on the previous page. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were $2.5 billion. In the center and far right columns, you can see the associated EPS numbers and the variance versus prior year.
Next page, on onetime items. We had $0.02 of charges related to ongoing industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to drive the cost-competitiveness of the company. Charges were $346 million on a pretax basis and $244 million after tax. About 45% of those charges related to restructuring in our Oil & Gas business as we continue to execute on our cost-out program. We had no industrial gains in the quarter.
On the bottom of page, you can see the fourth quarter estimate. We're expecting gains from Appliances signaling and embedded systems transactions in the quarter. For the year, we continue to expect gains in restructuring to be balanced on an EPS basis. We have increased our expected restructuring from $0.11 to about $0.14 due to the hard gains we expect for the year. We have additional attractive restructuring opportunities, including Alstom, which will offset the higher gains.
Now I'll go through each of the segments, starting with Power & Water. Orders in the quarter were up 8% and up 13% organically. Equipment orders were up 7% to $3.5 billion on strength in Distributed Power higher by 61%, Renewables up 2%, partly offset by Thermal down 6%. Distributed Power was higher driven by 2 fast-track power deals in Indonesia and Ghana and our first order for 6 LM6000-PF+ units in Thailand. The new LM6000-PF+ contains 56% combined-cycle efficiency, which is the highest in its class. It takes half the time to install versus its predecessor and can start up to full power in about 10 minutes.
Renewables orders were up 2%, up 14% excluding FX on strong international orders. Unit volumes were lower at 821 versus 839 a year ago, but megawatts were up 9%. 
Thermal orders were down 6%, down 2% ex FX. We took orders for 22 gas turbines versus 23 last year. The business booked 4 H orders in the quarter, 2 in Pakistan, 1 in Korea and 1 in the U.S. This brings our total H units in backlog to 21, with an additional 47 technical ones, a 7-unit increase from the second quarter.
Service orders grew 8% to $3.4 billion, driven by strength in PGS up 10%. We continue to see success in our upgrade campaigns, including AGPs, Dry Low NOx outflex [ph], all of which enhance the performance of our machines. In the quarter, we booked 22 AGPs, up 4 from the third quarter of last year. 
Revenues in the quarter were up 1% and higher by 7% organically. Equipment revenue was down 6%, driven by Thermal down 10% on 16 gas turbine shipments versus 26 a year ago. And Distributed Power was down 13% on lower engine volume, principally driven by weak demand in the gas compression market. Renewables revenues were up 8% and up 19% excluding exchange, on higher shipments of 735 wind turbines versus 642 last year.
Service revenues were strong, up 9%, led by PGS up 13%, driven principally by upgrade sales. AGPs totaled 22 in the quarter versus 18 a year ago. Op profit was higher by 7% and up 10% organically. Margins improved 100 basis points, driven by service growth and cost productivity.
As we look to the fourth quarter, no change in the framework we've given you on gas turbines and Distributed Power. Wind is turning to the low end of the range we had given you previously of 3,000 to 3,200 turbines.
Next, Oil & Gas. The business continues to perform in a very difficult environment. Orders in the quarter were down 38% and down 32% organically. All segments saw lower orders given the constrained CapEx environment and project delays. Equipment orders were down 60%, with TMS down 57%, driven by a large Canadian LNG pushout. Subsea was down 81%, with softness in both drilling and well stream. Downstream was down 58%, Surface was down 49% on lower rig counts, and M&C was down 22% on softness in flow and process technology.
Service orders for the quarter were down 13% but down 4% organically, principally driven by Subsea and Surface down 26% and 39%, respectively. And that was partly offset by TMS, which was up 4% and up 20% organically on higher installations. Backlog in the third quarter ended at $22.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year. Revenues in the quarter were down 16% to $3.9 billion and down 7% organically. Foreign exchange had a $400 million impact on revenue.
Equipment revenues were down 18% and down 8% organically, driven by Surface down 36%; and Subsea lower by 12%, down 3% ex foreign exchange. Organically, TMS was down 3%, and downstream was up 12%. Service revenues were down 14% and down 5% organic, with M&C down 2%. 
Op profit was lower by 12% versus last year and flat organically. Foreign exchange was a $75 million headwind in the quarter. 
The business continues to execute on cost of material deflation. Value gap was positive with a very modest price impact. Margins improved 70 basis points and 100 basis points, excluding the effects of exchange. 
Through 3 quarters, revenues are down 13% and down 4% organically. Operating profit is down 10% reported and up 5% organically. We expect volume pressure to persist into the fourth quarter. However, given the strong execution on cost out, we believe that for total year organic op profit, we will be about flat year-over-year or slightly better versus the flat to down 5% guidance we provided earlier. 
The team is making strong progress in achieving the $600 million of cost-out goal for 2015 and is well positioned to deliver $1 billion plus cumulatively of cost out through 2016. 
In Aviation, underlying travel demand continues to grow robustly, higher by 6.6% year-to-date August, with strength domestically and internationally. The Middle East and Asia Pacific continue to be particularly strong. Airfreight volumes grew 2.6% through August. 
Orders in the third quarter of $6.5 billion were down 35%. The third quarter of 2014 included large orders received at the Farnborough Airshow. Equipment orders were down 58%, driven by commercial orders. Last year, we booked $3.8 billion of GE9X orders versus $600 million of GE90/9X orders this quarter. GEnx orders of $600 million were up 3x, driven by strength in China, and we had $800 million of LEAP CFM orders in the quarter. 
Commercial engines backlog of just under $30 billion is higher by 22% versus last year. Military orders were down significantly on nonrepeat of international campaigns last year and soft U.S. demand. 
Services were very strong. Service orders grew 13% on strong commercial experience growth of 28% at $39.5 million a day, and military services were higher by 76%. This was partly offset by overall volume being down. 
Revenue in the quarter was up 5% to $6 billion. Equipment revenues were down 6%, with commercial down 1% and military down 20%. We shipped 64 GEnx units versus 65 last year. And services revenues was up 17%, with commercial experience higher by 22% and military up 16%.
Operating profit was up 7% driven by strong services volume and value gap. Margins expanded 30 basis points in the quarter. So another solid quarter from the Aviation team. The LEAP testing performance remains on track, with the first installs expected to be in service in mid-2016.
Next up is Healthcare. Orders of $4.5 billion were down 4% reported but up 3% organically. Geographically, the U.S. was down 1%. Europe was up strongly ex foreign exchange by 11% and down 5% reported. China was flat, and the Middle East grew 15%.
In terms of product lines, Healthcare systems orders were down 7% but up 1% ex foreign exchange. In the U.S., orders were up 2%, driven by strength in CT and MR, which were higher by 10% and 15%, respectively, partially offset by weak X-ray. 
The U.S. appears to have performed in line with the market. Europe was strong again, up 7% organically, and that's the fifth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth for us in Europe. The Middle East grew 22%. China was down 14% as orders continue to be impacted by lower public tenders. The private sector orders are growing at double-digit rates in China but off a much smaller base than the public market.
Life Sciences orders grew 11% organically and 4% reported. Bioprocess grew 23% excluding FX, with very strong demand in Europe, up 42%; and in China, up 162%. Healthcare revenues were down 5% in the quarter, up 2% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Healthcare systems was up 1%, and Life Sciences grew 8%, excluding FX.
Operating profit in the quarter was down 10% and down 4% organically. Negative leverage was driven by lower value gap and higher new product spend, which more than offset the cost productivity in the business. Margins contracted 90 basis points in the quarter. 
The third quarter was impacted by lower-than-expected volume in the growth markets and accelerated new product spread to drive future growth. The business has seen strong customer interest in productivity analytics and, as a result, has accelerated their migration to the Predix platform and development of Predictivity applications. In the fourth quarter, we expect this level of higher product investment to continue, and we expect growth markets to remain challenging and developed markets to continue to show positive organic growth.
In Transportation, North American carloads were down 2.2%, primarily driven by lower coal and petroleum down about 9%. That was partly offset by 2% intermodal growth. Year-to-date, rail volume is down about 1%. 
Orders in the quarter were down 77% or about $3 billion, as we expected, driven by locomotives. In the third quarter of '14, we took a threefold increase or about 1,100 units in order for Tier 4. 2014 large order intake, combined with the current global commodity cycle, is pressuring demand for incremental locomotive power. However, we are working on several large opportunities and expect fourth quarter locomotive orders to be much stronger.
Revenues in the quarter grew 3%, driven by services up 10%. And locomotive equipment revenues are up 11%, partially offset by mining. Operating profit was up 11% driven by volume, productivity and deflation, more than offsetting Tier 4 ramp cost. Margins improved 160 basis points.
In Energy Management, orders of $2.1 billion were up 2% and up 8% organically, driven by strength in renewables in our Power Conversion business, which grew orders 16%, up 26% organically. Power Conversion's renewable orders were up over 4x on deals won in conjunction with both GE and Alstom, which offset the weak Oil & Gas/Marine segment.
Digital Energy orders were up 20%, and Industrial Solutions was down 13%. Revenues in the quarter were down 2% reported but up 6% ex exchange. Organically, Power Conversion was up 15%, Digital Energy was up 8%, and Industrial Solutions was flat.
Operating profit was higher by more than 2x to $127 million in the quarter. Higher earnings driven by strong cost productivity and value gap, partly offset by negative FX. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter.
And in appliances and lighting. For the segment, revenues grew 8% in the quarter with appliances up 10% on strong volume and lighting up 5%. The U.S. appliance industry was up 8% with retail up 9% and contract up 7%. Lighting continued to grow LEDs. LED revenue grew 65%, partially offset by a 15% decline in traditional products. LEDs now account for 39% of lighting revenue, up from 25% a year ago. Op profit in the quarter was up 88% driven by material deflation and cost productivity.
Next, I'll cover GE Capital. Our vertical businesses earned $351 million this quarter. That's up 55% from prior year, driven by transactional gains and lower annual impairments in our Aviation business, partially offset by Oil & Gas impairments in our energy business. Portfolio quality remains stable as GE Cap finished the quarter with 0 delinquencies and no AOGs.
Looking down the page, consumer earned $795 million during the quarter, up 28% on gains related to portfolio exits in the international platform, partially offset by Synchrony minority interest. Our share of Synchrony earnings was $493 million, as in prior quarters, CEO, Margaret Keane, will hold Synchrony's earnings call later today. As Keith covered, we received approval from the Federal Reserve to proceed with the Synchrony separation and intend to launch the share exchange next week, subject to market conditions.
GE Capital corporate generated $411 million loss in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit-related tax and restructuring charges, excess interest expense and headquarters operating costs. Discontinued operations end of the quarter was $347 million loss, driven by $1 billion noncash charge associated with the execution of our portfolio exit strategy, partially offset by operating results in the underlying businesses. These charges are in line with $23 billion total cost construct we shared with you in April.
Overall, GE Capital reported $387 million of earnings, and we ended the quarter with $176 billion of continuing ENI, excluding liquidity. The verticals ended the quarter with $78 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter with $97 billion, including $15 billion attributable to Synchrony. As part of GE Capital's internal reorganization, we launched a debt exchange to capitalize our international entity and to better align our assets and liabilities from a maturing and liquidity perspective. The exchange was oversubscribed. We accepted $36 billion of new bonds, which were priced on October 5, and we'll settle the transactions on October 26. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 13.7%, which is up 230 basis points from the second quarter. We expect to achieve 14% Tier 1 common ratio by year end inclusive of the additional $2.5 billion dividend that Keith mentioned previously.
Just some highlights on the right-hand side of the page. The verticals are on track to deliver $1.5 billion of earnings in 2015. Asset sales are ahead of plan with $126 billion signed and $60 billion closed. Once completed, the Synchrony exchange will trigger the consumer segment to move to discontinued operations. Given our significant progress, we plan to apply for CPD designation in the first quarter of 2016. In the last 6 months, Keith and the GE Capital team have continued to deliver operationally and are well ahead of the plan on the portfolio transformation we shared with you in April.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We've kept the industrial EPS expectations at $1.13 to $1.20. If appliances close, we will be closer to the high end of this range, and our execution on our organic growth, margins and corporate cost remain strong. We expect the GE Capital verticals to be at least $0.15 with more strength in GECAS, and capital asset sale should be at least $100 billion, with more coming in the first quarter. CFOA should be about $16 billion, and free cash flows plus divestitures would be about $15 billion, assuming that appliances closes. And we expect to return $30 billion to investors about -- reflecting the impact of Synchrony. GE is executing on its investor commitments and is on track for its 2015 goals. Our portfolio transformation is happening at an unprecedented pace. We have a focused infrastructure business with leading positions in our markets, and we're positioned to grow faster than our competitors with a strong dividend. We're growing operating and gross profit margins and making corporate smaller. We have nearly a $200 billion backlog of services that positions the company well for any cycle, and we're transforming GE into the world's premier digital industrial company in a unique position to drive outcomes for customers and grow margins.
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the work of the GE team. Last quarter, we completed our largest industrial acquisition, completely repositioned GE Capital and launched one of the largest-ever IPOs. At the same time, we're winning in the market and delivering strong financial results. I'm very proud of their work.
Now Matt, back to you for questions."

On balance, Scott, we see as much activity as we've ever seen. So the quoting activity, the deal activity, things like that is still quite robust. Business for us in China is still pretty good, which is a big market. And so we still see a fair amount of opportunities out there, even amongst the volatility. So I really believe that we can still accomplish our long-term goals in the world we see today.

We've got a very diversified country mix, and that's some of the stuff that John Rice had done. The last thing I would say, Scott, is look, there's no way to describe what it feels like to run GE where the team knows exactly what it has to do over the next 3 years. I mean, our plan -- we can't guarantee exactly what the macro environment is going to be, but between the GE Capital actions, buying back stock, organic growth, integrating Alstom, you got a leadership team that knows precisely what we need to do for investors over the next 3 years, and that is a place we haven't been and -- certainly since the financial crisis. And that -- I think just helps everybody. It helps people who own the stock and it gives the leadership team, I think, extra momentum as we go forward."

And then I think if we look forward and just -- we don't assume that the market gets appreciably better. We would say that revenue might be down 10% to 15% next year and then operating profit might be down 10% to 15% next year, and that we hold margins in a tougher environment.

The GE team had a good quarter in a slow-growth and volatile environment. Organic performance was strong. Industrial revenue growth was up 4%, profit was up 9%, year-to-date Industrial CFOA is up 23%, and Industrial segment margins are up 100 basis points.
Let me make a few comments on how we are seeing our markets more broadly. The U.S. is still okay, and Europe is appreciably better. Meanwhile, growth markets are facing some headwinds in resource pricing and currency. Nonetheless, we're positioned to win some big fourth quarter deals in these markets, in locomotives and Power, Aviation and Power Conversion, which should support our growth objectives. And Service provides a great buffer in times of uncertainty.
We made substantial progress on GE's portfolio transformation in the quarter. Alstom has been approved by the European Commission, and we expect this to close soon. The Fed has approved the Synchrony separation, and we expect to commence the share exchange next week. The net effect of this should be to return about $20 billion to investors in the form of share reduction.
Our GE Capital portfolio sales are ahead of plan. And with the Wells announcement, we now expect 2015 signings of $140 billion to $150 billion. And we believe this will facilitate an incremental dividend from GE Capital of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter or $3 billion for the year.
So if you look at our execution, we're tracking to meet or beat all of our critical goals. We're reconfirming our earnings outlook that we gave in the second quarter, when we boosted the low end of our range. And our CFOA and cash return to investors will be at the high end of our framework. So Keith and I will now take you through a deeper dive on the portfolio moves.
For Alstom, all the major regulators have now approved GE's purchase of Alstom with remedies. We're comfortable with the outcome as the economic and strategic impact of the deal remains intact. We will divest to Ansaldo the GT26 new units and the GT36 technology and 34 of 720 service contracts in the installed base. We will retain the ability to do service for competitive units through PSM. 
Financially, we still expect to achieve $3 billion of synergies, with $0.05 to $0.08 of earnings accretion in '16 and $0.15 to $0.20 by 2018. Alstom grows GE's installed base by 50%. In addition, they will substantially improve our position in renewables and grid. Alstom will achieve a strong return for investors, and we will give you more operating details on Alstom at a special meeting we plan to hold in late November.
Now over to Keith to give you an update on the GE Capital portfolio moves."
177031,307086030,877504,"General Electric Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2015",2015-10-16,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we have received formal approval from the Federal Reserve to move forward with the split-off of Synchrony Financial as a stand-alone company. This is the final step in a project which we started",834,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we have received formal approval from the Federal Reserve to move forward with the split-off of Synchrony Financial as a stand-alone company. This is the final step in a project which we started 2 years ago and is a key component in the transformation of GE Capital.
We can't talk about the specific financial terms of this exchange until we launch. However, to provide some context, on the left side of the page, we show the time line and mechanics for the exchange. We plan to launch the split exchange next week, subject to market conditions. The offer period remains open for 20 business days from the time of launch. And at launch, we're going to set the offer terms for the exchange, meaning the split discount that holders will receive on Synchrony stock when they exchange their GE shares plus the exchange cap ratio, which is the maximum discount between GE and Synchrony shares set at the time of the launch. The pricing for the split exchange will happen on days 16 to 18, and the offer closes on day 20, which would occur the week of November 16.
Based on precedents from other exchanges that have taken place and the current stock prices of GE and Synchrony, we anticipate to receive proceeds of between $18 billion and $21 billion, which translate to a buyback of 650 million to 750 million shares in GE. The range in outcomes is determined by the split discount, the exchange ratio and the movement of GE and Synchrony shares prior to and during the exchange up to pricing. 
We anticipate that we'll record a gain in GE Capital in discontinued operations. And that gain, the size of which is dependent on the final split discount, will be embedded in the proceeds for the buyback, so it will not have any impact on GECC capital ratios. I'd really like to thank Margaret Keane and her team for the terrific work they've done to position Synchrony for this separation. In the next 30 days, we plan to retire 6% to 7% of GE shares.
Next, I'll give you an update on our progress executing the plan that we announced on April 10. On the top left of this chart is an update on the portfolio sales. We are ahead of plan. And in the first 6 months since the announcement, we signed deals on $126 billion worth of ENI. Since 2Q, we signed $58 billion worth of transactions, the largest being the $30 billion sale of our distribution finance, vendor finance and direct lending businesses to Wells Fargo, which we announced earlier this week. 
We gave previous guidance that we would sign $120 billion to $150 billion of deals by year-end, and we're now raising the low end of that range to $140 billion given the progress we've made. We have closed $60 billion of sales to date, and we're on track to close $100 billion by year-end.
On the bottom left, you can see our current view versus the goals that we established back on April 10. We're ahead of plan on asset sales, and we expect to largely be done with our exits by year-end '16 instead of '17. Overall, we're on track to deliver the $35 billion of capital back to the parent. You can see on the top right that our pricing to date on the $126 billion is slightly ahead of plan at 1.4x price to tangible book. And the deal that we announced with Wells earlier this week was also at approximately 1.4x price to tangible book. 
As a result of the accelerated sales, we are giving up some of the future income from the Hubble plan, but overall, with our asset and liability management actions, including the debt exchange that we completed, our current estimate of capital to be returned is still $35 billion.
In terms of timing of dividends, as we close sales transactions in the fourth quarter, we expect our Tier 1 common ratio to exceed 14%, and we plan to pay a dividend of approximately $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, subject to our governance process. That would result in $3 billion for 2015, which is $2 billion higher than the original plan. 
In addition, we're on track for the $18 billion of dividends that we previously said would come in 2016. Our goal is to apply for SIFI de-designation, which, based on our view of transaction closings, our target is to file in the first quarter of '16. If you combine the Synchrony split with the 2015 transaction closings, we expect to end 2015 with around $175 billion of ENI, around $200 billion lower than year-end 2014.
I'd really like to thank the GE Capital employees who have accomplished a lot in the last 6 months, and the team is focused on substantially completing the business exits by the end of 2016.
Let me turn it back to Jeff."

We faced some tough comps in orders compared to third quarter '14, when total orders grew by 22% and equipment orders grew by 31%.",816,"Thanks, Keith. And now I'll briefly go through GE's Industrial operations. Our year-to-date orders are down 4% organically. We faced some tough comps in orders compared to third quarter '14, when total orders grew by 22% and equipment orders grew by 31%. Organically, developed markets are up 18% year-to-date, with growth markets down 7%, excluding a large onetime GE9X order.
Our year-to-date orders in China are up 1%. Service grew by 6% organically, and our progress was broad based. Power Gen Services grew by 10%, Aviation spares grew by 28%, and Healthcare was up by 4% organically. Power & Water, Energy Management and Healthcare orders were up 9% organically. However, Aviation and Transportation had significant onetime orders placed in the third quarter of '14 with the GE9X and Tier 4. These 2 products alone had $6 billion of orders in the third quarter of '14. 
Oil & Gas orders reflect the impact of industry dynamics. Our organic orders decline was 32%. It is not unexpected. We continue to compete well in the market and have not seen cancellations. Importantly, there are substantial equipment orders where we've been selected technically, but they have been delayed. So we're confident in our market position.
Across the company, we have a strong funnel of orders for the fourth quarter, and we expect our orders performance to improve. 
On execution, the GE team executed very well in the quarter. Our organic revenue growth was up 4%, with 6 of 7 segments up. Our relative position, both in product and geographic diversity, has never been stronger. Globally, revenue in the U.S. was up 5%, and Europe organic growth was up substantially, while growth markets declined by 7%. 
Year-to-date revenue was positive in ASEAN, China, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Middle East and North Africa. Meanwhile, regions like Russia, Canada and Australia have been hard hit by natural resource dynamics. 
Services were up 8% organically. Growth for Software & Analytics was up 16%, gaining momentum from our digital investments. 
At Minds & Machines, we launched Predix and now have more than 20,000 developers. We're expanding partnerships with important customers like Boeing, Exelon and BP. Service growth was broad based, with Power up 9%, Aviation up 17%, Transportation up 10% and Healthcare up 3% organically. 
We're winning with new products. The H turbine has 67 technical selections, with 21 in backlog. Power Conversion revenue grew by 15%, behind multiple new product launches. Our aviation engines are achieving market leadership by meeting customer commitments with superior execution. We now have 10,000 LEAP engines in backlog. 
Life Sciences had 8% organic growth in the quarter, and we have 2 important wins for bioprocess manufacturing in China. We launched Current as a way to capitalize on 72% LED growth and the opportunity to build a strong presence in the C&I energy efficiency space. 
Margins continue to be a great GE story. Segment op margins grew by 100 basis points, with growth in gross margins of 80 basis points. And we've expanded our value gap by $300 million year-to-date and expect this to continue.
Our product margins are expanding, and analytics continue to drive productivity in services. Restructuring is delivering substantial benefits. And in all, we think our margins can continue to grow. This is our 10th straight quarter of margin expansion, so we have real momentum.
I would like to highlight the work of our Oil & Gas team as a good example of our execution. In a tough environment, with organic revenue declining by 7%, they grew margins by 100 basis points organically and held earnings. This will position them well in a volatile industry.
Our cash is also a good story for the year. Industrial CFOA is up 23% year-to-date. Industrial free cash flow was up 53%. And as is typical, we expect a strong fourth quarter, where we expect a $2 billion reduction in working capital, similar to last year.
The great portfolio execution mentioned by Keith will allow for upside in our cash performance. Based on accelerated progress in capital asset sales, we should be able to dividend an additional $2.5 billion to the parent in the fourth quarter, and this would be $3 billion for the year. This will put the company at the high end of our CFOA range. And an effective Synchrony execution should return about $20 billion to investors through a share exchange, and this will put us about $30 billion of cash returned to investors for the year through dividend and buyback.
We still expect Appliances to close in the quarter. This is not a complicated transaction. Appliances is a highly competitive industry with at least 7 manufacturers and 21 brands. Electrolux wants to close and is working hard to do so.
So the GE balance sheet is very strong, and we will finish the year with substantial liquidity. 
And now over to Jeff to go through operations."
177031,307086030,877504,"General Electric Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2015",2015-10-16,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the third quarter summary. We have revenues of $31.7 billion, which were down 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including corporate, were down 2% to $25.8 billion. Industrial operating, plus Vertical EPS, was $0.",2930,"Great. Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the third quarter summary. We have revenues of $31.7 billion, which were down 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including corporate, were down 2% to $25.8 billion. Industrial operating, plus Vertical EPS, was $0.29, up 16% year-over-year, with Industrial up 9% and the Verticals up 50%. Operating EPS number of $0.32 adds in other continuing GE Capital activity, including the Consumer segment, headquarter runoff and other exit-related items, which I'll cover in more detail on the GE Capital page.
Continuing EPS of $0.28 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS of $0.25 includes the impact of discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact for the quarter was a negative $347 million, which included $1 billion of exit-related noncash charges. These charges are within the framework of the $23 billion exit impact that we communicated in April. Partly offsetting the charge was income associated with operations in CLL and real estate, which were moved to disc ops earlier in the year. 
As Jeff said, we generated $6.5 billion of CFOA year-to-date, which was down 9% driven by lower GE Capital dividends. However, Industrial CFOA was $6.1 billion year-to-date, up 23%. 
The GE tax rate was 17%, bringing the year-to-date rate to 20%, which is in line with our current estimate for the total year rate. The GE Capital reported rate was a negative 6% in the quarter, which includes tax benefits associated with the plan to shrink GE Capital. 
The Vertical tax rate was 0%. As we communicated previously, as we complete the GE Capital restructuring, we expect the Verticals tax rate to be low double digits.
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% on a reported basis but up 4% organically, reflecting about 5 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was a $1.2 billion drag on Industrial segment revenue and $165 million impact on Industrial segment op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 5%, and organically, the Industrial segments were up 9%. GE Capital Vertical earnings of $351 million in the quarter were up 55%.
Next, I'll go through the earnings walk. Consistent with last quarter, we included a walk of the different elements of our earnings so that the dynamics are clear, given all the moving pieces with GE Capital. 
Starting with the first column on the left and working down. Industrial operating net income was $2.6 billion and Vertical income was $351 million, for a total Industrial plus Verticals operating earnings of $2.9 billion. The GE Capital Consumer segment earned $795 million during the quarter, which I'll cover later. 
On the other GE Capital line, we incurred $411 million of cost driven by exit-related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter runoff, operating expenses and excess interest. As a result, total operating earnings were $3.3 billion. Including nonoperating pension costs, continuing earnings were $2.9 billion. 
Discontinued operations were a charge of $347 million, which I discussed on the previous page. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were $2.5 billion. In the center and far right columns, you can see the associated EPS numbers and the variance versus prior year.
Next page, on onetime items. We had $0.02 of charges related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to drive the cost competitiveness of the company. Charges were $346 million on a pretax basis and $244 million after tax. About 45% of those charges related to restructuring in our Oil & Gas business as we continue to execute on our cost-out program. We had no Industrial gains in the quarter.
On the bottom of the page, you can see the fourth quarter estimate. We're expecting gains from Appliances, signaling and embedded systems transactions in the quarter. For the year, we continue to expect gains and restructuring to be balanced on an EPS basis. We have increased our expected restructuring from $0.11 to about $0.14 due to the higher gains we expect for the year. We have additional attractive restructuring opportunities, including Alstom, which will offset the higher gains.
Now I'll go through each of the segments, starting with Power & Water. Orders in the quarter were up 8% and up 13% organically. Equipment orders were up 7% to $3.5 billion on strength in Distributed Power, higher by 61%; Renewables, up 2%; partly offset by Thermal, down 6%. Distributed Power was higher driven by 2 fast-track power deals in Indonesia and Ghana and our first order for 6 LM6000-PF+ units in Thailand. The new LM6000-PF+ attains 56% combined-cycle efficiency, which is the highest in its class. It takes half the time to install versus its predecessor and can start up to full power in about 10 minutes.
Renewables orders were up 2%, up 14% excluding FX, on strong international orders. Unit volumes were lower at 821 versus 839 a year ago, but megawatts were up 9%. 
Thermal orders were down 6%, down 2% ex FX. We took orders for 22 gas turbines versus 23 last year. The business booked 4 H orders in the quarter: 2 in Pakistan, 1 in Korea and 1 in the U.S. This brings our total H units in backlog to 21, with an additional 47 technical ones, a 7-unit increase from the second quarter.
Service orders grew 8% to $3.4 billion, driven by strength in PGS, up 10%. We continue to see success in our upgrade campaigns, including AGP's Dry Low NOx OpFlex, all of which enhance the performance of our machines. In the quarter, we booked 22 AGPs, up 4 from the third quarter of last year. 
Revenues in the quarter were up 1% and higher by 7% organically. Equipment revenue was down 6%, driven by Thermal down 10% on 16 gas turbine shipments versus 26 a year ago. And Distributed Power was down 13% on lower engine volume, principally driven by weak demand in the gas compression market. Renewables revenues were up 8%, and up 19% excluding exchange, on higher shipments of 735 wind turbines versus 642 last year.
Service revenues were strong, up 9%, led by PGS up 13%, driven principally by upgrade sales. AGPs totaled 22 in the quarter versus 18 a year ago. Op profit was higher by 7% and up 10% organically. Margins improved 100 basis points, driven by service growth and cost productivity.
As we look to the fourth quarter, no change in the framework we've given you on gas turbines and Distributed Power. Wind is trending to the low end of the range we had given you previously of 3,000 to 3,200 turbines.
Next, Oil & Gas. The business continues to perform in a very difficult environment. Orders in the quarter were down 38% and down 32% organically. All segments saw lower orders given the constrained CapEx environment and project delays. Equipment orders were down 60%, with TMS down 57%, driven by a large Canadian LNG pushout. Subsea was down 81%, with softness in both drilling and well stream. Downstream was down 58%, Surface was down 49% on lower rig counts, and M&C was down 22% on softness in flow and process technology.
Service orders for the quarter were down 13% but down 4% organically, principally driven by Subsea and Surface down 26% and 39%, respectively. And that was partly offset by TMS, which was up 4% and up 20% organically on higher installations. Backlog in the third quarter ended at $22.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year. Revenues in the quarter were down 16% to $3.9 billion and down 7% organically. Foreign exchange had a $400 million impact on revenue.
Equipment revenues were down 18% and down 8% organically, driven by Surface down 36% and Subsea lower by 12%, down 3% ex foreign exchange. Organically, TMS was down 3%, and Downstream was up 12%. Service revenues were down 14% and down 5% organic, with M&C down 2%. 
Op profit was lower by 12% versus last year and flat organically. Foreign exchange was a $75 million headwind in the quarter. 
The business continues to execute on cost-of-material deflation. Value gap was positive with a very modest price impact. Margins improved 70 basis points, and 100 basis points excluding the effects of exchange. 
Through 3 quarters, revenues are down 13% and down 4% organically. Operating profit is down 10% reported and up 5% organically. We expect volume pressure to persist into the fourth quarter. However, given the strong execution on cost out, we believe that for total year organic op profit, we will be about flat year-over-year or slightly better versus the flat to down 5% guidance we provided earlier. 
The team is making strong progress in achieving the $600 million of cost-out goal for 2015 and is well positioned to deliver $1 billion plus cumulatively of cost out through 2016. 
In Aviation, underlying travel demand continues to grow robustly, higher by 6.6% year-to-date August, with strength domestically and internationally. The Middle East and Asia Pacific continue to be particularly strong. Airfreight volumes grew 2.6% through August. 
Orders in the third quarter of $6.5 billion were down 35%. The third quarter of 2014 included large orders received at the Farnborough Airshow. Equipment orders were down 58%, driven by commercial orders. Last year, we booked $3.8 billion of GE9X orders versus $600 million of GE90/9X orders this quarter. GEnx orders of $600 million were up 3x, driven by strength in China, and we had $800 million of LEAP CFM orders in the quarter. 
Commercial engines backlog of just under $30 billion is higher by 22% versus last year. Military orders were down significantly on nonrepeat of international campaigns last year and soft U.S. demand. 
Services were very strong. Service orders grew 13% on strong commercial spares growth of 28% at $39.5 million a day, and military services were higher by 76%. This was partly offset by overall volume being down. 
Revenue in the quarter was up 5% to $6 billion. Equipment revenues were down 6%, with commercial down 1% and military down 20%. We shipped 64 GEnx units versus 65 last year. And Services revenue was up 17%, with commercial spares higher by 22% and military up 16%.
Operating profit was up 7%, driven by strong Services volume and value gap. Margins expanded 30 basis points in the quarter. So another solid quarter from the Aviation team. The LEAP testing performance remains on track, with the first installs expected to be in service in mid-2016.
Next up is Healthcare. Orders of $4.5 billion were down 4% reported, but up 3% organically. Geographically, the U.S. was down 1%. Europe was up strongly ex foreign exchange by 11% and down 5% reported. China was flat, and the Middle East grew 15%.
In terms of product lines, Healthcare Systems orders were down 7% but up 1% ex foreign exchange. In the U.S., orders were up 2%, driven by strength in CT and MR, which were higher by 10% and 15%, respectively, partially offset by weak X-ray. 
The U.S. appears to have performed in line with the market. Europe was strong again, up 7% organically, and that's the fifth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth for us in Europe. The Middle East grew 22%. China was down 14% as orders continue to be impacted by lower public tenders. The private sector orders are growing at double-digit rates in China but off a much smaller base than the public market.
Life Sciences orders grew 11% organically and 4% reported. Bioprocess grew 23% excluding FX, with very strong demand in Europe, up 42%; and in China, up 162%. Healthcare revenues were down 5% in the quarter, up 2% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Healthcare Systems was up 1%, and Life Sciences grew 8%, excluding FX.
Operating profit in the quarter was down 10% and down 4% organically. Negative leverage was driven by lower value gap and higher new product spend, which more than offset the cost productivity in the business. Margins contracted 90 basis points in the quarter. 
The third quarter was impacted by lower-than-expected volume in the growth markets and accelerated new product spend to drive future growth. The business has seen strong customer interest in productivity analytics and, as a result, has accelerated their migration to the Predix platform and development of Predictivity applications. In the fourth quarter, we expect this level of higher product investment to continue, and we expect growth markets to remain challenging and developed markets to continue to show positive organic growth.
In Transportation, North American carloads were down 2.2%, primarily driven by lower coal and petroleum down about 9%. That was partly offset by 2% intermodal growth. Year-to-date, rail volume is down about 1%. 
Orders in the quarter were down 77% or about $3 billion, as we expected, driven by locomotives. In the third quarter of '14, we took a threefold increase or about 1,100 units in orders for Tier 4. 2014 large order intake, combined with the current global commodity cycle, is pressuring demand for incremental locomotive power. However, we are working on several large opportunities and expect fourth quarter locomotive orders to be much stronger.
Revenues in the quarter grew 3%, driven by services up 10%. And locomotive equipment revenues are up 11%, partially offset by mining. Operating profit was up 11% driven by volume, productivity and deflation, more than offsetting Tier 4 ramp costs. Margins improved 160 basis points.
In Energy Management, orders of $2.1 billion were up 2% and up 8% organically, driven by strength in renewables in our Power Conversion business, which grew orders 16%, up 26% organically. Power Conversion's renewable orders were up over 4x on deals won in conjunction with both GE and Alstom, which offset the weak Oil & Gas/Marine segment.
Digital Energy orders were up 20%, and Industrial Solutions was down 13%. Revenues in the quarter were down 2% reported but up 6% ex exchange. Organically, Power Conversion was up 15%, Digital Energy was up 8%, and Industrial Solutions was flat.
Operating profit was higher by more than 2x to $127 million in the quarter. Higher earnings driven by strong cost productivity and value gap, partly offset by negative FX. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter.
And in Appliances & Lighting. For the segment, revenues grew 8% in the quarter, with appliances up 10% on strong volume and lighting up 5%. The U.S. appliance industry was up 8%, with retail up 9% and contract up 7%. Lighting continued to grow LEDs. LED revenue grew 65%, partially offset by a 15% decline in traditional products. LEDs now account for 39% of lighting revenue, up from 25% a year ago. Op profit in the quarter was up 88%, driven by material deflation and cost productivity.
Next, I'll cover GE Capital. Our Vertical businesses earned $351 million this quarter. That's up 55% from prior year, driven by transactional gains and lower annual impairments in our Aviation business, partially offset by Oil & Gas impairments in our Energy business. Portfolio quality remains stable and GECAS finished the quarter with 0 delinquencies and no AOGs.
Looking down the page, Consumer earned $795 million during the quarter, up 28% on gains related to portfolio exits in the international platform, partially offset by Synchrony minority interest. Our share of Synchrony earnings was $493 million, and as in prior quarters, CEO, Margaret Keane, will hold Synchrony's earnings call later today. As Keith covered, we received approval from the Federal Reserve to proceed with the Synchrony separation and intend to launch the share exchange next week, subject to market conditions.
GE Capital corporate generated a $411 million loss in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit-related tax and restructuring charges, excess interest expense and headquarters operating costs. Discontinued operations end of the quarter was a $347 million loss, driven by a $1 billion noncash charge associated with the execution of our portfolio exit strategy, partially offset by operating results in the underlying businesses. These charges are in line with the $23 billion total cost construct we shared with you in April.
Overall, GE Capital reported $387 million of earnings, and we ended the quarter with $176 billion of continuing ENI, excluding liquidity. The Verticals ended the quarter with $78 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter with $97 billion, including $15 billion attributable to Synchrony. As part of GE Capital's internal reorganization, we launched a debt exchange to capitalize our international entity and to better align our assets and liabilities from a maturity and liquidity perspective. The exchange was oversubscribed. We accepted $36 billion of new bonds, which were priced on October 5, and we'll settle the transactions on October 26. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 13.7%, which is up 230 basis points from the second quarter. We expect to achieve 14% Tier 1 common ratio by year-end, inclusive of the additional $2.5 billion dividend that Keith mentioned previously.
Just some highlights on the right-hand side of the page. The Verticals are on track to deliver $1.5 billion of earnings in 2015. Asset sales are ahead of plan with $126 billion signed and $60 billion closed. Once completed, the Synchrony exchange will trigger the Consumer segment to move to discontinued operations. Given our significant progress, we plan to apply for SIFI de-designation in the first quarter of 2016. In the last 6 months, Keith and the GE Capital team have continued to deliver operationally and are well ahead of the plan on the portfolio transformation we shared with you in April.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We've kept the Industrial EPS expectations at $1.13 to $1.20. If Appliances close, we will be closer to the high end of this range, and our execution on our organic growth, margins and corporate cost remain strong. We expect the GE Capital Verticals to be at least $0.15 with more strength in GECAS, and capital asset sales should be at least $100 billion, with more coming in the first quarter. CFOA should be about $16 billion, and free cash flows plus divestitures would be about $15 billion, assuming that Appliances closes. And we expect to return $30 billion to investors about, reflecting the impact of Synchrony. GE is executing on its investor commitments and is on track for its 2015 goals. Our portfolio transformation is happening at an unprecedented pace. We have a focused infrastructure business with leading positions in our markets, and we're positioned to grow faster than our competitors with a strong dividend. We're growing operating and gross profit margins and making corporate smaller. We have nearly a $200 billion backlog of services that positions the company well for any cycle, and we're transforming GE into the world's premier digital industrial company in a unique position to drive outcomes for customers and grow margins.
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the work of the GE team. Last quarter, we completed our largest industrial acquisition, completely repositioned GE Capital and launched one of the largest-ever IPOs. At the same time, we're winning in the market and delivering strong financial results. I'm very proud of their work.
Now Matt, back to you for questions."

On balance, Scott, we see as much activity as we've ever seen. So the quoting activity, the deal activity, things like that is still quite robust. Business for us in China is still pretty good, which is a big market. And so we still see a fair amount of opportunities out there, even amongst the volatility. So I really believe that we can still accomplish our long-term goals in the world we see today. And then I would just remind you that we got $200 billion backlog of Services, that's 70% or 80% of our earnings. It's growing organically 8%. So we've got a pretty robust underpinning of the total company as we go forward. But the quote activity is as robust today as it was 6 months ago or a year ago."

We've got a very diversified country mix, and that's some of the stuff that John Rice had done. The last thing I would say, Scott, is look, there's no way to describe what it feels like to run GE, where the team knows exactly what it has to do over the next 3 years. I mean, our plan -- we can't guarantee exactly what the macro environment is going to be, but between the GE Capital actions, buying back stock, organic growth, integrating Alstom, you've got a leadership team that knows precisely what we need to do for investors over the next 3 years, and that is a place we haven't been and -- certainly since the financial crisis. And that, I think, just helps everybody. It helps people who own the stock and it gives the leadership team, I think, extra momentum as we go forward."

We've got some particular markets that are challenging based on commodities, FX or politics. If you think about Russia, the Middle East, places like Iraq are very, very tough to comp year-over-year. And we actually feel a little bit better that China is stabilizing a little bit for Healthcare. Their performance this quarter sequentially was better, and we think the tendering process is ultimately going to pick back up. When you think about China, the underlying fundamentals haven't changed. There's still 1.5 billion people. They're still building hospitals. The private market in China is growing 15% to 20% a quarter. It's the slowdown in the public tender, as part of the campaign the government has been running there has put some slowness into what we've seen in terms of order.
