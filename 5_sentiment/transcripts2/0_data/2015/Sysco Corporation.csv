And hello, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased nearly 8% to $12.1 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 6% to $245 million",1305,"Thank you, Shannon. And hello, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased nearly 8% to $12.1 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 6% to $245 million. Adjusted EPS increased 5% to $0.41 for the quarter. 
Our second quarter financial results were generally in line with our expectations as we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance. Most important, our associates remain highly focused on providing excellent service to our customers in what remains an extremely competitive market environment. 
We generated nearly 4% case volume growth during the quarter and effectively managed acute inflationary pressures in our meat and dairy categories. Specifically, case growth trends in our locally managed Broadline business were favorable in most of the geographic markets we serve. 
In addition, we generated solid case growth once again with our corporate managed customers in the restaurant and travel and leisure segments. Our performance during the quarter was due in part to the benefits we realized from our portfolio of business transformation initiatives, especially category management, as our ability to effectively integrate these initiatives in our steady-state operating activities has improved consistently over time. 
While we are pleased with our overall performance during the quarter, we did fall short of our expense management targets. Expense increases were driven primarily by higher incentive accruals, selling cost and delivery costs. Excluding certain items and the unfavorable impact of incentive accruals, operating expenses increased 4%. 
As I've mentioned previously, Sysco's single largest opportunity for improvement remains more consistent execution across the organization. We are implementing tools to provide increased visibility to key performance metrics as well as improve best practices. While we are seeing some level of improvement in this area and believe we are on the right path, we have more work to do. 
Regarding overall industry trends, current restaurant data shows modest signs of gradual improvement. NPD, which tracks restaurant trends, recently reported positive traffic growth in the mid-scale and casual dining sectors for the first time since 2008. This is encouraging news as the casual dining sector includes a significant number of independent restaurant customers for whom we provide substantial value-added product and services. 
In addition, consumer confidence and employment metrics are, for the most part, showing improvement. We are hopeful lower fuel prices will further improve the customers -- the consumer's outlook and lead to sustainable increased traffic and spend for our customer base.
We remain intently focused on enhancing every aspect of our business so that we are able to better support our customers, operate more efficiently and compete more effectively. Benefits from our category management initiative continue to gain momentum. We expect that all categories, representing approximately $15 billion in annual spend, will be launched into the market by the end of this fiscal year, and that we will achieve the 3-year cost savings target that we established prior to the start of fiscal 2013. In addition, we are working with our suppliers in a more strategic and effective way that we believe provides a meaningful platform for growth and innovation in our respective businesses.
Turning to an update on our technology initiatives. We continue our merger integration planning with regards to technology and have begun certain fundamental projects necessary for integration. As we move forward in deploying our ERP platform, our approach has continued to evolve. 
For instance, we have focused on broad implementations at the operating companies for several years, with a plan to convert the hub or our shared business services facility last. However, we have found that this created inefficiencies at STS that would make further rollouts challenging. Thus, we are now moving forward with the rollout of SAP financial modules for general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable as well as additional elements of the HR module, all of which are intended to make SBS function more effectively in the near term and make future ERP conversions at the operating companies relatively easier.
While focusing on operational excellence is a key area for us, we also have important work under way to identify new markets with opportunity for profitable growth. As we discussed last quarter, we've developed a robust approach to serve the fast-growing Hispanic restaurant sector. We estimate that we have 10% to 15% of this $10 billion foodservice market and believe we have a significant opportunity to better serve these customers and grow our sales. 
We made additional strides to this effort recently with the launch of our new multilingual website dedicated to support customers in this segment. The site includes news, tips, menu ideas and trend data intended to help Hispanic operators drive restaurant traffic, improve their operations and better address their customers' evolving needs.
I'm extremely proud of the efforts and accomplishments of our leadership team over the last several months. As we announced last August, retired from Sysco at the end of the calendar year after 24 years of distinguished service. 
On January 1, Tom became Executive Vice President and President, Food Service Operations, succeeding Mike. Tom reports to me and has responsibility for all business operations, sales, merchandising, marketing and revenue management. Tom is a proven commercial leader with deep expertise and a strong track record in the food service industry. 
Since joining Sysco early in 2013, he has helped drive major advances in category management, revenue management, sales capability and customer insights and segmentation. We're fortunate to have such a capable leader to succeed Mike.
In addition and also effective January 1, 2015, Scott Charlton, Senior Vice President, Distribution Services, now reports to me in an expanded role. Scott leads end-to-end supply chain operations including warehousing, inbound and outbound transportation and replenishment. Scott joined Sysco in 2013 as well and brings great energy and expertise to our senior leadership team.
Turning to an update on our proposed merger with US Foods. Over the past 12 months, we have worked in good faith with the FTC, providing millions of pages of documents and explaining to them our industry and the merits of our proposed merger. We strongly believe that the combination of Sysco and US Foods will promote competition in what is already a highly competitive industry by positioning us to provide significant value to our customers, including lower cost. 
Unfortunately, the FTC has taken a different view of the potential competitive impacts of the merger. While we respectfully but vigorously disagree with the FTC's analysis, we announced today a substantial divestiture package that we believe fully addresses their concerns. At this time, the FTC has not agreed to this solution, so we will now present our position, including this proposed remedy to the 5 FTC commissioners and seek to obtain their approval. We remain convinced that the proposed transaction is good for our customers, our associates and our shareholders.
In closing, I am pleased with our operating performance through the first half of our fiscal year. Case growth and sales growth were up 3% and 7%, respectively, while adjusted operating income and EPS grew at a rate of 5% and 6%, respectively. In addition, many of our strategic business initiatives are gaining traction and contributing to these results. 
As we move forward into the remainder of our fiscal year, we are committed to improving the consistency of our operational execution, successfully rolling out our portfolio of initiatives and further developing our plans to integrate Sysco and US Foods.
This is a critical time in our history, and we believe the strategic actions we are taking are vital to both strengthening our customer relationships and providing solid returns to our shareholders over the long term. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter as well as [indiscernible] this morning with performance for the group."
189096,278898479,752969,"Sysco Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2015",2015-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $12.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year. Food cost inflation was 6%, driven mainly by double-digit inflation in the meat and dairy categories. Sales from acquis",2042,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $12.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year. Food cost inflation was 6%, driven mainly by double-digit inflation in the meat and dairy categories. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.8%, and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.9%. Case volume grew 3.6% during the quarter, including acquisitions and approximately 3.3% excluding acquisitions.
Gross profit in the second quarter was $2.1 billion, a 6.1% increase, and gross margin declined 23 basis points to 17.25%. Benefits from category management contributed to our gross profit performance during the quarter. In addition, case volume growth advanced from the prior quarter, and this increased demand, aiding gross profit performance. In our higher-margin locally managed Broadline business, case volume growth remained relatively steady and accelerated with our corporate managed customers.
Certain items for the quarter totaled $133 million and primarily related to merger and integration planning expenses. Of this amount, $81 million was recorded in operating expense and $52 million was recorded in interest expense. 
Merger and integration planning expenses that impacted operating expense were associated with professional fees to assist us in managing integration planning as well as legal and IT-related projects. Work-related integration planning peaked in the second quarter, and costs related to these efforts should decline going forward. 
Merger and integration expenses that impacted interest expense relate to the debt issuance during the quarter that is intended to finance US Foods' debt upon closing of the merger. We are treating this interest expense as a certain item until the merger closes. 
After excluding certain items, adjusted operating expense for the quarter increased $108 million or 6.8% compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by a $115 million increase in payroll expense, resulting from several factors: First, during last year's second quarter, we reduced certain management incentive accruals based on our performance versus our objective at that time. In this year's second quarter, these same incentives are generally accrued at higher amounts, reflecting the impact of our recent performance and causing a year-over-year variance of $41 million. Excluding this year-over-year difference in incentive accruals, adjusted operating expenses would have increased only 4.2%.
Second, sales organization was higher as a result of growth in gross profit dollars. These are costs we would expect to see, given our performance for the quarter. Sales costs also increased, although to a lesser extent, as a result of hiring additional marketing associates over the last year. 
As we discussed last quarter, some of this increase in MAs is related to normal hiring to replace attrition and support growth. However, certain markets added MAs because they lost more than they planned when we implemented our sales reorganization a couple of years ago. As a reminder, it takes roughly 18 months for an MA to be fully productive. 
Third, as we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to experience higher delivery costs in our Broadline operations. As Bill mentioned, we have a number of initiatives that are in various stages of implementation that we anticipate will help to reduce these costs and increase productivity to mitigate these increases. 
And lastly, payroll increased due to newly acquired operations, including Metropolitan Poultry, the joint venture in Costa Rica we entered into last fiscal year and Iowa Premium Beef.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $396 million, up 3.1% from  [ph] the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 3.3%, down 14 basis points from last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.1% compared to 35.4% in the prior year period. The majority of this change is the result of reduced state taxes from legal restructuring as well as a growing base of business in international jurisdictions that have lower tax rates. Adjusted net earnings increased 5.5% to $245 million, and adjusted EPS increased 5.1% to $0.41. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations declined $6 million to $452 million for the first half of the fiscal year. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by 2 items: first, the cash impact of certain items increased $96 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses; second, we made a $50 million pension contribution in the first half of this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year. 
With respect to working capital, our usage increased year-over-year, mainly due to an increase in sales and inventory driven by increased inflation and case growth.
Cash tax payments for the first half of fiscal year were $179 million lower than last year due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced taxable earnings. 
Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, totaled $296 million for the first half of the fiscal year compared to $247 million last year. Roughly half of the $49 million year-over-year increase is due to the timing of investments in our fleet, with the remainder coming from IT projects that are related to integration planning. 
Free cash flow was $157 million in the first half of this fiscal year compared to $211 million in the prior year period. These results include the $96 million increase in the cash impact of certain items to cash flows from operations and the $50 million increase in pension contributions I mentioned earlier, as well as a $16 million [ph] increase in capital spending related to merger integration. After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $324 million or an increase of $107 million.
As we discussed last quarter, in October, we issued $5 billion in debt. The proceeds of the offering are intended to fund the various elements of the US Foods transaction. As we closed on the new debt issuance, we've simultaneously terminated both the bridge facility and the related pre-issuance hedges, both of which were put in place as part of the financing strategy for the merger. 
Following the unwinding of the hedges, we paid $59 million in September to settle the hedge against our 10-year note issuance. In October, we paid $130 million to settle the hedge against our 30-year debt issuance, which is shown as a financing activity in our cash flow statement in the second fiscal quarter. The financial impact of the unwind of the hedges will be amortized into earnings over 10 years and 30 years, respectively.
Regarding our outlook into the third quarter and the remainder of the year, there are several additional items I'd like to point out. First, as discussed on the last quarter's call, we continue to implement our category management initiative as planned and are pleased with the progress we've made in integrating this approach to our business. The favorable year-over-year impact has been meaningful to our performance over the last 3 quarters, but we expect it will begin to moderate in the fourth quarter.
Second, regarding cost per case in our North American Broadline business, we had communicated last quarter that we expected that it would be difficult to meet our objective of keeping cost per case flat year-over-year. For the first half of the year, cost per case increased to $0.10. 
While we expect year-over-year cost increases can moderate in the second half of the year, we no longer expect cost per case to be flat for the full year. Instead, we now anticipate an increase of approximately $0.05 to $0.10 for the fiscal year. 
Third, with regard to fuel expense, we have been evaluating the impact on our business of the recent climb in crude prices. While diesel prices have declined more than 20% over the course of the fiscal year, our program of entering into forward fuel purchase contracts moved the impact of price changes over time. As a result, we did not have a material change in fuel expense in the second quarter or first half of this fiscal year. However, we do expect a roughly $50 million [ph] decline in fuel expense over the second half of the fiscal year. This modest projected benefit will likely be offset, to some degree, by lower fuel surcharges.
Fourth, as a reminder, we continue to expect to report approximately $40 million in incremental merger-related interest expense per quarter, which we will exclude from our adjusted numbers until the close of the merger.
And finally, I wanted to speak for a moment about our outlook for share repurchases. Our approach to repurchases for the last several years has been to buy back shares throughout the year, with the goal of keeping shares outstanding relatively constant. However, during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying shares due to the pending merger. This has had the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first half of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employee stock options and RAC brands. 
We are not prepared to comment about if or when we may resume buying back shares. However, if we bought no shares for the remainder of the year, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than 597 million shares for the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock exercises that occur and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the proposed US Foods merger.
Turning to an update on our proposed merger with US Foods. We believe that the divestiture agreement we announced today fully addresses the FTC's concerns. Upon closing of the Sysco-US Foods merger, this definitive agreement will include selling 11 US Foods operating locations, representing $4.6 billion in annual sales to Performance Food Group. Sysco would receive $850 million in cash in return from PFG. 
The divested markets will expand Performance Food Group's geographic footprint in the U.S. and enable it to compete more effectively for both larger and smaller customers. The divested locations are Corona, California; Denver, Colorado; Kansas City, Kansas; Phoenix, Arizona; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Cleveland, Ohio; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
In addition, Sysco and Performance Food Group have signed a multiyear transition services agreement to ensure a smooth transfer of assets from  US Foods to Performance Food Group. provides various support services and personnel to help Performance Food Group succeed as the new business owner in these locations. 
Clearly, this development has implications for our synergy expectations. It's important to remember that integration planning work has been under way over the past year, which has enabled us to refine and enhance our confidence in our synergy estimates. As a direct result of this work, we determine that growth synergies related to the transaction were substantially higher than previous estimate. 
As reducing our revised synergy estimates to reflect the facilities to be divested, we now expect net annualized operating synergies to be at least $600 million after 4 years. Our current expectation is that operating synergies will begin to accumulate in year 2 following the close of the transaction. 
In addition to operating synergies, there are substantial financial synergies related to the transaction, including interest savings totaling approximately $150 million [ph] annually and cash tax savings from the realization of acquired NOLs totaling approximately $150 million. We expect to realize both of these financial synergies in the first year following the close of the transaction.
We have also updated our expectations regarding the cost to integrate the 2 companies. We continue to expect that incremental merger expenses will total approximately $700 million to $800 million over 4 years. In addition, we expect the incremental capital spend required to integrate will total approximately $300 million to $400 million over 4 years. 
Now while the actual gross costs to integrate will be higher than those incremental costs I just mentioned, we expect to fund a portion of these costs from our current operating and capital expense run rates. We now expect the transaction to be accretive in the second year following the close of the transaction, excluding costs to integrate the company and deal-related amortization.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

One of the things we want to be careful this morning is we don't want to be in a position where we're trying to articulate a point of view of the FTC. They'll have plenty of opportunity to do that. So what I would say is a good -- a very high percentage of the conversation over the last several weeks and really months has been around their concern of -- they believe that there's a national -- they believe that there are customers out there that will only buy from distributors who have a national footprint. We disagree with that. We see the with that every day. Customers, some of these larger customers will buy from multiple distributors. They might buy from regionals or multi-regionals, and they buy from us and/or U.S. or PFG, and they obviously buy from specialty firms. Some may buy from only a few of us, some may actually but most of their business with 1 or 2 of us. But our point of view is that when we compete for that business, we're competing not just with US Foods and PFG but DMA but with a lot of regionals who are now multi-regionals. And even with the -- even in a situation where certain customers will work with a fewer number of distributors, that opportunity to work [indiscernible] is always in the room where you're negotiating an RFP or new business. So I think, again, I can't make the case for them, but I think that's where we spend a lot of time in the conversation of how we address their concerns about how these customers continue to get service and appropriate pricing. And that is why we ultimately, even though we disagree with the position, we're willing to put forth a divestiture package, which we believe, from our perspective based on our knowledge of the business, our knowledge of the competitive landscape, should allow PFG to go out and compete very well in the way that the FTC would hope. So that's my best way of describing it today. As we said, we'll have some more opportunity to speak with the FTC and the 5 commissioners here over the next week or 2 and I'm sure there'll be more information coming out of those meetings."

When we put our first synergy number out on the table, feel like I have to keep reminding ourselves, as well as everybody else, it was with essentially publicly available information. We didn't have a lot of additional information. We had some experience at Sysco dealing with some of these buckets of opportunities. We have done some category management work. We have done route optimization. And so we knew that -- this is what we've been able to do, what can we do if we combine them, and we made some assumption. And we made prudent assumptions but not overly aggressive. We're going to be candid about that. As we've learned a lot more about this, I would say every bucket probably increased in size, certainly around merchandising and supply chain, I will say inbound and outbound delivery transportation, those buckets got quite a lot larger. So we founded across-the-board but in certain places, we found more. And so we rebuilt synergies from the bottom up using more information through our integration planning efforts. There is still about of information we are not allowed to have access to, and we're abiding by all those rules. So we expect that when we eventually close, and we get access to some additional information, we'll true this up again. But we made pretty good assumptions and we're still being what I would call prudent. We're not being overly aggressive or overly conservative."

And so in those markets where energy has been strong, we've struggled to some extent. Too early to tell if that's going to abate. The other part of it, quite candidly, is we've had some internal issues in certain of the markets where as we've centralized some of our hiring practices and to coordinate that process between the OpCo and our SBS center, we went pretty fast and aggressively, and there were some markets where we didn't execute as well as we should have.

Fuel surcharges on the street are different and obviously, they can change on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. So the concept of ""giving them up"" that doesn't -- it's harder for me to address. I will say this. We look at fuel, we look at what's happening to fuel. We did not raise fuel surcharges when fuel prices started going up, and that was kind of one of the luxuries of our forward buying strategy. It gave us time to assess what was really going on before we needed to react. Now that they're coming down, we are looking at it actively to see what the appropriate market and for our customers, and we'll continue to look at that. What we wanted to flag is it's a big story out there, there's a reason why it doesn't impact our fuel cost because of the way we smooth on an ongoing basis. So it hasn't in the first half, we're flagging that it will, to the extent at least of $15 million [ph] which has been our overall cost structure is a very small amount.

As we've gone through the integration planning process, we've continued to refine our thinking there. And the one thing I can tell you is there is no good science around predicting that. I can make a guess, you can make a guess and we could be wildly different in our guesses. And then secondly, there's no way to measure it even after the fact. And so what we've done instead is just try to get into what would cause a customer to want to leave, and then what can we do reason by reason to mitigate that risk. And so we've spent an enormous amount of time through all of our integration planning teams to go after those issues. Everything that we're working on is based in the principle of we want to make this as -- the least disruptive to our customers as we possibly can, our customers and US Foods customers as we possibly can. And so we're not spending a lot of time trying to estimate potential disruption or losses of customers. We're spending a lot of our time try to make sure that we know what might cause them to leave and how we're going to address that right out-of-the-box so they don't leave. Now to address your question, we're calling these net operational synergies because we do believe it takes into account what we might see in the way of disruption. But it's our estimate, and we frankly hope that we're going to be wrong and it's going to be better than that."

I think we're hopeful that some of this positive consumer sentiment that's been out there for a while begins to get to our customer base and then that will translate into more industry growth. Our quarterly numbers, as you track them, you see they've been floating around between 2% and 3% real here over the last few quarters. We do have positive growth for the locally managed customers now, which we didn't have a year ago, so that's a big part of it coming back to mix in a different way, customer mix. We've spent, as you can appreciate, a lot of time and effort over the last 15 months with best practices and how to manage margin better and still effectively deliver customers' needs in terms of offerings. But clearly, the category management is driving a fair amount of it right now. And we're doing a better job of integrating that, as I've said in my prepared comments, in the everyday business activities. So I would say that's a large part of it."

But what we've been able to do and we did -- when we talked out about it last earnings call, we've been able to go in and put in some significant enhancements into the software that are now being utilized by the 12 OpCos that are on, on the core SAP software platform. And the other thing we're doing more of, which we spoke to here today is taking some of the other applications, whether they're financial or HR, maintenance, that type of thing even for the non-SAP OpCos, bringing those into SBS, accelerating that work to where SBS is now supporting in certain areas, not just the 12 OpCos that are on SAP, but these other functional support software packages as well. So it's a -- to summarize, I think it's a combination of we're continuing to enhance the support around and the software that the 12 OpCos you are seeing, as well as beginning to leverage SBS in a different way and as I said, so that A, we're providing better service to the 12 OpCos today but also when we do begin to redeploy again, those future conversions can go more smoothly.

And hello, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased nearly 8% to $12.1 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 6% to $245 million",1311,"Thank you, Shannon. And hello, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased nearly 8% to $12.1 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 6% to $245 million. Adjusted EPS increased 5% to $0.41 for the quarter. 
     
Our second quarter financial results were generally in line with our expectations as we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance. Most important, our associates remain highly focused on providing excellent service to our customers in what remains an extremely competitive market environment. 
We generated nearly 4% case volume growth during the quarter and effectively managed acute inflationary pressures in our meat and dairy categories. Specifically, case growth trends in our locally managed Broadline business were favorable in most of the geographic markets we serve. 
In addition, we generated solid case growth once again with our corporate managed customers in the restaurant and travel and leisure segments. Our performance during the quarter was due in part to the benefits we realized from our portfolio of business transformation initiatives, especially category management, as our ability to effectively integrate these initiatives in our steady-state operating activities has improved consistently over time. 
While we are pleased with our overall performance during the quarter, we did fall short of our expense management targets. Expense increases were driven primarily by higher incentive accruals, selling costs and delivery costs. Excluding certain items and the unfavorable impact of incentive accruals, operating expenses increased 4%. 
As I've mentioned previously, Sysco's single largest opportunity for improvement remains more consistent execution across the organization. We are implementing tools to provide increased visibility to key performance metrics as well as improve best practices. While we are seeing some level of improvement in this area and believe we are on the right path, we have more work to do. 
Regarding overall industry trends, current restaurant data shows modest signs of gradual improvement. NPD, which tracks restaurant trends, recently reported positive traffic growth in the mid-scale and casual dining sectors for the first time since 2008. This is encouraging news as the casual dining sector includes a significant number of independent restaurant customers for whom we provide substantial value-added products and services. 
In addition, consumer confidence and employment metrics are, for the most part, showing improvement. We are hopeful lower fuel prices will further improve the customers' -- the consumers' outlook and lead to sustainable increased traffic and spend for our customer base.
We remain intently focused on enhancing every aspect of our business so that we are able to better support our customers, operate more efficiently and compete more effectively. Benefits from our category management initiative continue to gain momentum. We expect that all categories, representing approximately $15 billion in annual spend, will be launched into the market by the end of this fiscal year, and that we will achieve the 3-year cost savings target that we established prior to the start of fiscal 2013. In addition, we are working with our suppliers in a more strategic and effective way that we believe provides a meaningful platform for growth and innovation in our respective businesses.
Turning to an update on our technology initiatives. We continue our merger integration planning with regards to technology and have begun certain fundamental projects necessary for integration. As we move forward in deploying our ERP platform, our approach has continued to evolve. 
For instance, we have focused on broad implementations at the operating companies for several years, with a plan to convert the hub or our shared business services facility last. However, we have found that this created inefficiencies at STS that would make further rollouts challenging. Thus, we are now moving forward with the rollout of SAP financial modules for general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable as well as additional elements of the HR module, all of which are intended to make SBS function more effectively in the near term and make future ERP conversions at the operating companies relatively easier.
While focusing on operational excellence is a key area for us, we also have important work under way to identify new markets with opportunity for profitable growth. As we discussed last quarter, we've developed a robust approach to serve the fast-growing Hispanic restaurant sector. We estimate that we have 10% to 15% of this $10 billion foodservice market and believe we have a significant opportunity to better serve these customers and grow our sales. 
We made additional strides to this effort recently with the launch of our new multilingual website dedicated to support customers in this segment. The site includes news, tips, menu ideas and trend data intended to help Hispanic operators drive restaurant traffic, improve their operations and better address their customers' evolving needs.
I'm extremely proud of the efforts and accomplishments of our leadership team over the last several months. As we announced last August, Mike Green retired from Sysco at the end of the calendar year after 24 years of distinguished service. 
On January 1, Tom Bené became Executive Vice President and President, Food Service Operations, succeeding Mike. Tom reports to me and has responsibility for all business operations, sales, merchandising, marketing and revenue management. Tom is a proven commercial leader with deep expertise and a strong track record in the food service industry. 
Since joining Sysco early in 2013, he has helped drive major advances in category management, revenue management, sales capability and customer insights and segmentation. We're fortunate to have such a capable leader to succeed Mike.
In addition and also effective January 1, 2015, Scott Charlton, Senior Vice President, Distribution Services, now reports to me in an expanded role. Scott leads end-to-end supply chain operations, including warehousing, inbound and outbound transportation and replenishment. Scott joined Sysco in 2013 as well and brings great energy and expertise to our senior leadership team.
Turning to an update on our proposed merger with US Foods. Over the past 12 months, we have worked in good faith with the FTC, providing millions of pages of documents and explaining to them our industry and the merits of our proposed merger. We strongly believe that the combination of Sysco and US Foods will promote competition in what is already a highly competitive industry by positioning us to provide significant value to our customers, including lower cost. 
Unfortunately, the FTC has taken a different view of the potential competitive impacts of the merger. While we respectfully but vigorously disagree with the FTC's analysis, we announced today a substantial divestiture package that we believe fully addresses their concerns. At this time, the FTC has not agreed to this solution, so we will now present our position, including this proposed remedy to the 5 FTC commissioners and seek to obtain their approval. We remain convinced that the proposed transaction is good for our customers, our associates and our shareholders.
In closing, I am pleased with our operating performance through the first half of our fiscal year. Case growth and sales growth were up 3% and 7%, respectively, while adjusted operating income and EPS grew at a rate of 5% and 6%, respectively. In addition, many of our strategic business initiatives are gaining traction and contributing to these results. 
As we move forward into the remainder of our fiscal year, we are committed to improving the consistency of our operational execution, successfully rolling out our portfolio of initiatives and further developing our plans to integrate Sysco and US Foods.
This is a critical time in our history, and we believe the strategic actions we are taking are vital to both strengthening our customer relationships and providing solid returns to our shareholders over the long term. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so that he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter as well as the agreement we announced this morning with Performance Food Group."
189096,278898479,753031,"Sysco Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2015",2015-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $12.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year. Food cost inflation was 6%, driven mainly by double-digit inflation in the meat and dairy categories. Sales from acquis",2043,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $12.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year. Food cost inflation was 6%, driven mainly by double-digit inflation in the meat and dairy categories. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.8%, and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.9%. Case volume grew 3.6% during the quarter, including acquisitions and approximately 3.3% excluding acquisitions.
Gross profit in the second quarter was $2.1 billion, a 6.1% increase, and gross margin declined 23 basis points to 17.25%. Benefits from category management contributed to our gross profit performance during the quarter. In addition, case volume growth advanced from the prior quarter, and this increased demand, aiding gross profit performance. In our higher-margin locally managed Broadline business, case volume growth remained relatively steady and accelerated with our corporate managed customers.
Certain items for the quarter totaled $133 million and primarily related to merger and integration planning expenses. Of this amount, $81 million was recorded in operating expense and $52 million was recorded in interest expense. 
Merger and integration planning expenses that impacted operating expense were associated with professional fees to assist us in managing integration planning as well as legal and IT-related projects. Work-related integration planning peaked in the second quarter, and costs related to these efforts should decline going forward. 
Merger and integration expenses that impacted interest expense relate to the debt issuance during the quarter that is intended to finance US Foods' debt upon closing of the merger. We are treating this interest expense as a certain item until the merger closes. 
After excluding certain items, adjusted operating expense for the quarter increased $108 million or 6.8% compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by a $115 million increase in payroll expense, resulting from several factors: First, during last year's second quarter, we reduced certain management incentive accruals based on our performance versus our objectives at that time. In this year's second quarter, these same incentives are generally accrued at higher amounts, reflecting the impact of our recent performance and causing a year-over-year variance of $41 million. Excluding this year-over-year difference in incentive accruals, adjusted operating expenses would have increased only 4.2%.
Second, pay to our sales organization was higher as a result of growth in gross profit dollars. These are costs we would expect to see, given our performance for the quarter. Sales costs also increased, although to a lesser extent, as a result of hiring additional marketing associates over the last year. 
As we discussed last quarter, some of this increase in MAs is related to normal hiring to replace attrition and support growth. However, certain markets added MAs because they lost more than they planned when we implemented our sales reorganization a couple of years ago. As a reminder, it takes roughly 18 months for an MA to be fully productive. 
Third, as we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to experience higher delivery costs in our Broadline operations. As Bill mentioned, we have a number of initiatives that are in various stages of implementation that we anticipate will help to reduce these costs and increase productivity to mitigate these increases. 
And lastly, payroll increased due to newly acquired operations, including Metropolitan Poultry, the joint venture in Costa Rica we entered into last fiscal year and Iowa Premium Beef.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $396 million, up 3.1% for the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 3.3%, down 14 basis points from last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.1% compared to 35.4% in the prior year period. The majority of this change is the result of reduced state taxes from legal restructuring as well as a growing base of business in international jurisdictions that have lower tax rates. Adjusted net earnings increased 5.5% to $245 million, and adjusted EPS increased 5.1% to $0.41. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations declined $6 million to $452 million for the first half of the fiscal year. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by 2 items: first, the cash impact of certain items increased $96 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses; second, we made a $50 million pension contribution in the first half of this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year. With respect to working capital, our usage increased year-over-year, mainly due to an increase in sales and inventory driven by increased inflation and case growth.
Cash tax payments for the first half of fiscal year were $179 million lower than last year due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced taxable earnings. 
Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, totaled $296 million for the first half of the fiscal year compared to $247 million last year. Roughly half of the $49 million year-over-year increase is due to the timing of investments in our fleet, with the remainder coming from IT projects that are related to integration planning. 
Free cash flow was $157 million in the first half of this fiscal year compared to $211 million in the prior year period. These results include the $96 million increase in the cash impact of certain items to cash flows from operations and the $50 million increase in pension contributions I mentioned earlier, as well as a $16 million increase in capital spending related to merger integration. After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $324 million or an increase of $107 million.
As we discussed last quarter, in October, we issued $5 billion in debt. The proceeds of the offering are intended to fund the various elements of the US Foods' transactions. As we closed on the new debt issuance, we've simultaneously terminated both the bridge facility and the related pre-issuance hedges, both of which were put in place as part of the financing strategy for the merger. 
Following the unwinding of the hedges, we paid $59 million in September to settle the hedge against our 10-year note issuance. In October, we paid $130 million to settle the hedge against our 30-year debt issuance, which is shown as a financing activity in our cash flow statement in the second fiscal quarter. The financial impact of the unwind of the hedges will be amortized into earnings over 10 years and 30 years, respectively.
Regarding our outlook into the third quarter and the remainder of the year, there are several additional items I'd like to point out. First, as discussed on the last quarter's call, we continue to implement our category management initiative as planned and are pleased with the progress we've made in integrating this approach to our business. The favorable year-over-year impact has been meaningful to our performance over the last 3 quarters, but we expect it will begin to moderate in the fourth quarter.
Second, regarding cost per case in our North American Broadline business, we had communicated last quarter that we expected that it would be difficult to meet our objective of keeping cost per case flat year-over-year. For the first half of the year, cost per case increased to $0.10. 
While we expect year-over-year cost increases can moderate in the second half of the year, we no longer expect cost per case to be flat for the full year. Instead, we now anticipate an increase of approximately $0.05 to $0.10 for the fiscal year. 
Third, with regard to fuel expense, we had been evaluating the impact on our business of the recent decline in crude prices. While diesel prices have declined more than 20% over the course of the fiscal year, our program of entering into forward fuel purchase contracts smoothed the impact of price changes over time. As a result, we did not have a material change in fuel expense in the second quarter or first half of this fiscal year. However, we do expect a roughly $50 million decline in fuel expense over the second half of the fiscal year. This modest projected benefit will likely be offset, to some degree, by lower fuel surcharges.
 
Fourth, as a reminder, we continue to expect to report approximately $40 million in incremental merger-related interest expense per quarter, which we will exclude from our adjusted numbers until the close of the merger.
And finally, I wanted to speak for a moment about our outlook for share repurchases. Our approach to repurchases for the last several years has been to buy back shares throughout the year, with the goal of keeping shares outstanding relatively constant. However, during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying shares due to the pending merger. This has had the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first half of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employee stock options and RSU brands. 
We are not prepared to comment about if or when we may resume buying back shares. However, if we bought no shares for the remainder of the year, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than 597 million shares for the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock exercises that occur and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the proposed US Foods merger.
Turning to an update on our proposed merger with US Foods. We believe that the divestiture agreement we announced today fully addresses the FTC's concerns. Upon closing of the Sysco-US Foods merger, this definitive agreement will include selling 11 US Foods operating locations, representing $4.6 billion in annual sales to Performance Food Group. Sysco would receive $850 million in cash in return from PFG. 
The divested markets will expand Performance Food Group's geographic footprint in the U.S. and enable it to compete more effectively for both larger and smaller customers. The divested locations are Corona, California; Denver, Colorado; Kansas City, Kansas; Phoenix, Arizona; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Cleveland, Ohio; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
In addition, Sysco and Performance Food Group have signed a multiyear transition services agreement to ensure a smooth transfer of assets from US Foods to Performance Food Group. The TSA provides various support services and personnel to help Performance Food Group succeed as the new business owner in these locations. 
Clearly, this development has implications for our synergy expectations. It's important to remember that integration planning work has been under way over the past year, which has enabled us to refine and enhance our confidence in our synergy estimates. As a direct result of this work, we determine that growth synergies related to the transaction were substantially higher than previous estimates. 
At reducing our revised synergy estimates to reflect the facilities to be divested, we now expect net annualized operating synergies to be at least $600 million after 4 years. Our current expectation is that operating synergies will begin to accumulate in year 2 following the close of the transaction. 
In addition to operating synergies, there are substantial financial synergies related to the transaction, including interest savings totaling approximately $115 million annually and cash tax savings from the realization of acquired NOLs totaling approximately $150 million. We expect to realize both of these financial synergies in the first year following the close of the transaction.
We have also updated our expectations regarding the cost to integrate the 2 companies. We continue to expect that incremental merger expenses will total approximately $700 million to $800 million over 4 years. In addition, we expect the incremental capital spend required to integrate will total approximately $300 million to $400 million over 4 years. 
Now while the actual gross costs to integrate will be higher than those incremental costs I just mentioned, we expect to fund a portion of these costs from our current operating and capital expense run rates. We now expect the transaction to be accretive in the second year following the close of the transaction, excluding costs to integrate the company and deal-related amortization.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

One of the things we want to be careful this morning is we don't want to be in a position where we're trying to articulate a point of view of the FTC. They'll have plenty of opportunity to do that. So what I would say is a good -- a very high percentage of the conversation over the last several weeks and really months has been around their concern of -- they believe that there's a national market. They believe that there are customers out there that will only buy from distributors who have a national footprint. We disagree with that. We see and live that every day, where customers, some of these larger customers will buy from multiple distributors. They might buy from regionals or multi-regionals, and they may buy from us and/or U.S. or PFG, and they obviously buy from specialty firms. Some may buy from only a few of us, some may actually put most of their business with 1 or 2 of us. But our point of view is that when we compete for that business, we're competing not just with US Foods and PFG, but -- DMA, but with a lot of regionals who are now multi-regionals. And even with the -- even in a situation where certain customers will work with a fewer number of distributors, that opportunity to work with more Zoes in the room when you're negotiating an RFP or new business. So I think, again, I can't make their case for them, but I think that's been where we spent a lot of the time in the conversation of how we address their concerns about how these customers continue to get good service and appropriate pricing. And that is why we ultimately, even though we disagree with the position, we're willing to put forth a divestiture package and -- which we believe, from our perspective based on our knowledge of the business, our knowledge of the competitive landscape, should allow PFG to go out and compete very well in the way that the FTC would hope. So that's my best way of describing it today. As we said, we'll have some more opportunity to speak with the FTC and the 5 commissioners here over the next week or 2 and I'm sure there'll be more information coming out of those meetings."

Financial synergies we expect to achieve in the first year after closing. The operational synergies, we expect to start accruing in the second year after closing. And then the middle question there really around where do we find the additional synergies. When we put our first synergy number out on the table, feel like I have to keep reminding ourselves, as well as everybody else, it was with essentially publicly available information. We didn't have a lot of additional information. We had some experience at Sysco dealing with some of these buckets of opportunities. We have done some category management work. We have done route optimization. And so we knew that -- this is what we've been able to do, what can we do if we combine them, and we made some assumptions. And we made prudent assumptions but not overly aggressive. We're going to be candid about that. As we've learned a lot more about this, I would say every bucket probably increased in size. Certainly around merchandising and supply chain, we'll say inbound and outbound delivery transportation, those buckets got quite a lot larger. So we found it across-the-board but in certain places, we found more. And so we rebuilt synergies from the bottom up using more information through our integration planning efforts. There is still a lot of information we're not allowed to have access to, and we're abiding by all those rules.

Some of the work we're doing with these initiatives in the technology area or so, in costs, are up a little more than we've planned but our gross profit is higher. So that one doesn't concern me as much. So that takes you to supply chain operations. And we just got more work to do there in terms of improving our productivity at a rate commensurate with when our costs go up. And we tend to be very good in this area, but we've got a lot of initiatives going on in this area as well. I mentioned Scott, and he's been with us for a couple of years. And with our new enterprise structure, his functional group working hand-in-hand with our operating company leadership to basically strike the right balance between what we need to do to support our customers each and every day, but also put in better and more consistent best practices, monitoring better, get our composition schemes in line with our productivity. So a lot of work being done in that area and more to do, but I would say that's where the biggest opportunity is. All right. So the merger -- I would say on the merger, Chris talked to this, and I'll let him kind of address it again. I think what -- I think we're seeing opportunities through these synergies to do better. The challenge there will be to do what we've done a nice job of so far. I mean, so far, we'd speak -- be really proud as a management team and, frankly, all of our folks, we've done a nice job of being able to separate all the work and all the hours and the pressure that's going on with the integration planning and still be able to run our business pretty well. So that's the biggest challenge I see post-close here, is to continue to run these businesses but drive out, at that point, the synergies. So I think when we get to that point, we'll talk to you more and we'll have to come up with some ways to speak to how we're making progress there and still making sure we're shipping groceries in the right way to our customers."

And so on those markets, where energy has been strong, we've struggled to some extent. Too early to tell if that's going to abate. The other part of it, quite candidly, is we've had some internal issues in certain of the markets, where as we centralized some of our hiring practices and begun to coordinate that process between the OpCo and our SBS center, we went pretty fast and aggressively, and there were some markets where we didn't execute as well as we should have.

So a lot of this inflation is in these higher dollar cost boxes of meat and dairy this last quarter. So it's partially mixed. It certainly is -- partially, it's hard to pass it along, to your point.

So if they can offer more poultry dishes or other types of à la carte items that supplant maybe what they've formerly done with cheese or with beef then there's some of that going on as well. I mean, our case growth still is very good in these inflationary categories. I think it's a mix. I think it's trying to find the right price point, if you will, for our customers.

And I think we're starting to see nice traction there on that part of it. Longer term, we see it as an opportunity to really differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with expanded product lines, maybe broader, not as deep, perhaps in some of the SKUs that don't move as fast so where we can have more customized offerings to customers as we better understand their needs and better understand the process, and then also use this platform to bring more innovation to the offerings.

First, I mean, fuel charges are a bit different when you think about it with our larger customers and our smaller customers. With the larger customers, we may have contracts that are pegged to a certain fuel price. They may go up, they may go down, they last for periods of time. That's not something that you just ""give up"" because they're restructured into the cost structure of the contract. Fuel surcharges on The Street are different and, obviously, they can change on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. So the concept of ""giving them up"" that doesn't -- it's harder for me to address. I will say this: We look at fuel and we look at what's happening to fuel. We did not raise fuel surcharges when fuel prices started going up, and that was kind of one of the luxuries of our forward-buying strategy. It gave us time to assess what was really going on before we needed to react. Now that they're coming down, we are looking at it actively to see what the appropriate [indiscernible] market and for our customers, and we'll continue to look at that. What we wanted to flag is it's a big story out there, there's a reason why it doesn't impact our fuel cost because of the way we smooth on an ongoing basis. So it hasn't in the first half. We're flagging that it will, to the extent at least of $15 million which had been our overall cost structure is a very small amount. But that's what we need to look at when we think about the fuel surcharges, how much of that amount might need to be mitigated with adjustments to the surcharge."

And the one thing I can tell you is there is no good science around predicting that. I can make a guess, you can make a guess and we could be wildly different in our guesses. And then secondly, there's no real way to measure it even after the fact. And so what we've done instead is just try to get into what would cause a customer to want to leave, and then what can we do, reason by reason, to mitigate that risk. And so we've spent an enormous amount of time through all of our integration planning teams to go after those issues. Everything that we're working on is based on the principle of we want to make this as least -- the least disruptive to our customers as we possibly can -- our customers and US Foods' customers, as we possibly can. And so we're not spending a lot of time trying to estimate potential disruption or losses of customers. We're spending a lot of our time trying to make sure that we know what might cause them to leave and how we're going to address that right out-of-the-box so they don't leave. Now to address your question, we're calling these net operational synergies because we do believe it takes into account what we might see in the way of disruption. But it's our estimate, and we, frankly, hope that we're going to be wrong and it's going to be better than that."

Ed, I think we're hopeful on the -- that some of this positive consumer sentiment that's been out there for a while begins to get to our customer base, and then that will translate into more industry growth. Our quarterly numbers, as you track them, you see they've been floating around between 2% and 3% real here over the last few quarters. We do have positive growth for the locally managed customers now, which we didn't have a year ago. So that's a big part of it, which is coming back to mix in a different way, customer mix. We've spent, as you can appreciate, a lot of time and effort over the last 15 months with best practices and how to manage margin better and still effectively deliver what customers' need in terms of offerings. But clearly, the category management is driving a fair amount of it right now. And we're doing a better job of integrating it, as I've said in my prepared comments, into the everyday business activities. So I would say that's a large part of it."

I think it's more of what we talked about over the last couple of quarters in terms of we are not doing new deployments right now until we have a better sense for where the merger is going to play out and when and some of the geographic issues that will come with that. But what we've been able to do when we did -- what we talked out about in the last earnings call, we've been able to go in and put in some significant enhancements into the software that are now being utilized by the 12 OpCos that are on, on the core SAP software platform. And the other thing we're doing more of, which we spoke to here today, is taking some of the other applications, whether they're financial or HR, maintenance, that type of thing even for the SA -- even for the non-SAP OpCos, bringing those into SBS, accelerating that work to where SBS is now supporting in certain areas, not just the 12 OpCos that are on SAP, but these other functional support software packages as well. So it's a -- to summarize, I think, Vinny, it's a combination of we're continuing to enhance the support around and the software that the 12 OpCos are using as well as beginning to leverage SBS in a different way and as I said, so that A, we're providing better service to the 12 OpCos today but also when we do begin to redeploy again, those future conversions can go more smoothly. And then we're still -- we're going to defer any further deployments until we understand the timing of the merger a little bit better."

And hello, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased nearly 8% to $12.1 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 6% to $245 million",1311,"Thank you, Shannon. And hello, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased nearly 8% to $12.1 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 6% to $245 million. Adjusted EPS increased 5% to $0.41 for the quarter. 
   
Our second quarter financial results were generally in line with our expectations as we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance. Most important, our associates remain highly focused on providing excellent service to our customers in what remains an extremely competitive market environment. 
We generated nearly 4% case volume growth during the quarter and effectively managed acute inflationary pressures in our meat and dairy categories. Specifically, case growth trends in our locally managed Broadline business were favorable in most of the geographic markets we serve. 
In addition, we generated solid case growth once again with our corporate managed customers in the restaurant and travel and leisure segments. Our performance during the quarter was due in part to the benefits we realized from our portfolio of business transformation initiatives, especially category management, as our ability to effectively integrate these initiatives in our steady-state operating activities has improved consistently over time. 
While we are pleased with our overall performance during the quarter, we did fall short of our expense management targets. Expense increases were driven primarily by higher incentive accruals, selling costs and delivery costs. Excluding certain items and the unfavorable impact of incentive accruals, operating expenses increased 4%. 
As I've mentioned previously, Sysco's single largest opportunity for improvement remains more consistent execution across the organization. We are implementing tools to provide increased visibility to key performance metrics as well as improve best practices. While we are seeing some level of improvement in this area and believe we are on the right path, we have more work to do. 
Regarding overall industry trends, current restaurant data shows modest signs of gradual improvement. NPD, which tracks restaurant trends, recently reported positive traffic growth in the mid-scale and casual dining sectors for the first time since 2008. This is encouraging news as the casual dining sector includes a significant number of independent restaurant customers for whom we provide substantial value-added products and services. 
In addition, consumer confidence and employment metrics are, for the most part, showing improvement. We are hopeful lower fuel prices will further improve the customers' -- the consumers' outlook and lead to sustainable increased traffic and spend for our customer base.
We remain intently focused on enhancing every aspect of our business so that we are able to better support our customers, operate more efficiently and compete more effectively. Benefits from our category management initiative continue to gain momentum. We expect that all categories, representing approximately $15 billion in annual spend, will be launched into the market by the end of this fiscal year, and that we will achieve the 3-year cost savings target that we established prior to the start of fiscal 2013. In addition, we are working with our suppliers in a more strategic and effective way that we believe provides a meaningful platform for growth and innovation in our respective businesses.
Turning to an update on our technology initiatives. We continue our merger integration planning with regards to technology and have begun certain fundamental projects necessary for integration. As we move forward in deploying our ERP platform, our approach has continued to evolve. 
For instance, we have focused on broad implementations at the operating companies for several years, with a plan to convert the hub, or our shared business services facility, last. However, we have found that this created inefficiencies at SBS that would make further rollouts challenging. Thus, we are now moving forward with the rollout of SAP financial modules for general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable as well as additional elements of the HR module, all of which are intended to make SBS function more effectively in the near term and make future ERP conversions at the operating companies relatively easier.
While focusing on operational excellence is a key area for us, we also have important work under way to identify new markets with opportunity for profitable growth. As we discussed last quarter, we've developed a robust approach to serve the fast-growing Hispanic restaurant sector. We estimate that we have 10% to 15% of this $10 billion foodservice market and believe we have a significant opportunity to better serve these customers and grow our sales. 
We made additional strides to this effort recently with the launch of our new multilingual website dedicated to support customers in this segment. The site includes news, tips, menu ideas and trend data intended to help Hispanic operators drive restaurant traffic, improve their operations and better address their customers' evolving needs.
I'm extremely proud of the efforts and accomplishments of our leadership team over the last several months. As we announced last August, Mike Green retired from Sysco at the end of the calendar year after 24 years of distinguished service. 
On January 1, Tom Bené became Executive Vice President and President, Food Service Operations, succeeding Mike. Tom reports to me and has responsibility for all business operations, sales, merchandising, marketing and revenue management. Tom is a proven commercial leader with deep expertise and a strong track record in the food service industry. 
Since joining Sysco early in 2013, he has helped drive major advances in category management, revenue management, sales capability and customer insights and segmentation. We're fortunate to have such a capable leader to succeed Mike.
In addition and also effective January 1, 2015, Scott Charlton, Senior Vice President, Distribution Services, now reports to me in an expanded role. Scott leads end-to-end supply chain operations, including warehousing, inbound and outbound transportation and replenishment. Scott joined Sysco in 2013 as well and brings great energy and expertise to our senior leadership team.
Turning to an update on our proposed merger with US Foods. Over the past 12 months, we have worked in good faith with the FTC, providing millions of pages of documents and explaining to them our industry and the merits of our proposed merger. We strongly believe that the combination of Sysco and US Foods will promote competition in what is already a highly competitive industry by positioning us to provide significant value to our customers, including lower cost. 
Unfortunately, the FTC has taken a different view of the potential competitive impacts of the merger. While we respectfully but vigorously disagree with the FTC's analysis, we announced today a substantial divestiture package that we believe fully addresses their concerns. At this time, the FTC has not agreed to this solution, so we will now present our position, including this proposed remedy to the 5 FTC commissioners and seek to obtain their approval. We remain convinced that the proposed transaction is good for our customers, our associates and our shareholders.
In closing, I am pleased with our operating performance through the first half of our fiscal year. Case growth and sales growth were up 3% and 7%, respectively, while adjusted operating income and EPS grew at a rate of 5% and 6%, respectively. In addition, many of our strategic business initiatives are gaining traction and contributing to these results. 
As we move forward into the remainder of our fiscal year, we are committed to improving the consistency of our operational execution, successfully rolling out our portfolio of initiatives and further developing our plans to integrate Sysco and US Foods.
This is a critical time in our history, and we believe the strategic actions we are taking are vital to both strengthening our customer relationships and providing solid returns to our shareholders over the long term. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so that he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter as well as the agreement we announced this morning with Performance Food Group."
189096,278898479,753135,"Sysco Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2015",2015-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $12.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year. Food cost inflation was 6%, driven mainly by double-digit inflation in the meat and dairy categories. Sales from acquis",2044,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $12.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year. Food cost inflation was 6%, driven mainly by double-digit inflation in the meat and dairy categories. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.8%, and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.9%. Case volume grew 3.6% during the quarter, including acquisitions and approximately 3.3% excluding acquisitions.
Gross profit in the second quarter was $2.1 billion, a 6.1% increase, and gross margin declined 23 basis points to 17.25%. Benefits from category management contributed to our gross profit performance during the quarter. In addition, case volume growth advanced from the prior quarter, and this increased demand is aiding gross profit performance. In our higher-margin locally managed Broadline business, case volume growth remained relatively steady and accelerated with our corporate managed customers.
Certain items for the quarter totaled $133 million and primarily related to merger and integration planning expenses. Of this amount, $81 million was recorded in operating expense and $52 million was recorded in interest expense. 
Merger and integration planning expenses that impacted operating expense were associated with professional fees to assist us in managing integration planning as well as legal and IT-related projects. Work-related integration planning peaked in the second quarter, and costs related to these efforts should decline going forward. 
Merger and integration expenses that impacted interest expense relate to the debt issuance during the quarter that is intended to finance US Foods' debt upon closing of the merger. We are treating this interest expense as a certain item until the merger closes. 
After excluding certain items, adjusted operating expense for the quarter increased $108 million or 6.8% compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by a $115 million increase in payroll expense, resulting from several factors: First, during last year's second quarter, we reduced certain management incentive accruals based on our performance versus our objectives at that time. In this year's second quarter, these same incentives are generally accrued at higher amounts, reflecting the impact of our recent performance and causing a year-over-year variance of $41 million. Excluding this year-over-year difference in incentive accruals, adjusted operating expenses would have increased only 4.2%.
Second, pay to our sales organization was higher as a result of growth in gross profit dollars. These are costs we would expect to see, given our performance for the quarter. Sales costs also increased, although to a lesser extent, as a result of hiring additional marketing associates over the last year. 
As we discussed last quarter, some of this increase in MAs is related to normal hiring to replace attrition and support growth. However, certain markets added MAs because they lost more than they planned when we implemented our sales reorganization a couple of years ago. As a reminder, it takes roughly 18 months for an MA to be fully productive. 
Third, as we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to experience higher delivery costs in our Broadline operations. As Bill mentioned, we have a number of initiatives that are in various stages of implementation that we anticipate will help to reduce these costs and increase productivity to mitigate these increases. 
And lastly, payroll increased due to newly acquired operations, including Metropolitan Poultry, the joint venture in Costa Rica we entered into last fiscal year and Iowa Premium Beef.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $396 million, up 3.1% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 3.3%, down 14 basis points from last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.1% compared to 35.4% in the prior year period. The majority of this change is the result of reduced state taxes from legal restructuring as well as a growing base of business in international jurisdictions that have lower tax rates. Adjusted net earnings increased 5.5% to $245 million, and adjusted EPS increased 5.1% to $0.41. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations declined $6 million to $452 million for the first half of the fiscal year. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by 2 items: first, the cash impact of certain items increased $96 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses; second, we made a $50 million pension contribution in the first half of this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year. With respect to working capital, our usage increased year-over-year, mainly due to an increase in sales and inventory driven by increased inflation and case growth.
Cash tax payments for the first half of fiscal year were $179 million lower than last year due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced taxable earnings. 
Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, totaled $296 million for the first half of the fiscal year compared to $247 million last year. Roughly half of the $49 million year-over-year increase is due to the timing of investments in our fleet, with the remainder coming from IT projects that are related to integration planning. 
Free cash flow was $157 million in the first half of this fiscal year compared to $211 million in the prior year period. These results include the $96 million increase in the cash impact of certain items to cash flows from operations and the $50 million increase in pension contributions I mentioned earlier, as well as a $16 million increase in capital spending related to merger integration. After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $324 million or an increase of $107 million.
As we discussed last quarter, in October, we issued $5 billion in debt. The proceeds of the offering are intended to fund the various elements of the US Foods' transactions. As we closed on the new debt issuance, we've simultaneously terminated both the bridge facility and the related pre-issuance hedges, both of which were put in place as part of the financing strategy for the merger. 
Following the unwinding of the hedges, we paid $59 million in September to settle the hedge against our 10-year note issuance. In October, we paid $130 million to settle the hedge against our 30-year debt issuance, which is shown as a financing activity in our cash flow statement in the second fiscal quarter. The financial impact of the unwind of the hedges will be amortized into earnings over 10 years and 30 years, respectively.
Regarding our outlook into the third quarter and the remainder of the year, there are several additional items I'd like to point out. First, as discussed on the last quarter's call, we continue to implement our category management initiative as planned and are pleased with the progress we've made in integrating this approach to our business. The favorable year-over-year impact has been meaningful to our performance over the last 3 quarters, but we expect it will begin to moderate in the fourth quarter.
Second, regarding cost per case in our North American Broadline business, we had communicated last quarter that we expected that it would be difficult to meet our objective of keeping cost per case flat year-over-year. For the first half of the year, cost per case increased $0.10. 
While we expect year-over-year cost increases to moderate in the second half of the year, we no longer expect cost per case to be flat for the full year. Instead, we now anticipate an increase of approximately $0.05 to $0.10 for the fiscal year. 
Third, with regard to fuel expense, we had been evaluating the impact on our business of the recent decline in crude prices. While diesel prices have declined more than 20% over the course of the fiscal year, our program of entering into forward fuel purchase contracts smoothed the impact of price changes over time. As a result, we did not have a material change in fuel expense in the second quarter or first half of this fiscal year. However, we do expect a roughly $50 million [ph] decline in fuel expense over the second half of the fiscal year. This modest projected benefit will likely be offset, to some degree, by lower fuel surcharges.
 
Fourth, as a reminder, we continue to expect to report approximately $40 million in incremental merger-related interest expense per quarter, which we will exclude from our adjusted numbers until the close of the merger.
And finally, I wanted to speak for a moment about our outlook for share repurchases. Our approach to repurchases for the last several years has been to buy back shares throughout the year, with the goal of keeping shares outstanding relatively constant. However, during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying shares due to the pending merger. This has had the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first half of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employee stock options and RSU grants.
We are not prepared to comment about if or when we may resume buying back shares. However, if we bought no shares for the remainder of the year, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than 597 million shares for the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock exercises that occur and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the proposed US Foods merger.
Turning to an update on our proposed merger with US Foods. We believe that the divestiture agreement we announced today fully addresses the FTC's concerns. Upon closing of the Sysco-US Foods merger, this definitive agreement will include selling 11 US Foods operating locations, representing $4.6 billion in annual sales to Performance Food Group. Sysco would receive $850 million in cash in return from PFG. 
The divested markets will expand Performance Food Group's geographic footprint in the U.S. and enable it to compete more effectively for both larger and smaller customers. The divested locations are Corona, California; Denver, Colorado; Kansas City, Kansas; Phoenix, Arizona; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Cleveland, Ohio; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
In addition, Sysco and Performance Food Group have signed a multiyear transition services agreement to ensure a smooth transfer of assets from US Foods to Performance Food Group. The TSA provides various support services and personnel to help Performance Food Group succeed as the new business owner in these locations. 
Clearly, this development has implications for our synergy expectations. It's important to remember that integration planning work has been under way over the past year, which has enabled us to refine and enhance our confidence in our synergy estimates. As a direct result of this work, we determine that growth synergies related to the transaction were substantially higher than previous estimates. 
After reducing our revised synergy estimates to reflect the facilities to be divested, we now expect net annualized operating synergies to be at least $600 million after 4 years. Our current expectation is that operating synergies will begin to accumulate in year 2 following the close of the transaction. 
In addition to operating synergies, there are substantial financial synergies related to the transaction, including interest savings totaling approximately $115 million annually and cash tax savings from the realization of acquired NOLs totaling approximately $150 million. We expect to realize both of these financial synergies in the first year following the close of the transaction.
We have also updated our expectations regarding the cost to integrate the 2 companies. We continue to expect that incremental merger expenses will total approximately $700 million to $800 million over 4 years. In addition, we expect the incremental capital spend required to integrate will total approximately $300 million to $400 million over 4 years. 
Now while the actual gross costs to integrate will be higher than those incremental costs I just mentioned, we expect to fund a portion of these costs from our current operating and capital expense run rates. We now expect the transaction to be accretive in the second year following the close of the transaction, excluding costs to integrate the company and deal-related amortization.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions."

One of the things we want to be careful this morning is we don't want to be in a position where we're trying to articulate a point of view of the FTC. They'll have plenty of opportunity to do that. So what I would say is a good -- a very high percentage of the conversation over the last several weeks and really months has been around their concern of -- they believe that there's a national market. They believe that there are customers out there that will only buy from distributors who have a national footprint. We disagree with that. We see and live that every day, where customers, some of these larger customers will buy from multiple distributors. They might buy from regionals or multi-regionals, and they may buy from us and/or U.S. or PFG, and they obviously buy from specialty firms. Some may buy from only a few of us, some may actually put most of their business with 1 or 2 of us. But our point of view is that when we compete for that business, we're competing not just with US Foods and PFG, but -- DMA, but with a lot of regionals who are now multi-regionals. And even with the -- even in a situation where certain customers will work with a fewer number of distributors, that opportunity to work with more Zoes in the room when you're negotiating an RFP or new business. So I think, again, I can't make their case for them, but I think that's been where we spent a lot of the time in the conversation of how we address their concerns about how these customers continue to get good service and appropriate pricing. And that is why we ultimately, even though we disagree with the position, we're willing to put forth a divestiture package and -- which we believe, from our perspective based on our knowledge of the business, our knowledge of the competitive landscape, should allow PFG to go out and compete very well in the way that the FTC would hope. So that's my best way of describing it today. As we said, we'll have some more opportunity to speak with the FTC and the 5 commissioners here over the next week or 2 and I'm sure there'll be more information coming out of those meetings."

The financial synergies I described, which the 2 biggest ones are interest savings over the 2 combined pro formas and the use of the NOLs, those are not included in the $600 million. Financial synergies we expect to achieve in the first year after closing. The operational synergies, we expect to start accruing in the second year after closing. And then the middle question there really around where do we find the additional synergies. When we put our first synergy number out on the table, feel like I have to keep reminding ourselves, as well as everybody else, it was with essentially publicly available information. We didn't have a lot of additional information. We had some experience at Sysco dealing with some of these buckets of opportunities. We have done some category management work. We have done route optimization. And so we knew that -- this is what we've been able to do, what can we do if we combine them, and we made some assumptions. And we made prudent assumptions but not overly aggressive. We're going to be candid about that. As we've learned a lot more about this, I would say every bucket probably increased in size. Certainly around merchandising and supply chain, we'll say inbound and outbound delivery transportation, those buckets got quite a lot larger. So we've found it across-the-board but in certain places, we found more. And so we rebuilt synergies from the bottom up using more information through our integration planning efforts.

Our selling costs are up a little more than we've planned but our gross profit is higher. So that one doesn't concern me as much. So that takes you to supply chain operations. And we just got more work to do there in terms of improving our productivity at a rate commensurate with when our costs go up. And we tend to be very good in this area, but we've got a lot of initiatives going on in this area as well. I mentioned Scott, and he's been with us for a couple of years. And with our new enterprise structure, his functional group working hand-in-hand with our operating company leadership to basically strike the right balance between what we need to do to support our customers each and every day, but also put in better and more consistent best practices, monitor them better, get our compensation schemes in line with our productivity. So a lot of work being done in that area and more to do, but I would say that's where the biggest opportunity is. All right. So the merger -- I would say on the merger, Chris talked to this, and I'll let him kind of address it again. I think what -- I think we're seeing opportunities through these synergies to do better. The challenge there will be to do what we've done a nice job of so far. I mean, so far, when you'd heard me speak -- be really proud as a management team and, frankly, all of our folks, we've done a nice job of being able to separate all the work and all the hours and the pressure that's going on with the integration planning and still be able to run our business pretty well. So that's the biggest challenge I see post-close here, is to continue to run these businesses but drive out, at that point, the synergies. So I think when we get to that point, we'll talk to you more and we'll have to come up with some ways to speak to how we're making progress there and still making sure we're shipping groceries in the right way to our customers."

And so on those markets, where energy has been strong, we've struggled to some extent. Too early to tell if that's going to abate. The other part of it, quite candidly, is we've had some internal issues in certain of the markets, where as we centralized some of our hiring practices and begun to coordinate that process between the OpCo and our SBS center, we went pretty fast and aggressively, and there were some markets where we didn't execute as well as we should have.

So if they can offer more poultry dishes or other types of à la carte items that supplant maybe what they've formerly done with cheese or with beef then there's some of that going on as well. I mean, our case growth still is very good in these inflationary categories. I think it's a mix. I think it's trying to find the right price point, if you will, for our customers. And I think it is hard to manage inflation, but our point is we've been doing a better job of it here over the last year or 2.

And I think we're starting to see nice traction there on that part of it. Longer term, we see it as an opportunity to really differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with expanded product lines, maybe broader, not as deep, perhaps in some of the SKUs that don't move as fast so where we can have more customized offerings to customers as we better understand their needs and better understand the process, and then also use this platform to bring more innovation to the offerings.

First, I mean, fuel charges are a bit different when you think about it with our larger customers and our smaller customers. With the larger customers, we may have contracts that are pegged to a certain fuel price. They may go up, they may go down, they last for periods of time. That's not something that you just ""give up"" because they're restructured into the cost structure of the contract. Fuel surcharges on The Street are different and, obviously, they can change on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. So the concept of ""giving them up"" that doesn't -- it's harder for me to address. I will say this: We look at fuel and we look at what's happening to fuel. We did not raise fuel surcharges when fuel prices started going up, and that was kind of one of the luxuries of our forward-buying strategy. It gave us time to assess what was really going on before we needed to react. Now that they're coming down, we are looking at it actively to see what the appropriate in the market and for our customers, and we'll continue to look at that. What we wanted to flag is it's a big story out there, there's a reason why it doesn't impact our fuel cost because of the way we smooth on an ongoing basis. So it hasn't in the first half. We're flagging that it will, to the extent at least of $15 million which had been our overall cost structure is a very small amount. But that's what we need to look at when we think about the fuel surcharges, how much of that amount might need to be mitigated with adjustments to the surcharge."

Everything that we're working on is based on the principle of we want to make this as least -- the least disruptive to our customers as we possibly can -- our customers and US Foods' customers, as we possibly can. And so we're not spending a lot of time trying to estimate potential disruption or losses of customers. We're spending a lot of our time trying to make sure that we know what might cause them to leave and how we're going to address that right out-of-the-box so they don't leave. Now to address your question, we're calling these net operational synergies because we do believe it takes into account what we might see in the way of disruption. But it's our estimate, and we, frankly, hope that we're going to be wrong and it's going to be better than that."

Ed, I think we're hopeful on the -- that some of this positive consumer sentiment that's been out there for a while begins to get to our customer base, and then that will translate into more industry growth. Our quarterly numbers, as you track them, you see they've been floating around between 2% and 3% real here over the last few quarters. We do have positive growth for the locally managed customers now, which we didn't have a year ago. So that's a big part of it, which is coming back to mix in a different way, customer mix. We've spent, as you can appreciate, a lot of time and effort over the last 15 months with best practices on how to manage margin better and still effectively deliver what customers' need in terms of offerings. But clearly, the category management is driving a fair amount of it right now. And we're doing a better job of integrating it, as I've said in my prepared comments, into the everyday business activities. So I would say that's a large part of it."

I think it's more of what we talked about over the last couple of quarters in terms of we are not doing new deployments right now until we have a better sense for where the merger is going to play out and when and some of the geographic issues that will come with that. But what we've been able to do when we did -- what we talked out about in the last earnings call, we've been able to go in and put in some significant enhancements into the software that are now being utilized by the 12 OpCos that are on, on the core SAP software platform. And the other thing we're doing more of, which we spoke to here today, is taking some of the other applications, whether they're financial or HR, maintenance, that type of thing even for the SA -- even for the non-SAP OpCos, bringing those into SBS, accelerating that work to where SBS is now supporting in certain areas, not just the 12 OpCos that are on SAP, but these other functional support software packages as well. So it's a -- to summarize, I think, Vinny, it's a combination of we're continuing to enhance the support around and the software that the 12 OpCos are using as well as beginning to leverage SBS in a different way and as I said, so that a, we're providing better service to the 12 OpCos today but also when we do begin to redeploy again, those future conversions can go more smoothly.

If we receive a ruling on our favor, we will proceed with closing unless the decision is appealed. In the event of an unfavorable ruling, we would assess together with U.S. Foods ownership whether to pursue the case further. We remain resolute in our belief that this transaction is procompetitive, good for our customers and will accelerate Sysco's business transformation. 
We announced in April that Joe has been named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective September 1, 2015, following Chris Kreidler's decision to leave the company. Joe is a veteran Sysco leader with nearly 20 years of experience in key finance and commercial roles. He is uniquely suited to step into the CFO position because of his deep knowledge of our local operations and people. We are fortunate to have a leader like Joe already to take on this key position, and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role as we move forward. 
We appreciate the numerous important contributions Chris has made on Sysco's behalf since joining us 5 years ago. He has agreed to remain as CFO through August, and he will work closely with Joe and Sysco Senior Executive team to ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities, including staying on through the end of December as an adviser. 
In closing, I am pleased with the consistent case growth we've seen in our locally managed and corporate managed business, which demonstrates our associates' unwavering focus on providing consistent and excellent service to our customers. In addition, our leadership team is making good progress in driving our initiatives to enhance both gross profit dollar growth and expense management. Our ongoing work to fundamentally reshape our company is challenging but gratifying, and we strongly believe that the steps we are taking will reinforce our leadership position in the ever evolving foodservice industry. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter."

For the third quarter, sales were $11.7 billion, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. Our sales growth rate was substantially lower than the 7% rate we saw during the first half of the fiscal year because of the rapid decline in food cost inflation and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Food cost inflation declined significantly from 6% in the second quarter to 3.7% in the third quarter. Our estimates for food cost inflation represents the weighted average change in Sysco's cost for the same products year-over-year. At 3.7%, it would appear we are getting close to what we normally describe as the sweet spot for inflation of 2% to 3%, but the 3.7% is an average across all of our product lines and sometimes averages don't tell the whole story as is the case here. Specifically, the meat category experienced low double-digit inflation in the quarter, and poultry inflation was in the high single digits. On a weighted-average basis, these 2 categories accounted for 3.2% of the 3.7% inflation we experienced across all of our categories. At these levels, passing along all of the inflation can be painful for our customers putting gross margin under pressure. In addition, rapid declines in food cost also make it challenging to leverage our fixed cost. 
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates had a much larger impact than usual this quarter. Similar to many companies with significant operations outside of the U.S., the strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars. This quarter's decrease of 1.3% was the highest in the past 3 years. The impact has typically been in the range of 0 to 0.5%. 
Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6%. Case volume grew 2.5% during the quarter, including acquisitions and approximately 2.2% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit in the third quarter was $2.1 billion, a 3.1% increase, while gross margin declined 17 basis points to 17.52%. Benefits from category management contributed significantly to our gross profit during the quarter. In addition, case volume growth for our locally managed Broadline business continued to increase slightly on a sequential basis as it has done the last 2 quarters. Solid local case growth is important to drive gross profit dollar growth. Case growth for our corporate managed customers remained strong, but competitive pricing pressure in this segment contributed to gross margin pressure. Certain items for the third quarter totaled $91 million and related to merger and integration planning expenses and interest on the merger of debt. Of this amount, $50 million was recorded an operating expense and $41 million was recorded in interest expense. 
Merger and integration planning cost that impacted operating expenses were mainly related to work to prepare for the integration of the 2 companies' technology platforms. These expenses in total were lower than in the third quarter compared to levels in the first half of the year as we scaled back our integration planning work in certain areas where a significant amount of work has already been completed. Merger cost that impacted interest expense relates to the debt that we issued last October that is intended to refinance US Foods' debt upon closing of the transaction. We are treating this interest expense as a certain item until the merger closes. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter increased $73 million or 4.5% due to $61 million increase in payroll expense. Payroll expense increased mainly due to higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, investments in new administrative support capabilities, higher incentive accruals and newly-acquired operations. These increases were partially offset by lower delivery costs, mainly driven by savings and fuel expense. After excluding incentives, adjusted operating expenses would have increased 3.9%. 
Our cost per case performance improved modestly from earlier in the year, but as Bill mentioned, expense management remain a challenge for us. Adjusted cost per case performance for the third quarter in the North American Broadline business, which is the portion of the business we've given guidance on previously, increased only $0.03 in the third quarter. However, excluding the benefit from currency translation, cost per case would have increased by $0.09. We have previously said we expect cost per case to increase between $0.05 and $0.10 this year. We would expect to be on the low end of this range, including the impact of foreign exchange and on the high end of this range, excluding foreign exchange. We are focused on driving improvements across our operations with multiple initiatives that implement best practices, enhance our operating training programs and improve our ability to measure and analyze our performance. 
Adjusted operating income from the quarter was $377 million, down 2.7% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 3.2%, down 23 basis points from last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34% compared to 39% in the prior year period. This quarter's rate was positively impacted by the favorable resolution of estate tax matter. In the prior year, the rate was elevated due to the nondeductible portion of a $20 million legal settlement that we disclosed at the time. Normalizing for these types of discrete events, our tax rate would be roughly 37%. This is lower than our historical rates due to the increasing amount of business earnings and international jurisdictions that have lower tax rates as well as reduced state taxes from legal restructurings. 
Adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million, and adjusted EPS increased 5.3% to $0.40. Cash flow performance in the first 39 weeks of the year was relatively strong after taking into account the cash impact of certain items. Cash flow from operations increased $12 million to $860 million versus last year. This increase reflects the negative impact of 2 items. First, the cash impact of certain items increased $82 million year-over-year mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses. Second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by a different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year. Cash tax payments were $135 million lower than last year due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced taxable earnings. Free cash flow was $439 million in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015 compared to $484 million in the prior year period or a reduction of $46 million. However, after adjusting for the cash impact of certain items and the increase in pension contribution I mentioned a moment ago, free cash flow was $617 [ph] million, an increase of $86 million or 16% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures for the first 39 weeks of the year, net of proceeds from sale of assets, increased $58 million to $422 million. About $53 million of this increase is due to IT-related merger integration planning and the rest was due to timing of investments in our fleet. 
Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow are always impacted by foreign currency translation, but the impact of the first of 39 weeks of fiscal 2015 is much greater than the last few years. You will see in the cash flow statement a $77 million impact this year compared to less than $0.5 million last year. This means our cash flows would have been $77 million higher on a constant dollar basis. 
Turning to an update on recent acquisitions. On last month, we completed the previously announced transaction to buy 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading foodservice distributor in Mexico. Pacific Star is operated since 1989 with distribution centers servicing customers in the major Metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Tijuana. It primarily services chain accounts, including fast food and casual dining restaurants, casinos, theme parks, movie theaters and hotels throughout Mexico. This partnership fits our international expansion strategy, allows us to enhance service to our U.S. customers who operate in the region and provides growth opportunities in an important region of the Americas. In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced our agreement to acquire Tannis Trading in Canada. Tannis operates in the Ottawa market, the fourth largest in Canada. This acquisition, which remain subject to regulatory approval, would allow us to better serve our customers and achieve our goal of increasing sales in Canada. 
Regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year, there are a few additional items I'd like to point out. First, as we discussed last quarter, because of the pending merger during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying back shares to offset dilution from incentive-based compensation as we would normally be doing. This has had the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employee stock options and divesting of restricted stock units. As a result, both adjusted and reported diluted EPS were lower by $0.005 in the third quarter and $0.015 [ph] over the first 39 weeks.  Unless we repurchased shares during the fourth quarter, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding maybe greater than 597 million shares in the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock option exercises and issued investing occurs and does not include shares issued in conjunction with the pending US Foods merger. Second, please note that we plan to pay off $300 million in bonds that come due in mid-June. We currently anticipate using cash on hand to fund this payment. 
Lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from asset sales, remains at $500 million -- sorry, $500 million to $550 million for fiscal year 2015, but we now expect to be at the high end of this range for the year. In closing, while our top line has been negatively impacted by lower levels of inflation and the larger impact from foreign currency translation, we are pleased that the business continues to generate solid case volume growth, in particular, in the locally managed portion of our business. We have opportunities to improve our operating expense management and have begun to make some progress in this area. But importantly, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow. While we have work ahead of us to transform the business, there are many exciting initiatives underway that will enhance our customers' experience, strengthen our operating performance and increase profitability. 
With that, operator, we'll now take some questions."

I mean so, yes, I do think in the past we've been able to adjust our expenses accordingly, and I agree with your premise.

The others -- you got dairy is very volatile, as you know, so dairy is down a little bit. Seafood is down a little bit, but Seafood is not a big part of the overall mix. So I think essentially, you're looking at an environment today where you've got 2 categories, meat and poultry that are high, which is difficult to pass along in a fast way and the right way. And the others are pretty much neutral if you put them all together. And yes, I expect that to continue here at least for, whatever, a few, couple, 3 months as far as we can see out. As I said in my comments, we are seeing improvement on the expensive sequentially. We're not just seeing as fast as we have planned, and I think you will see more expense improvement here in the fourth quarter relative to the first part of the year and we're certainly planning to do even more for next year."

Obviously, as we've said for a while now, the market environment we're in is difficult. It's very competitive, and it's not like many other industries and we don't expect that to change. So again, to kind of recap how we look at the world, we see modest medium- to long-term growth in the industry. We expect to grow faster than that. To do that, we need to differentiate ourselves ongoing-ly with our customers and we need to take cost out of the system. It's one of the reasons why this merger is so important to us. If the merger doesn't happen, we'll need to find other ways to continue to do that. We may not get there quite as fast, but I'm confident we'll continue to go in the right direction. Specifically, to this quarter, you can look at it a lot of different ways. The bottom line is we didn't manage our expenses as well as we would have liked. If we had manage our cost may be just $0.05 better, I think you would have seen the different result here, and I would haven't talked as much about planned expenses. So we're going to have quarters where there's inflation and less inflation. We had good volume growth, as I said. We managed gross profit reasonably well given the environment.

It's still probably fine, but it just can't be sustained. I mean, it's just -- we just have a situation where seasonally, it's a low-volume quarter. It's also the time that we bring MAs on in terms of training. And we have some operating companies that were behind in our headcount, and I think that put some pressure on us here as well. So selling cost is a little higher than what we plan. On the operations side, we're making progress. We're driving out a lot of change here, Karen. And we've been driving out very aggressively over the last year, 2 years, and that put a lot of stress on the operating companies at a time when they still need to provide really solid service to our customers.

I mean the interest portion of that obviously is not going to go anywhere, but even on the operating expense portion, there's a lot of work that continues to be done to prepare the 2 IT systems to be able to merge. We're not touching the U.S. food system or vice versa, but we're creating the conduits that will be necessary to allow them to merge. Unfortunately, at this deal has dragged out, we were able to stand down certain aspects of what we're doing from a planning perspective as we can stand them back rather quickly. But in a lot of other areas, we need all the time we could possibly get to be prepared for merger and integrating and we continue some of that work. So it's come down somewhat. I expect it to not increase again, of course, until we complete the transaction and, of course, we'll be giving you guidance."

We certainly standardize all of it. We still do some locally in terms of working with suppliers. But for the most part, we're working with the suppliers here at corporate and then working closely with our operating companies. So from that standpoint, we realize a lot of benefits, but that's some more launches here today later this year into next year, not a significant part of the overall volume. And then I think what you'll see us do is we'll get into renewals, and we'll continue to perfect what we started here and get better at it and probably have more time to focus on innovation side, which is critical obviously to growing the business as well. So I look at it as something which we will continue to get better at which would continue to help us mitigate the overall margin pressure that we face in the business itself.

Andy, as you noticed, I didn't really talk about the industry and the market because it's hard to make that call right now. While I did talk about weather, I didn't find about weather this year, so I feel good about that. What we saw was this, not alluded to in my comments. Last year, if you remember the weather, it was pretty harsh in December, January and first 3 weeks in February. And it was harsh in areas where typically you don't see it, Charlotte, Dallas, Atlanta and other places. And so we had some favorable comparisons in late December, January and February. Unfortunately, January and February are not exactly big months for us. Then if you recall last year, there's a little bit of a accounting favor impact up North and people got out in March because they needed to get out. And then March was reasonably mild and so is April, and so the Kansan started earlier. So we had good volume in March and April relative to the rest of the year last year, and I think we're seeing softer volume this year. What I'm trying to say here is I think weather is impacting that, I just don't know to what degree. And I think I can make a better call on that after we see May and June year because we'll be back apples-to-apples. In terms of what I read and what I hear, it's probably not a whole lot different than you. The good news here is that the consumer sentiment is positive. It's up and down a little bit, but it's still positive. The sentiment of our restaurant operators is positive. It's remained positive. So I think people are generally seeing at least maintaining -- they're seeing good things, and they're hopeful that it'll translate into better things. Probably the biggest positive out there right now, I would say, would be the lower fuel prices. They come back a little bit, but all in all, the consumer is getting a raise, if you will, the pump. What's not clear there at all is to what degree. It appears the consumer is paying down debt with some of that, saving some of that and spending some of that. It's not clear how much of that we're getting, perhaps some, but I don't think a lot at this point. With that said, I think to the extent that the fuel prices stayed down for up an extended period of time, that will be good for our customers and I would expect that, that will help us over time. So it's a long way of saying it's hard for me to really explain what's going on in the market right now because of kind of the unusual weather comparisons as well as the impact of fuel. But I think we'll have a better read on this as we get into the summer."

I would say it's been a couple of years since SYGMA had a strong year, and it's got a lot of attention. We have restructured there somewhat and Greg Keller over SYGMA full time, and Greg grew up in SYGMA business. He's been raining our national sales area up until the last several months, so he is very well-versed in the SYGMA of the business. He's very well connected with our customer base. He's got a lot of passion for that business. So I believe we're in good hands there from leadership. There are some things that we're working on their both in terms of how do we better position ourselves in terms of the needs of those customers and still run expenses very tight, so it's a very transaction, service-oriented business, not with a lot of touches like the Broadline, but there's no very little margin for here in SYGMA. So we had to invest in money over the last year or so in terms of facilities and drivers and people like that, things like that to strengthen the business, and that's hurt us on the bottom line. We've also had to just take a look at how well we run the business overall. So I'd say we're in transition with SYGMA. We like the business strategically. It's a very -- that customer base or potential customer base is a big part of the overall opportunity, and it's always nice when you're seeing how customers or perspective customers to give them a choice in terms of which model they would prefer to model or the Broadline model. And the reality is sometimes they prefer both depending on their locations and our position. So somewhat in transition there, work to do strategically, still very important to the company."

But again, Greg is a very strong leader, very strong sales guy. So I'm quite optimistic that we'll continue to find the right mix of customers and do a good job for them. But again, the way we look at SYGMA today is we want to understand what the customers are looking for, with kind of model, what level of support, what economics are they willing to incur. And if that's the SYGMA model, then fine. If it's not, then we'll put them into Broadline. They go back and forth. And as I said, some customers utilize both models. So I think we're in good place there in terms of the direction. But from a customer standpoint, we look at it across the entire spectrum, which is what does the customer want in terms of the trade-off of service and pricing."

This morning, Sysco reported third quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased 4% to $11.7 billion, adjusted operating income decreased 3% to $377 million. Adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million, and EPS increased 5% to $0.40 for the quarter. Net earnings and EPS for the quarter were in line with our expectations, as solid volume and gross profit dollar growth along with a favorable tax rate, offset the impact of moderating inflation trends and favorable foreign exchange translation and higher-than-planned operating expenses.
Case volume grew 2.5% for the quarter, and we were pleased with our growth both with locally managed and corporate managed customers. Overall, weather was not a major factor in our year-over-year comparisons for the quarter, as we benefited from favorable comparisons in January and February, but were hampered by severe weather in the Northeast and Mideast in late February and most of March.
This last point is important to not because March provides a disproportionally large portion of our third quarter volume, and was a relatively mild weather month last year. We experienced similar trends in April, but expect the year-over-year monthly impact of weather will dissipate as we move into May and June.
We continue to roll out and successfully execute our category management initiative, and the benefits from this process contributed to our gross profit growth during the quarter. Through category management, we were able to able our customer's growth by lowering our product cost and developing innovative product development ideas. This is vital to mitigating gross margin pressure as we move forward in what remains a fiercely competitive market environment.
Regarding expense management, we established appropriately aggressive goals for cost per case management for fiscal 2015. After a very strong expense management performance in the prior year. We experienced modest improvement in sequential trends in the third quarter, but will fall short of our original goals in this area for the year.
With that said, our entire leadership team is intently focused on enhancing productivity in a sustainable manner, while delivering exceptional service to our customers. I expect our performance trends in this area to improve modestly in the fourth quarter and more so in fiscal 2016.
Moving to our multiyear business transformation initiatives, we are pleased with the progress we've made on achieving the steady-state cost-savings goals we set as we began fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2015 is the third year of that financial road map and we've already exceeded our original target of $600 million, which was comprised of approximately $300 million in annual savings in both operating and product costs.
While pleased with this progress we've made over the past 3 years on these initiatives, it's more clear than ever that transforming Sysco's business will be a perpetual process as we strive to fully realize our vision of being our customer's most valued and trusted business partner.
Foundational to our optimal success is further developing and continually enhancing our technology platform. We have now embedded this work in the overall scope of our business technology group under the leadership of Wayne Shurts. We have learned a great deal from the challenges we encountered in deploying SAP and all of the standardized processes it requires. 
Over the past 2 years under Wayne's leadership, we have refined our business processes, strengthened our technology support capabilities, stabilized the SAP system and enhanced its efficiency. While there's more work to be done, we are well positioned to move forward with a cohesive, enterprise-wide, modular-centric approach rather than our previous OpCo-by-OpCo multimodule approach. As our deployment process matures and evolves in the future, we expect this change to result in smoother conversions, better execution and an improved experience for our customers. 
On the acquisition front, we recently completed the previously announced agreement to acquire 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading foodservice distributor in Mexico. We have developed a strong relationship over the past several years with the ownership and management team at Pacific Star, and we are very excited about the potential opportunities that this partnership will provide to profitably grow our business in Mexico. 
Regarding our pending merger with US Foods, the hearing related to the FTC's motion for preliminary injunction begins tomorrow, May 5, and will last up to 7 business days. If we receive a ruling on our favor, we will proceed with closing unless the decision is appealed. In the event of an unfavorable ruling, we would assess together with US Foods' ownership whether to pursue the case further. We remain resolute in our belief that this transaction is procompetitive, good for our customers and will accelerate Sysco's business transformation. 
We announced in April that Joel Grade has been named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective September 1, 2015, following Chris Kreidler's decision to leave the company. Joel is a veteran Sysco leader with nearly 20 years of experience in key finance and commercial roles. He is uniquely suited to step into the CFO position because of his deep knowledge of our local operations and people. We are fortunate to have a leader like Joel already to take on this key position, and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role as we move forward. 
We appreciate the numerous important contributions Chris has made on Sysco's behalf since joining us 5 years ago. He has agreed to remain as CFO through August, and he will work closely with Joel and Sysco's senior executive team to ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities, including staying on through the end of December as an adviser. 
In closing, I am pleased with the consistent case growth we've seen in our locally managed and corporate managed business, which demonstrates our associates' unwavering focus on providing consistent and excellent service to our customers. In addition, our leadership team is making good progress in driving out initiatives to enhance both gross profit dollar growth and expense management. Our ongoing work to fundamentally reshape our company is challenging but gratifying, and we strongly believe that the steps we are taking will reinforce our leadership position in the ever-evolving foodservice industry. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter."
189096,278897903,802794,"Sysco Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, May 04, 2015",2015-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $11.7 billion, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. Our sales growth rate was substantially lower than the 7% rate we saw during the first half of the fiscal year becau",1777,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $11.7 billion, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. Our sales growth rate was substantially lower than the 7% rate we saw during the first half of the fiscal year because of the rapid decline in food cost inflation and the impact of foreign exchange translation.
Food cost inflation declined significantly from 6% in the second quarter to 3.7% in the third quarter. Our estimates for food cost inflation represents the weighted average change in Sysco's cost for the same products year-over-year. At 3.7%, it would appear we are getting close to what we normally describe as the sweet spot for inflation of 2% to 3%, but the 3.7% is an average across all of our product lines and sometimes averages don't tell the whole story as is the case here.
Specifically, the meat category experienced low double-digit inflation in the quarter, and poultry inflation was in the high single digits. On a weighted-average basis, these 2 categories accounted for 3.2% of the 3.7% inflation we experienced across all of our categories. At these levels, passing along all of the inflation can be painful to our customers putting gross margin under pressure. In addition, rapid declines in food cost also make it challenging to leverage our fixed costs. 
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates had a much larger impact than usual this quarter. Similar to many companies with significant operations outside of the U.S., the strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars. This quarter's decrease of 1.3% was the highest in the past 3 years. The impact has typically been in the range of 0 to 0.5%. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6%. Case volume grew 2.5% during the quarter, including acquisitions and approximately 2.2% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit in the third quarter was $2.1 billion, a 3.1% increase, while gross margin declined 17 basis points to 17.52%. Benefits from category management contributed significantly to our gross profit during the quarter. 
In addition, case volume growth for our locally managed Broadline business continued to increase slightly on a sequential basis as it has done the last 2 quarters. Solid local case growth is important to drive gross profit dollar growth. Case growth for our corporate managed customers remained strong, but competitive pricing pressure in this segment contributed to gross margin pressure. Certain items for the third quarter totaled $91million and related to merger and integration planning expenses and interest on the merger debt. Of this amount, $50 million was recorded in operating expense and $41 million was recorded in interest expense. 
Merger and integration planning costs that impacted operating expenses were mainly related to work to prepare for the integration of the 2 companies' technology platforms. These expenses in total were lower in the third quarter compared to levels in the first half of the year, as we scaled back our integration planning work in certain areas where a significant amount of work has already been completed. Merger cost that impacted interest expense relates to the debt that we issued last October that is intended to refinance US Foods' debt upon closing of the transaction. We are treating this interest expense as a certain item until the merger closes. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter increased $73 million or 4.5% due to $61 million increase in payroll expense. Payroll expense increased mainly due to higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, investments in new administrative support capabilities, higher incentive accruals and newly-acquired operations. These increases were partially offset by lower delivery costs, mainly driven by savings and fuel expense. After excluding incentives, adjusted operating expenses would have increased 3.9%. 
Our cost per case performance improved modestly from earlier in the year, but as Bill mentioned, expense management remains a challenge for us. Adjusted cost per case performance for the third quarter in the North American Broadline business, which is the portion of the business we've given guidance on previously, increased only $0.03 in the third quarter. However, excluding the benefit from currency translation, cost per case would have increased by $0.09. We have previously said we expect cost per case to increase between $0.05 and $0.10 this year. We would expect to be on the low end of this range, including the impact of foreign exchange, and on the high end of this range, excluding foreign exchange. We are focused on driving improvement across our operations with multiple initiatives that implement best practices, enhance our operating training programs and improve our ability to measure and analyze our performance. 
Adjusted operating income from the quarter was $377 million, down 2.7% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 3.2%, down 23 basis points from last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34% compared to 39% in the prior year period. This quarter's rate was positively impacted by the favorable resolution of state tax matter. In the prior year, the rate was elevated due to the nondeductible portion of a $20 million legal settlement that we disclosed at the time. Normalizing for these types of discrete events, our tax rate would be roughly 37%. This is lower than our historical rates due to the increasing amount of business earnings and international jurisdictions that have lower tax rates, as well as reduced state taxes from legal restructurings. 
Adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million, and adjusted EPS increased 5.3% to $0.40. Cash flow performance in the first 39 weeks of the year was relatively strong after taking into account the cash impact of certain items. Cash flow from operations increased $12 million to $860 million versus last year. This increase reflects the negative impact of 2 items. First, the cash impact of certain items increased $82 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses. Second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by a different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year.
Cash tax payments were $135 million lower than last year due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago, and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced taxable earnings. Free cash flow was $439 million in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015 compared to $484 million in the prior year period, or a reduction of $46 million. However, after adjusting for the cash impact of certain items and the increase in pension contribution I mentioned a moment ago, free cash flow was $617 million, an increase of $86 million or 16% from the prior year period.
Capital expenditures for the first 39 weeks of the year, net of proceeds from sale of assets, increased $58 million to $422 million. About $53 million of this increase is due to IT-related merger integration planning and the rest was due to timing of investments in our fleet. 
Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow are always impacted by foreign currency translation, but the impact of the first of 39 weeks of fiscal 2015 is much greater than the last few years. You will see in the cash flow statement a $77 million impact this year compared to less than $0.5 million last year. This means our cash flows would have been $77 million higher on a constant dollar basis. 
Turning to an update on recent acquisitions. Last month, we completed the previously announced transaction to buy 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading foodservice distributor in Mexico. Pacific Star has operated since 1989 with distribution centers servicing customers in the major metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Tijuana. It primarily services chain accounts, including fast food and casual dining restaurants, casinos, theme parks, movie theaters and hotels throughout Mexico.
This partnership fits our international expansion strategy, allows us to enhance service to our U.S. customers who operate in the region and provides growth opportunities in an important region of the Americas. In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced our agreement to acquire Tannis Trading in Canada. Tannis operates in the Ottawa market, the fourth largest in Canada. This acquisition, which remains subject to regulatory approval, would allow us to better serve our customers and achieve our goal of increasing sales in Canada. 
Regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year, there are a few additional items I'd like to point out. First, as we discussed last quarter, because of the pending merger during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying back shares to offset dilution from incentive-based compensation as we would normally be doing. This has had the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employee stock options and divesting of restricted stock units. As a result, both adjusted and reported diluted EPS were lower by $0.005 in the third quarter and $0.015 over the first 39 weeks.
Unless we repurchased shares during the fourth quarter, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than 597 million shares in the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock option exercises and RSU vesting that occurs and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the pending US Foods merger. Second, please note that we plan to pay off $300 million in bonds that come due in mid-June. We currently anticipate using cash on hand to fund this payment. Lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from asset sales, remains at $500 million to $500 million -- sorry, $500 million to $550 million for fiscal year 2015, but we now expect to be at the high end of this range for the year.
In closing, while our top line has been negatively impacted by lower levels of inflation and the larger impact from foreign currency translation, we are pleased that the business continues to generate solid case volume growth, in particular, in the locally managed portion of our business. We have opportunities to improve our operating expense management and have begun to make some progress in this area. But importantly, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow. While we have work ahead of us to transform the business, there are many exciting initiatives underway that will enhance our customers' experience, strengthen our operating performance and increase profitability. 
With that, operator, we'll now take some questions."

So I think essentially, you're looking at an environment today where you've got 2 categories, meat and poultry that are high, which is difficult to pass along in a fast way and the right way. And the others are pretty much neutral if you put them all together. And yes, I expect that to continue here at least for the, whatever, a few, couple, 3 months as far as we can see out. As I said in my comments, we're seeing improvement on the expenses sequentially, we're not just seeing as fast as we have planned. And I think you will see more expense improvement here in the fourth quarter relative to the first part of the year, and we're certainly planning to do even more for next year."

So we need to manage what we have the ability to control the most, which is our business, and we're pretty good at running our business. Obviously, as we've said for a while now, the market environment we're in is difficult. It's very competitive, and it's not like many other industries and we don't expect that to change. So again, to kind of recap how we look at the world, we see modest medium- to long-term growth in the industry. We expect to grow faster than that. To do that, we need to differentiate ourselves ongoing-ly with our customers and we need to take cost out of the system. It's one of the reasons why this merger is so important to us. If the merger doesn't happen, we'll need to find other ways to continue to do that. We may not get there quite as fast, but I'm confident we'll continue to go in the right direction. Specifically, to this quarter, you can look at it a lot of different ways. The bottom line is we didn't manage our expenses as well as we would have liked. If we had managed our cost at least may be just $0.05 better, I think you would have seen a different result here, and I would've been -- I wouldn't have talked as much about planned expenses. So we're going to have quarters where there's inflation and less inflation. And we had good volume growth, as I said. We managed gross profit reasonably well given the environment. We just didn't bring our expenses and weren't as fast as we planned. And I expect that we'll get better at that here over the next 2 or 3 quarters."

So this quarter was up more than that. It's still probably fine, but it just can't be sustained. I mean, it's just -- we just have a situation where seasonally, it's a low-volume quarter. It's also a time that we bring M.A.s on in terms of training. And we had some operating companies that were behind in our headcount, and I think that put some pressure on us here as well. So selling cost is a little higher than what we planned. On the operations side, we're making progress. We're driving out a lot of change here, Karen. And we've been driving out very aggressively over the last year, 2 years, and that puts a lot of stress on the operating companies at a time when they still need to provide really solid service to our customers. And so there's been some challenges in terms of how fast you can drive that change and how well it's received by our workforce and how well our leadership, including me, are able to drive that out. So what we're doing here is transforming the company and we're bringing more standardization to our best practices in the field.

So from that standpoint, we've realized a lot of benefits, but we have some more launches here to do later this year into next year, and that's a significant part of the overall volume. And then I think what you'll see us do is we'll get into renewals, and we'll continue to perfect what we started here and get better at it and probably have more time to focus on the innovation side of it, which is critical obviously to growing the business as well. So I look at it as something which we would continue to get better at, which would continue to help us mitigate the overall margin pressure that we face in the business itself, but something that we feel really good about the this point."

Andy, if you noticed, I really didn't talk a lot about the industry or the market because it's hard to make that call right now. While I did talk about weather, I didn't find about weather this year, so I feel good about that. What we saw was this, and what I alluded to in my comments, we had -- last year, if you go back and looked at the weather, it was pretty harsh in December, January and first 3 weeks in February. And it was harsh in areas where typically you don't see it -- Charlotte, Dallas, Atlanta and other places. And so we had some favorable comparisons in late December, January and February. Unfortunately, January and February are not exactly big months for us. Then if you recall last year, there's a little bit of a cabin fever impact up North, and I think people got out in March just because they needed to get out. And then March was reasonably mild and so was April, and so the camps and the clubs started to open up earlier. So we had good volume in March and April relative to the rest of the year last year, and I think we're seeing softer volume this year. What I'm trying to say here is I think weather is impacting that, I just don't know to what degree. And I think I can make a better call on that after we see May and June here because we'll be back apples-to-apples. In terms of what I read and what I hear, it's probably not a whole lot different than you. It's -- the good news here is that the consumer sentiment is positive. It's up and down a little bit, but still positive. The sentiment of our restaurant operators is positive. It's remained positive. So I think people are generally seeing at least maintaining -- they're seeing good things and they're hopeful that it'll translate into better things. Probably the biggest positive out there right now, I would say, would be the lower fuel prices. They've come back up a little bit, but all in all, the consumer is getting a raise, if you will, at the pump. But what's not clear there at all is to what degree. It appears the consumer is paying down debt with some of that, saving some of that and spending some of that. It's not clear how much of that we're getting, perhaps some, but I don't think a lot at this point. With that said, I think to the extent that the fuel prices stayed down for an extended period of time, that will be good for our customers and I would expect that, that will help us over time. So it's a long way of saying it's hard for me to really explain what's going on in the market right now because of kind of the unusual weather comparisons as well as the impact of fuel. But I think we'll have a better read on this as we get into the summer."

So with us, it always starts the way you pose the question, which is what's important to customer, what does the customer need.

But not with a lot of touches like the Broadline, but there's no -- very little margin for error in SYGMA. So we've had to invest some money over the last year or so in terms of facilities and drivers and people like that, things like that, to strengthen the business, and that's hurt us on the bottom line. We've also had to just take a look at how well we're running the business overall. So I'd say we're in transition with SYGMA. We like the business strategically. It's a very -- that customer base or potential customer base is a big part of the overall opportunity, and it's always nice when you're seeing how customers or perspective customers for -- to give them a choice in terms of which model they would prefer to SYGMA model or the Broadline model.

There are certainly parts of the country and certain OpCos where we do a very good job on the local side and fresh side, and then there's others not so good and that's where I see the work in merchandise and the category management, in particular, with innovation giving us a position to be more consistent. And by doing that, create more volume, which will make them more economical. So the trends have definitely been there. We're responding to them. We just -- we need to continue to get better at it.

This morning, Sysco reported third quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased 4% to $11.7 billion, adjusted operating income decreased 3% to $377 million. Adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million, and EPS increased 5% to $0.40 for the quarter. Net earnings and EPS for the quarter were in line with our expectations, as solid volume and gross profit dollar growth along with a favorable tax rate, offset the impact of moderating inflation trends and favorable foreign exchange translation and higher-than-planned operating expenses.
Case volume grew 2.5% for the quarter, and we were pleased with our growth both with locally managed and corporate managed customers. Overall, weather was not a major factor in our year-over-year comparisons for the quarter, as we benefited from favorable comparisons in January and February, but were hampered by severe weather in the Northeast and Mideast in late February and most of March.
This last point is important to note because March provides a disproportionally large portion of our third quarter volume, and was a relatively mild weather month last year. We experienced similar trends in April, but expect the year-over-year monthly impact of weather will dissipate as we move into May and June.
We continue to roll out and successfully execute our category management initiative, and the benefits from this process contributed to our gross profit dollar growth during the quarter. Through category management, we were able to support our customer's growth by lowering our product cost and developing innovative product development ideas. This is vital to mitigating gross margin pressure as we move forward in what remains a fiercely competitive market environment.
Regarding expense management, we established appropriately aggressive goals for cost per case management for fiscal 2015. After a very strong expense management performance in the prior year. We experienced modest improvement in sequential trends in the third quarter, but will fall short of our original goals in this area for the year.
With that said, our entire leadership team is intently focused on enhancing productivity in a sustainable manner, while delivering exceptional service to our customers. I expect our performance trends in this area to improve modestly in the fourth quarter and more so in fiscal 2016.
Moving to our multiyear business transformation initiatives, we are pleased with the progress we've made on achieving the steady-state cost-savings goals we set as we began fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2015 is the third year of that financial road map and we've already exceeded our original target of $600 million, which was comprised of approximately $300 million in annual savings in both operating and product costs.
While pleased with this progress we've made over the past 3 years on these initiatives, it's more clear than ever that transforming Sysco's business will be a perpetual process as we strive to fully realize our vision of being our customer's most valued and trusted business partner.
Foundational to our ultimate success is further developing and continually enhancing our technology platform. We have now embedded this work in the overall scope of our business technology group under the leadership of Wayne Shurts. We have learned a great deal from the challenges we encountered in deploying SAP and all of the standardized processes it requires. 
Over the past 2 years under Wayne's leadership, we have refined our business processes, strengthened our technology support capabilities, stabilized the SAP system and enhanced its efficiency. While there's more work to be done, we are well positioned to move forward with a cohesive, enterprise-wide, modular-centric approach rather than our previous OpCo-by-OpCo multimodule approach. As our deployment process matures and evolves in the future, we expect this change to result in smoother conversions, better execution and an improved experience for our customers. 
On the acquisition front, we recently completed the previously announced agreement to acquire 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading foodservice distributor in Mexico. We have developed a strong relationship over the past several years with the ownership and management team at Pacific Star, and we are very excited about the potential opportunities that this partnership will provide to profitably grow our business in Mexico. 
Regarding our pending merger with US Foods, the hearing related to the FTC's motion for preliminary injunction begins tomorrow, May 5, and will last up to 7 business days. If we receive a ruling on our favor, we will proceed to closing unless the decision is appealed. In the event of an unfavorable ruling, we would assess together with US Foods' ownership whether to pursue the case further. We remain resolute in our belief that this transaction is procompetitive, good for our customers and will accelerate Sysco's business transformation. 
We announced in April that Joel Grade has been named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective September 1, 2015, following Chris Kreidler's decision to leave the company. Joel is a veteran Sysco leader with nearly 20 years of experience in key finance and commercial roles. He is uniquely suited to step into the CFO position because of his deep knowledge of our local operations and people. We are fortunate to have a leader like Joel ready to take on this key position, and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role as we move forward. 
We appreciate the numerous important contributions Chris has made on Sysco's behalf since joining us 5 years ago. He has agreed to remain as CFO through August, and he will work closely with Joel and Sysco's senior executive team to ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities, including staying on through the end of December as an adviser. 
In closing, I am pleased with the consistent case growth we've seen in our locally managed and corporate managed business, which demonstrates our associates' unwavering focus on providing consistent and excellent service to our customers. In addition, our leadership team is making good progress in driving out initiatives to enhance both gross profit dollar growth and expense management. Our ongoing work to fundamentally reshape our company is challenging but gratifying, and we strongly believe that the steps we are taking will reinforce our leadership position in the ever-evolving foodservice industry. 
Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter."
189096,278897903,802927,"Sysco Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, May 04, 2015",2015-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $11.7 billion, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. Our sales growth rate was substantially lower than the 7% rate we saw during the first half of the fiscal year becau",1779,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $11.7 billion, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. Our sales growth rate was substantially lower than the 7% rate we saw during the first half of the fiscal year because of the rapid decline in food cost inflation and the impact of foreign exchange translation.
Food cost inflation declined significantly from 6% in the second quarter to 3.7% in the third quarter. Our estimates for food cost inflation represents the weighted average change in Sysco's cost for the same products year-over-year. At 3.7%, it would appear we are getting close to what we normally describe as the sweet spot for inflation of 2% to 3%, but the 3.7% is an average across all of our product lines and sometimes averages don't tell the whole story as is the case here.
Specifically, the meat category experienced low double-digit inflation in the quarter, and poultry inflation was in the high single digits. On a weighted-average basis, these 2 categories accounted for 3.2% of the 3.7% inflation we experienced across all of our categories. At these levels, passing along all of the inflation can be painful to our customers putting gross margin under pressure. In addition, rapid declines in food cost also make it challenging to leverage our fixed costs. 
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates had a much larger impact than usual this quarter. Similar to many companies with significant operations outside of the U.S., the strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars. This quarter's decrease of 1.3% was the highest in the past 3 years. The impact has typically been in the range of 0 to 0.5%. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6%. Case volume grew 2.5% during the quarter, including acquisitions and approximately 2.2% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit in the third quarter was $2.1 billion, a 3.1% increase, while gross margin declined 17 basis points to 17.52%. Benefits from category management contributed significantly to our gross profit during the quarter. 
In addition, case volume growth for our locally managed Broadline business continued to increase slightly on a sequential basis as it has done the last 2 quarters. Solid local case growth is important to drive gross profit dollar growth. Case growth for our corporate managed customers remained strong, but competitive pricing pressure in this segment contributed to gross margin pressure. Certain items for the third quarter totaled $91 million and related to merger and integration planning expenses and interest on the merger debt. Of this amount, $50 million was recorded in operating expense and $41 million was recorded in interest expense. 
Merger and integration planning costs that impacted operating expenses were mainly related to work to prepare for the integration of the 2 companies' technology platforms. These expenses in total were lower in the third quarter compared to levels in the first half of the year, as we scaled back our integration planning work in certain areas where a significant amount of work has already been completed. Merger cost that impacted interest expense relates to the debt that we issued last October that is intended to refinance US Foods' debt upon closing of the transaction. We are treating this interest expense as a certain item until the merger closes. 
Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter increased $73 million or 4.5% due to a $61 million increase in payroll expense. Payroll expense increased mainly due to higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, investments in new administrative support capabilities, higher incentive accruals and newly-acquired operations. These increases were partially offset by lower delivery costs, mainly driven by savings and fuel expense. After excluding incentives, adjusted operating expenses would have increased 3.9%. 
Our cost per case performance improved modestly from earlier in the year, but as Bill mentioned, expense management remains a challenge for us. Adjusted cost per case performance for the third quarter in the North American Broadline business, which is the portion of the business we've given guidance on previously, increased only $0.03 in the third quarter. However, excluding the benefit from currency translation, cost per case would have increased by $0.09. We have previously said we expect cost per case to increase between $0.05 and $0.10 this year. We would expect to be on the low end of this range, including the impact of foreign exchange, and on the high end of this range, excluding foreign exchange. We are focused on driving improvement across our operations with multiple initiatives that implement best practices, enhance our operating training programs and improve our ability to measure and analyze our performance. 
Adjusted operating income from the quarter was $377 million, down 2.7% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 3.2%, down 23 basis points from last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34% compared to 39% in the prior year period. This quarter's rate was positively impacted by the favorable resolution of state tax matter. In the prior year, the rate was elevated due to the nondeductible portion of a $20 million legal settlement that we disclosed at the time. Normalizing for these types of discrete events, our tax rate would be roughly 37%. This is lower than our historical rates due to the increasing amount of business earnings and international jurisdictions that have lower tax rates, as well as reduced state taxes from legal restructurings. 
Adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million, and adjusted EPS increased 5.3% to $0.40. Cash flow performance in the first 39 weeks of the year was relatively strong after taking into account the cash impact of certain items. Cash flow from operations increased $12 million to $860 million versus last year. This increase reflects the negative impact of 2 items. First, the cash impact of certain items increased $82 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses. Second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by a different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year.
Cash tax payments were $135 million lower than last year due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago, and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced taxable earnings. Free cash flow was $439 million in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015 compared to $484 million in the prior year period, or a reduction of $46 million. However, after adjusting for the cash impact of certain items and the increase in pension contribution I mentioned a moment ago, free cash flow was $617 million, an increase of $86 million or 16% from the prior year period.
Capital expenditures for the first 39 weeks of the year, net of proceeds from sale of assets, increased $58 million to $422 million. About $53 million of this increase is due to IT-related merger integration planning and the rest was due to timing of investments in our fleet. 
Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow are always impacted by foreign currency translation, but the impact of the first of 39 weeks of fiscal 2015 is much greater than the last few years. You will see in the cash flow statement a $77 million impact this year compared to less than $0.5 million last year. This means our cash flows would have been $77 million higher on a constant dollar basis. 
Turning to an update on recent acquisitions. Last month, we completed the previously announced transaction to buy 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading foodservice distributor in Mexico. Pacific Star has operated since 1989 with distribution centers servicing customers in the major metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Tijuana. It primarily services chain accounts, including fast food and casual dining restaurants, casinos, theme parks, movie theaters and hotels throughout Mexico.
This partnership fits our international expansion strategy, allows us to enhance service to our U.S. customers who operate in the region and provides growth opportunities in an important region of the Americas. In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced our agreement to acquire Tannis Trading in Canada. Tannis operates in the Ottawa market, the fourth largest in Canada. This acquisition, which remains subject to regulatory approval, would allow us to better serve our customers and achieve our goal of increasing sales in Canada. 
Regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year, there are a few additional items I'd like to point out. First, as we discussed last quarter, because of the pending merger during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying back shares to offset dilution from incentive-based compensation as we would normally be doing. This has had the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employee stock options and divesting of restricted stock units. As a result, both adjusted and reported diluted EPS were lower by $0.005 in the third quarter and $0.015 over the first 39 weeks.
Unless we repurchased shares during the fourth quarter, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than 597 million shares in the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock option exercises and RSU vesting that occurs and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the pending US Foods merger. Second, please note that we plan to pay off $300 million in bonds that come due in mid-June. We currently anticipate using cash on hand to fund this payment. Lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from asset sales, remains at $500 million to $500 million -- sorry, $500 million to $550 million for fiscal year 2015, but we now expect to be at the high end of this range for the year.
In closing, while our top line has been negatively impacted by lower levels of inflation and the larger impact from foreign currency translation, we are pleased that the business continues to generate solid case volume growth, in particular, in the locally managed portion of our business. We have opportunities to improve our operating expense management and have begun to make some progress in this area. But importantly, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow. While we have work ahead of us to transform the business, there are many exciting initiatives underway that will enhance our customers' experience, strengthen our operating performance and increase profitability. 
With that, operator, we'll now take some questions."

So I think essentially, you're looking at an environment today where you've got 2 categories, meat and poultry that are high, which is difficult to pass along in a fast way and the right way. And the others are pretty much neutral if you put them all together. And yes, I expect that to continue here at least for the, whatever, a few, couple, 3 months as far as we can see out. As I said in my comments, we're seeing improvement on the expenses sequentially, we're not just seeing as fast as we have planned.

So we need to manage what we have the ability to control the most, which is our business, and we're pretty good at running our business. Obviously, as we've said for a while now, the market environment we're in is difficult. It's very competitive, and it's not like many other industries and we don't expect that to change. So again, to kind of recap how we look at the world, we see modest medium- to long-term growth in the industry. We expect to grow faster than that. To do that, we need to differentiate ourselves ongoing-ly with our customers and we need to take cost out of the system. It's one of the reasons why this merger is so important to us. If the merger doesn't happen, we'll need to find other ways to continue to do that. We may not get there quite as fast, but I'm confident we'll continue to go in the right direction. Specifically, to this quarter, you can look at it a lot of different ways. The bottom line is we didn't manage our expenses as well as we would have liked. If we had managed our cost at least maybe just $0.05 better, I think you would have seen a different result here, and I would've been -- I wouldn't have talked as much about planned expenses. So we're going to have quarters where there's inflation and less inflation. And we had good volume growth, as I said. We managed gross profit reasonably well given the environment. We just didn't bring our expenses in line as fast as we planned. And I expect that we'll get better at that here over the next 2 or 3 quarters."

It's also a time that we bring M.A.s on in terms of training. And we had some operating companies that were behind in our headcount, and I think that put some pressure on us here as well. So selling cost is a little higher than what we planned. On the operations side, we're making progress. We're driving out a lot of change here, Karen. And we've been driving out very aggressively over the last year, 2 years, and that puts a lot of stress on the operating companies at a time when they still need to provide really solid service to our customers. And so there's been some challenges in terms of how fast you can drive that change and how well it's received by our workforce and how well our leadership, including me, are able to drive that out. So what we're doing here is transforming the company and we're bringing more standardization to our best practices in the field. We're functionalizing that part of our business in terms of the OpCo and our end-to-end supply chain organization now, and it's just taking a little longer to get where we want to go.

But for the most part, we're working with the suppliers here at corporate and then working closely with our operating companies. So from that standpoint, we've realized a lot of benefits, but we have some more launches here to do later this year into next year, and that's a significant part of the overall volume. And then I think what you'll see us do is we'll get into renewals, and we'll continue to perfect what we started here and get better at it and probably have more time to focus on the innovation side of it, which is critical obviously to growing the business as well.

Andy, if you noticed, I really didn't talk a lot about the industry or the market because it's hard to make that call right now. While I did talk about weather, I didn't whine about weather this year, so I feel good about that. What we saw was this, and what I alluded to in my comments, we had -- last year, if you go back and looked at the weather, it was pretty harsh in December, January and first 3 weeks in February. And it was harsh in areas where typically you don't see it -- Charlotte, Dallas, Atlanta and other places. And so we had some favorable comparisons in late December, January and February. Unfortunately, January and February are not exactly big months for us. Then if you recall last year, there's a little bit of a cabin fever impact up North, and I think people got out in March just because they needed to get out. And then March was reasonably mild and so was April, and so the camps and the clubs started to open up earlier. So we had good volume in March and April relative to the rest of the year last year, and I think we're seeing softer volume this year. What I'm trying to say here is I think weather is impacting that, I just don't know to what degree. And I think I can make a better call on that after we see May and June here because we'll be back to apples-to-apples. In terms of what I read and what I hear, it's probably not a whole lot different than you. It's -- the good news here is that the consumer sentiment is positive. It's up and down a little bit, but still positive. The sentiment of our restaurant operators is positive. It's remained positive. So I think people are generally seeing at least maintaining -- they're seeing good things and they're hopeful that it'll translate into better things. Probably the biggest positive out there right now, I would say, would be the lower fuel prices. They've come back up a little bit, but all in all, the consumer is getting a raise, if you will, at the pump. But what's not clear there at all is to what degree. It appears the consumer is paying down debt with some of that, saving some of that and spending some of that. It's not clear how much of that we're getting, perhaps some, but I don't think a lot at this point. With that said, I think to the extent that the fuel prices stayed down for an extended period of time, that will be good for our customers and I would expect that, that will help us over time. So it's a long way of saying it's hard for me to really explain what's going on in the market right now because of kind of the unusual weather comparisons as well as the impact of fuel. But I think we'll have a better read on this as we get into the summer."

So with us, it always starts the way you pose the question, which is what's important to customer, what does the customer need. And we're doing a lot of work on the customer side through the marketing department and customer loyalty initiatives to understand customer needs and then connecting that to work that we're doing with our suppliers and category management and the day-to-day provide us to better optimize our SKUs. Now it's early days and plenty of work to do there, but that's a big opportunity for us going forward.

But not with a lot of touches like the Broadline, but there's no -- very little margin for error in SYGMA. So we've had to invest some money over the last year or so in terms of facilities and drivers and people like that, things like that, to strengthen the business, and that's hurt us on the bottom line. We've also had to just take a look at how well we're running the business overall. So I'd say we're in transition with SYGMA. We like the business strategically. It's a very -- that customer base or potential customer base is a big part of the overall opportunity, and it's always nice when you're sitting down with customers or prospective customers for -- to give them a choice in terms of which model they would prefer, the SYGMA model or the Broadline model.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance and excellent progress in several key initiatives that have begun to provide a strong foundation for value creation. Our favorable operating performance was driven by providing our customers with exceptional service, growing our business with both locally and corporate managed customers and stabilizing our gross margins. 
For the year, we achieved record sales of $49 billion, an increase of 5%. We grew our adjusted operating income and earnings per share by 3% and 5%, respectively. We generated $1 billion of free cash flow. We earned our return on invested capital of 13% on an adjusted basis. We increased our dividend for the 46th time in our history and distributed nearly $700 million in dividends to our shareholders.
In addition and subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we announced a $3 billion 2-year share buyback program that will more effectively leverage our strong balance sheet and return additional capital to shareholders. It is important to note that these accomplishments were achieved with minimal disruption from the U.S. Foods merger planning and litigation processes that continued throughout the entire fiscal year. And I am extremely appreciative and proud of all of our associates who performed so well on multiple fronts.
Moving to our performance in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the following. We generated case growth of 3.6% in our Broadline business. Gross profit grew 3% in an environment with no food cost inflation, and gross margin expanded by 35 basis points compared to the prior year. Expense management trends improved from earlier in the year, and our cost per case in our North American Broadline operations was essentially flat compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis. 
Key drivers of our improved operating performance for both the year and the fourth quarter were the following: increasing acceleration of local case growth; effective implementation of our category management process; improved Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally managed customers; significant progress in developing and growing our offerings for the Hispanic customer segment; collaborative and mutually beneficial joint business planning processes with a small but growing number of corporate managed accounts. 
One other meaningful factor that impacted our financial results was the degree of volatility in food cost inflation. We experienced nearly 5% food cost inflation during the first 3 quarters of 2015 and we managed it very well. However, food cost inflation in the fourth quarter was essentially flat, which unfavorably impacted sales and gross profit growth. Early trends in fiscal 2016 are similar, and we expect this to be a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or 2. We are committed to mitigating as much of this pressure as possible through ongoing margin stabilization efforts and improved expense management.
Moving to market and economic trends. As I speak to you today, the data is mixed. Consumer confidence and the outlook of food service operators are at historically high levels but have slipped somewhat in the summer months. Fuel prices at the pump remained at historically attractive levels, which should support higher consumer spending moving forward. Restaurant spend is up but traffic is generally flat. Overall, the market environment appears to be modestly improved from 1 year or 2 ago, but it is unclear what the go-forward trajectory for the industry growth is over the next several quarters. 
Whether the overall industry grows over the next 3 years at 1% real growth consistent with the past few years or closer to the 2% in Technomic's recently released 5-year forecast, we at Sysco will continue to differentiate our product and service offerings in a manner that will allow us to both profitably grow our market share and provide an improved return on invested capital for our shareholders. I will offer some additional color on our future opportunities after Chris shares his perspective on our financial results for the year and the fourth quarter."

I'd like to begin by providing some highlights of our financial performance in 2015, then I'll discuss our results for the fourth quarter, and I'll close with some guidance for fiscal 2016 around a few metrics.F",1829,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by providing some highlights of our financial performance in 2015, then I'll discuss our results for the fourth quarter, and I'll close with some guidance for fiscal 2016 around a few metrics.
For the year, sales, gross profit and adjusted operating expenses all grew about 5%. Sales and gross profit benefited from high food cost inflation in the first half of the year but were constrained in the back half as that inflation moderated and eventually disappeared. Expenses were growing too fast early in the year but were being supported by high gross profit growth. Expense growth moderated in the back half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter.
Our adjusted EPS also grew by about 5% this year. One thing to notice that our diluted shares for the year increased 1.1% because we did not repurchase shares while the merger was pending as we typically would have done. If we had held our diluted shares flat, it would have added approximately $0.02 to our adjusted EPS and 1% to our EPS growth rate.
We achieved several of our objectives during the year. We exceeded our final 3-year target for annualized business transformation benefit. Our successful implementation of category management helped to enhance gross profits and mitigate gross margin pressure. For the year, gross margin was flat compared to 2014 after declining in each of the last 4 fiscal years. 
We continued our prudent management of capital expenditures, with net CapEx of $518 million, falling well within our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. We recorded another year of significant growth and free cash flow on an adjusted basis, which grew to $1.3 billion, up 22% over the last year. 
With regards to cost per case, we achieved our revised goal of limiting the increase to $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year. Actual cost per case increased $0.09 per case for the full year on a constant currency basis and decreased $0.01 in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. It's important to note that our original objective when we started the year was to hold cost per case flat for the year. Because we didn't achieve our original goal, we also did not achieve our goal of growing operating expenses slower than gross profit for the year, as operating expenses were up 4.8% versus a gross profit increase of 4.5%. However, we were able to improve our cost per case performance in the second half of the year and achieved our goal in the fourth quarter where operating expenses grew by 2.2% compared to gross profit growth of 3%.
Let's turn our attention now to our fourth quarter results. Year-over-year sales growth decelerated to 9% as food cost inflation declined significantly from 5.4% in the first half of the year and 3.7% in the third quarter to flat in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we saw relatively modest inflation in the meat, poultry and frozen categories but produce, seafood and dairy were deflationary. 
Changes in foreign exchange rates continue to have a much larger impact than usual in the fourth quarter. A strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars and as a result, decreased sales by 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales by 0.4% in the quarter.
Broadline and SYGMA case volume grew 2.2% during the quarter, including acquisitions and 1.9% excluding acquisitions. This result included a decline in SYGMA's case volume as we work to optimize that business. Broadline case growth, which excludes SYGMA, was 3.6%, reflecting our solid performance at both locally and corporate managed account. We are especially encouraged that local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business has grown sequentially in each of the last 5 quarters.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $2.2 billion, a 3% increase, while gross margin increased 35 basis points to 17.9%. Our U.S. Broadline business was responsible for the majority of this increase, driven by a stronger relative mix of sales for our locally managed business, benefits from category management and a very effective national promotion for our Sysco branded products. Case growth for our corporate managed customers remains strong but competitive pricing in this segment pressured overall gross margin.
Expenses for certain items in the fourth quarter totaled roughly $430 million, almost entirely related to the termination of the U.S. Foods merger. This included noncash accruals for the 2 break-up fees paid to U.S. Foods and PSG, totaling $313 million; $67 million in litigation fees and other integration planning expenses; interest on merger debt of $41 million; and an $11 million write-off on merger integration capital. This was capital we spend on projects that would only be useful if the merger was completed. A vast majority of the merger-related capital we spent will benefit the company as we move forward. We've included a table in our slide presentation to show the expense impact of these items. I will provide more details about the impact to our 2016 financials in a few minutes.
Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased $36 million or 2%, mainly driven by the impact of higher case volumes, which increased our payroll and more specifically, incentive compensation accruals. As I mentioned earlier, we made progress in reducing our cost per case during the quarter. Cost per case was down $0.01 on a constant currency basis and down $0.07 when we include the impact from foreign exchange translation. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $509 million, up 5.8% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 4.1%, up 19 basis points from last year.
Turning to other income. There was an $19 million [ph] increase from last year, mainly driven by accounting for our JV transaction where we consolidate 100% of the JV's results above the operating income line and then back out the noncontrolling interest in other income expense.
Our tax rate for the quarter was negative, primarily driven by the merger termination fees. Adjusting for these fees and other certain items, our tax rate for the quarter would have been closer to 38%. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter increased 5.7% to $309 million and adjusted EPS increased 6.1% to $0.52.
Cash flow performance for the year was again very strong. Cash flow from operations increased $63 million to $1.6 billion while free cash flow increased $42 million to $1 billion. Both operating and free cash flow reflect the negative impact of 2 items. First, the cash impact of certain items was $231 million in fiscal 2015 mainly due to merger-related expenses. Second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contribution this year. After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $280 million higher or $1.3 billion in fiscal year '15.
Capital expenditures for the year, net of proceeds from asset sales, increased $21 million to $518 million, well within our guidance and internal budget. During the year, we significantly increased our investment in business technology as we were planning for the merger integration. While the vast majority of these additional investments will benefit the company even without the merger, we wrote off $11 million, as I mentioned previously. 
We were pleased that our adjusted ROIC grew 70 basis points to 13.1% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the continued prudent and disciplined investments in our business and solid operating performance during the year. Finally, a housekeeping item to point out in our segment reporting. We have reclassified our specialty meat company results out of the Broadline segment and into the other segment as these operations are no longer into our Broadline leadership. We've provided a schedule in the earnings release this morning to show the quarterly and full year impact of this reclassification to both fiscal 2014 and 2015.
Looking ahead, I'd like to provide guidance for a few metrics to set expectations for the coming year: first, fiscal year 2016 will be a 53-week fiscal year for us, with the extra week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter; second, as Bill mentioned, we are starting the year off with little to no food cost inflation, which will create a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or 2; third, we will recognize additional merger-related expenses totaling $95 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. These will include $50 million related to the payment of the 1% call premium on the merger debt, which was redeemed in July; a $29 million write-off of professional fees related to the issuance of the merger debt; an $18 million [ph] write-off of the bond discounts on the merger debt; a $10 million gain on the termination of the interest rate swaps we put in place upon issuing the merger debt; and $8 million in interest expense incurred, leading up to the July 14, 2015, redemption of the merger-related debt. These amounts will all be classified certain items in the first quarter.
The negative cash impact of certain items during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 will total approximately $350 million, including $313 million reflecting the payment of the break fees accrued after this quarter, $500 million for the bond redemption premium, partially offset by approximately $15 million in proceeds related to the gain on the termination of our interest rate swaps.
Fourth, we expect to issue $2 billion in new debt around the end of the first quarter to fund both the accelerated share repurchase, as announced previously, as well as term out a portion of our commercial paper facility. Adjusted interest expense for 2016 will be significantly higher because of this. Additionally, prior to issuing our merger debt in October of 2014, we entered into swaps that locked in a portion of the interest rates. These swaps were settled in fiscal 2015, and we may expect to amortize about $10 million of that interest expense in fiscal 2016.
A share repurchase program we announced will positively impact EPS in fiscal 2016. Because of the timing of the buyback implementation, we don't expect to realize a full year's benefit from the reduction of shares in fiscal 2016. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal '16, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction on average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense on the new debt issuance. In fiscal 2017, we would expect to capture the full year impact of this buyback on an annualized basis.
Fifth, with regards to taxes, a normalized tax rate for Sysco would typically be in the range of 36% to 37%. And lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds for asset sales, is $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2016. Now I'll turn it back to Bill for closing remarks."

While pleased with our progress and accomplishments in fiscal 2015, we recognize that there's so much work to do if we are to fully realize our vision for Sysco to be our customer's most valued and trusted business partner. 
The good news is that we have a sound strategy that is predicated on profoundly enriching the experience of doing business with Sysco, enhancing productivity and innovation in all aspects of our business, attracting and developing the best people available and exploring opportunities for growth within and beyond our core business. 
The better news is that we have begun to realize the benefits of several years of -- we have begun to realize the benefits of several years of transformative change to our business through a portfolio of strategic business initiatives. And the exciting news is that we are now beginning to embed these initiatives in how we do business each and every day by putting the customer first and working cohesively as One Sysco.
Following the termination of the U.S. Foods merger agreement and utilizing the knowledge that we have acquired through our ongoing customer insights work, we've begun to update our 3-year strategic business plan. Specifically, we see opportunities to further accelerate our case growth, especially with locally managed customers through more impactful product and service differentiation, together with enhanced sales and technology capabilities. 
We also believe that we can build upon our recent success in stabilizing gross margin through enhanced product innovation, growing our Sysco brand sales and improving our pricing analytics and support. In addition, we see significant potential to improve our productivity and reduce overhead costs throughout our supply chain organization and in the administrative areas of our business. We will continue to invest in our business to fully realize these benefits and improve our return on invested capital over the next 3 years as well.
We'll discuss these plans in more detail, including financial impacts, at our September 15 Investor Day. Lastly, as most of you know, this is Chris' last conference call with us. I'd like to thank Chris for his numerous contributions to Sysco over the past 6 years, and all of us at Sysco would like to wish Chris and his family the very best as they move forward.

We won't steal too much thunder from Investor Day so don't worry about that, Ed.

We won't steal too much thunder from Investor Day so don't worry about that, Ed. I think in the cost side, the way I look at our numbers, as those of you follow us know, I look at them in terms of what are the key things we look at here. Volume growth, in particular relative to the market, and within that volume growth, it's very important that we see good local case growth, and we've seen that here over the last several quarters. We need the contract business as well but we need that local business to grow as well to drive profitability. And I look at operating income growth. And operating income is always going to be not just mathematically but just from a business perspective, it's going to be a by-product of the environment that we're in. And at times, sometimes, the gross profit will grow faster and sometimes, the expenses will grow a little bit slower. And so I think any given quarter, there's always things that'll move around that could impact the numbers. So I think as you look at the year, I think I would say to you that basically what we said in the prepared comments, we're pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter on the expense side, in particular in the supply chain side of the business and really the business itself in the field where we had flat cost per piece. Now for the year, we didn't. I mean, we were up almost $0.10 and I would say we need to bring that number for the year back down into that flat to up $0.05 zone. I'm not saying that we will or we won't. I'm just saying that, that's kind of where the numbers ultimately need to get to drive the earnings growth. So our plan to earnings to your Investor Day, Ed, our plan is to become more consistent in terms of how we do that and to take the quarter we saw here in the field and to begin to put that up quarter after quarter. Now with that said, I also said that we're going to continue to invest in the business here in terms of things that will drive some of the commercial initiatives that are really panning out for us now, both on the growth side as well as the merchandising side. So it's always going to be a mix, I think, of timing of investment relative to what you think the value of it is. And bottom line, I would say, there are some things in the fourth quarter, for example, bad debt, we had an exceptional year in bad debt this year, knock on wood please but -- and so that benefited our fourth quarter number as well as the year to some extent. So I would say that somewhere between that 2% growth and the 4.8% is where we need to get to. And I would say in terms of Investor Day at I think what you're going to hear there is we're running a business here it's very important that we accelerate our case growth. We see opportunities to do that, especially on the local side. That needs to turn into leveraging our operating income, which we did here in the fourth quarter, and we were up for the year. So I look at the fourth quarter as hopefully approximately for what we can do next year. Our quarters are going to have their own unique and I would think that you'll hear a message from us that says we have opportunity on all sides, including the cost side. But the big opportunity here is always going to be for a company with our capabilities, with our footprint, with our people and with our technology today to grow faster than the market and to do that profitably and to provide a good return on capital. So certainly opportunities for cost reduction, they are significant. It'll take some time for that to play out, and we will talk about that more at Investor Day. But I don't want to -- I won't leave this question without emphasizing how important it is for us to grow the business as we did this quarter. I mean, this is a quality quarter for us, both in terms of growth leverage and the mix of that growth. And I think that's really what you're going to hear at Investor Day. It takes all facets of our business to be sync for us to go where we want to go."

So when we're in those levels, we're able to kind of have the best of both worlds, if you will, in terms of a little bit of a tailwind inflation, and at the same time, it doesn't hurt demand to any large extent. We very seldom find ourselves in that zone, and right now, we find ourselves in a zone where there's little to no inflation. As we said, there's some modest inflation, some modest deflation in the categories. So I think the way I would look at that is it's a little bit of a better environment right now in terms of our customer being able to manage their business. And when our costs aren't going up that much, obviously, we don't have to raise our prices as much. So from that standpoint, it probably does help in terms of case growth, but in terms of the competitive environment, I don't really think it changes that at all."

So it's -- there's a high percentage of street business but there's also a fair amount of what we call local contract business. And these would be chains -- and they can be of different sizes. They could be local chains, they could be somewhat regional, they could even be across regions, and that's why I said there's exceptions. But in our world, it's street business plus what we call local contract. And then corporate managed business is your very large regional chains and your national and international customers for that matter, where the relationships are largely managed from corporate here and generally with the customer. And then obviously our operating companies are responsible for handling those relationships locally with the units and servicing those accounts. So that's as clear as I can make it. And there is some fuzziness there in the local contract, but the key is really it's how we look at the business and its -- how we sign primary accountability for these customer relationships."

I don't want to be too anal on this thing but that's the reality of it. We pay our bills with dollars so gross profit dollar growth is very important here. And we had 3% gross profit dollar growth, which was less than what you saw earlier in the year. But at a time where there's no inflation, that was pretty good and we were able to manage our expenses pretty well. That's why I was saying earlier those numbers are going to move around from time to time. Obviously, where we need to get back more consistently with that gross profit is growing faster than the expenses. I think on gross margin, when you're in an environment where your costs are not going up, there's not much pressure to obviously [indiscernible] prices. This not -- and that allows you to manage our margin percent a little bit better. So there's no doubt that, that's helped on the percentage part of it. But again, we need to match both. And after 3 years of talking about how important gross profit dollar growth is, I'm not going to say here today, take a victory on gross margin. I think it's good that it went up, but I think it's more impressive that we were able to grow the gross profit 3% with very little, if any, inflation and keep our expenses below that. That'll be somewhat challenging here, as we said, in the first couple of quarters but we'll continue to work at that. And we'd like to get the gross profit growth back up in that 4% to 5% zone on a time but that'll be somewhat driven by inflation. I think the core Larry here, Kelly, is when we have inflation, let's say, higher-than-normal inflation like we saw, in particular, the first half of the year, that's where and it's very difficult to -- and in times not even appropriate to raise your prices as fast as your costs are going up. And so when you have inflation environment at 5%, 6%, it's highly unlikely that your gross margin is going to keep pace on a year-over-year basis there. So it's math but it's more than math. It's the environment. There are sales people working. And it's basically what's the right way to treat the customer. So bottom line, I think it helped on the margin, but it hurt on the gross profit this quarter. As far as stabilizing, let's take it a year at a time, okay? So we have a year here where we had essentially flat margins. And I think what I should say reiterate here is because we've talked about inflation or lack thereof. I mean, we did a lot of good things this quarter and this year, so category management really matured this year and helped improve our margins. We'll see some more benefit there in the new year, not as much trajectory [indiscernible] a little bit. Growing local cases is very, very important in this business. I don't think I can say that enough. So what we said here is we now had several quarters in a row where we grew our local business. That's where we provide the most value, that's where we make the most money, and we don't have to grow at the same rate as the corporate managed necessarily, but we do need to grow them. And I think that contributed significantly to the margin as well as the gross profit growth. And then this quarter and really the year, to some extent, we saw the brand rebound a little bit. And some of that was some promotional work some of it just natural by-product connecting it with our category management direct and anytime they can our private brands create value, that's also positive. So I think there's a lot of things that led to it. There's a lot of things we need to keep doing well. And we have some good things going, but it's -- it is competitive out there and I think if we can stabilize margins at this level, we'd be very happy with that."

I don't think we can sustain 2% expense growth or 3% case growth. I don't think that's a sustainable ratio. With that said, I expect our expense growth to, on a relative basis, to be better next year than what we saw this year relative to case growth relative to sales and GP growth. So I actually feel pretty good about the part that we're managing right now and my caution is that if you look at the quarter, I see that is something -- we had 3 good quarters this year, we need to have 4 next year.

The reason is 4% is 4% is because we acknowledge that we're going to drive cases, and that's going to drive cost.

There's going to be some ups and downs there, but I'm confident that we're on the right track there. So I don't know that you can sustain flat every quarter, but certainly low single-digit case increases -- cost case increases [indiscernible] shooting for here. On the corporate said it kind of depends on the quarter. You talked about some true-ups. I mentioned bad debts. So in any given quarter, there could be some it's on the corporate side. I would just say to you that as we continue -- look, we have stood up a lot of capabilities here cap that meant a lot of things and sales capabilities. There's more to do there. So we'll continue to invest in our people and our technology to position this company to grow its business and grow profitably and compete very well and do great things for our customers. So long story short we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but as I said, we expect to grow the cases. So I don't think 2% is sustainable, with 3% case growth if we're able to continue to do that. At the same time, 4.8% is too hard.

So overall cost per case was higher than it should have been, higher than we wanted it to be. We got it to back under control in Q4. And certainly, that's the goal as we look into next year.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance and excellent progress in several key initiatives that have begun to provide a strong foundation for value creation. Our favorable operating performance was driven by providing our customers with exceptional service, growing our business with both locally and corporate managed customers and stabilizing our gross margins. 
For the year, we achieved record sales of $49 billion, an increase of 5%. We grew our adjusted operating income and earnings per share by 3% and 5%, respectively. We generated $1 billion of free cash flow. We earned a return on invested capital of 13% on an adjusted basis. We increased our dividend for the 46th time in our history and distributed nearly $700 million in dividends to our shareholders. In addition and subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we announced a $3 billion 2-year share buyback program that will more effectively leverage our strong balance sheet and return additional capital to shareholders. 
It is important to note that these accomplishments were achieved with minimal disruption from the U.S. Foods merger planning and litigation processes that continued throughout the entire fiscal year, and I am extremely appreciative and proud of all of our associates who performed so well on multiple fronts.
Moving to our performance in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the following: we generated case growth of 3.6% in our Broadline business. Gross profit grew 3% in an environment with no food cost inflation, and gross margin expanded by 35 basis points compared to the prior year; expense management trends improved from earlier in the year, and our cost per case in our North American Broadline operations was essentially flat compared to the prior year on a constant-currency basis. 
Key drivers of our improved operating performance for both the year and the fourth quarter were the following: increasing acceleration of local case growth; effective implementation of our category management process; improved Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally managed customers; significant progress in developing and growing our offerings for the Hispanic customer segment; collaborative and mutually beneficial joint business planning processes with a small but growing number of corporate managed accounts. 
One other meaningful factor that impacted our financial results was the degree of volatility in food cost inflation. We experienced nearly 5% food cost inflation during the first 3 quarters of 2015, and we managed it very well. However, food cost inflation in the fourth quarter was essentially flat, which unfavorably impacted sales and gross profit growth. Early trends in fiscal 2016 are similar, and we expect this to be a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or 2. We are committed to mitigating as much of this pressure as possible through ongoing gross margin stabilization efforts and improved expense management.
Moving to market and economic trends. As I speak to you today, the data is mixed. Consumer confidence and the outlook of food service operators are at historically high levels but have slipped somewhat in the summer months. Fuel prices at the pump remained at historically attractive levels, which should support higher consumer spending moving forward. Restaurant spend is up but traffic is generally flat. Overall, the market environment appears to be modestly improved from 1 year or 2 ago, but it is unclear what the go-forward trajectory for the industry growth is over the next several quarters. 
Whether the overall industry grows over the next 3 years at 1% real growth, consistent with the past few years, or closer to the 2% in Technomics' recently released 5-year forecast, we at Sysco will continue to differentiate our product and service offerings in a manner that will allow us to both profitably grow our market share and provide an improved return on invested capital for our shareholders. 
I will offer some additional color on our future opportunities after Chris shares his perspective on our financial results for the year and the fourth quarter."

I'd like to begin by providing some highlights of our financial performance in 2015, then, I'll discuss our results for the fourth quarter, and I'll close with some guidance for fiscal 2016 around a few metrics.
For the year, sales, gross profits and adjusted operating expenses all grew about 5%. Sales and gross profits benefited from high food cost inflation in the first half of the year but were constrained in the back half as that inflation moderated and eventually disappeared. Expenses were growing too fast early in the year but were being supported by high gross profit growth. Expense growth moderated in the back half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter.
Our adjusted EPS also grew by about 5% this year. One thing to note is that our diluted shares for the year increased 1.1% because we did not repurchase shares while the merger was pending as we typically would have done. If we had held our diluted shares flat, it would have added approximately $0.02 to our adjusted EPS and 1% to our EPS growth rate.
We achieved several of our objectives during the year. We exceeded our final 3-year target for annualized business transformation benefits. Our successful implementation of category management helped to enhance gross profits and mitigate gross margin pressure. For the year, gross margin was flat compared to 2014 after declining in each of the last 4 fiscal years. 
We continued our prudent management of capital expenditures, with net CapEx of $518 million falling well within our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. We recorded another year of significant growth in free cash flow on an adjusted basis, which grew to $1.3 billion, up 22% over the last year. 
With regards to cost per case, we achieved our revised goal of limiting the increase to $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year. Actual cost per case increased $0.09 per case for the full year on a constant-currency basis and decreased $0.01 in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. It's important to note that our original objective when we started the year was to hold cost per case flat for the year. Because we didn't achieve our original goal, we also did not achieve our goal of growing operating expenses slower than gross profit for the year, as operating expenses were up 4.8% versus a gross profit increase of 4.5%. However, we were able to improve our cost-per-case performance in the second half of the year and achieved our goal in the fourth quarter, where operating expenses grew by 2.2% compared to gross profit growth of 3%.
Let's turn our attention now to our fourth quarter results. Year-over-year sales growth decelerated to 9%, as food cost inflation declined significantly from 5.4% in the first half of the year and 3.7% in the third quarter to flat in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we saw relatively modest inflation in the meat, poultry and frozen categories but produce, seafood and dairy were deflationary. 
Changes in foreign exchange rates continued to have a much larger impact than usual in the fourth quarter. The strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars and, as a result, decreased sales by 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales by 0.4% in the quarter.
Broadline and SYGMA case volume grew 2.2% during the quarter, including acquisitions, and 1.9% excluding acquisitions. This result included a decline in SYGMA's case volume as we work to optimize that business. Broadline case growth, which excludes SYGMA, was 3.6%, reflecting our solid performance at both locally and corporate managed accounts. We are especially encouraged that local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business has grown sequentially in each of the last 5 quarters.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $2.2 billion, a 3% increase, while gross margin increased 35 basis points to 17.9%. Our U.S. Broadline business was responsible for the majority of this increase, driven by a stronger relative mix of sales for our locally managed business, benefits from category management and a very effective national promotion for our Sysco-branded products. Case growth for our corporate managed customers remained strong but competitive pricing in this segment pressured overall gross margin.
Expenses for certain items in the fourth quarter totaled roughly $430 million, almost entirely related to the termination of the U.S. Foods merger. This included noncash accruals for the 2 breakup fees paid to U.S. Foods and PFG, totaling $313 million; $67 million in litigation fees and other integration planning expenses; interest on merger debt of $41 million; and an $11 million write-off on merger integration capital. This was capital we spend on projects that would only be useful if the merger was completed. A vast majority of the merger-related capital we spent will benefit the company as we move forward. We've included a table in our slide presentation to show the expense impact of these items. I will provide more details about the impact to our 2016 financials in a few minutes.
Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased $36 million or 2%, mainly driven by the impact of higher case volumes, which increased our payroll and, more specifically, incentive compensation accruals. As I mentioned earlier, we made progress in reducing our cost per case during the quarter. Cost per case was down $0.01 on a constant-currency basis and down $0.07 when we include the impact from foreign exchange translation. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $509 million, up 5.8% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 4.1%, up 19 basis points from last year.
Turning to other income. There was an $18 million increase from last year, mainly driven by accounting for our JV transactions, where we consolidate 100% of the JV's results above the operating income line and then back out the noncontrolling interest in other income expense.
Our tax rate for the quarter was negative, primarily driven by the merger termination fees. Adjusting for these fees and other certain items, our tax rate for the quarter would have been closer to 38%. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter increased 5.7% to $309 million and adjusted EPS increased 6.1% to $0.52.
Cash flow performance for the year was again very strong. Cash flow from operations increased $63 million to $1.6 billion while free cash flow increased $42 million to $1 billion. Both operating and free cash flow reflect the negative impact of 2 items: First, the cash impact of certain items was $231 million in fiscal 2015, mainly due to merger-related expenses; second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contribution each year. After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $280 million higher or $1.3 billion in fiscal year '15.
Capital expenditures for the year, net of proceeds from asset sales, increased $21 million to $518 million, well within our guidance and internal budget. During the year, we significantly increased our investment in business technology, as we were planning for the merger integration. While the vast majority of these additional investments will benefit the company even without the merger, we wrote off $11 million, as I mentioned previously. 
We were pleased that our adjusted ROIC grew 70 basis points to 13.1% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the continued prudent and disciplined investments in our business and solid operating performance during the year. 
Finally, a housekeeping item to point out in our segment reporting. We have reclassified our specialty meat company results out of the Broadline segment and into the other segment, as these operations are no longer reporting to our Broadline leadership. We've provided a schedule in the earnings release this morning to show the quarterly and full year impact of this reclassification to both fiscal 2014 and 2015.
Looking ahead, I'd like to provide guidance for a few metrics to set expectations for the coming year: First, fiscal year 2016 will be a 53-week fiscal year for us, with the extra week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. Second, as Bill mentioned, we are starting the year off with little to no food cost inflation, which will create a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or 2. Third, we will recognize additional merger-related expenses totaling $95 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. These will include $50 million related to the payment of the 1% call premium on the merger debt, which was redeemed in July; a $29 million write-off of professional fees related to the issuance of the merger debt; an $18 million write-off of the bond discounts on the merger debt; a $10 million gain on the termination of the interest rate swaps we put in place upon issuing the merger debt; and $8 million in interest expense incurred, leading up to the July 14, 2015, redemption of the merger-related debt. These amounts will all be classified as certain items in the first quarter.
The negative cash impact of certain items during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 will total approximately $350 million, including $313 million reflecting the payment of the break fees accrued this quarter, $500 million for the bond redemption premium, partially offset by approximately $15 million in proceeds related to the gain on the termination of our interest rate swaps.
Fourth, we expect to issue $2 billion in new debt around the end of the first quarter to fund both the accelerated share repurchase, as announced previously, as well as term out a portion of our commercial paper facility. Adjusted interest expense for 2016 will be significantly higher because of this. Additionally, prior to issuing our merger debt in October of 2014, we entered into swaps that locked in a portion of the interest rates. These swaps were settled in fiscal 2015, and we may expect to amortize about $10 million of that interest expense in fiscal 2016.
A share repurchase program we announced will positively impact EPS in fiscal 2016. Because of the timing of the buyback implementation, we don't expect to realize a full year's benefit from the reduction of shares in fiscal 2016. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal '16, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense on the new debt issuance. In fiscal 2017, we would expect to capture the full year impact of this buyback on an annualized basis.
Fifth, with regards to taxes, a normalized tax rate for Sysco would typically be in the range of 36% to 37%. And lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds for asset sales, is $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2016. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill for closing remarks."

While pleased with our progress and accomplishments in fiscal 2015, we recognize that there's still much work to do if we are to fully realize our vision for Sysco: To be our customer's most valued and trusted business partner. 
The good news is that we have a sound strategy that is predicated on profoundly enriching the experience of doing business with Sysco, enhancing productivity and innovation in all aspects of our business, attracting and developing the best people available and exploring opportunities for growth within and beyond our core business. 
The better news is that we have begun to realize the benefits of several years of transformative change to our business through our portfolio of strategic business initiatives. And the exciting news is that we are now beginning to embed these initiatives in how we do business each and every day by putting the customer first and working cohesively as One Sysco.
Following the termination of the U.S. Foods merger agreement and utilizing the knowledge that we have acquired through our ongoing customer insights work, we have begun to update our 3-year strategic business plan. Specifically, we see opportunities to further accelerate our case growth, especially with locally managed customers through more impactful product and service differentiation, together with enhanced sales and technology capabilities. 
We also believe that we can build upon our recent success in stabilizing gross margin through enhanced product innovation, growing our Sysco brand sales and improving our pricing analytics and support. In addition, we see significant potential to improve our productivity and reduce overhead cost throughout our supply chain organization and in the administrative areas of our business. We will continue to invest in our business to fully realize these benefits and improve our return on invested capital over the next 3 years as well. We will discuss these plans in more detail, including financial impacts, at our September 15 Investor Day. 
Lastly, as most of you know, this is Chris' last conference call with us. I'd like to thank Chris for his numerous contributions to Sysco over the past 6 years, and all of us at Sysco would like to wish Chris and his family the very best as they move forward. We also look forward to welcoming Joel into his new role and working with him as our CFO. 
And with that, operator, Chris and I will now take questions."

We won't steal too much thunder from Investor Day, so don't worry about that, Ed. I think, on the cost side, the way -- look, the way I look at our numbers, as those of you who follow us know, I look at them in terms of -- what are the key things we",791,"Yes. We won't steal too much thunder from Investor Day, so don't worry about that, Ed. I think, on the cost side, the way -- look, the way I look at our numbers, as those of you who follow us know, I look at them in terms of -- what are the key things we look at here? Volume growth, in particular, relative to the market, and within that volume growth, it's very important that we see good local case growth. And we've seen that here over the last several quarters. We need the contract business as well, but we need that local business to grow as well to drive profitability. And then, I look at operating income growth. And operating income is always going to be -- not just mathematically but just from a business perspective, it's going to be a by-product of the environment that we're in. And at times, sometimes, the gross profit will grow faster and sometimes, the expenses will grow a little bit slower, and so which is -- and I think, any given quarter, there's always things that'll move around that could impact the numbers. So I think, as you look at the year, I think I would say to you that, basically what we said in the prepared comments, we're pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter on the expense side, in particular, in the supply chain side of the business, and really, the business itself in the field where we had flat cost per piece. Now for the year, we didn't. I mean, we were up almost $0.10, and I would say that we need to bring that number for the year back down into that ""flat to up $0.05"" zone. I'm not saying that we will or we won't, I'm just saying that, that's kind of where the numbers ultimately need to get to, to drive the earnings growth. So our plan -- to go to your earnings -- to your Investor Day, Ed, our plan is to become more consistent in terms of how we do that and to take the quarter we saw here in the field and to begin to put that up quarter after quarter. Now with that said, I also said that we're going to continue to invest in the business here, in terms of things that will drive some of the commercial initiatives that are really panning out for us now, both on the growth side as well as the merchandising side. So it's always going to be a mix, I think, of timing of investment relative to what you think the value of it is. And bottom line, I would say, there are some things in the fourth quarter, for example, bad debt, we had an exceptional year in bad debt this year, knock on wood, please, but -- and so that benefited our fourth quarter numbers as well as the year to some extent. So I would say that somewhere between that 2% growth and the 4.8% is where we need to get to. And I would say to you, in terms of Investor Day, I think what you're going to hear us say there, Ed, is we're running a business here. It's very important that we accelerate our case growth. We see opportunities to do that, especially on the local side. That needs to turn into leveraging our operating income, which we did here in the fourth quarter, and we were up for the year. So I look at the fourth quarter as, hopefully, a proxy for what we can do next year. Quarters are going to have their own unique volatility, and I would think that you'll hear a message from us that says that we have opportunity on all sides, including the cost side. But the big opportunity here is always going to be for a company with our capabilities, with our footprint, with our people and with our technology today to grow faster than the market and to do that profitably and to provide a good return on capital. So certainly, opportunities for cost reduction, they are significant. It'll take some time for that to play out, and we will talk about that more at Investor Day. But I don't want to leave this question without emphasizing how important it is for us to grow the business as we did this quarter. I mean, this is a quality quarter for us, both in terms of growth, leverage and the mix of that growth. And I think that's really what you're going to hear at Investor Day. It takes all facets of our business to be on -- in sync for us to go where we want to go."

I mean, there's still plenty of competitors out there of all types, as we've talked about in great detail here, over the last year or 2. So I would tell you, I think competition's very, very acute. I think, in the short term, the way I would look at inflation, we have, for years, said and truly believe that the optimal range of inflation for our customers is -- and for us is probably in the 2% to maybe 3% range. That's a level that typically our customers can pass on and do pass on. And generally, that's a level that the consumer will accept. So when we're in those levels, we're able to kind of have the best of both worlds, if you will, in terms of a little bit of a tailwind and inflation at the same time, it doesn't hurt demand to any large extent. We very seldom find ourselves in that zone, and right now, we find ourselves in a zone where there's little to no inflation. And as we said, there's some modest inflation, some modest deflation in the categories. So I think the way I would look at that is it's a little bit of a better environment right now in terms of our customer being able to manage their business. And when our costs aren't going up that much, obviously, we don't have to raise our prices as much. So from that standpoint, it probably does help in terms of case growth, but in terms of the competitive environment, I don't really think it changes that at all."

So no, it's not the same, but it's very close. And what we did -- this was about 3 years ago, Meredith, we changed our terminology internally to, frankly, bring a little bit more clarity and accountability to the ultimate responsibility for these customers. So locally managed business is business where the customer generally -- and there's exceptions to every rule in Sysco, but generally, the customer, the decision-maker of that customer is proximate, i.e., within the selling radius of that local operating company. So it's -- there's a high percentage of street business, but there's also a fair amount of, what we call, local contract business. And these would be chains -- and they could be of different sizes. They could be local chains, they could be somewhat regional, and they could even be across regions, and that's why I said there's exceptions. But in our world, it's street business plus, what we call, local contract. And then, corporate managed business is your very large regional chains and your national and international customers, for that matter, where the relationships are largely managed from corporate here and, generally, with the customer. And then, obviously our operating companies are responsible for handling those relationships locally with the units and servicing those accounts. So that's as clear as I can make it. And there is some fuzziness there in the local contract, but the key is, really, it's how we look at the business and it's how we assign primary accountability for these customer relationships."

We",756,"I'm not sure I can answer the second one, but let me start with the first one, Kelly. So look, I think it depends on whether you're talking about gross profit or gross margin. And I don't want to be too anal on this thing, but that's the reality of it. We pay our bills with dollars, so gross profit dollar growth is very important here. And we had 3% gross profit dollar growth, which was less than what you saw earlier in the year. But at a time when there's no inflation, that was pretty good, and we were able to manage our expenses pretty well. That's why I was saying earlier, that -- those numbers are going to move around from time to time. Obviously, what we need to get back to more consistently is where that gross profit is growing faster than the expenses. I think, on gross margin, when you're in an environment where your costs are not going up, there's not as much pressure to, obviously, raise your prices. There's not -- and that allows you to manage your margin percent a little bit better. So there's no doubt that, that helped on the percentage part of it. But again, we need to match both. And after 3 years of talking about how important gross profit dollar growth is, I'm not going to sit here today and take a victory laugh on gross margin. I think it's good that it went up, but I think it's more impressive that we were able to grow the gross profit 3% with very little, if any, inflation and keep our expenses below that. That'll be somewhat challenging here, as we said, in the first couple of quarters, but we'll continue to work at that. And we'd like to get the gross profit growth back up in that 4% to 5% zone over time, like what we saw, but that will be somewhat driven by inflation. I think the corollary here, Kelly, is when we have inflation, let's say, higher-than-normal inflation like we saw, in particular, the first half of the year, that's where it's very difficult to, and at times not even appropriate, to raise your prices as fast as your costs are going up. And so when you have an inflation environment of 5%, 6%, it's highly unlikely that your gross margin is going to keep pace on a year-over-year basis there. So it's math, but it's more than math. It's the environment that our salespeople work in. And it's basically, how -- what's the right way to treat the customer. So bottom line, I think it helped on the margin, but it hurt on the gross profit this quarter. As far as stabilizing, let's take it a year at a time, okay? So we have a year here where we had essentially flat margins. And I think, what I should say or reiterate here, because we've talked a lot about inflation or lack thereof, I mean, we did a lot of good things this quarter and this year. So category management really matured this year and helped improve our margins. We'll see some more benefit there in the new year, not as much; the trajectory or the slope will flatten out a little bit. Growing local cases is very, very important in this business. I don't think I can say that enough. So what we said here is we've now had several quarters in a row where we grew our local business. That's where we provide the most value, that's where we make the most money, and we don't have to grow them at the same rate as the corporate managed necessarily, but we do need to grow them. And I think that contributed significantly to the margin as well as the gross profit growth. And then, this quarter and, really, the year, to some extent, we saw the brand rebound a little bit. And some of that was through some promotion work, some of it was just the natural by-product of connecting it with our category management work. And any time we can utilize our private brands to create value, that's also a positive. So I think there's a lot of things that led to it. There's a lot of things we need to keep doing well, and we have some good things going, but it's -- look, it is competitive out there, and I think, if we can stabilize margins at this level, we'd be very happy with that."

Attaining that 4% is going to be difficult without some sort of re-inflation in food cost. The reason the 4% is 4% is because we acknowledge that we're going to drive cases, and that's going to drive costs.

And as I said a couple of times now, that may look differently in some quarters than others, and it'll be a little more pressure here in the first quarter or 2. Our expenses this year were -- we were -- as Chris took you through, we're higher than we planned. And we're -- we can't have, 8%, 9%, 10% case growth on a currency-adjusted basis. So we had a good number here in the fourth quarter. I expect this to continue to improve on the expense side in the field. There's going to be some ups and downs there, but I'm confident that we're on the right track there. So I don't know that you can sustain flat every quarter, but certainly, low single-digit case increases -- cost case increases would be what we're shooting for here. On the corporate side, it kind of depends on the quarter. We talked about some true-ups. So I've mentioned bad debts. So in any given quarter, there could be some things on the corporate side. I would just say to you that as we continue -- look, we have stood up a lot of capabilities here, from CatMan to a lot of things in sales capabilities. There's more to do there, and so we'll continue to invest in our people and our technology to position this company to grow its business and grow it profitably and compete very well and do great things for our customers. So long story short, we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but -- and as I said, we expect to grow the cases, so I don't think 2% is sustainable, with 3% case growth if we're able to continue to do that. At the same time, 4.8% is too high. So I think you can assume from that, that somewheres in the middle is what we're shooting for."

It's certainly the best quarter we had during the year. So I'm going to be repetitive here with Bill, that we were not at all pleased with the overall year performance, but we were much more pleased with Q4, again, calling out the fact that it might be a little bit swung to the other side of being, well, hard to repeat. So overall cost per case was higher than it should have been, higher than we wanted it to be. We got it to back under control in Q4, and certainly, that's the goal as we look into next year. But it's something that we have to continue to focus on. But I -- again, we saw real improvement in Q4.

So our view on that is pretty straightforward, I think, at this point. We've kept our powder dry here for quite some time because we've been looking at a lot of different opportunities on the acquisition front, some larger than others. And we ended up pulling the trigger on the U.S. Foods deal, and that required a lot of capital. And as we all know, that ultimately didn't play out. So where we're at today is we just felt it was appropriate to return some capital, in the form of share repurchase, back to our shareholders here over the next year or 2. But we still think we need to keep some powder dry here. We continue to look for acquisitions, as I said in my comments, both within the core and potentially beyond the core, whether it be adjacency or continue to build out our international platform here. So I would just say to you, we're going to do what we're saying here, which is, from time to time, we'll continue to look at our capital structure relative to what our other options are, and for the most part, it starts with investing in the business.

We've improved modestly, but we've begun to improve in our working capital management. So there's some good things going on there. But I would always like to kind of have the opportunity to do some strategic acquisitions, if and when they present themselves.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance and excellent progress on several key initiatives that have begun to provide a strong foundation for value creation. Our favorable operating performance was driven by providing our customers with exceptional service, growing our business with both locally and corporate managed customers and stabilizing our gross margins. 
For the year, we achieved record sales of $49 billion, an increase of 5%. We grew our adjusted operating income and earnings per share by 3% and 5%, respectively. We generated $1 billion of free cash flow. We earned a return on invested capital of 13% on an adjusted basis. We increased our dividend for the 46th time in our history and distributed nearly $700 million in dividends to our shareholders. In addition and subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we announced a $3 billion 2-year share buyback program that will more effectively leverage our strong balance sheet and return additional capital to shareholders. 
It is important to note that these accomplishments were achieved with minimal disruption from the U.S. Foods merger planning and litigation processes that continued throughout the entire fiscal year, and I am extremely appreciative and proud of all of our associates who performed so well on multiple fronts.
Moving to our performance in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the following: we generated case growth of 3.6% in our Broadline business. Gross profit grew 3% in an environment with no food cost inflation, and gross margin expanded by 35 basis points compared to the prior year; expense management trends improved from earlier in the year, and our cost per case in our North American Broadline operations was essentially flat compared to the prior year, on a constant-currency basis. 
Key drivers of our improved operating performance for both the year and the fourth quarter were the following: increasing acceleration of local case growth; effective implementation of our category management process; improved Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally managed customers; significant progress in developing and growing our offerings for the Hispanic customer segment; collaborative and mutually beneficial joint business planning processes with a small but growing number of corporate managed accounts. 
One other meaningful factor that impacted our financial results was the degree of volatility in food cost inflation. We experienced nearly 5% food cost inflation during the first 3 quarters of 2015, and we managed it very well. However, food cost inflation in the fourth quarter was essentially flat, which unfavorably impacted sales and gross profit growth. Early trends in fiscal 2016 are similar, and we expect this to be a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or 2. We are committed to mitigating as much of this pressure as possible through ongoing gross margin stabilization efforts and improved expense management.
Moving to market and economic trends. As I speak to you today, the data is mixed. Consumer confidence and the outlook of food service operators are at historically high levels but have slipped somewhat in the summer months. Fuel prices at the pump remain at historically attractive levels, which should support higher consumer spending moving forward. Restaurant spend is up but traffic is generally flat. Overall, the market environment appears to be modestly improved from 1 year or 2 ago, but it is unclear what the go-forward trajectory for the industry growth is over the next several quarters. 
Whether the overall industry grows over the next few years at 1% real growth, consistent with the past few years, or closer to the 2% in Technomics' recently released 5-year forecast, we at Sysco will continue to differentiate our product and service offerings in a manner that will allow us to both profitably grow our market share and provide an improved return on invested capital for our shareholders. 
I will offer some additional color on our future opportunities after Chris shares his perspective on our financial results for the year and the fourth quarter."

I'd like to begin by providing some highlights of our financial performance in 2015, then I'll discuss our results for the fourth quarter, and I'll close with some guidance for fiscal 2016 around a few metrics.
For the year, sales, gross profits and adjusted operating expenses all grew about 5%. Sales and gross profits benefited from high food cost inflation in the first half of the year, but were constrained in the back half as that inflation moderated and eventually disappeared. Expenses were growing too fast early in the year but were being supported by high gross profit growth. Expense growth moderated in the back half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter.
Our adjusted EPS also grew by about 5% this year. One thing to note is that our diluted shares for the year increased 1.1% because we did not repurchase shares while the merger was pending as we typically would have done. If we had held our diluted shares flat, it would have added approximately $0.02 to our adjusted EPS and 1% to our EPS growth rate.
We achieved several of our objectives during the year. We exceeded our final 3-year target for annualized business transformation benefits. Our successful implementation of category management helped to enhance gross profits and mitigate gross margin pressure. For the year, gross margin was flat compared to 2014, after declining in each of the last 4 fiscal years. 
We continued our prudent management of capital expenditures, with net CapEx of $518 million falling well within our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. We recorded another year of significant growth in free cash flow on an adjusted basis, which grew to $1.3 billion, up 22% over the last year. 
With regards to cost per case, we achieved our revised goal of limiting the increase to $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year. Actual cost per case increased $0.09 per case for the full year on a constant-currency basis and decreased $0.01 in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. It's important to note that our original objective when we started the year was to hold cost per case flat for the year. Because we didn't achieve our original goal, we also did not achieve our goal of growing operating expenses slower than gross profit for the year, as operating expenses were up 4.8% versus a gross profit increase of 4.5%. However, we were able to improve our cost-per-case performance in the second half of the year and achieved our goal in the fourth quarter, where operating expenses grew by 2.2% compared to gross profit growth of 3%.
Let's turn our attention now to our fourth quarter results. Year-over-year sales growth decelerated to 9%, as food cost inflation declined significantly from 5.4% in the first half of the year and 3.7% in the third quarter to flat in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we saw relatively modest inflation in the meat, poultry and frozen categories but produce, seafood and dairy were deflationary. 
Changes in foreign exchange rates continued to have a much larger impact than usual in the fourth quarter. The strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted into U.S. dollars and, as a result, decreased sales by 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales by 0.4% in the quarter.
Broadline and SYGMA case volume grew 2.2% during the quarter, including acquisitions, and 1.9% excluding acquisitions. This result includes a decline in SYGMA's case volume as we work to optimize that business. Broadline case growth, which excludes SYGMA, was 3.6%, reflecting our solid performance with both locally and corporate managed accounts. We are especially encouraged that local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business has grown sequentially in each of the last 5 quarters.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $2.2 billion, a 3% increase, while gross margin increased 35 basis points to 17.9%. Our U.S. Broadline business was responsible for the majority of this increase, driven by a stronger relative mix of sales for our locally managed business, benefits from category management and a very effective national promotion for our Sysco-branded products. Case growth for our corporate managed customers remained strong but competitive pricing in this segment pressured overall gross margin.
Expenses for certain items in the fourth quarter totaled roughly $430 million, almost entirely related to the termination of the U.S. Foods merger. This included noncash accruals for the 2 breakup fees paid to U.S. Foods and PFG, totaling $313 million; $67 million in litigation fees and other integration planning expenses; interest on merger debt of $41 million; and an $11 million write-off on merger integration capital. This was capital we spent on projects that would only be useful if the merger was completed. The vast majority of the merger-related capital we spent will benefit the company as we move forward. We've included a table in our slide presentation to show the expense impact of these items. I will provide more details about the impact to our 2016 financials in a few minutes.
Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased $36 million or 2%, mainly driven by the impact of higher case volumes, which increased our payroll and, more specifically, incentive compensation accruals. As I mentioned earlier, we made progress in reducing our cost per case during the quarter. Cost per case was down $0.01 on a constant-currency basis and down $0.07 when we include the impact from foreign exchange translation. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $509 million, up 5.8% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 4.1%, up 19 basis points from last year.
Turning to other income. There was an $18 million increase from last year, mainly driven by accounting for our JV transactions, where we consolidate 100% of the JV's results above the operating income line and then back out the noncontrolling interest in other income expense.
Our tax rate for the quarter was negative, primarily driven by the merger termination fees. Adjusting for these fees and other certain items, our tax rate for the quarter would have been closer to 38%. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter increased 5.7% to $309 million and adjusted EPS increased 6.1% to $0.52.
Cash flow performance for the year was again very strong. Cash flow from operations increased $63 million to $1.6 billion while free cash flow increased $42 million to $1 billion. Both operating and free cash flow reflect the negative impact of 2 items: first, the cash impact of certain items was $231 million in fiscal 2015, mainly due to merger-related expenses; second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contribution each year. After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $280 million higher or $1.3 billion in fiscal year '15.
Capital expenditures for the year, net of proceeds from asset sales, increased $21 million to $518 million, well within our guidance and internal budgets. During the year, we significantly increased our investment in business technology, as we were planning for the merger integration. While the vast majority of these additional investments will benefit the company even without the merger, we wrote off $11 million, as I mentioned previously. 
We were pleased that our adjusted ROIC grew 70 basis points to 13.1% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the continued prudent and disciplined investments in our business and solid operating performance during the year. 
Finally, a housekeeping item to point out in our segment reporting. We have reclassified our specialty meat company results out of the Broadline segment and into the other segment, as these operations are no longer reporting to our Broadline leadership. We provided a schedule in the earnings release this morning to show the quarterly and full year impact of this reclassification to both fiscal 2014 and 2015.
Looking ahead, I'd like to provide guidance for a few metrics to set expectations for the coming year. First, fiscal year 2016 will be a 53-week fiscal year for us, with the extra week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. Second, as Bill mentioned, we are starting the year off with little to no food cost inflation, which will create a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or 2. Third, we will recognize additional merger-related expenses totaling $95 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. These will include $50 million related to the payment of the 1% call premium on the merger debt, which was redeemed in July; a $29 million write-off of professional fees related to the issuance of the merger debt; an $18 million write-off of the bond discounts on the merger debt; a $10 million gain on the termination of the interest rate swaps we put in place upon issuing the merger debt; and $8 million in interest expense incurred leading up to the July 14, 2015 redemption of the merger-related debt. These amounts will all be classified as certain items in the first quarter.
The negative cash impact of certain items during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 will total approximately $350 million, including $313 million reflecting the payment of the break fees accrued this quarter, $500 million for the bond redemption premium, partially offset by approximately $15 million in proceeds related to the gain on the termination of our interest rate swaps.
Fourth, we expect to issue $2 billion in new debt around the end of the first quarter to fund both the accelerated share repurchases announced previously as well as term out a portion of our commercial paper facility. Adjusted interest expense for 2016 will be significantly higher because of this. Additionally, prior to issuing our merger debt in October of 2014, we entered into swaps that locked in a portion of the interest rates. These swaps were settled in fiscal 2015, and we expect to amortize about $10 million of that interest expense in fiscal 2016.
The share repurchase program we announced will positively impact EPS in fiscal 2016. Because of the timing of the buyback implementation, we don't expect to realize a full year's benefit from the reduction of shares in fiscal 2016. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal '16, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense on the new debt issuance. In fiscal 2017, we would expect to capture the full year impact of this buyback on an annualized basis.
Fifth, with regards to taxes, a normalized tax rate for Sysco would typically be in the range of 36% to 37%. And lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds for asset sales, is $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2016. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill for closing remarks."

And the exciting news is that we are now beginning to embed these initiatives in how we do business each and every day by putting the customer first and working cohesively as One Sysco.
Following the termination of the U.S. Foods merger agreement and utilizing the knowledge that we have acquired through our ongoing customer insights work, we have begun to update our 3-year strategic business plan. Specifically, we see opportunities to further accelerate our case growth, especially with locally managed customers, through more impactful product and service differentiation together with enhanced sales and technology capabilities. 
We also believe that we can build upon our recent success in stabilizing gross margin through enhanced product innovation, growing our Sysco brand sales and improving our pricing analytics and support. In addition, we see significant potential to improve our productivity and reduce overhead costs throughout our supply chain organization and in the administrative areas of our business. We will continue to invest in our business to fully realize these benefits and improve our return on invested capital over the next 3 years as well. We will discuss these plans in more detail, including financial impacts, at our September 15 Investor Day. 
Lastly, as most of you know, this is Chris' last conference call with us. I'd like to thank Chris for his numerous contributions to Sysco over the past 6 years, and all of us at Sysco would like to wish Chris and his family the very best as they move forward. We also look forward to welcoming Joel into his new role and working with him as our CFO. 
And with that, operator, Chris and I will now take questions."

We won't steal too much thunder from Investor Day, so don't worry about that, Ed. I think, on the cost side, the way -- look, the way I look at our numbers, as those of you who follow us know, I look at them in terms of what are the key things we loo",791,"Yes. We won't steal too much thunder from Investor Day, so don't worry about that, Ed. I think, on the cost side, the way -- look, the way I look at our numbers, as those of you who follow us know, I look at them in terms of what are the key things we look at here? Volume growth, in particular, relative to the market, and within that volume growth, it's very important that we see good local case growth. And we've seen that here over the last several quarters. We need the contract business as well, but we need that local business to grow as well to drive profitability. And then I look at operating income growth. And operating income is always going to be -- not just mathematically but just from a business perspective, it's going to be a byproduct of the environment that we're in, and at times, sometimes the gross profit will grow faster and sometimes the expenses will grow a little bit slower, and so which is -- and I think, any given quarter, there's always things that'll move around that could impact the numbers. So I think, as you look at the year, I think I would say to you that, basically what we said in the prepared comments, we're pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter on the expense side, in particular, on the supply chain side of the business, and really the business itself in the field where we had flat cost per piece. Now for the year, we didn't. I mean, we were up almost $0.10, and I would say to you we need to bring that number for the year back down into that flat to up $0.05 zone. I'm not saying that we will or we won't, I'm just saying that, that's kind of where the numbers ultimately need to get to, to drive the earnings growth. So our plan -- to go to your earnings -- to your Investor Day, Ed, our plan is to become more consistent in terms of how we do that and to take the quarter we saw here in the field and to begin to put that up quarter after quarter. Now with that said, I also said that we're going to continue to invest in the business here in terms of things that will drive some of the commercial initiatives that are really panning out for us now, both on the growth side as well as the merchandising side. So it's always going to be a mix, I think, of timing of investment relative to what you think the value of it is. And bottom line, I would say there were some things in the fourth quarter, for example, bad debt, we had an exceptional year in bad debt this year, knock on wood, please, but -- and so that benefited our fourth quarter numbers as well as the year to some extent. So I would say that somewhere between that 2% growth and the 4.8% is where we need to get to. And I would say to you, in terms of Investor Day, I think what you're going to hear us say there, Ed, is we're running a business here. It's very important that we accelerate our case growth. We see opportunities to do that, especially on the local side. That needs to turn into leveraging our operating income, which we did here in the fourth quarter, and we were up for the year. So I look at the fourth quarter as, hopefully, a proxy for what we can do next year. Quarters are going to have their own unique volatility, and I would think that you'll hear a message from us that says that we have opportunity on all sides, including the cost side. But the big opportunity here is always going to be for a company with our capabilities, with our footprint, with our people and with our technology today to grow faster than the market and to do that profitably and to provide a good return on capital. So certainly, opportunities for cost reduction, they are significant. It'll take some time for that to play out, and we will talk about that more at Investor Day. But I don't want to leave this question without emphasizing how important it is for us to grow the business as we did this quarter. I mean, this was a quality quarter for us, both in terms of growth, leverage and the mix of that growth. And I think that's really what you're going to hear at Investor Day. It takes all facets of our business to be on -- in sync for us to go where we want to go."

I mean, there's still plenty of competitors out there of all types, as we've talked about in great detail here over the last year or 2. So I would tell you, I think that the competition's very, very acute. I think, in the short term, the way I would look at inflation, we have, for years, said and truly believe that the optimal range of inflation for our customers is, and for us, is probably in the 2% to maybe 3% range. That's a level that typically our customers can pass on and do pass on. And generally, that's a level that the consumer will accept. So when we're in those levels, we're able to kind of have the best of both worlds, if you will, in terms of a little bit of a tailwind on inflation and at the same time, it doesn't hurt demand to any large extent. We very seldom find ourselves in that zone, and right now we find ourselves in a zone where there's little to no inflation. And as we said, there's some modest inflation and some modest deflation in the categories. So I think the way I would look at that is it's a little bit of a better environment right now in terms of our customer being able to manage their business. And when our costs aren't going up that much, obviously, we don't have to raise our prices as much. So from that standpoint, it probably does help in terms of case growth, but in terms of the competitive environment, I don't really think it changes that at all."

And we're starting to see some good success there, in -- the most recent example being our inventory replenishment system, which, internally, we refer to as DPR.

But there are some limitations to that, until you really sit down and kind of open it up a little bit more in terms of what each organization's willing to do. So what I'm getting at there is where it makes sense, and it's not always going to make sense, it depends on the nature of the relationship and the strategies of the respective companies, but we are starting to see some really nice progress with a couple key customers, in particular, where, by working together, we're able to reduce their costs and also reduce our costs at the same time. And, and this is really the most important part, find ways to grow the business together. So more to come, but that is something that we've been working on quite a bit the last year, 2 years."

So locally managed business is business where the customer generally, and there's exceptions to every rule in Sysco, but generally, the customer, the decision-maker of that customer is proximate, i.e., within the selling radius of that local operating company. So it's -- there's a high percentage of street business, but there's also a fair amount of what we call local contract business. And these would be chains -- and they could be of different sizes. They could be local chains, they could be somewhat regional, and they could even be across regions, and that's why I say there's exceptions. But in our world, it's street business plus what we call local contract. And then corporate managed business is your very large regional chains and your national and international customers, for that matter, where the relationships are largely managed from corporate here and generally with the customer. And then, obviously our operating companies are responsible for handling those relationships locally with the units and servicing those accounts. So that's as clear as I can make it.

So look, I think it depends on whether you're talking about gross profit or gross margin. And I don't want to be too anal on this thing, but that's the reality of it. We",757,"I'm not sure I can answer the second one, but let me start with the first one, Kelly. So look, I think it depends on whether you're talking about gross profit or gross margin. And I don't want to be too anal on this thing, but that's the reality of it. We pay our bills with dollars, so gross profit dollar growth is very important here. And we had 3% gross profit dollar growth, which was less than what you saw earlier in the year. But at a time when there's no inflation, that was pretty good, and we were able to manage our expenses pretty well. That's why I was saying earlier, that -- those numbers are going to move around from time to time. Obviously, what we need to get back to more consistently is where that gross profit is growing faster than the expenses. I think, on gross margin, when you're in an environment where your costs are not going up, there's not as much pressure to, obviously, raise your prices. There's not -- and that allows you to manage your margin percent a little bit better. So there's no doubt that, that helped on the percentage part of it. But again, we need to manage both. And after 3 years of talking about how important gross profit dollar growth is, I'm not going to sit here today and take a victory lap on gross margin. I think it's good that it went up, but I think it's more impressive that we were able to grow the gross profit 3% with very little, if any, inflation and keep our expenses below that. That'll be somewhat challenging here, as we said, in the first couple of quarters, but we'll continue to work at that. And we'd like to get the gross profit growth back up in that 4% to 5% zone over time, like what we saw, but that will be somewhat driven by inflation. I think the corollary here, Kelly, is when we have inflation, let's say, higher-than-normal inflation like we saw, in particular, the first half of the year, that's where it's very difficult to, and at times not even appropriate, to raise your prices as fast as your costs are going up. And so when you have an inflation environment of 5%, 6%, it's highly unlikely that your gross margin is going to keep pace on a year-over-year basis there. So it's math, but it's more than math. It's the environment that our salespeople work in. And it's basically how -- what's the right way to treat the customer. So bottom line, I think it helped on the margin, but it hurt on the gross profit this quarter. As far as stabilizing, let's take it a year at a time, okay? So we have a year here where we had essentially flat margins. And I think what I should say, or reiterate here, because we've talked a lot about inflation or lack thereof, I mean, we did a lot of good things this quarter and this year. So category management really matured this year and helped improve our margins. We'll see some more benefit there in the new year, not as much; so the trajectory of the slope will flatten out a little bit. Growing local cases is very, very important in this business. I don't think I can say that enough. So what we said here is we've now had several quarters in a row where we grew our local business. That's where we provide the most value, that's where we make the most money, and we don't have to grow them at the same rate as the corporate managed necessarily, but we do need to grow them. And I think that contributed significantly to the margin as well as the gross profit growth. And then, this quarter and, really, the year to some extent, we saw the brand rebound a little bit. And some of that was through some promotion work, some of it is just the natural byproduct of connecting it with our category management work. And any time we can utilize our private brands to create value, that's also a positive. So I think there's a lot of things that led to it. There's a lot of things we need to keep doing well, and we have some good things going, but it's -- look, it is competitive out there, and I think if we can stabilize margins at this level, we'd be very happy with that."

Attaining that 4% is going to be difficult without some sort of reinflation in food cost. The reason the 4% is 4% is because we acknowledge that we're going to drive cases, and that's going to drive costs. So as Bill just said, I think very, very well, if we're going to have headwinds on the top line numbers, it means we have to control the costs even more at a time when, frankly, we're driving cases. So that makes the math a little bit tough. So I'm with Bill. I'm very pleased with the quarter. Neither of us are pessimistic about next year or even the first half of next year.

There's going to be some ups and downs there, but I'm confident that we're on the right track there. So I don't know that you can sustain flat every quarter, but certainly low single-digit case increases -- cost case increases would be what we're shooting for here. On the corporate side, it kind of depends on the quarter. We talked about some true-ups. I mentioned bad debt. So in any given quarter, there could be some things on the corporate side. I would just say to you that as we continue -- look, we have stood up a lot of capabilities here, from CatMan to a lot of things in sales capabilities.

So long story short, we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but  as I said, we expect to grow the cases, so I don't think 2% is sustainable, with 3% case growth if we're able to continue to do that.

So I mean, as you've talked and had more time to think about this with the Board and perhaps even solicited investor feedback, what do you think that optimal capital structure is in terms of rating? And whatever that is, I mean, I guess at this point, what are you waiting for to implement that optimized capital structure?"

So our view on that is pretty straightforward, I think, at this point. We've kept our powder dry here for quite some time because we've been looking at a lot of different opportunities on the acquisition front, some larger than others. And we ended up pulling the trigger on the U.S. Foods deal, and that required a lot of capital. And as we all know, that ultimately didn't play out. So where we're at today is we just felt it was appropriate to return some capital, in the form of share repurchase, back to our shareholders here over the next year or 2. But we still think we need to keep some powder dry here. We continue to look for acquisitions, as I said in my comments, both within the core and potentially beyond the core, whether it be adjacency or continue to build out our international platform here. So I would just say to you we're going to do what we're saying here, which is from time to time we'll continue to look at our capital structure relative to what our other options are, and for the most part, it starts with investing in the business. I think we've got, I think, a pretty good cadence here. We've got pretty good -- Chris has done a nice job coming in here and helping us get a little more structure and discipline around our CapEx spending. We've improved modestly, but we've begun to improve in our working capital management. So there's some good things going on there. But I would always like to kind of have the opportunity to do some strategic acquisitions, if and when they present themselves. And it's just, at this point, we don't need to keep quite as much capital available to do that."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's first quarter financial results announced this morning reflect important early progress towards achieving the 3-year financial targets we established for operating income",624,"Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's first quarter financial results announced this morning reflect important early progress towards achieving the 3-year financial targets we established for operating income and return on invested capital at our September Investor Day. 
The key levers for realizing these targets are accelerating local case growth, improving gross margins, leveraging our supply chain cost and reducing administrative cost. The quality of our overall business results for the quarter was very good, driven by strong volume growth with both our locally and corporate managed customers and sound gross margin management. However, sales growth was minimal and earnings were essentially flat, due in large part to the unfavorable impact of both food cost deflation and currency translation. These 2 factors have somewhat restrained our performance for a good portion of the calendar year, and we expect that these headwinds will persist for the next few months.
Looking at broader economic and industry trends, we continue to see mixed data points with evidence of both underlying strength and optimism but also pockets of concern. Consumer confidence recently rebounded to its yearly highs in September but then fell back in October. Unemployment remains at low levels, although nonfarm employment levels have decreased steadily since May. 
NPD data for the 3-month period ending in August showed continued positive restaurant spend, with traffic growth rebounding from the prior 3-month period. The QSR segment continues to be the main driver of positive restaurant traffic while fine dining segment also returned to a positive growth rate. Overall, restaurant traffic appears to be slightly positive.
While still favorable on an absolute level, recent NRA data for September showed a decline in restaurant performance and foodservice operator confidence to levels last seen in late 2014.
Turning to our first quarter results. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our U.S. Broadline business. As you know, this part of our business represents approximately 70% of Sysco's revenues and 90% of our profits. During the first quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.4%, including local case growth of 2%, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth. 
Gross profit dollar growth of 4.6%, nearly 2% more than our operating expense growth of 2.7% and operating income growth of 6.4%. This performance is strong, especially after considering the impact of 1% food cost deflation in U.S. Broadline business and drove Sysco's overall gross profit growth of more than 2% and year-over-year gross margin expansion of approximately 1/4 of 1%. 
Expense management trends continued to improve in much of our business as reflected in the $0.01 per case cost reduction in U.S. Broadline business compared to the prior year. However, such improvement was offset by planned investment in merger-related carryover technology spend for projects that will provide key support to achieving our financial targets over the next 3 years. 
As I stated a moment ago, 2 of the key levers to achieving our 3-year financial plan are: one, accelerating our local case growth; and two, improving margins. Our results this quarter reflect good progress on doing exactly that. A few examples of the progress we've made in various areas to produce these results include our category management work, which continues to provide incremental benefits to both our customers and Sysco; improved Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally managed customers; and continued progress with our revenue management development work and early success in our pilot locations. 
In summary, our underlying business has good momentum, and we are in the right path to achieving our long-term financial and strategic objectives. For now, I'll turn it over to Joel for some additional details, and then I'll come back to summarize before we go to Q&A."
189096,309043555,889158,"Sysco Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2015",2015-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results were of good quality, in particular for our core underlying business, the U.S. Broadline. Today, I'm going to discuss the details of the first quarter results on an adj",1253,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results were of good quality, in particular for our core underlying business, the U.S. Broadline. Today, I'm going to discuss the details of the first quarter results on an adjusted basis, which mainly excludes expenses related to the termination of the proposed merger of US Foods as well as provide some additional pro forma comparisons on a constant currency basis. 
Our first quarter sales increased by roughly 1% despite the deflation and currency headwinds Bill noted. For some additional color on the inflation volatility we've experienced over the past year, we have transitioned from 5% inflation last year to a 0.2% deflation this year. In addition, as Bill mentioned, deflation in U.S. Broadline was even greater at about 1% for the first quarter. 
From a category perspective, [indiscernible] protein and dairy drove the majority of this deflation with disinflation across many other categories. To put the deflation in context, the deflationary environment has developed 2 times over the past 10 years, lasting 3 to 9 months in length when it occurred. 
As for foreign exchange, this quarter, we saw continued strength in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the euro. Since Canada represents the majority of our international sales, the Canadian dollar valuation was the main driver for the negative 2% impact to sales in the quarter, which is largest impact we've experienced in recent history. When we look at our sales on a constant currency basis, they're up 3%.
Turning to other sales drivers. We reported solid case growth this quarter, including 3.4% total and 2% local in U.S. Broadline. In addition, local and corporate managed case growth across our total Broadline operations remained healthy. 
Despite the headwinds from foreign exchange and deflation, gross profit growth was solid at 2.3%, and gross margin expanded by 23 basis points over the prior year. Positive contributors to gross profit growth include: solid local case growth, category management and improved Sysco brand penetration. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by 4.3%.
Turning to expenses. Certain items during the first quarter totaled $108 million, the vast majority of which related to the termination of our merger agreement with US Foods, including $10 million that was adjusted out of operating expenses and $95 million that hit the interest expense line. As previously mentioned, this will be the final quarter to be impacted by certain items pertaining to the US Foods merger termination.
In total, our adjusted operating expense in the first quarter increased by $52 million over the prior year, mainly driven by payroll, which was impacted by both volume increases and the $9 million increase in our long-term incentive accruals. The increase in the long-term incentive accrual was related to our total shareholder return metric and was driven by the improvement in our stock price performance relative to the S&P 500. 
During the first quarter, we also started to see early signs of productivity improvements and cost reductions within our supply chain, as cost per case is down approximately $0.01 in our U.S. Broadline business. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses grew by about 5%.
Adjusted operating income was down 0.5% or $3 million. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income would have been up 1.2%. 
As for our SYGMA business, we're beginning to see modest signs of improvement. For the first quarter, SYGMA sales were down 6.2% but segment operating income grew 1.4%. As we previously mentioned, we have transitioned some SYGMA business which did pressure sales but did not negatively impact our profitability. That said, we remain focused on improving productivity, efficiency and customer profitability in SYGMA and will continue to closely monitor its progress.
Moving to other income. I want to remind you that we consolidate the results of some of the entities we control but do not have 100% ownership of. These represent investments in joint ventures, including some that are in the early investments or start-up phase. As such, our other income line this quarter reflects a $15 million [ph] improvement that is mostly attributable to the elimination of the non-Sysco portion of the results associated with these ventures. 
Our income tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36% both on a GAAP and on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, the adjusted rate is on the low end of our 36% to 37% normalized rate. The GAAP rate benefited from the impact of merger-related items, which offset the strength in our U.S. business. Adjusted net earnings grew about 1% and benefited from both higher other income and a lower tax rate versus last year.
Adjusted earnings per share were flat for the quarter. Foreign exchange impacted earnings per share results by $0.01 per share. In addition, share count was up over 7 million shares versus the prior year, negatively impacting earnings per share by $0.01 per share as well. As a reminder, we have historically repurchased shares in the open market to offset dilution from new share issuances, but we have not done so for the past 5 quarters. We expect to resume these purchases later this year.
As you may know, we have commenced an accelerated share repurchase program or ASR, but it had no impact on share count in this quarter. For those of you not familiar with the mechanics of the ASR, here are some details. 
Our broker borrowed 85% or approximately 32 million shares and delivered them to us on September 28, at which time our outstanding share count was reduced by that amount. Over the next several months, our broker will then acquire these shares through various mechanisms, including open market purchases. The balance of the shares covered by the accelerated share repurchase will be trued up during settlement over the next several months.
As it pertains to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the first quarter was negative $261 million, including the cash impact of certain items, which reduced cash flow from operations by $260 million. Excluding the impact of certain items, adjusted cash flow from operations was essentially flat.
From a working capital perspective, we saw improvements in net working capital this quarter, driven by improvements in both the accounts receivable and inventory areas. This resulted in working capital using approximately $70 million less cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 than it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.
Net CapEx was $120 million for the quarter, generally flat year-over-year, mainly reflecting fleet replenishment and our investments in technology initiatives that we discussed during Investor Day.
Free cash flow for the first quarter was a negative $381 million, which includes the $260 million impact of certain items. Please keep in mind that our free cash flow is seasonal as more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger sequential quarterly increases in free cash flow throughout the remainder of the year.
Finally, I want to remind you of the expected impact of the accelerated share repurchase on our fiscal 2016 share count and earnings per share. On our last earnings call, we said that we anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense and new debt issuance. Now that we have begun execution of this plan, we still maintain this guidance.
I'll now turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

So I would say generally, John, the competitive environment remains very competitive but reasonably rational, and yet at the same time, I would tell you in any given day in any given market, there's probably some volatility and probably some inconsistencies to what I'm telling you there, but I don't think a big change from when we had talked a few months ago. As far as the U.S. Broadline is concerned, it's a good question. I would say to you -- let me -- without the deflation in that -- honestly, I would just tell you it would've been much better or at least somewhat better without the deflation. We had good gross profit growth, as I said, even with deflation, very good case growth and we managed the margins well. We've got work to do, John, so we still have work to do on the expense side here in all parts of our business and we're beginning to make some strides there. But I would say without the deflation, U.S. Broadline would have been -- probably had somewhere of a stronger performance."

So I'm feeling good about our ability to manage margin. I think what you heard us say at the Analyst Day or the Investor Day, there's things we don't control. So right now, our GP was up -- it was up overall, it was up nicely in U.S. Broadline. But I would -- we're not at that spread right now overall, so I would say to you, the plan here is to get back to that spread of at least 1% between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. And what we need to do to do that, we need to maintain the momentum we've done on local case growth. We've got to continue to manage those gross margins well, and we do need to get our expense increases to a lower level."

I would say under Tom's leadership, there's some basic things. There's a very tight cadence of meetings between him and his market leadership and the field, weekly, monthly, quarterly, that type of thing, so we got good continuity there. Some of the segmentation work that Tom spoke too, both in terms of customer segmentation, product category opportunities, those are looking for opportunities within every that we operate in, whether it's geographically, across customer segments. And we talked about Hispanic, we talked about potential more opportunity in the local fresh area, that type of thing. But also just basic things where you sit down as a management team, whether it's locally or through the CatMan group and look at categories that you may be underpenetrated in. So it's -- we've got good alignment around good basic business principles, good connectivity between what we're doing here at corporate and into the market, and then obviously, where it all happens in the field and also CatMan continues to help.

The way I would be thinking about both the way we laid out our 3-year goals as well as the way this year's plan is targeted, that 3-year plan, we said it wouldn't be linear. This year is not going to be linear and there's a -- there's less of a trajectory, if you will, on the operating income in the first year than there is in year 2 and year 3. The short answer to your question is yes, I think as we get into breaking down those costs, especially -- I don't really want to call it SG&A I'm just going to call them administrative costs regardless of what part of the business they're in, whether they're locally or corporate or in between and whether they're purely admin or just administrative in nature. You should expect to see those numbers, that growth to -- that curve to become more shallow as we go forward. Seeing on your earlier question was we did plan in some meaningful technology spend this year to finish off some projects that we had started with the merger, that are very compelling from a customer-facing standpoint but also have significant costs. And so that's driving a lot of that expense delta here right now. So I was pleased with the overall cost per piece in the business. The corporate [indiscernible] actually manage their expenses fine. We have the technology spend, and we have this other issue here on the incentive accruals. So short answer to your question is it will begin to grow at a slower rate, and that's probably going to take us another quarters to visibility on that."

We do -- half of that $50 billion, we do roughly half of that is with local street, a little bit more as a go to local. So it's the DNA of the company. It's in our -- it's woven into the fabric of this company. It's how we've grown the way we are today. I think the point we made it Investor Day is with some of the challenges that we've added a macro environment and the acute -- the increased competition that came from 2009 simultaneously with us driving out a heck of a lot transformational change, we struggled over the last few years until last year to drive the local case growth. So it's nothing new. It's just something we haven't done as well as we would have liked over the last few years and there's reasons for that. So in terms of why Sysco, I think it starts with our sales force. We've got 7,000 associates across the country. Our structure that we continue to find ways to optimize, but one of the reasons we remain very local is because, as I've said many times, about 2/3 of our revenue strength comes from customers whose decision-makers are domiciled within 100, 150 miles of that operating company. So that creates a need not just for local sales representation for local leadership with our presidents and senior teams there. So I think our geographic footprint, the talent of our operating teams, the experience and the breadth of our sales force, all these new things that we've been talking about earlier in the call in the commercial initiative side from CatMan to Revman to segmentation, listening to our customers in a much more effective way through, over the last 3 or 4 years, that have led to increased loyalty, the fact that we had the courage to take on transforming this company at a time key inflection point in our country and in our industry, we're one of the few people in our industry that has taken on this kind of change, so I think the fact that you are forward looking, and we've got great people and you've got great strategy I think those are all reasons why we should continue to have a lot of success."

So first, last 2 quarters combined, is that $0.03 for EPS, about $0.01 this and about $0.02 last quarter.

So take on the cost cutting. The way I actually look at it in terms of running a business we'll go to your last question, which is to cut cost, there's no trophies for cutting cost all right, to cut costs and to do it in a way that anticipated the downside would be somewhat bullish on our part. And that's why we're taking some time here on the administrative cost side to go through and look at the work, look at the of the work look at the sequencing of the work, look at the structure, look at how much we still need to do on the technology side, for example, to continue to be out there in front of our customers to be responsive to their needs. So what we're doing right now is prioritizing all of that and in a way that we need to put it together in a fiscally responsible way. And then we will bring it back to you and to our customer base and to our associates in the most balanced way that we can and the least risky way that we can. And certainly, if we were to go out and back dramatically on customer-facing technology, support our customer-facing associates, that wouldn't be a very smart way to proceed here. So we're proceeding -- we see opportunities, as I said, multiple times now in all parts of the business. We are seeing focus primarily right now is on supply chain and the administrative side. And I think over the next couple of quarters, we'll be able to give you more visibility to that."

That's because history tells you that it that tells you most of our customers are able to pass that type of increase along in reasonably manageable way and a way that works for their business. So 2 [ph] or 3 [ph] overall would be fine. Now when it gets up over that, 4%, 5%, 6%, that's not good for our customers, and it starts to make it difficult for us to pass that much along in a timely basis. Deflation would be the least attractive of all those. Probably does -- it certainly does help your margins to some extent in terms of the percentage but as we all understand, you're taking fewer dollars to the back to pay bills so puts a lot of pressure on your expenses along the way. So deflation, we haven't seen a lot of it we did some work on this I think over the last decade. And we've only had deflation a couple of times I think it's range from one instance a quarter or so, another instance, maybe up 2, 3 quarters.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's first quarter financial results announced this morning reflect important early progress towards achieving the 3-year financial targets we established for operating income",623,"Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's first quarter financial results announced this morning reflect important early progress towards achieving the 3-year financial targets we established for operating income and return on invested capital at our September Investor Day. The key levers for realizing these targets are accelerating local case growth, improving gross margins, leveraging our supply chain costs and reducing administrative costs. 
The quality of our overall business results for the quarter was very good, driven by strong volume growth with both our locally and corporate managed customers and sound gross margin management. However, sales growth was minimal and earnings were essentially flat due in large part to the unfavorable impact of both food cost deflation and currency translation. These 2 factors have somewhat restrained our performance for a good portion of the calendar year, and we expect that these headwinds will persist for the next few months.
Looking at broader economic and industry trends, we continue to see mixed data points with evidence of both underlying strength and optimism but also pockets of concern. Consumer confidence recently rebounded to its yearly highs in September but then fell back in October. Unemployment remains at low levels, although nonfarm employment levels have decreased steadily since May. NPD data for the 3-month period ending in August showed continued positive restaurant spend with traffic growth rebounding from the prior 3-month period. The QSR segment continues to be the main driver of positive restaurant traffic while fine dining segment also returned to a positive growth rate. Overall, restaurant traffic appears to be slightly positive. While still favorable on an absolute level, recent NRA data for September showed a decline in restaurant performance and foodservice operator confidence to levels last seen in late 2014.
Turning to our first quarter results. I'm especially pleased with performance of our U.S. Broadline business. As you know, this part of our business represents approximately 70% of Sysco's revenues and 90% of our profits. During the first quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.4%, including local case growth of 2%, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth; gross profit dollar growth of 4.6%, nearly 2% more than our operating expense growth of 2.7%; and operating income growth of 6.4%. This performance was strong, especially after considering the impact of 1% food cost deflation in U.S. Broadline business, and drove Sysco's overall gross profit growth of more than 2% and year-over-year gross margin expansion of approximately 1/4 of 1%. 
Expense management trends continued to improve in much of our business, as reflected in the $0.01 per case cost reduction in U.S. Broadline business compared to the prior year. However, such improvement was offset by planned investment in merger-related carryover technology spend for projects that will provide key support to achieving our financial targets over the next 3 years. 
As I stated a moment ago, 2 of the key levers to achieving our 3-year financial plan are: one, accelerating our local case growth; and two, improving margins. Our results this quarter reflect good progress on doing exactly that. A few examples of the progress we've made in various areas to produce these results include our category management work, which continues to provide incremental benefits to both our customers and Sysco; improved Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally managed customers; and continued progress with our revenue management development work and early success in our pilot locations. 
In summary, our underlying business has good momentum, and we are in the right path to achieving our long-term financial and strategic objectives. 
For now, I'll turn it over to Joel for some additional details, and then I'll come back to summarize before we go to Q&A."

As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results were of good quality, in particular for our core underlying business, the U.S. Broadline. Today, I'm going to discuss the details of the first quarter results on an adj",1257,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results were of good quality, in particular for our core underlying business, the U.S. Broadline. Today, I'm going to discuss the details of the first quarter results on an adjusted basis, which mainly excludes expenses related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods, as well as provide some additional pro forma comparisons on a constant currency basis. 
Our first quarter sales increased by roughly 1% despite the deflation and currency headwinds Bill noted. For some additional color on the inflation volatility we've experienced over the past year, we have transitioned from 5% inflation last year to a 0.2% deflation this year. In addition, as Bill mentioned, deflation in U.S. Broadline was even greater at about 1% for the first quarter. 
From a category perspective, center of the plate protein and dairy drove the majority of this deflation with disinflation across many other categories. To put the deflation in context, a deflationary environment has developed 2 times over the past 10 years, lasting 3 to 9 months in length when it occurred. 
As for foreign exchange, this quarter, we saw continued strength in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the euro. Since Canada represents the majority of our international sales, the Canadian dollar valuation was the main driver for the negative 2% impact to sales in the quarter, which is the largest impact we've experienced in recent history. When we look at our sales on a constant currency basis, they're up 3%.
Turning to other sales drivers. We reported solid case growth this quarter, including 3.4% to total and 2% local in U.S. Broadline. In addition, local and corporate-managed case growth across our total Broadline operations remained healthy. 
Despite the headwinds from foreign exchange and deflation, gross profit growth was solid at 2.3%, and gross margin expanded by 23 basis points over the prior year. Positive contributors to gross profit growth include: solid local case growth, category management and improved Sysco brand penetration. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by 4.3%.
Turning to expenses. Certain items during the first quarter totaled $108 million, the vast majority of which related to the termination of our merger agreement with US Foods, including $10 million that was adjusted out of operating expenses and $95 million that hit the interest expense line. As previously mentioned, this will be the final quarter to be impacted by certain items pertaining to the US Foods merger termination.
In total, our adjusted operating expense in the first quarter increased by $52 million over the prior year, mainly driven by payroll, which was impacted by both volume increases and a $9 million increase in our long-term incentive accruals. The increase in the long-term incentive accrual was related to our total shareholder return metric and was driven by the improvement in our stock price performance relative to the S&P 500. 
During the first quarter, we also started to see early signs of productivity improvements and cost reductions within our supply chain as cost per case is down approximately $0.01 in our U.S. Broadline business. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses grew by about 5%.
Adjusted operating income was down 0.5% or $3 million. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income would have been up 1.2%. 
As for our SYGMA business, we're beginning to see modest signs of improvement. For the first quarter, SYGMA sales were down 6.2% but segment operating income grew 1.4%. As we previously mentioned, we have transitioned some SYGMA business, which did pressure sales but did not negatively impact our profitability. That said, we remain focused on improving productivity, efficiency and customer profitability in SYGMA and will continue to closely monitor its progress.
Moving to other income. I want to remind you that we consolidate the results of some of the entities we control but do not have 100% ownership of. These represent investments in joint ventures, including some that are in the early investments or start-up phase. As such, our Other Income line this quarter reflects a $15 million improvement that is mostly attributable to the elimination of the non-Sysco portion of the results associated with these ventures. 
Our income tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36% both on a GAAP and on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, the adjusted rate is on the low end of our 36% to 37% normalized rate. The GAAP rate benefited from the impact of merger-related items, which offset the strength in our U.S. business. 
Adjusted net earnings grew about 1% and benefited from both higher other income and a lower tax rate versus last year.
Adjusted earnings per share were flat for the quarter. Foreign exchange impacted earnings per share results by $0.01 per share. In addition, share count was up over 7 million shares versus the prior year, negatively impacting earnings per share by $0.01 per share as well. As a reminder, we have historically repurchased shares in the open market to offset dilution from new share issuances, but we have not done so for the past 5 quarters. We expect to resume these purchases later this year.
As you may know, we have commenced an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, but it had no impact on share count in this quarter. For those of you not familiar with the mechanics of the ASR, here are some details. 
Our broker borrowed 85% or approximately 32 million shares and delivered them to us on September 28, at which time our outstanding share count was reduced by that amount. Over the next several months, our broker will then acquire these shares through various mechanisms, including open market purchases. The balance of the shares covered by the accelerated share repurchase will be trued-up during settlement over the next several months.
As it pertains to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the first quarter was negative $261 million, including the cash impact of certain items, which reduced cash flow from operations by $260 million. Excluding the impact of certain items, adjusted cash flow from operations was essentially flat.
From a working capital perspective, we saw improvements in net working capital this quarter, driven by improvements in both the accounts receivable and inventory areas. This resulted in working capital using approximately $70 million less cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 than it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.
Net CapEx was $120 million for the quarter, generally flat year-over-year, mainly reflecting fleet replenishment and our investments in technology initiatives that we discussed during Investor Day.
Free cash flow for the first quarter was a negative $381 million, which includes the $260 million impact of certain items. Please keep in mind that our free cash flow is seasonal as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger sequential quarterly increases in free cash flow throughout the remainder of the year.
Finally, I want to remind you of the expected impact of the accelerated share repurchase on our fiscal 2016 share count and earnings per share. On our last earnings call, we said that we anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense and new debt issuance. Now that we have begun execution of this plan, we still maintain this guidance.
I'll now turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

So I would say generally, John, the competitive environment remains very competitive but reasonably rational. And yet at the same time, I would tell you in any given day in any given market, there's probably some volatility and probably some inconsistencies with what I'm telling you there. But I don't think a big change from when we were -- talked a few months ago. As far as the U.S. Broadline is concerned, it's a good question. I would say to you -- let me -- without the deflation in that -- honestly, I would just tell you it would have been much better or at least somewhat better without the deflation. We had good gross profit growth, as I said, even with deflation, very good case growth and we managed the margins well. We've got work to do, John. So we still have work to do on the expense side here in all parts of our business, and we're beginning to make some strides there.

So I'm feeling good about our ability to manage margin. I think what you heard us say at the Analyst Day or the Investor Day, well, there's things we don't control.

But I would -- we're not at that spread right now overall, so I would say to you the plan here is to get back to that spread of at least 1% between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth.

There's a very tight cadence of meetings between him and his market leadership and the field, weekly, monthly, quarterly, that type of thing. So we've got good continuity there. Some of the segmentation work that Tom spoke to both in terms of customer segmentation, product category opportunities, those are looking for opportunities within every cell that we operate in, whether it's geographically, across customer segments. We talked about Hispanic. We talked about potentially more opportunity in the local fresh area, that type of thing but also just basic things where you sit down as a management team, whether it's locally or through the CatMan group, and look at categories that you may be underpenetrated in. So it's -- we've got good alignment around good basic business principles, good connectivity between what we're doing here at corporate and to the market, and then, obviously, where it all happens in the field. And we also think CatMan continues to help. It's going to -- as it matures in terms of some of the sourcing aspects of it, it's going to help us, I think, create more momentum and innovation and, over time, optimizing our SKU count as we strike the right balance between reducing SKUs where we have redundancies but also broadening our SKUs for some of the items that may be new or maybe don't move quite as fast but are particularly important to customers.

You should expect to see those numbers -- that growth to -- that curve to become more shallow as we go forward. What I would say on the earlier question was we did plan in some meaningful technology spend this year to finish off some projects that we had started with the merger that are very compelling from a customer-facing standpoint but also had significant cost. And so that's driving a lot of that expense delta here right now. So I was pleased with the overall cost per piece in the business. The corporate departments actually manage their expenses fine. We have the technology spend and we had this other issue here on the incentive accruals. So short answer to your question is it will begin to grow at a slower rate, and that's probably going to take us another couple of quarters to give you some visibility on that."

We do -- half of that $50 billion we do, roughly half of that is with local or street, a little bit more if you go to local. So it's the DNA of the company. It's in our -- it's woven into the fabric of this company. It's how we've grown to where we are today. I think the point we made at Investor Day is with some of the challenges we've had in the macro environment and the acute -- the increased competition that came from 2009 simultaneously with us driving out a heck of a lot of transformational change, we struggled over the last few years until last year to drive the local case growth. So it's nothing new. It's just something we haven't done as well as we would have liked over the last few years, and there's reasons for that. So in terms of why Sysco, I think it starts with our sales force. We've got 7,000 market associates across the country. Our structure that we continue to find ways to optimize, but one of the reasons we remain very local is because, as I've said many times, about 2/3 of our revenue strength comes from customers whose decision makers are domiciled within 100, 150 miles of that operating company. So that creates a need not just for local sales representation for local leadership with our presidents and senior teams there. So I think our geographic footprint, the talent of our operating teams, the experience and the breadth of our sales force, all these new things that we've been talking about earlier on the call on the commercial initiative side from CatMan to RevMan to segmentation, listening to our customers in a much more effective way through -- over the last 3 or 4 years that have led to increased loyalty, the fact that we had the courage to take on transforming this company at a time -- key inflection point in our country and in our industry, we're one of the few people in our industry that has taken on this kind of change. So I think the fact that we're forward looking and we've got great people and we've got great strategy, I think those are all reasons why we should continue to have a lot of success."

We believe we can grow profitably and take share in the right way, but it needs to be more targeted growth than what we've seen over the past -- we need a little more balance between the corporate-managed growth and the local growth. And it's not that we don't want corporate-managed growth. We do. We just need to see a little bit more balance there. So I think on the cost cutting, the way I actually look at it in terms of running a business, we'll go to your last question, which is to cut costs. There's no trophies for cutting cost all right? So the -- to cut costs and to do it in a way where you go and anticipate what the downside would be would be somewhat foolish on our part. And that's why we're taking some time here on the administrative cost side to go through and look at the work, look at the prioritization of the work, look at the sequencing of the work, look at the structure, look at how much we still need to do on the technology side, for example, to continue to be out there in front with our customers to be responsive to their needs. So what we're doing right now is prioritizing all of that in a way that we need to put it together in a fiscally responsible way. And then we'll bring it back to you and to our customer base and to our associates in the most balanced way that we can and the least risky way that we can. So certainly, if we were to go out and cut back dramatically on customer-facing technology support or customer-facing associates, that wouldn't be a very smart way to proceed here. So we're proceeding -- we see opportunities, as I said multiple times now, in all parts of the business. Where you're seeing focused primarily right now is on supply chain and the administrative side. And I think over the next couple of quarters, we'll be able to give you more visibility to that."

Our -- the ideal place for us to be would be to have 2 or 3 points of inflation across every category. I mean, that's as good as it gets. I've never seen it in 27 years of doing this. But that would be very good. And why is that? That's because history tells you and the data tells you that most of our customers are able to pass that type of increase along in a reasonably manageable way and a way that works for their business. So 2 to 3 overall would be fine. Now when it gets up over that 4%, 5%, 6%, that's not good for our customers, and that's -- when it starts off, so make it difficult for us to pass that much along on a timely basis. Now deflation would be the least attractive of all of those. It probably does -- it certainly does help your margins to some extent in terms of the percentage. But, as we all understand, you're taking fewer dollars to the bank to pay bills, so it puts a lot of pressure on your expenses along the way. So deflation, we haven't seen a lot of it over the -- we did some work on this, I think, over the last decade. And we've only had deflation a couple of times, and I think it's ranged from, in one instance, a quarter or so; in another instance, maybe 2, 3 quarters. So we think we'll probably be on the lower end of that this time around. But it's a challenging environment. I will tell you I think we've -- I think we're doing a good job striking the right balance in terms of managing that down in a way that works for the customer but still is working for us, and I think you saw that in the numbers this quarter."

There's just a -- and you see it in the press, there's a labor shortage our there. They're having to adjust their cost structure accordingly.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's first quarter financial results announced this morning reflect important early progress towards achieving the 3-year financial targets we established for operating income",625,"Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's first quarter financial results announced this morning reflect important early progress towards achieving the 3-year financial targets we established for operating income and return on invested capital at our September Investor Day. The key levers for realizing these targets are accelerating local case growth, improving gross margins, leveraging our supply chain costs and reducing administrative costs. 
The quality of our overall business results for the quarter was very good, driven by strong volume growth with both our locally and corporate managed customers and sound gross margin management. However, sales growth was minimal and earnings were essentially flat due in large part to the unfavorable impact of both food cost deflation and currency translation. These 2 factors have somewhat restrained our performance for a good portion of the calendar year, and we expect that these headwinds will persist for the next few months.
Looking at broader economic and industry trends, we continue to see mixed data points with evidence of both underlying strength and optimism but also pockets of concern. Consumer confidence recently rebounded to its yearly highs in September but then fell back in October. Unemployment remains at low levels, although nonfarm employment levels have decreased steadily since May. NPD data for the 3-month period ending in August showed continued positive restaurant spend with traffic growth rebounding from the prior 3-month period. The QSR segment continues to be the main driver of positive restaurant traffic while fine dining segment also returned to a positive growth rate. Overall, restaurant traffic appears to be slightly positive. While still favorable on an absolute level, recent NRA data for September showed a decline in restaurant performance and foodservice operator confidence to levels last seen in late 2014.
Turning to our first quarter results. I'm especially pleased with performance of our U.S. Broadline business. As you know, this part of our business represents approximately 70% of Sysco's revenues and 90% of our profits. During the first quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.4%, including local case growth of 2%, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth; gross profit dollar growth of 4.6%, nearly 2% more than our operating expense growth of 2.7%; and operating income growth of 6.4%. This performance was strong, especially after considering the impact of 1% food cost deflation in U.S. Broadline business, and drove Sysco's overall gross profit growth of more than 2% and year-over-year gross margin expansion of approximately 1/4 of 1%. 
Expense management trends continued to improve in much of our business, as reflected in the $0.01 per case cost reduction in the U.S. Broadline business compared to the prior year. However, such improvement was offset by planned investment in merger-related carryover technology spend for projects that will provide key support to achieving our financial targets over the next 3 years. 
As I stated a moment ago, 2 of the key levers to achieving our 3-year financial plan are: one, accelerating our local case growth; and two, improving margins. Our results this quarter reflect good progress on doing exactly that. A few examples of the progress we've made in various areas to produce these results include our category management work, which continues to provide incremental benefits to both our customers and Sysco; improved Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally managed customers; and continued progress with our revenue management development work and early success in our pilot locations. 
In summary, our underlying business has good momentum, and we are in the right path to achieving our long-term financial and strategic objectives. 
For now, I'll turn it over to Joel for some additional details, and then I'll come back to summarize before we go to the Q&A."
189096,309043555,889617,"Sysco Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2015",2015-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results were of good quality, in particular for our core underlying business, the U.S. Broadline. Today, I'm going to discuss the details of the first quarter results on an adj",1257,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results were of good quality, in particular for our core underlying business, the U.S. Broadline. Today, I'm going to discuss the details of the first quarter results on an adjusted basis, which mainly excludes expenses related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods, as well as provide some additional pro forma comparisons on a constant currency basis. 
Our first quarter sales increased by roughly 1% despite the deflation and currency headwinds Bill noted. For some additional color on the inflation volatility we've experienced over the past year, we have transitioned from 5% inflation last year to a 0.2% deflation this year. In addition, as Bill mentioned, deflation in U.S. Broadline was even greater at about 1% for the first quarter. 
From a category perspective, center of the plate protein and dairy drove the majority of this deflation with disinflation across many other categories. To put the deflation in context, a deflationary environment has developed 2 times over the past 10 years, lasting 3 to 9 months in length when it occurred. 
As for foreign exchange, this quarter, we saw continued strength in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the euro. Since Canada represents the majority of our international sales, the Canadian dollar valuation was the main driver for the negative 2% impact to sales in the quarter, which is the largest impact we've experienced in recent history. When we look at our sales on a constant currency basis, they're up 3%.
Turning to other sales drivers. We reported solid case growth this quarter, including 3.4% to total and 2% local in U.S. Broadline. In addition, local and corporate-managed case growth across our total Broadline operations remained healthy. 
Despite the headwinds from foreign exchange and deflation, gross profit growth was solid at 2.3%, and gross margin expanded by 23 basis points over the prior year. Positive contributors to gross profit growth include: solid local case growth, category management and improved Sysco brand penetration. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by 4.3%.
Turning to expenses. Certain items during the first quarter totaled $108 million, the vast majority of which related to the termination of our merger agreement with US Foods, including $10 million that was adjusted out of operating expenses and $95 million that hit the interest expense line. As previously mentioned, this will be the final quarter to be impacted by certain items pertaining to the US Foods merger termination.
In total, our adjusted operating expense in the first quarter increased by $52 million over the prior year, mainly driven by payroll, which was impacted by both volume increases and a $9 million increase in our long-term incentive accruals. The increase in the long-term incentive accrual was related to our total shareholder return metric and was driven by the improvement in our stock price performance relative to the S&P 500. 
During the first quarter, we also started to see early signs of productivity improvements and cost reductions within our supply chain as cost per case is down approximately $0.01 in our U.S. Broadline business. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses grew by about 5%.
Adjusted operating income was down 0.5% or $3 million. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income would have been up 1.2%. 
As for our SYGMA business, we're beginning to see modest signs of improvement. For the first quarter, SYGMA sales were down 6.2% but segment operating income grew 1.4%. As we previously mentioned, we have transitioned some SYGMA business, which did pressure sales but did not negatively impact our profitability. That said, we remain focused on improving productivity, efficiency and customer profitability in SYGMA and will continue to closely monitor its progress.
Moving to other income. I want to remind you that we consolidate the results of some of the entities we control but do not have 100% ownership of. These represent investments in joint ventures, including some that are in the early investments or start-up phase. As such, our Other Income line this quarter reflects a $15 million improvement that is mostly attributable to the elimination of the non-Sysco portion of the results associated with these ventures. 
Our income tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36% both on a GAAP and on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, the adjusted rate is on the low end of our 36% to 37% normalized rate. The GAAP rate benefited from the impact of merger-related items, which offset the strength in our U.S. business. 
Adjusted net earnings grew about 1% and benefited from both higher other income and a lower tax rate versus last year.
Adjusted earnings per share were flat for the quarter. Foreign exchange impacted earnings per share results by $0.01 per share. In addition, share count was up over 7 million shares versus the prior year, negatively impacting earnings per share by $0.01 per share as well. As a reminder, we have historically repurchased shares in the open market to offset dilution from new share issuances, but we have not done so for the past 5 quarters. We expect to resume these purchases later this year.
As you may know, we have commenced an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, but it had no impact on share count in this quarter. For those of you not familiar with the mechanics of the ASR, here are some details. 
Our broker borrowed 85% or approximately 32 million shares and delivered them to us on September 28, at which time our outstanding share count was reduced by that amount. Over the next several months, our broker will then acquire these shares through various mechanisms, including open market purchases. The balance of the shares covered by the accelerated share repurchase will be trued-up during settlement over the next several months.
As it pertains to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the first quarter was negative $261 million, including the cash impact of certain items, which reduced cash flow from operations by $260 million. Excluding the impact of certain items, adjusted cash flow from operations was essentially flat.
From a working capital perspective, we saw improvements in net working capital this quarter, driven by improvements in both the accounts receivable and inventory areas. This resulted in working capital using approximately $70 million less cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 than it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.
Net CapEx was $120 million for the quarter, generally flat year-over-year, mainly reflecting fleet replenishment and our investments in technology initiatives that we discussed during Investor Day.
Free cash flow for the first quarter was a negative $381 million, which includes the $260 million impact of certain items. Please keep in mind that our free cash flow is seasonal as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger sequential quarterly increases in free cash flow throughout the remainder of the year.
Finally, I want to remind you of the expected impact of the accelerated share repurchase on our fiscal 2016 share count and earnings per share. On our last earnings call, we said that we anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense and new debt issuance. Now that we have begun execution of this plan, we still maintain this guidance.
I'll now turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks."

So I would say generally, John, the competitive environment remains very competitive but reasonably rational. And yet at the same time, I would tell you in any given day in any given market, there's probably some volatility and probably some inconsistencies with what I'm telling you there. But I don't think a big change from when we would have talked a few months ago. As far as the U.S. Broadline is concerned, it's a good question. I would say to you -- let me -- without the deflation in that -- honestly, I would just tell you it would have been much better or at least somewhat better without the deflation. We had good gross profit growth, as I said, even with deflation, very good case growth and we managed the margins well. We've got work to do, John. So we still have work to do on the expense side here in all parts of our business, and we're beginning to make some strides there. But I would say without the deflation, U.S. Broadline would have been -- probably had somewhat of a stronger performance."

But -- and there's a lot of things, as you know, John, that impact margin, from macro events to mix and all that type of thing. I think what I'm conveying to you today is a lot of these initiatives that we've taken on over the last 2 or 3 years are beginning to bear fruit, whether it's how we manage our sales force, rolling out CatMan, continue to work on the brand in the right way in conjunction with CatMan and early days of revenue management, which manifests itself in a lot of different ways. So I'm feeling good about our ability to manage margin. I think what you heard us say at the Analyst Day or the Investor Day, well, there's things we don't control. So right now, our GP was up -- it was up. Well, it was up overall. It was up nicely in U.S. Broadline. But I would -- we're not at that spread right now overall, so I would say to you the plan here is to get back to that spread of at least 1% between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. And what do we need to do to do that? We need to maintain the momentum we've got on local case growth, we've got to continue to manage those gross margins well and we do need to get our expense increases to a lower level."

I would say under Tom's leadership, there's some basic things. There's a very tight cadence of meetings between him and his market leadership and the field, weekly, monthly, quarterly, that type of thing. So we've got good continuity there. Some of the segmentation work that Tom spoke to both in terms of customer segmentation, product category opportunities, those are looking for opportunities within every cell that we operate in, whether it's geographically, across customer segments. We talked about Hispanic. We talked about potentially more opportunity in the local fresh area, that type of thing but also just basic things where you sit down as a management team, whether it's locally or through the CatMan group, and look at categories that you may be underpenetrated in. So it's -- we've got good alignment around good basic business principles, good connectivity between what we're doing here at corporate end of the market, and then, obviously, where it all happens in the field. And we also think CatMan continues to help. It's going to -- as it matures in terms of some of the sourcing aspects of it, it's going to help us, I think, create more momentum and innovation and, over time, optimizing our SKU count as we strike the right balance between reducing SKUs where we have redundancies but also broadening our SKUs for some of the items that may be new or maybe don't move quite as fast but they're particularly important to customers. So it's -- a lot of it's process and a lot of it's, again, going back to these commercial initiatives that we've been developing and employing here over the last 2 or 3 years."

This year is not going to be linear and there's a -- there's less of a trajectory, if you will, on the operating income in the first year than there is in year 2 and year 3. The short answer to your question is yes, I think as we get into breaking down those costs, especially -- I don't really want to call them SG&A, I'm just going to call them administrative costs regardless of what part of the business they're in, whether they're locally or corporate or in between and whether they're purely admin or just administrative in nature. You should expect to see those numbers -- that growth to -- that curve to become more shallow as we go forward. What I was saying on the earlier question was we did plan in some meaningful technology spend this year to finish off some projects that we had started with the merger that are very compelling from a customer-facing standpoint but also had significant cost. And so that's driving a lot of that expense delta here right now. So I was pleased with the overall cost per piece in the business. The corporate departments actually manage their expenses fine. We have the technology spend and we had this other issue here on the incentive accruals. So short answer to your question is it will begin to grow at a slower rate, and that's probably going to take us another couple of quarters to give you some visibility to that."

We do -- half of that $50 billion we do, roughly half of that is with local or street, a little bit more if you go to local. So it's the DNA of the company. It's in our -- it's woven into the fabric of this company. It's how we've grown to where we are today. I think the point we made at Investor Day is with some of the challenges we've had in the macro environment and the acute -- the increased competition that came from 2009 simultaneously with us driving out a heck of a lot of transformational change, we struggled over the last few years until last year to drive the local case growth. So it's nothing new. It's just something we haven't done as well as we would have liked over the last few years, and there's reasons for that. So in terms of why Sysco, I think it starts with our sales force. We've got 7,000 marketing associates across the country. Our structure that we continue to find ways to optimize, but one of the reasons we remain very local is because, as I've said many times, about 2/3 of our revenue strength comes from customers whose decision makers are domiciled within 100, 150 miles of that operating company. So that creates a need not just for local sales representation but for local leadership with our presidents and senior teams there. So I think our geographic footprint, the talent of our operating teams, the experience and the breadth of our sales force, all these new things that we've been talking about earlier on the call on the commercial initiative side from CatMan to RevMan to segmentation, listening to our customers in a much more effective way through -- over the last 3 or 4 years that have led to increased loyalty, the fact that we had the courage to take on transforming this company at a time -- key inflection point in our country and in our industry, we're one of the few people in our industry that has taken on this kind of change. So I think the fact that we're forward looking and we've got great people and we've got great strategy, I think those are all reasons why we should continue to have a lot of success."

We believe we can grow profitably and take share in the right way, but it needs to be more targeted growth than what we've seen over the past -- we need a little more balance between the corporate-managed growth and the local growth. And it's not that we don't want corporate-managed growth. We do. We just need to see a little bit more balance there. So I think on the cost cutting, the way I actually look at it in terms of running a business, we'll go to your last question, which is to cut costs. There's no trophies for cutting costs all right? So the -- to cut costs and to do it in a way where you go and anticipate what the downside would be would be somewhat foolish on our part. And that's why we're taking some time here on the administrative cost side to go through and look at the work, look at the prioritization of the work, look at the sequencing of the work, look at the structure, look at how much we still need to do on the technology side, for example, to continue to be out there in front with our customers to be responsive to their needs. So what we're doing right now is prioritizing all of that in a way that we need to put it together in a fiscally responsible way. And then we'll bring it back to you and to our customer base and to our associates in the most balanced way that we can and the least risky way that we can. So certainly, if we were to go out and cut back dramatically on customer-facing technology support or customer-facing associates, that wouldn't be a very smart way to proceed here. So we're proceeding -- we see opportunities, as I said multiple times now, in all parts of the business. Where you're seeing focused primarily right now is on supply chain and the administrative side. And I think over the next couple of quarters, we'll be able to give you more visibility to that."

Our -- the ideal place for us to be would be to have 2 or 3 points of inflation across every category. I mean, that's as good as it gets. I've never seen it in 27 years of doing this. But that would be very good. And why is that? That's because history tells you and the data tells you that most of our customers are able to pass that type of increase along in a reasonably manageable way and a way that works for their business. So 2 to 3 overall would be fine. Now when it gets up over that 4%, 5%, 6%, that's not good for our customers, and that's -- when it starts off, so make it difficult for us to pass that much along on a timely basis. Now deflation would be the least attractive of all of those. It probably does -- it certainly does help your margin to some extent in terms of the percentage. But, as we all understand, you're taking fewer dollars to the bank to pay bills, so it puts a lot of pressure on your expenses along the way. So deflation, we haven't seen a lot of it over the -- we did some work on this, I think, over the last decade. And we've only had deflation a couple of times, and I think it's ranged from, in one instance, a quarter or so; in another instance, maybe up to 3 quarters. So we think we'll probably be on the longer end of that this time around. But it's a challenging environment. I will tell you I think we've -- I think we're doing a good job striking the right balance in terms of managing that down in a way that works for the customer but still is working for us, and I think you saw that in the numbers this quarter."

I think what we're -- what you're hearing from us as we begin to develop a real revenue management process is, there's opportunities for us with analytics in terms of the segmentation we're doing both across product categories as well as customers. There's opportunities for us to be smarter and more consistent and to be more on the market in terms of what's important to our customers. So I think that's the bigger opportunity. I was with a customer the other day, and your point on labor, it's the biggest thing we hear today from every customer we talk to. There's just a -- and you see it in the press, there's a labor shortage our there. They're having to adjust their cost structure accordingly. And I think that actually does the opposite of your question. It puts a little more pressure on some pricing because they're always looking for opportunities to manage their cost. But overall, I'd say it's -- it's not a bad environment right now from a pricing standpoint other than the deflation aspect of it."
