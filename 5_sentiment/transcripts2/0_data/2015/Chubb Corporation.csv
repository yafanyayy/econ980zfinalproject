In the fourth quarter of 2014, Chubb had record operating income per share of $2.29. Net income per share was $2.35. This capital of another great year with other operating income of $7.63 for the full year and net income per share of $8.62. Each of these being the second-best result in Chubb history. As you recall, 2013 earnings per share was the best in our history. So great back to back performance reflecting superior underwriting execution.
Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3%, the best combined ratio for any quarter in the past 6 years and a 1.2 point improvement over the year early in fourth quarter. The impact of catastrophe losses in the 2014 fourth quarter was 8/10 point compared to 2.1 points in the fourth quarter of 2013.
On an x cap basis, our combined ratio was 83.5%, essentially the same as in the fourth quarter of 2013. Premiums worldwide were up 30% in the quarter or up 4% excluding the impact of currency. As in recent quarters, we saw higher retention levels, continued rate increases and new business.
GAAP book value per share ran at $70.12, up 8% for the year. Our capital position remains very strong and we just completed our existing share repurchase program. Today, we announced a new $1.3 billion buyback program. As you saw in our press release, we have provided 2015 operating income per share guidance of $7.35 to $7.65.

In a marketplace that was competitive but still behaving rationally regarding price and terms and conditions, Commercial and Specialty both had strong performance in the fourth quarter. This was characterized most importantly, by excellent underwriting profitability and by executing our stated plans of emphasizing the retention of our profitable portfolio, while pushing for rate increases on those accounts that still require it. We also leveraged our distinct underwriting and claims advantages to write new business in our targeted niches.
Beginning with CCI. The fourth quarter combined ratio was 88.5% compared to 89% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 89.5% in the third quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 1.8 points of the combined ratio in 2014 and 0.6 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCIs fourth quarter combined ratio improved to 86.7% into 2014 from 88.4% in the prior year.
Dueling down into the CCI lines, we had another strong performance in the multiple parallel where the combined ratio was 85.4% compared to the unusually low 73.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Casualty combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 99.8% compared to the 102.9% reposted in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our Worker's Compensation combined ratio of 80.2% was outstanding, more than the 11 point improvement over the 91.5% that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013 and well below our 10-year average of 88%.
Property and Marine produced a fourth quarter combined ratio of 84.4% compared to 83.1% in the year-ago quarter. In recent conference calls, we told you that in light of rate increases over the past several years, we were increasingly focused on retention while at the same time, taking advantage of better priced new business in market segments we target. This focus is contributing to our positive growth. In CCI, fourth quarter net premiums grew to 5% to $1.3 billion. Workers comps grew asked the percent but as you would see if you look back at the results in previous quarters, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter-to-quarter due to the presence or absence of a larger premium account. For example, our Workers Comp growth rate for the third quarter of 2014 was down 1%, while for the full year, we grew the line by 6%, a little less in the 8% we grew it in 2013. Notwithstanding the fluctuation, we were able to achieve several points better retention in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter along with a slight increase in rate, and we are able to cross sell a few large quantities to existing customer. Overall, retention for CCI the fourth quarter was 88% in the U.S., high by historical standards and a 1 point improvement over the third quarter. Please note that in our press release, the retention and renewal rate changes for CCI and CSI that are stated to be for our third quarter are in fact are those for our fourth quarter. We apologize for any inconvenience, a corrected release is in the process of being issued.
Now even with this prior retention, we achieved an overall written renewal rating increase of 2% for the U.S. book. This was the 16th consecutive quarter we obtained rate increases and the earned premium impact continued to keep pace with our long-term loss trends. Outside the US, CCI's average renewal rate increases in the fourth quarter were marginally positive. As we noted last quarter, in this successful execution of our rate retention strategy was opened in there being fewer accounts in our portfolio that need substantial rate increases or that needs to be called from the book entirely. Of course, in those instances, where we cannot secure appropriate rates and terms, the calling will persist. The prospective new business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise and products and services that target the market segments in which we specialize. In the fourth quarter, we were able to secure new business opportunities that we believe will meet our required return target in many of these segment. In the U.S., our new-to-lost ratio was 1.4:1 compared to 1.0:1 in the third quarter of 2014. This improvement reflects the historically high retention rate and some additional new business.
Notwithstanding the continued improvement, new business writings as a percentage of our overall portfolio were still slightly below levels we were writing several years ago. For the full year, CCI's net written premiums increased 2% to $5.4 billion. The combined ratio was 89.9% in 2014 versus 86.5% in 2013. The impact of catastrophe accounted for 3.8 points of the 2014 combined ratio compared to 2.1 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of tax, CCI's combined ratio for the year was 86.1% in 2014 and 84.4% in 2013.
Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance. Our fourth quarter combined ratio was an outstanding 76.7% in 2014 and represented a 5-point improvement and compared to 81.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013. And Professional Liability, which represents the majority of our portfolio, the combined ratio was 80.3% compared to 85.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 due mainly to a higher level of favorable development. Our continued strong underwriting result in the quarter, same from our disciplined underwriting, which is increasingly informed by our use of advanced analytics continued culling actions where we don't believe we can achieve our required return and accumulative effects of rate increases, which  are on our U.S. book exceeded 20% over the last 3 years.
With respect to growth, CCI's net written premiums in the fourth quarter were $701 million, down about 1%. For the Professional Liability portion of CSI, net written premium of $628 million were essentially flat on a worldwide basis but up 3% in the U.S. As we have noted in the past, premium growth in Chubb Specialty can vary from quarter-to-quarter in part due to the absence or presence of large premium accounts and in the fourth quarter, we simply skew fewer good business opportunities outside the U.S. that we did in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, renewal retention for Professional Liability the U.S. remained at a very high 89% level achieved in the third quarter. At the same time, we secured a 4% average renewal rate increase in the U.S. book in line with our long-term loss cost trend. The fourth quarter was the 13 consecutive quarter in which we achieved rate increases in the U.S.
In markets outside the U.S., the average renewal rate change was close to flat. In the U.S., Professional Liability's new-to-lost ratio in the fourth quarter was 1.3:1, unchanged from the third quarter. This was a function of high retention levels in both quarters and our ability to find quality new business opportunities and our target markets following several years of industry rate increases and underwriting action.
Turning now to the Surety portion of the specialty book. The combined ratio of 48.6% in the fourth quarter represented a 5-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 6-point improvement when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net written premiums for Surety was $73 million, down 6%, reflecting the lack of large premium transaction like those book in the fourth quarter of 2013 for our customers who were performing work on major construction project. It is not uncommon to experience this variation in work orders but with the U.S. economy improving, we expect that our Surety customers, who were among the best in their field, should particularly benefit from that growth.
For the full year 2014, CSI's net written premiums increased 2% to $2.7 billion, and the combined ratio was an outstanding 80.5% compared to 84.3% in 2013. Professional Liability premiums increased 3% to $2.4 billion and the combined ratio was 82.2% versus 89.3% in 2013. Surety premiums for 2014 declined 4% to $300 million and the combined ratio was 67.3% versus 47.2% and 2013. Bottom line, we are very pleased with the strategies we implemented and the actions we have taken to improve the profitability of our specialty business, and we are well-positioned to the convertible profitably over time.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

Excluding the catastrophes, the Homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 76.4% versus 67.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. As you might recall, we pointed out last year at this time, the 76.3 x cat combined ratio for Homeowners was unusually good result. The average Homeowners renewal premium increase total 6% in the U.S. compared to 7% in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, net written premiums for personal Auto group 4%. The Personal Auto combined ratio was 95.2% compared to 93.9% in the corresponding quarter of 2013.

Homeowners policy retention was down slightly while personal Auto was unchanged from the third quarter of 2014.
In Other Personal, which includes our accident, Personal Excess Liability and yacht lines, we had strong growth of 6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the combined ratio was 95.1% compared to 96.8% in the corresponding quarter of 2013.
Looking now in our full year result, CPI's net written premiums increased 4% to $4.5 billion. CPI produced a combined ratio of 90.9% including 5.5 percentage points of catastrophe losses compared to a combined ratio of 87% for 2013, including a 7.2 point impact of catastrophes. Excluding catastrophes, CPI's combined ratio for the full year was 85.4% in 2014 versus 79.8% for 2013. For all of 2014, Homeowners premiums increased by 4% to $2.8 billion. The Homeowners combined ratio was 88.3% including an 8.9 percentage point impact from catastrophes. Compared to a combined ratio of 82.3% in 2013, including an 11.5 point impact from catastrophes. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the Homeowners combined ratio for the full year was 79.4% in 2014 versus 70.8% in 2013. Personal Auto premiums increased 1% in 2014 to $740 million and the combined ratio was 96.8% compared to 94.8% in 2013. Other Personal lines premiums increased 8% for the full year to $1 billion and the combined ratio was 94% versus 94.8% in 2013.
Turning now to claims for child overall. It was a fairly benign quarter for the loss perspective. On an x cat basis, newly rise claim count increased only 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, which is in line with our premium growth.
Regarding catastrophes, their impact in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 0.8 percentage points of the combined ratio or $25 million before tax. This includes $35 million of favorable development from Cat events earlier in 2014, which was partially offset by $11 million of unfavorable development from Cat events in 2013 and prior years.
Losses from catastrophe events that occurred in the fourth quarter 2014, totaled $49 million and were dominated by 2 hail and windstorms. 1 in Brisbane, Australia and then another that impacted Texas and Kansas. The impact of catastrophes for the full year 2014 was 3.6 percentage points or $444 million before tax, reflecting $11 million of unfavorable development from events that occurred in 2013 and prior years.
And now, I will turn it over to Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail."

We had strong underwriting income of $477 million in the quarter. For the full year, underwriting income was $1.4 billion. Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3% compared to 85.5% in the same quarter a year earlier. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 30.5% in 2014 versus 30.8% in 2013. For the full year, our combined ratio was 88.3% in 2014 compared to 86.1% in 2013 and our expense ratio for the full year was 31.4% in 2014 and 31.9% in 2013. Please note that over the past few years, our expense ratio in the fourth quarter has been lower than for other quarters in the full year due to seasonality. The expense ratio varies from quarter-to-quarter due to mix of business and other variables.
Property & Casualty investment income after-tax was down 6% in the fourth quarter. The $267 million, due once again, to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed maturity portfolios and to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign currency translation. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $18 million or $0.06 per share after-tax, including a $0.01 per share loss from alternative investment. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $67 million or $0.17 per share after-tax, including the gain of $0.09 per share from alternative investment.
Unrealized depreciation before tax at December 31, 2014, was $2.7 billion. For comparison at year-end; 2013, unrealized depreciation before tax was $1.9 billion. The increase in unrealized depreciation in 2014 largely reflects the decrease in interest rate and the increase in equity market that occurred during the year. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4 years and the average credit rating is AA3.
We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At December 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investments, including approximately $585 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at December 31, 2014 was $70.12 compared to $64.83 at year-end 2013, an increase of 8%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $65.03 compared to $61.86 at 2013 year-end and increase of 5%.
With regard to book value, as you may know, companies like Chubb as defined benefit pension and postretirement benefits plan are required to prepare an annual revaluation of the plants as it can benefit liability. As a result of our revaluation at the end of 2014, the estimate of our plan viability increased and our change in book value for the fourth quarter would adversely impacted by approximately $350 million after-tax. The increase in our plans liability was primarily due to the decrease in our discount rate assumption that resulted from the decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year-end rate and to a lesser extent, a change in our mortality assumption. The change in our mortality assumption reflects the impact of the October 2014 revision of the Society of Actuary for quality stables, which many companies including Chubb take into account the measurement of that benefit plant liability.
In addition, for change in book value driven the quarter was negatively affected by that $75 million due to the impact of foreign currency translation. As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2014 on prior year reserves by SBU, as follows: And CPI's, we had about $15 million, CCI had about $50 million, CSI had about $90 million and the runoff reinsurance assumed business had none, bringing our total favorable development to about $155 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 5 points overall, including an adverse impact from prior year catastrophes of $11 million. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had about $115 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $25 million in CPI, $35 million in CCI, $55 million in CSI, and none in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2013 was about 4 points overall, including a favorable impact from prior-year catastrophes of $6 million.
Favorable development for the full year 2014 totaled about $635 million and had a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 5 points, compared to $710 million in 2013 and a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 6 points.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 88.8% compared to 87% in last year's fourth quarter and for the full year 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 90% compared to 88.4% in 2013.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, our loss reserves decreased by $350 million, including a decrease of $344 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $6 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall decrease in reserves reflects the decrease of $53 million related to catastrophes, the impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $155 million.
Turning now to capital management. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $346 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $100.58 per share. For the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion and an average cost of $92.05 per share. As of December 31, 2014, there was approximately $52 million remaining under our January, 2014, repurchase program, which we completed this month.
As we announced today, our Board of Directors have authorized a new $1.3 billion share repurchase program beside of the share buyback program is essentially in line with the 2015 operating income reflected in our guidance last shareholder dividend. We intend to complete this program by the end of January 2016 subject to market condition and other factors.
Finally, let me make a few additional comments regarding our guidance. We expect operating income per share for 2015 to be in the range of $7.35 to $7.65 with the midpoint of $7.50.
Before reviewing the key assumptions underlying our 2015 operating income per share guidance, I would like to highlight a couple of external factors that will impact our financial results this year. First, interest rates have continued to decline on global basis, which were once again, put pressure on investment income. In addition, the impact of lower interest rate on our discount assumption will increase our pension and postretirement benefits cost in 2015, which will be reflected in slightly higher expense ratio for the full year compared to the 31.4% expense ratio in 2014. Second, since roughly a quarter of our businesses generated outside the United States, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies will have a negative impact on both a premium growth and investment income. As we said in our press release, we are achieving for the full year a negative 2 percentage point impact of foreign currency translation on written premium growth and a negative 1% this point impact on a growth of Property & Casualty investment income after-tax.
Our operating income per share guidance assumes the full year 2015, an increase of 1% to 3% in net written premium or 3% to 5% excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Combined ratio of 89% to 90% a decline of 6% to 8% in Property & Casualty investment income after taxes or 5% to 7%, down 5% to 7% excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, and our guidance assumes $230 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance also assumes 4 percentage points with catastrophe losses in line with our median annual catastrophe impact over the last 10 years. In terms of sensitivity, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on 2015 operating income per share is approximately $0.36.
And now I will turn it back to John."

The only other question I have was on the discussion on the combined ratio guidance. Can you -- did the x cat guidance is 85% to 86%. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the underlying accident that you're going forward? Does that still improve based on how on rates coming exceeding loss cost trends? Or is it sort of flat line? Can you just expand on that?"

Remember that 2015 accident year is based on earn rate, which means it's 50% driven by rate increases in year 2014 and 50% by rate increases in the year 2015. In the year 2014, our rate increases exceeded loss cost trends and even our shorter term loss cost. So we're going with some headwind of [indiscernible] from 2014 to 15% in 2015 accident year. Tailwind, not a headwind, tailwind. No wonder why I can't fly a plane. The -- now as we move in towards 2015, right now, our earn rate is still a little bit an excess of our loss cost trends in the fourth quarter but our written rate is about neutral to loss cost trends. I don't know where rate is going but I expect as we went up a variety of scenarios, it's more biased than the scenarios to rate increases not being as high as they currently are. So there could be some pressure on margins related to the 50% of accident year performance related to 2015. But then you got to combine that with the 2014 tailwind and it's hard to call whether you're going to have to see overall for the 2015 accident year contraction of margin expansion. And the second thing is that, we've talked about this on the path is that margin expansion analysis even correct that is necessary correlate in the year-over-year movement and combined ratios. The other big factor is how the actual losses compared to a loss cost trends. And as we saw this year, our actual losses especially in the Property line, when I say Homeowners was significantly higher than what we've experienced in recent years. We hope to see some reversion to the mean in that line of business. Now, there's no guarantee that you can't be higher than the need 2 years in a row so were conservative and we look at that. But again, we're hoping for some of our reversions in the actual losses and some of the lines, we have unfavorable experience in this year, which will largely related to those factors such as fire and non-cat weather."

For our domestic taxable fixed income maturities, it's probably 75 to 125 basis points. And is some variability in this because obviously, depending when you bought a security, if you bought something 5 years ago, it may have had a higher coupon at the finance crisis in this period, and that was going to be maturing.

Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3%, the best combined ratio for any quarter in the past 6 years and a 1.2-point improvement over the year early in fourth quarter. The impact of catastrophe losses in the 2014 fourth quarter was 0.8 point compared to 2.1 points in the fourth quarter of 2013.

In a marketplace that was competitive but still behaving rationally regarding price and terms and condition, Commercial and Specialty both had strong performance in the fourth quarter. This was characterized most importantly, by excellent underwriting profitability and by executing our stated plans of emphasizing the retention of our profitable portfolio, while pushing for rate increases on those accounts that still require it. We also leveraged our distinct underwriting and claims advantages to write new business in our targeted niches.
Beginning with CCI. The fourth quarter combined ratio was 88.5% compared to 89% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 89.5% in the third quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 1.8 points of the combined ratio in 2014 and 0.6 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCIs fourth quarter combined ratio improved to 86.7% into 2014 from 88.4% in the prior year.
Drilling down into the CCI lines, we had another strong performance in the Multiple Peril, where the combined ratio was 85.4% compared to the unusually low 73.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Casualty combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 99.8% compared to the 102.9% we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our Workers' Compensation combined ratio of 80.2% was outstanding, more than an 11-point improvement over the 91.5% that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013 and well below our 10-year average of 88%.
Property and Marine produced a fourth quarter combined ratio of 84.4% compared to 83.1% in the year-ago quarter. In recent conference calls, we told you that in light of rate increases over the past several years, we were increasingly focused on retention while at the same time, taking advantage of better priced new business in market segments we target. This focus is contributing to our positive growth. 
In CCI, fourth quarter net written premiums grew to 5% to $1.3 billion. Workers' Comp grew asked the percent. But as you would see if you look back at the results in previous quarters, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter-to-quarter due to the presence or absence of a larger premium account. For example, our Workers' Comp growth rate for the third quarter of 2014 was down 1%, while for the full year, we grew the line by 6%, a little less in the 8% we grew it in 2013. 
Notwithstanding the fluctuation, we were able to achieve several points better retention in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, along with a slight increase in rate, and we were able to cross-sell a few large policies to existing customer. 
Overall, retention for CCI in the fourth quarter was 88% in the U.S., high by historical standards and a 1-point improvement over the third quarter. Please note that in our press release, the retention and renewal rate changes for CCI and CSI that are stated to be for our third quarter are in fact are those for our fourth quarter. We apologize for any inconvenience. A corrected release is in the process of being issued.
Now even with this higher retention, we achieved an overall written renewal rate increase of 2% for the U.S. book. This was the 16th consecutive quarter we obtained rate increases and the earned premium impact continues to keep pace with our long-term loss cost trends. 
Outside the US, CCI's average renewal rate increases in the fourth quarter were marginally positive. As we noted last quarter, this successful execution of our rate retention strategy resulted in there being fewer accounts in our portfolio that need substantial rate increases or that needs to be called from the book entirely. Of course, in those instances, where we cannot secure appropriate rates and terms, the calling will persist. 
For prospective new business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise and products and services that target the market segments in which we specialize. In the fourth quarter, we were able to secure new business opportunities that we believe will meet our required return target in many of these segments. In the U.S., our new-to-lost business ratio was 1.4:1 compared to 1.0:1 in the third quarter of 2014. This improvement reflects the historically high retention rate and some additional new business.
Notwithstanding the continued improvement, new business writings as a percentage of our overall portfolio were still slightly below levels we were writing several years ago. For the full year, CCI's net written premiums increased 2% to $5.4 billion. The combined ratio was 89.9% in 2014 versus 86.5% in 2013. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 3.8 points of the 2014 combined ratio compared to 2.1 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of tax, CCI's combined ratio for the year was 86.1% in 2014 and 84.4% in 2013.
Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance. Our fourth quarter combined ratio was an outstanding 76.7% in 2014 and represented a 5-point improvement compared to 81.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013. And Professional Liability, which represents the majority of our portfolio, the combined ratio was 80.3% compared to 85.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 due mainly to a higher level of favorable development. Our continued strong underwriting result in the quarter stemmed from our disciplined underwriting, which is increasingly informed by our use of advanced analytics, continued calling actions where we don't believe we can achieve our required return and accumulative effects of rate increases, which on our U.S. book exceeded 20% over the last 3 years.
With respect to growth, CCI's net written premiums in the fourth quarter were $701 million, down about 1%. For the Professional Liability portion of CSI, net written premiums of $628 million were essentially flat on a worldwide basis but up 3% in the U.S. As we have noted in the past, premium growth in Chubb Specialty can vary from quarter-to-quarter in part due to the absence or presence of large premium accounts, and in the fourth quarter, with simply fewer good business opportunities outside the U.S. than we did in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, renewal retention for Professional Liability the U.S. remained at a very high 89% level achieved in the third quarter. At the same time, we secured a 4% average renewal rate increase in our U.S. book in line with our long-term loss cost trend. The fourth quarter was the 13th consecutive quarter in which we achieved rate increases in the U.S.
In markets outside the U.S., the average renewal rate change was close to flat. In the U.S., Professional Liability's new-to-lost ratio in the fourth quarter was 1.3:1, unchanged from the third quarter. This was a function of high retention levels in both quarters and our ability to find quality new business opportunities in our target markets following several years of industry rate increases and underwriting actions.
Turning now to the Surety portion of the Specialty book. The combined ratio of 48.6% in the fourth quarter represented a 5-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 6-point improvement when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net written premiums for Surety were $73 million, down 6%, reflecting the lack of large premium transactions like those booked in the fourth quarter of 2013 for our customers who were performing work on major construction projects. It is not uncommon to experience this variation in work orders, but with the U.S. economy improving, we expect that our Surety customers, who are among the best in their field, should particularly benefit from that growth.
For the full year 2014, CSI's net written premiums increased 2% to $2.7 billion, and the combined ratio was an outstanding 80.5% compared to 84.3% in 2013. Professional Liability premiums increased 3% to $2.4 billion and the combined ratio was 82.2% versus 89.3% in 2013. Surety premiums for 2014 declined 4% to $300 million and the combined ratio was 67.3% versus 47.2% in 2013. Bottom line, we are very pleased with the strategies we implemented and the actions we have taken to improve the profitability of our Specialty business, and we are well positioned to continue to grow profitably over time.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

In Other Personal, which includes our Accident, Personal Excess Liability and Yacht lines, we had strong growth of 6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the combined ratio was 95.1% compared to 96.8% in the corresponding quarter of 2013.
Looking now at our full year results, CPI's net written premiums increased 4% to $4.5 billion. CPI produced a combined ratio of 90.9% including 5.5 percentage points of catastrophe losses compared to a combined ratio of 87% for 2013, including a 7.2-point impact of catastrophes. Excluding catastrophes, CPI's combined ratio for the full year was 85.4% in 2014 versus 79.8% for 2013. 
For all of 2014, Homeowners premiums increased by 4% to $2.8 billion. The Homeowners combined ratio was 88.3% including an 8.9 percentage point impact from catastrophes. Compared to a combined ratio of 82.3% in 2013, including an 11.5-point impact from catastrophes. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the Homeowners combined ratio for the full year was 79.4% in 2014 versus 70.8% in 2013. 
Personal Auto premiums increased 1% in 2014 to $740 million and the combined ratio was 96.8% compared to 94.8% in 2013. 
Other Personal lines premiums increased 8% for the full year to $1 billion and the combined ratio was 94% versus 94.8% in 2013. 
Turning now to claims for Chubb overall. It was a fairly benign quarter from a loss perspective. On an x cat basis, [indiscernible] claim counts increased only 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, which is in line with our premium growth.
Regarding catastrophes, their impact in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 0.8 percentage points of the combined ratio or $25 million before tax. This includes $35 million of favorable development from cat events earlier in 2014, which was partially offset by $11 million of unfavorable development from cat events in 2013 and prior years.
Losses from catastrophe events that occurred in the fourth quarter 2014 totaled $49 million and were dominated by 2 hail and windstorms, one in Brisbane, Australia and then another that impacted Texas and Kansas. The impact of catastrophes for the full year 2014 was 3.6 percentage points or $444 million before tax, reflecting $11 million of unfavorable development from events that occurred in 2013 and prior years.
And now I will turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail."

We had strong underwriting income of $477 million in the quarter. For the full year, underwriting income was $1.4 billion. Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3% compared to 85.5% in the same quarter a year earlier. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 30.5% in 2014 versus 30.8% in 2013. For the full year, our combined ratio was 88.3% in 2014 compared to 86.1% in 2013, and our expense ratio for the full year was 31.4% in 2014 and 31.9% in 2013. Please note that over the past few years, our expense ratio in the fourth quarter has been lower than for other quarters in the full year due to seasonality. The expense ratio varies from quarter-to-quarter due to mix of business and other variables.
Property & Casualty investment income after-tax was down 6% in the fourth quarter to $267 million, due once again to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed maturity portfolios and to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign currency translation. 
Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $18 million or $0.06 per share after-tax, including a $0.01 per share loss from alternative investments. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $67 million or $0.17 per share after-tax, including a gain of $0.09 per share from alternative investment.
Unrealized depreciation before tax at December 31, 2014 was $2.7 billion. For comparison at year end 2013, unrealized depreciation before tax was $1.9 billion. The increase in unrealized depreciation in 2014 largely reflects the decrease in interest rate and the increase in equity market that occurred during the year. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4 years and the average credit rating is AA3.
We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At December 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investments, including approximately $585 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at December 31, 2014 was $70.12 compared to $64.83 at year end 2013, an increase of 8%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $65.03 compared to $61.86 at 2013 year end and increase of 5%.
With regard to book value, as you may know, companies like Chubb that have defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan are required to prepare an annual revaluation of the plan's assets can benefit liabilities. As a result of our revaluation at the end of 2014, the estimate of our plan viability increased and our change in book value for the fourth quarter was adversely impacted by approximately $350 million after tax. 
The increase in our plan's liabilities was primarily due to the decrease in our discount rate assumption that resulted from the decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year-end rate and to a lesser extent, a change in our mortality assumption. The change in our mortality assumption reflects the impact of the October 2014 revision of the Society of Actuaries mortality tables, which many companies, including Chubb, take into account the measurement of their benefit plan liabilities.
In addition, the change in book value during the quarter was negatively affected by that $75 million due to the impact of foreign currency translation. 
As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2014 on prior year reserves by SBU, as follows: In CPI, we had about $15 million, CCI had about $50 million, CSI had about $90 million and the runoff reinsurance assumed business had none, bringing our total favorable development to about $155 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 5 points overall, including an adverse impact from prior year catastrophes of $11 million. 
For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had about $115 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $25 million in CPI, $35 million in CCI, $55 million in CSI, and none in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2013 was about 4 points overall, including a favorable impact from prior-year catastrophes of $6 million.
Favorable development for the full year 2014 totaled about $635 million and had a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 5 points, compared to $710 million in 2013 and a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 6 points.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 88.8% compared to 87% in last year's fourth quarter. And for the full year 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 90% compared to 88.4% in 2013.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, our loss reserves decreased by $350 million, including a decrease of $344 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $6 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall decrease in reserves reflects the decrease of $53 million related to catastrophes. The impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $155 million.
Turning now to capital management. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $346 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $100.58 per share. For the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion and an average cost of $92.05 per share. As of December 31, 2014, there was approximately $52 million remaining under our January 2014 repurchase program, which we completed this month.
As we announced today, our Board of Directors have authorized a new $1.3 billion share repurchase program. The size of the share buyback program is essentially in line with the 2015 operating income reflected in our guidance less shareholder dividend. We intend to complete this program by the end of January 2016, subject to market condition and other factors.
Finally, let me make a few additional comments regarding our guidance. We expect operating income per share for 2015 to be in the range of $7.35 to $7.65 with a midpoint of $7.50.
Before reviewing the key assumptions underlying our 2015 operating income per share guidance, I would like to highlight a couple of external factors that will impact our financial results this year. First, interest rates have continued to decline on a global basis, which will once again, put pressure on investment income. In addition, the impact of lower interest rates on our discount assumption will increase our pension and post-retirement benefits cost in 2015, which will be reflected in slightly higher expense ratio for the full year compared to the 31.4% expense ratio in 2014. 
Second, since roughly 1/4 of our business is generated outside the United States, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies will have a negative impact on both a premium growth and investment income. As we said in our press release, we are assuming for the full year a negative 2 percentage point impact of foreign currency translation on written premium growth and a negative 1 percentage point impact on the growth of Property & Casualty investment income after-tax.
Our operating income per share guidance assumes the full year 2015, an increase of 1% to 3% in net written premium or 3% to 5% excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, a combined ratio of 89% to 90%, a decline of 6% to 8% in Property & Casualty investment income after taxes or 5% to 7% -- down 5% to 7% excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation. And our guidance assumes $230 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance also assumes 4 percentage points of catastrophe losses in line with our median and annual catastrophe impact over the last 10 years. In terms of sensitivity, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on 2015 operating income per share is approximately $0.36.
And now I will turn it back to John."

We generate annualized GAAP ROE of 13.6% and annualized operating ROE of 14.8%. The fourth quarter results capped off a terrific year in which we achieved excellent operating and net income per share. Renewal rates improved in all 3 SBUs with average U.S. rate increases for the full year of 3% for Standard Commercial, 5% for Professional Liability and we also achieved average U.S. renewal increases of 6% for Personal lines.
The growing rate adequacy of our overall book has increased our focus on retaining more of our profitable portfolio, as evidenced by our higher renewal retention rates. In the light of broader industry rate increases in the last few years, we're able to secure some additional new business that was attractively priced within the market segment we target.
We continued to actively manage our capital in 2014 by returning more than $2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our ongoing commitment to capital management is demonstrated by the new $1.3 billion share repurchase program we announced today.
As you can tell from our 2015 guidance, we're expecting another overall strong year despite the dual headwinds of continued low interest rates and the strong dollar.

In terms of assumptions, I'm not -- I can't go through each of the industry [ph] pieces, but obviously, retention is strong. You heard the commentary on rates of what we're seeing in the near term. And then there's some new business, of course, as well. And I'd highlight also, if you think about the relationship between growth, premium growth and renewal rate increases, they're not necessarily correlated. So for example, if you look back in 2013, we actually have lower x currency premium growth of 3%. But average renewal rates were actually higher than they were in 2014. I hope that gives you some idea of what we're thinking."

I mean, a variety of things can happen, obviously. It depends on some degree where rates do go. But when you look at the 2015 accident year, let's start with what most of the analysts talk about as margin expansion, meaning the earn rate versus long-term loss cost trends. Remember that the 2015 accident year is based on earn rate, which means it's 50% driven by rate increases in year 2014 and 50% by rate increases in the year 2015. In the year 2014, our rate increases exceeded loss cost trends and even our shorter-term loss cost. So we're going with some headwind, 1 point or 2, from 2014, plus 50% of 2015 accident year. Tailwind, not a headwind -- tailwind. No wonder why I can't fly a plane. Now as we move in towards 2015, right now, our earn rate is still a little bit in excess of our loss cost trends in the fourth quarter, but our written rate is about neutral to loss cost trends. I don't know where rate is going, but I expect as we run a variety of scenarios, it's more biased than the scenarios to rate increases not being as high as they currently are. But there could be some pressure on margins related to the 50% of accident year performance related to 2015. But then you've got to combine that with the 2014 tailwind, and it's hard to call whether you're going to have to see overall for the 2015 accident year contraction or margin expansion. Then the second thing is that, we've talked about this [indiscernible] in the past is that margin expansion analysis, even if correct, doesn't necessarily correlate to the year-over-year movement and combined ratios. The other big factor is how the actual losses compare to loss cost trends. And as we saw this year, our actual losses were, especially in the Property line, or I'd say Homeowners, were significantly higher than what we've experienced in recent years. And we'd hope to see some reversion to the mean in that line of business. Now there's no guarantee that you can't be higher than the mean 2 years in a row. So we're conservative when we look at that. But again, we're hoping for some reversions to the mean than actual losses. In some of the lines, we had unfavorable experience in this year, which were largely related to a lot of factors such as fire and non-cat weather."

Loss cost trends are used by different firms in different ways. What it doesn't take into account is the impact of proactive underwriting initiatives. So the kind of calling of the book we've been talking about doing over the past 2 years reduces our loss cost in the short term. When you take into account the underwriting initiatives we have underway, we'd expect our short-term loss cost trends to be about 1 point or 2 lower than long-term loss cost trends.

Overseas, the growth has been hurt overseas by rates directly and also because of the lack of increase in the rates has made new opportunities less attractive. We still look at overseas as an area which should grow somewhat better than the U.S., constant exchange and similar rate increases. But we've also suffered over the last for years of an economic downturn in Europe from Brazil turning down. So there were a lot of things that happened in the last few years in the overseas economy in general to exchange rates and then the insurance industry, just.

What percent of the portfolio comes up for reinvestment during the year? It looks like your forecast accelerated or accelerated in terms of declines from where it was a year ago. What are the ingredients that make that happen?"

So obviously, the way we do the forecasting is we take a look at the maturity profile of our portfolio in the upcoming year. We have to make, obviously, some assumptions related to what our cash flow is going to look like. We have our buy back and other things that impact all that. And we buy securities over time, which can impact the sort of the maturities and when they actually occur. And we start by looking at that. We have an estimate and a projection, if you will, of what we think our cash flows are going to look like with the maturities. We have an estimate of what we think reinvestment rates are going to look like, and we project down over time. Then obviously, as I mentioned, we also, this time around, given what's happening in the currency market, also needed to take a look at what we're seeing both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. to make some guesstimate about what we think the impact of currency will be. So that's how we do it. We look at our actual maturities and project down. It's sort of a moving target because things change over time. But we have a pretty good idea of what we think the maturity schedule is going to look like. And as you know, we actually published a maturity schedule in our 10-K every year, where we highlight the next few years of what the expected maturities are. So you can get a pretty good deal from that."

So outside the U.S., I'd say, our current reinvestment rates are about 2.25%. Our reinvestment rates in tax exempt in the U.S. is probably about 2.4% or thereabouts. And our reinvestment rate for our tax book securities in the U.S. is probably around 2.5%. And just to give -- I'll go one step further. So given that, I can try to at least give you some idea of when we think about the maturity schedule and what's maturing over the next, call it, few years on the U.S. tax exempt side, we're probably -- those reinvestment rates will probably be 175 to 200 basis points below our maturing book yields on average over the next few years. For our domestic taxable fixed income maturities, it's probably 75 to 125 basis points. And there is some variability in it because obviously, depending when you bought a security, if you bought something 5 years ago, it may have had a higher coupon at the financial crisis than this period, and that was going to be maturing. And then outside the U.S., it's 25 to 75 basis points."

This capped off another great year with operating income per share of $7.63 for the full year and net income per share of $8.62, each of these being the second-best results in Chubb history. As you recall, 2013 earnings per share was the best in our history. So great back-to-back performance reflecting superior underwriting execution.
Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3%, the best combined ratio for any quarter in the past 6 years and a 1.2-point improvement over the year early in fourth quarter. The impact of catastrophe losses in the 2014 fourth quarter was 0.8 point compared to 2.1 points in the fourth quarter of 2013. On an x cap basis, our combined ratio was 83.5%, essentially the same as in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Premiums worldwide were up 3% in the quarter or up 4% excluding the impact of currency. As in recent quarters, we saw higher retention levels, continued rate increases and new business.
GAAP book value per share at year end was $70.12, up 8% for the year. Our capital position remains very strong, and we just completed our existing share repurchase program. 
Today we announced a new $1.3 billion buyback program. As you saw in our press release, we have provided 2015 operating income per share guidance of $7.35 to $7.65. And Rick will have more to say about guidance as well as our capital management activities.

In a marketplace that was competitive but still behaving rationally regarding price and terms and condition, Commercial and Specialty both had strong performance in the fourth quarter. This was characterized most importantly by excellent underwriting profitability and by executing our stated plans of emphasizing the retention of our profitable portfolio, while pushing for rate increases on those accounts that still require it. We also leveraged our distinct underwriting and claims advantages to write new business in our targeted niches.
Beginning with CCI. The fourth quarter combined ratio was 88.5% compared to 89% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 89.5% in the third quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 1.8 points of the combined ratio in 2014 and 0.6 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's fourth quarter combined ratio improved to 86.7% into 2014 from 88.4% in the prior year.
Drilling down into the CCI lines, we had another strong performance in the Multiple Peril, where the combined ratio was 85.4% compared to the unusually low 73.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Casualty combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 99.8% compared to the 102.9% we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our Workers' Compensation combined ratio of 80.2% was outstanding, more than an 11-point improvement over the 91.5% that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013 and well below our 10-year average of 88%.
Property and Marine produced a fourth quarter combined ratio of 84.4% compared to 83.1% in the year-ago quarter. In recent conference calls, we told you that in light of rate increases over the past several years we were increasingly focused on retention, while at the same time, taking advantage of better priced new business in market segments we target. This focus is contributing to our positive growth. 
In CCI, fourth quarter net written premiums grew to 5% to $1.3 billion. Workers' Comp grew 16%. But as you would see if you look back at the results in previous quarters, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter-to-quarter due to the presence or absence of a larger premium account. For example, our Workers' Comp growth rate for the third quarter of 2014 was down 1%, while for the full year, we grew the line by 6%, a little less in the 8% we grew it in 2013. 
Notwithstanding these fluctuations, we were able to achieve several points better retention in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, along with a slight increase in rate, and we were able to cross-sell a few large policies to existing customers. 
Overall, retention for CCI in the fourth quarter was 88% in the U.S., high by historical standards and a 1-point improvement over the third quarter. Please note that in our press release, the retention and renewal rate changes for CCI and CSI that are stated to be for our third quarter, are in fact are those for our fourth quarter. We apologize for any inconvenience. A corrected release is in the process of being issued.
Now even with this higher retention, we achieved an overall written renewal rate increase of 2% for the U.S. book. This was the 16th consecutive quarter we obtained rate increase in, and the earned premium impact continues to keep pace with our long-term loss cost trends. 
Outside the US, CCI's average renewal rate increases in the fourth quarter were marginally positive. As we noted last quarter, this successful execution of our rate retention strategy resulted in there being fewer accounts in our portfolio that need substantial rate increases or that need to be culled from the book entirely. Of course, in those instances, where we cannot secure appropriate rates and terms, the culling will persist. 
For prospective new business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise and products and services to target the market segments in which we specialize. In the fourth quarter, we were able to secure new business opportunities that we believe will meet our required return targets in many of these segments. In the U.S., our new-to-lost business ratio was 1.4:1 compared to 1.0:1 in the third quarter of 2014. This improvement reflects the historically high retention rate and some additional new business.
Notwithstanding the continued improvement, new business writings as a percentage of our overall portfolio were still slightly below levels we were writing several years ago. For the full year, CCI's net written premiums increased 2% to $5.4 billion. The combined ratio was 89.9% in 2014 versus 86.5% in 2013. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 3.8 points of the 2014 combined ratio compared to 2.1 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of cats, CCI's combined ratio for the year was 86.1% in 2014 and 84.4% in 2013.
Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance. Our fourth quarter combined ratio was an outstanding 76.7% in 2014 and represented a 5-point improvement compared to 81.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013. And Professional Liability, which represents the majority of our portfolio, the combined ratio was 80.3% compared to 85.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 due mainly to a higher level of favorable development. Our continued strong underwriting results in the quarter stemmed from our disciplined underwriting, which is increasingly informed by our use of advanced analytics, continued culling actions where we don't believe we can achieve our required return and the cumulative effects of rate increases, which on our U.S. book exceeded 20% over the last 3 years.
With respect to growth, CCI's net written premiums in the fourth quarter were $701 million, down about 1%. For the Professional Liability portion of CSI, net written premiums of $628 million were essentially flat on a worldwide basis but up 3% in the U.S. As we have noted in the past, premium growth in Chubb Specialty can vary from quarter-to-quarter in part due to the absence or presence of large premium accounts, and in the fourth quarter, with 50 [ph] fewer good business opportunities outside the U.S. than we did in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, renewal retention for Professional Liability the U.S. remained at a very high 89% level achieved in the third quarter. At the same time, we secured a 4% average renewal rate increase in our U.S. book in line with our long-term loss cost trend. The fourth quarter was the 13th consecutive quarter in which we achieved rate increases in the U.S.
In markets outside the U.S., the average renewal rate change was close to flat. In the U.S., Professional Liability's new-to-lost business ratio in the fourth quarter was 1.3:1, unchanged from the third quarter. This was a function of high retention levels in both quarters and our ability to find quality new business opportunities in our target markets following several years of industry rate increases and underwriting actions.
Turning now to the Surety portion of the Specialty book. The combined ratio of 48.6% in the fourth quarter represented a 5-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 6-point improvement when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net written premiums for Surety were $73 million, down 6%, reflecting the lack of large premium transactions like those booked in the fourth quarter of 2013 for our customers who were performing work on major construction projects. It is not uncommon to experience this variation in work orders, but with the U.S. economy improving, we expect that our Surety customers, who are among the best in their field, should particularly benefit from that growth.
For the full year 2014, CSI's net written premiums increased 2% to $2.7 billion, and the combined ratio was an outstanding 80.5% compared to 84.3% in 2013. Professional Liability premiums increased 3% to $2.4 billion and the combined ratio was 82.2% versus 89.3% in 2013. Surety premiums for 2014 declined 4% to $300 million and the combined ratio was 67.3% versus 47.2% in 2013. Bottom line, we are very pleased with the strategies we implemented and the actions we have taken to improve the profitability of our Specialty business, and we are well positioned to continue to grow profitably over time.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

Catastrophes had only 0.1 percentage point impact on CPI's fourth quarter combined ratio compared to a 5.3 point impact in the fourth quarter of 2013. CPI's x cat combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 83.8% versus 78.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Homeowners premiums increased 3% for the quarter. The Homeowners combined ratio was 76.5% compared to 75.8% in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Catastrophes had a 0.1 percentage point impact on the Homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 8.5 percentage points in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Excluding catastrophes, the Homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 76.4% versus 67.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. As you might recall, we pointed out last year at this time that the 76.3% x cat combined ratio for Homeowners was an unusually good result. The average Homeowners renewal premium increased total 6% in the U.S. compared to 7% in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, net written premiums for Personal Auto grew 4%. The Personal Auto combined ratio was 95.2% compared to 93.9% in the corresponding quarter of 2013. CPI policy retention in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 89% for both Homeowners and Personal Auto. Homeowners policy retention was down slightly while Personal Auto was unchanged from the third quarter of 2014.
In Other Personal, which includes our Accident, Personal Excess Liability and Yacht lines, we had strong growth of 6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the combined ratio was 95.1% compared to 96.8% in the corresponding quarter of 2013.
Looking now at our full year results, CPI's net written premiums increased 4% to $4.5 billion. CPI produced a combined ratio of 90.9% including 5.5 percentage points of catastrophe losses compared to a combined ratio of 87% for 2013, including a 7.2-point impact from catastrophes. Excluding catastrophes, CPI's combined ratio for the full year was 85.4% in 2014 versus 79.8% for 2013. 
For all of 2014, Homeowners premiums increased by 4% to $2.8 billion. The Homeowners combined ratio was 88.3% including an 8.9 percentage point impact from catastrophes. Compared to a combined ratio of 82.3% in 2013, including an 11.5-point impact from catastrophes. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the Homeowners combined ratio for the full year was 79.4% in 2014 versus 70.8% in 2013. 
Personal Auto premiums increased 1% in 2014 to $740 million and the combined ratio was 96.8% compared to 94.8% in 2013. 
Other Personal lines premiums increased 8% for the full year to $1 billion and the combined ratio was 94% versus 94.8% in 2013. 
Turning now to claims for Chubb overall. It was a fairly benign quarter from a loss perspective. On an x cat basis, new revised claim counts increased only 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, which is in line with our premium growth.
Regarding catastrophes, their impact in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 0.8 percentage points of the combined ratio or $25 million before tax. This includes $35 million of favorable development from cat events earlier in 2014, which was partially offset by $11 million of unfavorable development from cat events in 2013 and prior years.
Losses from catastrophe events that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 totaled $49 million and were dominated by 2 hail and windstorms, one in Brisbane, Australia and then another that impacted Texas and Kansas. The impact of catastrophes for the full year 2014 was 3.6 percentage points or $444 million before tax, reflecting $11 million of unfavorable development from events that occurred in 2013 and prior years.
And now I will turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail."

Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3% compared to 85.5% in the s",1395,"Thanks, Paul. Looking first at our operating results. We had strong underwriting income of $477 million in the quarter. For the full year, underwriting income was $1.4 billion. Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3% compared to 85.5% in the same quarter a year earlier. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 30.5% in 2014 versus 30.8% in 2013. For the full year, our combined ratio was 88.3% in 2014 compared to 86.1% in 2013, and our expense ratio for the full year was 31.4% in 2014 and 31.9% in 2013. Please note that over the past few years, our expense ratio in the fourth quarter has been lower than for other quarters in the full year due to seasonality. The expense ratio varies from quarter-to-quarter due to mix of business and other variables.
Property & Casualty investment income after-tax was down 6% in the fourth quarter to $267 million, due once again to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed maturity portfolios and to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign currency translation. 
Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $18 million or $0.06 per share after-tax, including a $0.01 per share loss from alternative investments. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $67 million or $0.17 per share after-tax, including a gain of $0.09 per share from alternative investment.
Unrealized depreciation before tax at December 31, 2014 was $2.7 billion. For comparison at year end 2013, unrealized depreciation before tax was $1.9 billion. The increase in unrealized depreciation in 2014 largely reflects the decrease in interest rates and the increase in equity markets that occurred during the year. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4 years and the average credit rating is AA3.
We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At December 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investments, including approximately $585 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at December 31, 2014 was $70.12 compared to $64.83 at year end 2013, an increase of 8%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $65.03 compared to $61.86 at 2013 year end, an increase of 5%.
With regard to book value, as you may know, companies like Chubb that have defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan are required to prepare an annual revaluation of the plan's assets and benefit liabilities. As a result of our revaluation at the end of 2014, the estimate of our plan's liabilities increased and our change in book value for the fourth quarter was adversely impacted by approximately $350 million after tax. 
The increase in our plan's liabilities was primarily due to the decrease in our discount rate assumption that resulted from the decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year-end rate and to a lesser extent, a change in our mortality assumption. The change in our mortality assumption reflects the impact of the October 2014 revision of the Society of Actuaries mortality tables, which many companies, including Chubb, take into account the measurement of their benefit plan liabilities.
In addition, the change in book value during the quarter was negatively affected by that $75 million due to the impact of foreign currency translation. 
As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2014 on prior year reserves by SBU, as follows: In CPI, we had about $15 million, CCI had about $50 million, CSI had about $90 million and the runoff reinsurance assumed business had none, bringing our total favorable development to about $155 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 5 points overall, including an adverse impact from prior year catastrophes of $11 million. 
For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had about $115 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $25 million in CPI, $35 million in CCI, $55 million in CSI, and none in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2013 was about 4 points overall, including a favorable impact from prior-year catastrophes of $6 million.
Favorable development for the full year 2014 totaled about $635 million. It had a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 5 points, compared to $710 million in 2013 and a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 6 points.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 88.8% compared to 87% in last year's fourth quarter. And for the full year 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 90% compared to 88.4% in 2013.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, our loss reserves decreased by $350 million, including a decrease of $344 million for the insurance business and a decrease with $6 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall decrease in reserves reflects the decrease of $53 million related to catastrophes. The impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $155 million.
Turning now to capital management. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $346 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $100.58 per share. For the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion and an average cost of $92.05 per share. As of December 31, 2014, there was approximately $52 million remaining under our January 2014 repurchase program, which we completed this month.
As we announced today, our Board of Directors have authorized a new $1.3 billion share repurchase program. The size of the share buyback program is essentially in line with the 2015 operating income reflected in our guidance less shareholder dividend. We intend to complete this program by the end of January 2016, subject to market conditions and other factors.
Finally, let me make a few additional comments regarding our guidance. We expect operating income per share for 2015 to be in the range of $7.35 to $7.65 with a midpoint of $7.50.
Before reviewing the key assumptions underlying our 2015 operating income per share guidance, I would like to highlight a couple of external factors that will impact our financial results this year. First, interest rates have continued to decline on a global basis, which will once again put pressure on investment income. In addition, the impact of lower interest rates on our discount assumption will increase our pension and post-retirement benefits cost in 2015, which will be reflected in slightly higher expense ratio for the full year compared to the 31.4% expense ratio in 2014. 
Second, since roughly 1/4 of our business is generated outside the United States, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies will have a negative impact on both premium growth and investment income. As we said in our press release, we are assuming for the full year a negative 2 percentage point impact of foreign currency translation on written premium growth and a negative 1 percentage point impact on the growth of Property & Casualty investment income after-tax.
Our operating income per share guidance assumes the full year 2015, an increase of 1% to 3% in net written premium or 3% to 5% excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, a combined ratio of 89% to 90%, a decline of 6% to 8% in Property & Casualty investment income after taxes or 5% to 7% -- down 5% to 7% excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation. And our guidance assumes $230 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance also assumes 4 percentage points of catastrophe losses in line with our median annual catastrophe impact over the last 10 years. In terms of sensitivity, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on 2015 operating income per share is approximately $0.36.
And now I will turn it back to John."

Is it simply a function of new business? Or are you factoring in some, maybe, rate momentum going forward?"

So for the full year 2014, net premiums written increased 3% or 4% excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. So we're expecting next year that x currency premium growth will be consistent with our 2014 growth, and we believe that it's reasonable based on the current market environment. In terms of assumptions, I'm not -- I can't go through each of the individual pieces, but obviously, retention is strong. You heard the commentary on rates of what we're seeing in the near term. And then there's some new business, of course, as well. And I'd highlight also, if you think about the relationship between growth -- premium growth and renewal rate increases, they're not necessarily correlated. So for example, if you look back in 2013, we actually had lower x currency premium growth of 3%. But average renewal rates were actually higher than they were in 2014. So hopefully that gives you some idea of what we're thinking."

I mean, a variety of things can happen, obviously. It depends on some degree where rates do go. But when you look at the 2015 accident year, let's start with what most of the analysts talk about as margin expansion, meaning earn rate versus long-term loss cost trends. Remember that the 2015 accident year is based on earn rate, which means it's 50% driven by rate increases in year 2014 and 50% by rate increases in the year 2015. In the year 2014, our rate increases exceeded loss cost trends and even our shorter-term loss cost. So we're going with some headwind, 1 point or 2, from 2014, plus 50% of 2015 accident year. Tailwind, not a headwind -- tailwind. No wonder why I can't fly a plane. Now as we move in towards 2015, right now, our earn rate is still a little bit in excess of our loss cost trends in the fourth quarter, but our written rate is about neutral to loss cost trends. I don't know where rate is going, but I expect as we run a variety of scenarios, it's more biased than the scenarios to rate increases not being as high as they currently are. But there could be some pressure on margins related to the 50% of accident year performance related to 2015. But then you've got to combine that with the 2014 tailwind, and it's hard to call whether you're going to have to see overall for the 2015 accident year contraction or margin expansion. Then the second thing is that, we've talked about this ad nauseam in the past, is that margin expansion analysis, even if correct, doesn't necessarily correlate to the year-over-year movement in combined ratios. The other big factor is how do actual losses compare to loss cost trends? And as we saw this year, our actual losses were, especially in the Property line, or I'd say Homeowners, were significantly higher than what we've experienced in recent years. And we'd hope to see some reversion to the mean in that line of business. Now there's no guarantee that you can't be higher than the mean 2 years in a row. So we're conservative when we look at that. But again, we're hoping for some reversions to the mean than actual losses. In some of the lines, we had unfavorable experience in this year, which were largely related to luck factors such as fire and non-cat weather."

When we talk about loss trend, we use 4%, but let me define that for you. Our loss trend is largely macroeconomic factors such as in Workers' Comp and healthcare inflation. Loss cost trends are used by different firms in different ways. What it doesn't take into account is the impact of proactive underwriting initiatives. So the kind of culling of the book we've been talking about doing over the past 2 years reduces our loss cost in the short term. When you take into account the underwriting initiatives we have underway, we'd expect our short-term loss cost trends to be about 1 point or 2 lower than long-term loss cost trends. So when we budget and look at profitability, we do this granularly by line, but we'd probably look at our short-term loss cost trends at 2 to 3 points rather than the 4-point long term loss cost trend.

Overseas, the growth has been hurt overseas by rates directly and also because of the lack of increase in the rates has made new opportunities less attractive. We still look at overseas as an area which should grow somewhat better than the U.S., constant exchange and similar rate increases.

We have an estimate of what we think reinvestment rates are going to look like, and we project down over time.

So given that, I can try to at least give you some idea of when we think about the maturity schedule and what's maturing over the next, call it, few years on the U.S. tax exempt side, we're probably -- those reinvestment rates will probably be 175 to 200 basis points below our maturing book yields on average over the next few years. For our domestic taxable fixed income maturities, it's probably 75 to 125 basis points. And there is some variability in this because obviously, depending when you bought a security, if you bought something 5 years ago, it may have had a higher coupon at the financial crisis than this period, and that was going to be maturing.

Clearly, with the broadening appetite in capacity and some of the lower pricing that you're referring to, you're going to get individual situations where we're able now to get into an account that required larger limits of insurance than we would be comfortable with. So today's facultative reinsurance dynamics helps us support those larger limits while we still effectively manage our overall net exposure. Now occasionally, we've also used cat reinsurance where maybe one of our insurers has moved to an area and expanded, the area where it -- they have -- there's too much catastrophe exposure there for us, and we can use some of the facultative reinsurance to cover us there. In this way, we get to be able to keep that account. So on individual account level, we're clearly taking advantage of the facultative reinsurance marketplace. But as Ricky and John point out, we don't see it as any -- influencing, any wholesale change in our underwriting strategy."

As you recall, 2013 earnings per share was the best in our history. So great back-to-back performance reflecting superior underwriting execution.
Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3%, the best combined ratio for any quarter in the past 6 years and a 1.2-point improvement over the year early in fourth quarter. The impact of catastrophe losses in the 2014 fourth quarter was 0.8 point compared to 2.1 points in the fourth quarter of 2013. On an x cap basis, our combined ratio was 83.5%, essentially the same as in the fourth quarter of 2013.

GAAP book value per share at year end was $70.12, up 8% for the year. Our capital position remains very strong, and we just completed our existing share repurchase program. 
Today we announced a new $1.3 billion buyback program. As you saw in our press release, we have provided 2015 operating income per share guidance of $7.35 to $7.65. And Rick will have more to say about guidance as well as our capital management activities.

In a marketplace that was competitive but still behaving rationally regarding price and terms and condition, Commercial and Specialty both had strong performance in the fourth quarter. This was characterized most importantly by excellent underwriting profitability and by executing our stated plans of emphasizing the retention of our profitable portfolio, while pushing for rate increases on those accounts that still require it. We also leveraged our distinct underwriting and claims advantages to write new business in our targeted niches.
Beginning with CCI. The fourth quarter combined ratio was 88.5% compared to 89% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 89.5% in the third quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 1.8 points of the combined ratio in 2014 and 0.6 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's fourth quarter combined ratio improved to 86.7% into 2014 from 88.4% in the prior year.
Drilling down into the CCI lines, we had another strong performance in the Multiple Peril, where the combined ratio was 85.4% compared to the unusually low 73.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Casualty combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 99.8% compared to the 102.9% we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our Workers' Compensation combined ratio of 80.2% was outstanding, more than an 11-point improvement over the 91.5% that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013 and well below our 10-year average of 88%.
Property and Marine produced a fourth quarter combined ratio of 84.4% compared to 83.1% in the year-ago quarter. In recent conference calls, we told you that in light of rate increases over the past several years we were increasingly focused on retention, while at the same time, taking advantage of better priced new business in market segments we target. This focus is contributing to our positive growth. 
In CCI, fourth quarter net written premiums grew to 5% to $1.3 billion. Workers' Comp grew 16%. But as you would see if you look back at the results in previous quarters, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter-to-quarter due to the presence or absence of a larger premium account. For example, our Workers' Comp growth rate for the third quarter of 2014 was down 1%, while for the full year, we grew the line by 6%, a little less in the 8% we grew it in 2013. 
Notwithstanding these fluctuations, we were able to achieve several points better retention in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, along with a slight increase in rate, and we were able to cross-sell a few large policies to existing customers. 
Overall, retention for CCI in the fourth quarter was 88% in the U.S., high by historical standards and a 1-point improvement over the third quarter. Please note that in our press release, the retention and renewal rate changes for CCI and CSI that are stated to be for our third quarter, are in fact are those for our fourth quarter. We apologize for any inconvenience. A corrected release is in the process of being issued.
Now even with this higher retention, we achieved an overall written renewal rate increase of 2% for the U.S. book. This was the 16th consecutive quarter we obtained rate increase in, and the earned premium impact continues to keep pace with our long-term loss cost trends. 
Outside the US, CCI's average renewal rate increases in the fourth quarter were marginally positive. As we noted last quarter, this successful execution of our rate retention strategy resulted in there being fewer accounts in our portfolio that need substantial rate increases or that need to be culled from the book entirely. Of course, in those instances, where we cannot secure appropriate rates and terms, the culling will persist. 
For prospective new business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise and products and services to target the market segments in which we specialize. In the fourth quarter, we were able to secure new business opportunities that we believe will meet our required return targets in many of these segments. In the U.S., our new-to-lost business ratio was 1.4:1 compared to 1.0:1 in the third quarter of 2014. This improvement reflects the historically high retention rate and some additional new business.
Notwithstanding the continued improvement, new business writings as a percentage of our overall portfolio were still slightly below levels we were writing several years ago. For the full year, CCI's net written premiums increased 2% to $5.4 billion. The combined ratio was 89.9% in 2014 versus 86.5% in 2013. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 3.8 points of the 2014 combined ratio compared to 2.1 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of cats, CCI's combined ratio for the year was 86.1% in 2014 and 84.4% in 2013.
Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance. Our fourth quarter combined ratio was an outstanding 76.7% in 2014 and represented a 5-point improvement compared to 81.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013. And Professional Liability, which represents the majority of our portfolio, the combined ratio was 80.3% compared to 85.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 due mainly to a higher level of favorable development. Our continued strong underwriting results in the quarter stemmed from our disciplined underwriting, which is increasingly informed by our use of advanced analytics, continued culling actions where we don't believe we can achieve our required return and the cumulative effects of rate increases, which on our U.S. book exceeded 20% over the last 3 years.
With respect to growth, CCI's net written premiums in the fourth quarter were $701 million, down about 1%. For the Professional Liability portion of CSI, net written premiums of $628 million were essentially flat on a worldwide basis but up 3% in the U.S. As we have noted in the past, premium growth in Chubb Specialty can vary from quarter-to-quarter in part due to the absence or presence of large premium accounts, and in the fourth quarter, with 50 [ph] fewer good business opportunities outside the U.S. than we did in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, renewal retention for Professional Liability the U.S. remained at a very high 89% level achieved in the third quarter. At the same time, we secured a 4% average renewal rate increase in our U.S. book in line with our long-term loss cost trend. The fourth quarter was the 13th consecutive quarter in which we achieved rate increases in the U.S.
In markets outside the U.S., the average renewal rate change was close to flat. In the U.S., Professional Liability's new-to-lost business ratio in the fourth quarter was 1.3:1, unchanged from the third quarter. This was a function of high retention levels in both quarters and our ability to find quality new business opportunities in our target markets following several years of industry rate increases and underwriting actions.
Turning now to the Surety portion of the Specialty book. The combined ratio of 48.6% in the fourth quarter represented a 5-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 6-point improvement when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net written premiums for Surety were $73 million, down 6%, reflecting the lack of large premium transactions like those booked in the fourth quarter of 2013 for our customers who were performing work on major construction projects. It is not uncommon to experience this variation in work orders, but with the U.S. economy improving, we expect that our Surety customers, who are among the best in their field, should particularly benefit from that growth.
For the full year 2014, CSI's net written premiums increased 2% to $2.7 billion, and the combined ratio was an outstanding 80.5% compared to 84.3% in 2013. Professional Liability premiums increased 3% to $2.4 billion and the combined ratio was 82.2% versus 89.3% in 2013. Surety premiums for 2014 declined 4% to $300 million and the combined ratio was 67.3% versus 47.2% in 2013. Bottom line, we are very pleased with the strategies we implemented and the actions we have taken to improve the profitability of our Specialty business, and we are well positioned to continue to grow profitably over time.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

CPI net written premiums increased a healthy 4% to $1.1 billion. CPI delivered a terrific combined ratio of 83.9% in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the 83.5% produced in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Catastrophes had only 0.1 percentage point impact on CPI's fourth quarter combined ratio compared to a 5.3 point impact in the fourth quarter of 2013. CPI's x cat combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 83.8% versus 78.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Homeowners premiums increased 3% for the quarter. The Homeowners combined ratio was 76.5% compared to 75.8% in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Catastrophes had a 0.1 percentage point impact on the Homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 8.5 percentage points in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Excluding catastrophes, the Homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 76.4% versus 67.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. As you might recall, we pointed out last year at this time that the 76.3% x cat combined ratio for Homeowners was an unusually good result. The average Homeowners renewal premium increased total 6% in the U.S. compared to 7% in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, net written premiums for Personal Auto grew 4%. The Personal Auto combined ratio was 95.2% compared to 93.9% in the corresponding quarter of 2013. CPI policy retention in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 89% for both Homeowners and Personal Auto. Homeowners policy retention was down slightly while Personal Auto was unchanged from the third quarter of 2014.
In Other Personal, which includes our Accident, Personal Excess Liability and Yacht lines, we had strong growth of 6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the combined ratio was 95.1% compared to 96.8% in the corresponding quarter of 2013.
Looking now at our full year results, CPI's net written premiums increased 4% to $4.5 billion. CPI produced a combined ratio of 90.9% including 5.5 percentage points of catastrophe losses compared to a combined ratio of 87% for 2013, including a 7.2-point impact from catastrophes. Excluding catastrophes, CPI's combined ratio for the full year was 85.4% in 2014 versus 79.8% for 2013. 
For all of 2014, Homeowners premiums increased by 4% to $2.8 billion. The Homeowners combined ratio was 88.3% including an 8.9 percentage point impact from catastrophes. Compared to a combined ratio of 82.3% in 2013, including an 11.5-point impact from catastrophes. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the Homeowners combined ratio for the full year was 79.4% in 2014 versus 70.8% in 2013. 
Personal Auto premiums increased 1% in 2014 to $740 million and the combined ratio was 96.8% compared to 94.8% in 2013. 
Other Personal lines premiums increased 8% for the full year to $1 billion and the combined ratio was 94% versus 94.8% in 2013. 
Turning now to claims for Chubb overall. It was a fairly benign quarter from a loss perspective. On an x cat basis, new revised claim counts increased only 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, which is in line with our premium growth.
Regarding catastrophes, their impact in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 0.8 percentage points of the combined ratio or $25 million before tax. This includes $35 million of favorable development from cat events earlier in 2014, which was partially offset by $11 million of unfavorable development from cat events in 2013 and prior years.
Losses from catastrophe events that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 totaled $49 million and were dominated by 2 hail and windstorms, one in Brisbane, Australia and then another that impacted Texas and Kansas. The impact of catastrophes for the full year 2014 was 3.6 percentage points or $444 million before tax, reflecting $11 million of unfavorable development from events that occurred in 2013 and prior years.

We had strong underwriting income of $477 million in the quarter. For the full year, underwriting income was $1.4 billion. Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3% compared to 85.5% in the same quarter a year earlier. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 30.5% in 2014 versus 30.8% in 2013. For the full year, our combined ratio was 88.3% in 2014 compared to 86.1% in 2013, and our expense ratio for the full year was 31.4% in 2014 and 31.9% in 2013. Please note that over the past few years, our expense ratio in the fourth quarter has been lower than for other quarters in the full year due to seasonality. The expense ratio varies from quarter-to-quarter due to mix of business and other variables.
Property & Casualty investment income after-tax was down 6% in the fourth quarter to $267 million, due once again to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed maturity portfolios and to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign currency translation. 
Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $18 million or $0.06 per share after-tax, including a $0.01 per share loss from alternative investments. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $67 million or $0.17 per share after-tax, including a gain of $0.09 per share from alternative investment.
Unrealized depreciation before tax at December 31, 2014 was $2.7 billion. For comparison at year end 2013, unrealized depreciation before tax was $1.9 billion. The increase in unrealized depreciation in 2014 largely reflects the decrease in interest rates and the increase in equity markets that occurred during the year. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4 years and the average credit rating is AA3.
We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At December 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investments, including approximately $585 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at December 31, 2014 was $70.12 compared to $64.83 at year end 2013, an increase of 8%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $65.03 compared to $61.86 at 2013 year end, an increase of 5%.
With regard to book value, as you may know, companies like Chubb that have defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan are required to prepare an annual revaluation of the plan's assets and benefit liabilities. As a result of our revaluation at the end of 2014, the estimate of our plan's liabilities increased and our change in book value for the fourth quarter was adversely impacted by approximately $350 million after tax. 
The increase in our plan's liabilities was primarily due to the decrease in our discount rate assumption that resulted from the decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year-end rate and to a lesser extent, a change in our mortality assumption. The change in our mortality assumption reflects the impact of the October 2014 revision of the Society of Actuaries mortality tables, which many companies, including Chubb, take into account the measurement of their benefit plan liabilities.
In addition, the change in book value during the quarter was negatively affected by that $75 million due to the impact of foreign currency translation. 
As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2014 on prior year reserves by SBU, as follows: In CPI, we had about $15 million, CCI had about $50 million, CSI had about $90 million and the runoff reinsurance assumed business had none, bringing our total favorable development to about $155 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 5 points overall, including an adverse impact from prior year catastrophes of $11 million. 
For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had about $115 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $25 million in CPI, $35 million in CCI, $55 million in CSI, and none in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2013 was about 4 points overall, including a favorable impact from prior-year catastrophes of $6 million.
Favorable development for the full year 2014 totaled about $635 million. It had a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 5 points, compared to $710 million in 2013 and a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 6 points.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 88.8% compared to 87% in last year's fourth quarter. And for the full year 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 90% compared to 88.4% in 2013.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, our loss reserves decreased by $350 million, including a decrease of $344 million for the insurance business and a decrease with $6 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall decrease in reserves reflects the decrease of $53 million related to catastrophes. The impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $155 million.
Turning now to capital management. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $346 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $100.58 per share. For the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion and an average cost of $92.05 per share. As of December 31, 2014, there was approximately $52 million remaining under our January 2014 repurchase program, which we completed this month.
As we announced today, our Board of Directors have authorized a new $1.3 billion share repurchase program. The size of the share buyback program is essentially in line with the 2015 operating income reflected in our guidance less shareholder dividend. We intend to complete this program by the end of January 2016, subject to market conditions and other factors.
Finally, let me make a few additional comments regarding our guidance. We expect operating income per share for 2015 to be in the range of $7.35 to $7.65 with a midpoint of $7.50.
Before reviewing the key assumptions underlying our 2015 operating income per share guidance, I would like to highlight a couple of external factors that will impact our financial results this year. First, interest rates have continued to decline on a global basis, which will once again put pressure on investment income. In addition, the impact of lower interest rates on our discount assumption will increase our pension and post-retirement benefits cost in 2015, which will be reflected in slightly higher expense ratio for the full year compared to the 31.4% expense ratio in 2014. 
Second, since roughly 1/4 of our business is generated outside the United States, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies will have a negative impact on both premium growth and investment income. As we said in our press release, we are assuming for the full year a negative 2 percentage point impact of foreign currency translation on written premium growth and a negative 1 percentage point impact on the growth of Property & Casualty investment income after-tax.
Our operating income per share guidance assumes the full year 2015, an increase of 1% to 3% in net written premium or 3% to 5% excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, a combined ratio of 89% to 90%, a decline of 6% to 8% in Property & Casualty investment income after taxes or 5% to 7% -- down 5% to 7% excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation. And our guidance assumes $230 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance also assumes 4 percentage points of catastrophe losses in line with our median annual catastrophe impact over the last 10 years. In terms of sensitivity, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on 2015 operating income per share is approximately $0.36.
And now I will turn it back to John."

Renewal rates improved in all 3 SBUs with average U.S. rate increases for the full year of 3% for Standard Commercial, 5% for Professional Liability and we also achieved average U.S. renewal increases of 6% for Personal lines.
The growing rate adequacy of our overall book has increased our focus on retaining more of our profitable portfolio, as evidenced by our higher renewal retention rates. And in the light of broader industry rate increases in the last few years, we're able to secure some additional new business that was attractively priced within the market segment we targeted.
We continued to actively manage our capital in 2014 by returning more than $2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our ongoing commitment to capital management is demonstrated by the new $1.3 billion share repurchase program we announced today.
As you can tell from our 2015 guidance, we're expecting another overall strong year despite the dual headwinds of continued low interest rates and the strong dollar.

In terms of assumptions, I'm not -- I can't go through each of the individual pieces, but obviously, retention is strong. You heard the commentary on rates of what we're seeing in the near term. And then there's some new business, of course, as well. And I'd highlight also, if you think about the relationship between growth -- premium growth and renewal rate increases, they're not necessarily correlated. So for example, if you look back in 2013, we actually had lower x currency premium growth of 3%. But average renewal rates were actually higher than they were in 2014. So hopefully that gives you some idea of what we're thinking."

I mean, a variety of things can happen, obviously. It depends on some degree where rates do go. But when you look at the 2015 accident year, let's start with what most of the analysts talk about as margin expansion, meaning earn rate versus long-term loss cost trends. Remember that the 2015 accident year is based on earn rate, which means it's 50% driven by rate increases in year 2014 and 50% by rate increases in the year 2015. In the year 2014, our rate increases exceeded loss cost trends and even our shorter-term loss cost. So we're going with some headwind, 1 point or 2, from 2014, plus 50% of 2015 accident year. Tailwind, not a headwind -- tailwind. No wonder why I can't fly a plane. Now as we move in towards 2015, right now, our earn rate is still a little bit in excess of our loss cost trends in the fourth quarter, but our written rate is about neutral to loss cost trends. I don't know where rate is going, but I expect as we run a variety of scenarios, it's more biased than the scenarios to rate increases not being as high as they currently are. But there could be some pressure on margins related to the 50% of accident year performance related to 2015. But then you've got to combine that with the 2014 tailwind, and it's hard to call whether you're going to have to see overall for the 2015 accident year contraction or margin expansion. Then the second thing is that, we've talked about this ad nauseam in the past, is that margin expansion analysis, even if correct, doesn't necessarily correlate to the year-over-year movement in combined ratios. The other big factor is how do actual losses compare to loss cost trends? And as we saw this year, our actual losses were, especially in the Property line, or I'd say Homeowners, were significantly higher than what we've experienced in recent years. And we'd hope to see some reversion to the mean in that line of business. Now there's no guarantee that you can't be higher than the mean 2 years in a row. So we're conservative when we look at that. But again, we're hoping for some reversions to the mean than actual losses. In some of the lines, we had unfavorable experience in this year, which were largely related to luck factors such as fire and non-cat weather."

When we talk about loss trend, we use 4%, but let me define that for you. Our loss trend is largely macroeconomic factors such as in Workers' Comp and healthcare inflation. Loss cost trends are used by different firms in different ways. What it doesn't take into account is the impact of proactive underwriting initiatives. So the kind of culling of the book we've been talking about doing over the past 2 years reduces our loss cost in the short term. When you take into account the underwriting initiatives we have underway, we'd expect our short-term loss cost trends to be about 1 point or 2 lower than long-term loss cost trends. So when we budget and look at profitability, we do this granularly by line, but we'd probably look at our short-term loss cost trends at 2 to 3 points rather than the 4-point long term loss cost trend. But when we compare it -- when I say we're about even in the fourth quarter, I was comparing written to long-term. We're still 1 point or so above what we envisioned to be the short-term loss cost trends."

And the other driver of relative growth is rates, and rates in the U.S. over the last 3 years, have been significantly higher than rates overseas. Overseas, the growth has been hurt overseas by rates directly and also because of the lack of increase in the rates has made new opportunities less attractive. We still look at overseas as an area which should grow somewhat better than the U.S., constant exchange and similar rate increases. But we've also suffered over the last for years of an economic downturn in Europe, from Brazil turning down.

We have to make, obviously, some assumptions related to what our cash flow is going to look like. We have our buy back and other things that impact all that.

We have an estimate and a projection, if you will, of what we think our cash flows are going to look like with the maturities. We have an estimate of what we think reinvestment rates are going to look like, and we project down over time. Then obviously, as I mentioned, we also, this time around, given what's happening in the currency market, also needed to take a look at what we're seeing both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. to make some guesstimate about what we think the impact of currency will be. So that's how we do it. We look at our actual maturities and project down. It's sort of a moving target because things change over time. But we have a pretty good idea of what we think the maturity schedule is going to look like. And as you know, we actually published a maturity schedule in our 10-K every year, where we highlight the next few years of what the expected maturities are.

I can tell you what our current new money rates are and maybe you'll get a sense from that. But basically, where we reinvesting today and, obviously, as I've said this before, depends on asset class, but they're all actually pretty -- they lump pretty close together these days. So outside the U.S., I'd say, our current reinvestment rates are about 2.25%. Our reinvestment rates in tax exempt in the U.S. is probably about 2.4% or thereabouts. And our reinvestment rate for our tax book securities in the U.S. is probably around 2.5%. And just to give -- I'll go one step further. So given that, I can try to at least give you some idea of when we think about the maturity schedule and what's maturing over the next, call it, few years on the U.S. tax exempt side, we're probably -- those reinvestment rates will probably be 175 to 200 basis points below our maturing book yields on average over the next few years. For our domestic taxable fixed income maturities, it's probably 75 to 125 basis points. And there is some variability in this because obviously, depending when you bought a security, if you bought something 5 years ago, it may have had a higher coupon at the financial crisis than this period, and that was going to be maturing. And then outside the U.S., it's 25 to 75 basis points."

As you recall, 2013 earnings per share was the best in our history. So great back-to-back performance reflecting superior underwriting execution.
Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3%, the best combined ratio for any quarter in the past 6 years and a 1.2-point improvement over the year early in fourth quarter. The impact of catastrophe losses in the 2014 fourth quarter was 0.8 point compared to 2.1 points in the fourth quarter of 2013. On an x cap basis, our combined ratio was 83.5%, essentially the same as in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Premiums worldwide were up 3% in the quarter or up 4% excluding the impact of currency. As in recent quarters, we saw higher retention levels, continued rate increases and new business.
GAAP book value per share at year end was $70.12, up 8% for the year. Our capital position remains very strong, and we just completed our existing share repurchase program. 
Today we announced a new $1.3 billion buyback program. As you saw in our press release, we have provided 2015 operating income per share guidance of $7.35 to $7.65. And Rick will have more to say about guidance as well as our capital management activities.

In a marketplace that was competitive but still behaving rationally regarding price and terms and condition, Commercial and Specialty both had strong performance in the fourth quarter. This was characterized most importantly by excellent underwriting profitability and by executing our stated plans of emphasizing the retention of our profitable portfolio, while pushing for rate increases on those accounts that still require it. We also leveraged our distinct underwriting and claims advantages to write new business in our targeted niches.
Beginning with CCI. The fourth quarter combined ratio was 88.5% compared to 89% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 89.5% in the third quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 1.8 points of the combined ratio in 2014 and 0.6 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's fourth quarter combined ratio improved to 86.7% into 2014 from 88.4% in the prior year.
Drilling down into the CCI lines, we had another strong performance in the Multiple Peril, where the combined ratio was 85.4% compared to the unusually low 73.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Casualty combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 99.8% compared to the 102.9% we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our Workers' Compensation combined ratio of 80.2% was outstanding, more than an 11-point improvement over the 91.5% that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013 and well below our 10-year average of 88%.
Property and Marine produced a fourth quarter combined ratio of 84.4% compared to 83.1% in the year-ago quarter. In recent conference calls, we told you that in light of rate increases over the past several years we were increasingly focused on retention, while at the same time, taking advantage of better priced new business in market segments we target. This focus is contributing to our positive growth. 
In CCI, fourth quarter net written premiums grew to 5% to $1.3 billion. Workers' Comp grew 16%. But as you would see if you look back at the results in previous quarters, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter-to-quarter due to the presence or absence of a larger premium account. For example, our Workers' Comp growth rate for the third quarter of 2014 was down 1%, while for the full year, we grew the line by 6%, a little less in the 8% we grew it in 2013. 
Notwithstanding these fluctuations, we were able to achieve several points better retention in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, along with a slight increase in rate, and we were able to cross-sell a few large policies to existing customers. 
Overall, retention for CCI in the fourth quarter was 88% in the U.S., high by historical standards and a 1-point improvement over the third quarter. Please note that in our press release, the retention and renewal rate changes for CCI and CSI that are stated to be for our third quarter, are in fact are those for our fourth quarter. We apologize for any inconvenience. A corrected release is in the process of being issued.
Now even with this higher retention, we achieved an overall written renewal rate increase of 2% for the U.S. book. This was the 16th consecutive quarter we obtained rate increase in, and the earned premium impact continues to keep pace with our long-term loss cost trends. 
Outside the US, CCI's average renewal rate increases in the fourth quarter were marginally positive. As we noted last quarter, this successful execution of our rate retention strategy resulted in there being fewer accounts in our portfolio that need substantial rate increases or that need to be culled from the book entirely. Of course, in those instances, where we cannot secure appropriate rates and terms, the culling will persist. 
For prospective new business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise and products and services to target the market segments in which we specialize. In the fourth quarter, we were able to secure new business opportunities that we believe will meet our required return targets in many of these segments. In the U.S., our new-to-lost business ratio was 1.4:1 compared to 1.0:1 in the third quarter of 2014. This improvement reflects the historically high retention rate and some additional new business.
Notwithstanding the continued improvement, new business writings as a percentage of our overall portfolio were still slightly below levels we were writing several years ago. For the full year, CCI's net written premiums increased 2% to $5.4 billion. The combined ratio was 89.9% in 2014 versus 86.5% in 2013. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 3.8 points of the 2014 combined ratio compared to 2.1 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of cats, CCI's combined ratio for the year was 86.1% in 2014 and 84.4% in 2013.
Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance. Our fourth quarter combined ratio was an outstanding 76.7% in 2014 and represented a 5-point improvement compared to 81.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013. And Professional Liability, which represents the majority of our portfolio, the combined ratio was 80.3% compared to 85.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 due mainly to a higher level of favorable development. Our continued strong underwriting results in the quarter stemmed from our disciplined underwriting, which is increasingly informed by our use of advanced analytics, continued culling actions where we don't believe we can achieve our required return and the cumulative effects of rate increases, which on our U.S. book exceeded 20% over the last 3 years.
With respect to growth, CCI's net written premiums in the fourth quarter were $701 million, down about 1%. For the Professional Liability portion of CSI, net written premiums of $628 million were essentially flat on a worldwide basis but up 3% in the U.S. As we have noted in the past, premium growth in Chubb Specialty can vary from quarter-to-quarter in part due to the absence or presence of large premium accounts, and in the fourth quarter we did see fewer good business opportunities outside the U.S. than we did in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, renewal retention for Professional Liability the U.S. remained at a very high 89% level achieved in the third quarter. At the same time, we secured a 4% average renewal rate increase in our U.S. book in line with our long-term loss cost trend. The fourth quarter was the 13th consecutive quarter in which we achieved rate increases in the U.S.
In markets outside the U.S., the average renewal rate change was close to flat. In the U.S., Professional Liability's new-to-lost business ratio in the fourth quarter was 1.3:1, unchanged from the third quarter. This was a function of high retention levels in both quarters and our ability to find quality new business opportunities in our target markets following several years of industry rate increases and underwriting actions.
Turning now to the Surety portion of the Specialty book. The combined ratio of 48.6% in the fourth quarter represented a 5-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 6-point improvement when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net written premiums for Surety were $73 million, down 6%, reflecting the lack of large premium transactions like those booked in the fourth quarter of 2013 for our customers who were performing work on major construction projects. It is not uncommon to experience this variation in work orders, but with the U.S. economy improving, we expect that our Surety customers, who are among the best in their field, should particularly benefit from that growth.
For the full year 2014, CSI's net written premiums increased 2% to $2.7 billion, and the combined ratio was an outstanding 80.5% compared to 84.3% in 2013. Professional Liability premiums increased 3% to $2.4 billion and the combined ratio was 82.2% versus 89.3% in 2013. Surety premiums for 2014 declined 4% to $300 million and the combined ratio was 67.3% versus 47.2% in 2013. Bottom line, we are very pleased with the strategies we implemented and the actions we have taken to improve the profitability of our Specialty business, and we are well positioned to continue to grow profitably over time.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

Catastrophes had only 0.1 percentage point impact on CPI's fourth quarter combined ratio compared to a 5.3 point impact in the fourth quarter of 2013. CPI's x cat combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 83.8% versus 78.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Homeowners’ premiums increased 3% for the quarter. The Homeowners combined ratio was 76.5% compared to 75.8% in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Catastrophes had a 0.1 percentage point impact on the Homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 8.5 percentage points in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Excluding catastrophes, the Homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 76.4% versus 67.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. As you might recall, we pointed out last year at this time that the 76.3% x cat combined ratio for Homeowners was an unusually good result. The average Homeowners renewal premium increased total 6% in the U.S. compared to 7% in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, net written premiums for Personal Auto grew 4%. The Personal Auto combined ratio was 95.2% compared to 93.9% in the corresponding quarter of 2013. CPI policy retention in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 89% for both Homeowners and Personal Auto. Homeowners’ policy retention was down slightly while Personal Auto was unchanged from the third quarter of 2014.
In Other Personal, which includes our Accident, Personal Excess Liability and Yacht lines, we had strong growth of 6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the combined ratio was 95.1% compared to 96.8% in the corresponding quarter of 2013.
Looking now at our full year results, CPI's net written premiums increased 4% to $4.5 billion. CPI produced a combined ratio of 90.9% including 5.5 percentage points of catastrophe losses compared to a combined ratio of 87% for 2013, including a 7.2-point impact from catastrophes. Excluding catastrophes, CPI's combined ratio for the full year was 85.4% in 2014 versus 79.8% for 2013. 
For all of 2014, Homeowners premiums increased by 4% to $2.8 billion. The Homeowners combined ratio was 88.3% including an 8.9 percentage point impact from catastrophes. Compared to a combined ratio of 82.3% in 2013, including an 11.5-point impact from catastrophes. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the Homeowners combined ratio for the full year was 79.4% in 2014 versus 70.8% in 2013. 
Personal Auto premiums increased 1% in 2014 to $740 million and the combined ratio was 96.8% compared to 94.8% in 2013. 
Other Personal lines premiums increased 8% for the full year to $1 billion and the combined ratio was 94% versus 94.8% in 2013. 
Turning now to claims for Chubb overall. It was a fairly benign quarter from a loss perspective. On an x cat basis, new revised claim counts increased only 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, which is in line with our premium growth.
Regarding catastrophes, their impact in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 0.8 percentage points of the combined ratio or $25 million before tax. This includes $35 million of favorable development from cat events earlier in 2014, which was partially offset by $11 million of unfavorable development from cat events in 2013 and prior years.
Losses from catastrophe events that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 totaled $49 million and were dominated by 2 hail and windstorms, one in Brisbane, Australia and then another that impacted Texas and Kansas. The impact of catastrophes for the full year 2014 was 3.6 percentage points or $444 million before tax, reflecting $11 million of unfavorable development from events that occurred in 2013 and prior years.
And now I will turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail."
261037,280141000,752788,"The Chubb Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul. Looking first at our operating results. We had strong underwriting income of $477 million in the quarter. For the full year, underwriting income was $1.4 billion. Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3% compared to 85.5% in the s",1395,"Thanks, Paul. Looking first at our operating results. We had strong underwriting income of $477 million in the quarter. For the full year, underwriting income was $1.4 billion. Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3% compared to 85.5% in the same quarter a year earlier. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 30.5% in 2014 versus 30.8% in 2013. For the full year, our combined ratio was 88.3% in 2014 compared to 86.1% in 2013, and our expense ratio for the full year was 31.4% in 2014 and 31.9% in 2013. Please note that over the past few years, our expense ratio in the fourth quarter has been lower than for other quarters in the full year due to seasonality. The expense ratio varies from quarter-to-quarter due to mix of business and other variables.
Property & Casualty investment income after-tax was down 6% in the fourth quarter to $267 million, due once again to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed maturity portfolios and to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign currency translation. 
Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $18 million or $0.06 per share after-tax, including a $0.01 per share loss from alternative investments. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $67 million or $0.17 per share after-tax, including a gain of $0.09 per share from alternative investment.
Unrealized depreciation before tax at December 31, 2014 was $2.7 billion. For comparison at year end 2013, unrealized depreciation before tax was $1.9 billion. The increase in unrealized depreciation in 2014 largely reflects the decrease in interest rates and the increase in equity markets that occurred during the year. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4 years and the average credit rating is AA3.
We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At December 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investments, including approximately $585 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at December 31, 2014 was $70.12 compared to $64.83 at year end 2013, an increase of 8%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $65.03 compared to $61.86 at 2013 year end, an increase of 5%.
With regard to book value, as you may know, companies like Chubb that have defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plan are required to prepare an annual revaluation of the plan's assets and benefit liabilities. As a result of our revaluation at the end of 2014, the estimate of our plan's liabilities increased and our change in book value for the fourth quarter was adversely impacted by approximately $350 million after tax. 
The increase in our plan's liabilities was primarily due to the decrease in our discount rate assumption that resulted from the decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year-end rate and to a lesser extent, a change in our mortality assumption. The change in our mortality assumption reflects the impact of the October 2014 revision of the Society of Actuaries mortality tables, which many companies, including Chubb, take into account the measurement of their benefit plan liabilities.
In addition, the change in book value during the quarter was negatively affected by that $75 million due to the impact of foreign currency translation. 
As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2014 on prior year reserves by SBU, as follows: In CPI, we had about $15 million, CCI had about $50 million, CSI had about $90 million and the runoff reinsurance assumed business had none, bringing our total favorable development to about $155 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 5 points overall, including an adverse impact from prior year catastrophes of $11 million. 
For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had about $115 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $25 million in CPI, $35 million in CCI, $55 million in CSI, and none in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2013 was about 4 points overall, including a favorable impact from prior-year catastrophes of $6 million.
Favorable development for the full year 2014 totaled about $635 million. It had a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 5 points, compared to $710 million in 2013 and a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 6 points.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 88.8% compared to 87% in last year's fourth quarter. And for the full year 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 90% compared to 88.4% in 2013.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, our loss reserves decreased by $350 million, including a decrease of $344 million for the insurance business and a decrease with $6 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall decrease in reserves reflects the decrease of $53 million related to catastrophes. The impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $155 million.
Turning now to capital management. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $346 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $100.58 per share. For the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion and an average cost of $92.05 per share. As of December 31, 2014, there was approximately $52 million remaining under our January 2014 repurchase program, which we completed this month.
As we announced today, our Board of Directors have authorized a new $1.3 billion share repurchase program. The size of the share buyback program is essentially in line with the 2015 operating income reflected in our guidance less shareholder dividend. We intend to complete this program by the end of January 2016, subject to market conditions and other factors.
Finally, let me make a few additional comments regarding our guidance. We expect operating income per share for 2015 to be in the range of $7.35 to $7.65 with a midpoint of $7.50.
Before reviewing the key assumptions underlying our 2015 operating income per share guidance, I would like to highlight a couple of external factors that will impact our financial results this year. First, interest rates have continued to decline on a global basis, which will once again put pressure on investment income. In addition, the impact of lower interest rates on our discount assumption will increase our pension and post-retirement benefits cost in 2015, which will be reflected in slightly higher expense ratio for the full year compared to the 31.4% expense ratio in 2014. 
Second, since roughly 1/4 of our business is generated outside the United States, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies will have a negative impact on both premium growth and investment income. As we said in our press release, we are assuming for the full year a negative 2 percentage point impact of foreign currency translation on written premium growth and a negative 1 percentage point impact on the growth of Property & Casualty investment income after-tax.
Our operating income per share guidance assumes the full year 2015, an increase of 1% to 3% in net written premium or 3% to 5% excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, a combined ratio of 89% to 90%, a decline of 6% to 8% in Property & Casualty investment income after taxes or 5% to 7% -- down 5% to 7% excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation. And our guidance assumes $230 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance also assumes 4 percentage points of catastrophe losses in line with our median annual catastrophe impact over the last 10 years. In terms of sensitivity, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on 2015 operating income per share is approximately $0.36.

We generate annualized GAAP ROE of 13.6% and annualized operating ROE of 14.8%. These fourth quarter results capped off a terrific year in which we achieved excellent operating and net income per share. Renewal rates improved in all 3 SBUs with average U.S. rate increases for the full year of 3% for Standard Commercial, 5% for Professional Liability and we also achieved average U.S. renewal increases of 6% for Personal lines.
The growing rate adequacy of our overall book has increased our focus on retaining more of our profitable portfolio, as evidenced by our higher renewal retention rates. And in the light of broader industry rate increases in the last few years, we're able to secure some additional new business that was attractively priced within the market segment we targeted.
We continued to actively manage our capital in 2014 by returning more than $2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our ongoing commitment to capital management is demonstrated by the new $1.3 billion share repurchase program we announced today.
As you can tell from our 2015 guidance, we're expecting another overall strong year despite the dual headwinds of continued low interest rates and the strong dollar.
And with that, I'll open the lines to your questions."

So we're expecting next year that x currency premium growth will be consistent with our 2014 growth, and we believe that it's reasonable based on the current market environment. In terms of assumptions, I'm not -- I can't go through each of the individual pieces, but obviously, retention is strong. You heard the commentary on rates of what we're seeing in the near term. And then there's some new business, of course, as well. And I'd highlight also, if you think about the relationship between growth -- premium growth and renewal rate increases, they're not necessarily correlated. So for example, if you look back in 2013, we actually had lower x currency premium growth of 3%. But average renewal rates were actually higher than they were in 2014. So hopefully that gives you some idea of what we're thinking."

I mean, a variety of things can happen, obviously. It depends on some degree where rates do go. But when you look at the 2015 accident year, let's start with what most of the analysts talk about as margin expansion, meaning earn rate versus long-term loss cost trends. Remember that the 2015 accident year is based on earn rate, which means it's 50% driven by rate increases in year 2014 and 50% by rate increases in the year 2015. In the year 2014, our rate increases exceeded loss cost trends and even our shorter-term loss cost. So we're going with some headwind, 1 point or 2, from 2014, plus 50% of 2015 accident year. Tailwind, not a headwind -- tailwind. No wonder why I can't fly a plane. Now as we move in towards 2015, right now, our earn rate is still a little bit in excess of our loss cost trends in the fourth quarter, but our written rate is about neutral to loss cost trends. I don't know where rate is going, but I expect as we run a variety of scenarios, it's more biased than the scenarios to rate increases not being as high as they currently are. But there could be some pressure on margins related to the 50% of accident year performance related to 2015. But then you've got to combine that with the 2014 tailwind, and it's hard to call whether you're going to have to see overall for the 2015 accident year contraction or margin expansion. Then the second thing is that, we've talked about this ad nauseam in the past, is that margin expansion analysis, even if correct, doesn't necessarily correlate to the year-over-year movement in combined ratios. The other big factor is how do actual losses compare to loss cost trends? And as we saw this year, our actual losses were, especially in the Property line, or I'd say Homeowners, were significantly higher than what we've experienced in recent years. And we'd hope to see some reversion to the mean in that line of business. Now there's no guarantee that you can't be higher than the mean 2 years in a row. So we're conservative when we look at that. But again, we're hoping for some reversions to the mean than actual losses. In some of the lines, we had unfavorable experience in this year, which were largely related to luck factors such as fire and non-cat weather."

Loss cost trends are used by different firms in different ways. What it doesn't take into account is the impact of proactive underwriting initiatives.

Overseas, the growth has been hurt overseas by rates directly and also because of the lack of increase in the rates has made new opportunities less attractive. We still look at overseas as an area which should grow somewhat better than the U.S., constant exchange and similar rate increases. But we've also suffered over the last for years of an economic downturn in Europe, from Brazil turning down.

And our reinvestment rate for our tax book securities in the U.S. is probably around 2.5%. And just to give -- I'll go one step further. So given that, I can try to at least give you some idea of when we think about the maturity schedule and what's maturing over the next, call it, few years on the U.S. tax exempt side, we're probably -- those reinvestment rates will probably be 175 to 200 basis points below our maturing book yields on average over the next few years. For our domestic taxable fixed income maturities, it's probably 75 to 125 basis points. And there is some variability in this because obviously, depending when you bought a security, if you bought something 5 years ago, it may have had a higher coupon at the financial crisis than this period, and that was going to be maturing.

Clearly, with the broadening appetite in capacity and some of the lower pricing that you're referring to, you're going to get individual situations where we're able now to get into an account that required larger limits of insurance than we would be comfortable with. So today's facultative reinsurance dynamics helps us support those larger limits while we still effectively manage our overall net exposure. Now occasionally, we've also used cat reinsurance where maybe one of our insurers has moved to an area and expanded, the area where it -- they have -- there's too much catastrophe exposure there for us, and we can use some of the facultative reinsurance to cover us there. In this way, we get to be able to keep that account. So on individual account level, we're clearly taking advantage of the facultative reinsurance marketplace. But as Ricky and John point out, we don't see it as any -- influencing, any wholesale change in our underwriting strategy."

These were achieve even with the adverse impact of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses, primarily in the homeowners line, spending from the harsh winter in the United States. 
The market remains relatively stable and we were pleased that we're able to secure rate increases while again achieving strong renewal retention in all 3 of our business units. Operating income per share was $1.57, a 5% increase over the $1.50 over last year's first quarter. The effective catastrophes were $0.69 per share in this year's first quarter compared to $0.52 per share last year. Annualized operating ROE was 10.2% for the first quarter of this year. The combined ratio for the first quarter was 93.9% this year compared to 93.2% last year. Excluding the impact of cats, the combined ratio for the first quarter improved to 85.8% in 2015 from 86.6% a year ago. Net written premiums which grew 1% were negatively affected by currency. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, premiums were up 4%. First quarter net income per share was $1.60 resulting in an annualized ROE of 9.2%.
Cat book value per share at March 31 were $70.33, up slightly from year-end 2014, and a 6% increase since March 31 a year ago. Our capital position is excellent. We continue to actively repurchase our shares. In addition, during the first one, we increased our common stock dividend by 14% to $2.28 per share on an annualized basis. It's Chubb's 33rd consecutive annual dividend increase is a consistent financial performance and financial strength. And now I'll turn it over to Dino."

In a marketplace that while competitive remains relatively stable with regard to pricing terms and condition, CCI and CPI both have strong performance in the first quarter. Each unit produced solid underwriting profitability and continue to execute our business plan, which emphasizes the retention of our profitable portfolio, while seeking rate increases on those accounts that still require them. We also leverage our distinct underwriting and claims service to write new business in our targeted niche markets. 
Beginning with CCI, the first quarter combined ratio was 90.8 compared to 88.5 in the first quarter of 2014. The first quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 3.4 points of the combined ratio in 2015 and 6.1 points in 2014. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's combined ratio in the first quarter of 2015 was 87.4 compared to 82.4 in the first quarter of 2014. A 5-point increase was almost all due to a reduction in the amount of favorable prior-year reserve development in CCI, which in turn was mainly driven by a swing from favorable development in the year-ago quarter to modestly adverse development in this year's first quarter in the Commercial Property lines, including Multiple Peril Property. CCI's x cat accident year combined ratio remains very strong at virtually the same level as in the first quarter a year ago.
Drilling down into the CCI lines, the all up Multiple Peril combined ratio was 96.9 compared to 91.8 in the first quarter of 2014 with a similar impact of catastrophes in both periods. Property Marine produced a combined ratio of 89 in the first quarter of this year and 89.1 in the same period last year with a lower impact of cats this year. The cash flow for the combined ratio for the first quarter of 2015 was 93.7, which was higher than the 89.7 we reported for the first quarter last year, but was more in line with our full year results for Casualty last year. And our Workers' Compensation combined ratio continue to be outstanding at 84.1, essentially unchanged from 84 that we posted reported in the first quarter of 2014. 
In recent conference call, we reported to you that the rate of rate increases we have secured for the past several years, we were increasingly focused on retention, while at the same time, taking advantage of better price new business in the market segments we target. This focus is contributing to a positive growth. In CCI, first quarter net written premiums grew 2% to $1.4 billion. Growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation was about 5%.
The Multiple Peril and Property Marine lines grew at 3% and 1%, respectively, despite the drag from currency. In Workers' Comp, which is largely a U.S. business, growth was a strong 11%. But as we have pointed out in the past, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter-to-quarter due to the presence or absence of a few larger premium accounts. Lastly, in Casualty net written premiums declined 5%, largely due to the adverse impact of foreign currency translation to a slightly higher than the impact on our overall CCI business due to casualties' higher percentage of business outside the United States in the first quarter.
Overall, renewal retention for CCI in the first quarter was 87% in the U.S. This is in line with our last 3 quarters and high by historical standards. Even with this high retention, we were able to achieve on average written renewal rate increase of 1% for the U.S. book. This was the 16th consecutive quarter in which CCI secured rate increases amounting to 3 years of rate-on-rate. Outside the U.S., CCI's average renewal rate increases in the first quarter were flat to slightly positive.
With respect to the business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise in products and services to target the market segments in which we specialize. In the first quarter, in the U.S., our new business ratio was 1.4 to 1 equal to the ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014. This reflects the high retention rate and solid new business writings that we believe will meet our performance targets. Indeed, the vast majority of our new business was written for customers within our proven niche markets. Because we focus almost entirely on this target market segments, where we offer value added products and services as well as unique expertise, winning the business is not exclusively a price-driven transaction but in turn, it also generates strong profit margins over time.
Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance, we experience another very strong quarter with a combined ratio of 81.9. This is a 7-point improvement over the first quarter of last year. Professional Liability, which represents the majority of the CFI portfolio, our combined ratio of 85.2 in the first quarter was similar to the 84.6 combined ratio in the first quarter of last year. The continued strong underwriting profitability of our Professional Liability business is a product that our disciplined underwriting, skillful management of the portfolio business mix and calling actions informed use of advanced analytics and predictive modeling. Of course, the compound effect of the rate increases on our U.S. book, which have exceeded 25% since January 2012, also contributed to our excellent combined ratio. 
With respect to growth, Chubb Specialty Insurance net written premiums in the first quarter were flat at $621 million. Growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation of about 4%. Net written premiums of the Professional Liability portion of CSI were e down 1% to $545 million, reflecting growth in the United States and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation on our business outside the U.S.
In the first quarter, we secured average renewal rate increases of 4% for Professional Liability in the U.S., just as we did in the fourth quarter of last year. The first quarter was the 14th consecutive quarter that we achieved Professional Liability rate increases in the U.S. Despite our pressing for rate increases, we achieved strong renewal retention of 87% for that book. 
In markets outside the U.S., average renewal rates continued to be flat. In terms of new business, Professional Liability had another good quarter in the U.S. with a new to loss ratio 1.2: 1. As was the case with CCI, our strong underwriting expertise in value-added services enabled us to find better quality opportunities in our target markets following several great years of rate increases and underwriting actions.
Turning now to the Surety portion of the Specialty book. The combined ratio of 54.8 in the first quarter represented a significant improvement over the 2014 first quarter's combined ratio of 122.9, which was adversely impacted by a single large loss. Net written premiums of $76 million were up 6%.
Bottom line for our CSA business overall, we are very pleased with the strategies we have implemented and we are well positioned to continue to grow profitably over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul to review our personal insurance operation and corporate-wide claim results."

CPI produced a combined ratio of 105.1 in the first quarter 20",584,"Thanks, Dino. Chubb personal insurance net written premiums increased 2% to $1 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was about 5%. CPI produced a combined ratio of 105.1 in the first quarter 2015 compared to 101.8 in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI's first quarter combined ratio was 18.4 points compared to 11.2 points in the first quarter of 2014. On an x cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 86.7 in the first quarter of 2015, nearly a 4-point improvement compared to 90.6% in the first quarter a year ago.
For our homeowners line, premiums grew 1% and the combined ratio was 112.7 compared to 104.9 in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 30 points of the homeowners' combined ratio in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 17.9 points in the first quarter of last year. There were 9 U.S. winter storm catastrophe events in the first quarter which affected 29 states in the District of Columbia. The majority of our losses were from burst pipes and ice damming, most of which occurred in February. While the damage was widespread across much of the Eastern section of the United States, our New York and New England customers were the most affected. 
Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the 2015 first quarter homeowners combined ratio was 82.7, a 4.3-point improvement compared to 87 in the same period a year ago. Most of the improvement is attributable to the fact that fire losses this year were in line with our 5- and 10-year averages, whereas in the first quarter a year ago, fire losses were considerably higher than average. Not surprisingly, the impact of non-cat weather-related losses in the first quarter of 2015 was elevated compared to a typical first quarter. However, it was slightly lower than the first quarter a year ago.
During the first quarter of 2015, we achieved an average homeowners renewal rate and exposure increase of 5% in the United States compared to 6% in the fourth quarter of last year. For our Personal Auto line, net written premiums grew 2% in the first quarter of 2015. The combined ratio was 92.9 compared to an unusually high 101.4 in the corresponding quarter of 2014. U.S. renewal policy retention in the first quarter of 2015 was a very strong 89% for both homeowners and Personal Auto, identical to the fourth quarter of 2014.
Net written premiums for other personal, which includes our accident, personal excess liability and yacht lines, grew 5% in the first quarter. The combined ratio for other personal was 92.3 in the first quarter, consistent with a combined ratio of 92.4 in the first quarter a year ago.
Turning now to first quarter claims corporate-wide. As we announced on April 7, we had catastrophe losses of $250 million before tax or 8.1 points on the combined ratio compared to $199 million or 6.6 points in the first quarter of 2014. The $250 million in this year's first quarter reflected about $264 million from 2015 cat events, almost entirely from the ones in the United States. Slightly offset by a $14 million decrease in our estimated losses from catastrophes which occurred in prior years. In the first quarter this year, roughly 80% of the total catastrophe losses were attributable to CPI and 20% to CCI. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail."

As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter and I will also provide an update on the April 1 renewal of our major property reinsurance program. Looking first at our operating results, underwriting income was $205 mill",945,"Thank you, Paul. As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter and I will also provide an update on the April 1 renewal of our major property reinsurance program. 
Looking first at our operating results, underwriting income was $205 million in the quarter. Property and Casualty investment income after tax was down 5% to $264 million, due once again to lower reinvestment rate in our fixed maturity portfolios and to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign currency translation. Net income was slightly higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $11 million or $0.03 per share after-tax, including $0.03 per share from alternative investments. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2014, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $116 million or $0.30 per share after-tax, including $0.14 per share from alternative investments. Unrealized depreciation before tax at March 31 was $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion at year-end 2014. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of March 31, 2015. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4.1 years and the average credit rating is AA grade. 
We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At March 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investment, including approximately $470 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at March 31 was $70.33 compared to $70.12 at year-end 2014. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized costs were $64.75 compared to $65.03 at 2014 year-end. the change in book value per share and the change in adjusted book value per share for the first quarter 2015 both reflected an adverse impact of approximately $0.77 due to foreign currency translation.
As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2015 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CCI, we had approximately $5 million; CCI, had $35 million; CSI had $70 million; and reinsurance assumed had none, bringing our total favorable development to approximately $110 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of about 3.5 points overall including a favorable impact of prior year catastrophes of $14 million. For comparison, in the first quarter 2014, we had about $160 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $5 million in CPI, $90 million in CCI, $65 million in CSI and none in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2014 was about 5.5 points, including a favorable impact of prior year catastrophes of $7 million. For the first quarter 2015, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 88.9 compared to 91.7 in last year's first quarter an improvement of 2.8 points. During the first quarter, our loss reserves decreased by $107 million. The impact of foreign currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $370 million and the effect of cats was increased reserves by $184 million.
Turning to capital management. We repurchased 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $326 million during the quarter. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $100.77 per share. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1 billion available for share repurchases under our current authorization. And as we've said on our last earnings call, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2016. In addition, as John mentioned, our board raised the quarterly common stock dividend in February by 14% to $0.50 -- $0.57 per share or $2.28 on an annual basis. 
I would now like to say a few words about our reinsurance program. On April 1, we renewed our major Property treaties, including our North American cat treaty, our non-U.S. cat treaty and our Commercial Property for risk treaty. We renewed these programs with a similar limit structure to what we had in 2014, but with expanded coverage and improved terms and condition. The reinsurance market was orderly and there was plenty of capacity meet our needs in each treaty. As you might expect, we're in a attractively seated [ph] We achieved meaningful savings on all 3 treaties again this year, with double-digit price decreases on our 2 major catastrophe treaties, as well as a high single-digit price decrease on the Commercial Property for risk treaty. 
In addition, in March, we successfully completed our seventh catastrophe bond offering to replace the maturing cat line. The transaction was very well received by the market and this enabled us to replace the existing limit of $250 million and expand the perils covered relative to the expiring arrangement at attractive pricing. Under this new arrangement, we purchased fully collateralized 5-year coverage to supplement our reinsurance program for our Commercial and Personal Property exposures in the Northeast United States, running from Virginia to Maine. In terms of pricing, the coupon of the new cap bond is approximately 45% lower than the maturing bond. 
Similar to our previous cat bonds, we had that indemnity based trigger, which means that our right to correct is based on actual incurred losses as opposed to industry or index-based losses. We like the diversification of these cat bond arrangements with our overall reinsurance program, especially in our peak zones. Importantly, they provide us with a cost-effective, fully-collateralized alternative to traditional reinsurance with price locked in for several years. 
And now I'll turn it back to John."

Professional Liability was 4% in the U.S. Personal lines was 5% in the U.S. So you when you look at it and if you look now for 2015 accident year, you're obviously also getting a benefit of the lag impact of rent premium based on written premium that was higher in 2014, right? So if you look at the 2015 accident year, and then you look at loss trends, which you properly stated, 3% to 4% -- 4%, 3% of long term, we've made a point of saying that still the macroeconomic will take you tack on the underwriting action, we believe 2 to 3 points, let's say 3 points is a reasonable action. So if you look at that, I'd say all of our businesses, in the U.S., will really probably on unearned premium basis in 2015 accident year, a little bit margin neutral to slightly margin profit positive. We CCI, the what you alluded to be a margin negative to some degree, but even CCI at current rates will have 2 point premiums so it will only slightly negative. Professional Liability, being slightly positive in the U.S. and personal lines, being 1 point or 2 point positive and it's a couple of points positive. So obviously, the challenge is in CCI, but right now, it's not a terrible place to be. But overall, from an overall book, 2015 accident year, it's not necessarily implied margin contraction, could be margin neutral to slightly positive at today's rates in the U.S., now you obviously had to have the assumption the rates are going and that could change it. Although again, you basically 5 quarters and after 2013 accident year rate."

First off, yes, we're all anxious to make enough to get that yacht, and hopefully get there soon. But I would start off by just level setting. There is a lot of energy around the high net worth space, amongst the small handful of competitors here, especially in the United States. And I think what exciting people about is there is a real opportunity to differentiate and to also take market share from regional carriers and from the direct writers. I would estimate that about 80% of the high net worth space is this large direct writer's and regional carriers, often times just by default. Somebody comes out of business school and ends up being with a buddy from high school who's a local agent, and they tend to stay there for 10 or 15, 20 years and they really don't know what an independent ratio can bring to the party and what Chubb personal lines can bring to the party. So one of the tricks in the energy around us is to have certain campaigns there trying to fuel people out of the direct writer market. Another is to make certain that we're working very closely with our agents to educate them, so they speak the language of the high net worth and the ultrahigh net worth people. We're obviously adding to our products as well so that we can service them. Clearly, our international network gives us a huge advantage when it comes to the ultra high net worth. Because as we all know, they have their homes and they park there yet in exotic place and that type of thing. Clearly, the fine art market is another thing. The art schedules are absolutely staggering for a lot of these families and we have the ability to put together hundreds of millions of dollars in art coverage on a single phone call. So we have deep expertise when it comes to appraisal, to preservation. just for example, we have I think 17 fine art specialists around the globe that are working on just helping with our customers preserve those fine art and that type of thing. So a lot of it is around products, a lot of it is around service, but we're working very hard to make certain that our independent agents have the ability to really sell to these families and the know-how to go out and try them out of channels that they're currently not tapping into."

That proved generally you wrong, although we've had some incremental development say 1.5 points from 2010 to 2014 but that's 6.5 to 5 is pretty darn good. So pretty robust, and I think it's benefiting us in a surprising aspect of the overall reserve development because that's actually been up significantly and it's been sustained at such strong level. And you're right, the first quarter was 3.5 points. And if we can move around quite a bit significant individual quarter but it's a significant trend. So give you an example -- 2 examples. The government was curious about the about the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2010 were $100 million to $115 million, very similar to what we have experienced in the first quarter. The same concern could have been raised for both periods. As it turns out development rebounded sharply in the the ensuing quarters. So in retrospect these less favorable development quarters turned out to be blips rather than the tipping point in the level of development. So I can't say whether or not this also true with the development in the balance of 2015. In the end, our reserves over time is function of actually loss experienced which is obviously different to predict.

And that's sort of the overall philosophy. It wasn't the stock price that drove the size of our share repurchase. We have a philosophy that we've articulated over the last few years that our intent, obviously, market conditions and other things all being equal, that our share buyback in essence be in line with our earnings less shareholder dividend, and that's how we came up with the size of the program. We do believe that we have a very strong excess capital position. We do -- we think very -- we think a lot about our deployment of capital and what's the right amount, and we think about all the different types of capital deployment strategies. We're very comfortable with our share repurchase. In years past, if you've looked at what we've done, we've had more opportunity from a valuation or others, we might do something slightly larger us than our earnings less dividends. So we're very careful about how we manage it and we're very aware of being good stewards of our capital for our shareholders. So we do think about all the different options. I'm not going to comment on which ones we may or may not think about in the future. I also point out, as John mentioned, we've increased our common dividend for the last 33 years, which is another piece of how we manage our capital position. So again, in sum, we feel very good about where we are and the way we approach this, and nothing really different than what we've been doing over a number of years."

I would think that in the second and third quarters -- remember, most of the currency movement that has happened started in the fourth quarter of last year and continued then into the first quarter of this year. So all other things being equal, currency stays where it was at the end of March then you will still see an impact on growth in certainly the second and third quarters. And I'm not saying whether it will be similar to what we have in the first quarter, I don't know, but certainly there will be an impact. And the guidance that we put in January, we did say that we expect a full impact for the full year, so maybe that can give you some help there as well. As John mentioned, from an earnings perspective, it doesn't have a very large impact on the quarterly basis, a couple of cents a share in the first quarter. Bear in mind, when you think about the investment income piece, a large part of our after-tax investment income comes from the municipal bond portfolio here in the U.S., so it's a slightly disproportionate impact on investment income in the U.S. Last point I'd make on book value is again, if currencies don't change from where they were at the end of March, which is a pretty big assumption, the impact on book value will probably be meaningfully less in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. It won't be 0 because we have some of our foreign operations that report on a one quarter lag, which we highlighted in our 10-K, so there will be an impact but it shouldn't be nearly as large as it was in the first quarter. Hopefully, that gives you some help."

As we said in our press release, Chubb produced solid financial results in the first quarter of 2015. These were achieved even with the adverse impact of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses, primarily in the Homeowners line, stemming from the harsh winter in the United States.
The market remained relatively stable, and we were pleased that we're able to secure rate increases while again achieving strong renewal retention in all 3 of our business units. Operating income per share was $1.57, a 5% increase over the $1.50 in last year's first quarter. The effect of catastrophes were $0.69 per share in this year's first quarter compared to $0.52 per share in last year's. Annualized operating ROE was 10.2% for the first quarter of this year. The combined ratio for the first quarter was 93.9% this year compared to 93.2% last year. Excluding the impact of cats, the combined ratio for the first quarter improved to 85.8% in 2015 from 86.6% a year ago. Net written premiums, which grew 1%, were negatively affected by currency. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, premiums were up 4%. First quarter net income per share was $1.60 resulting in an annualized ROE of 9.2%.
Cat book value per share at March 31 was $70.33, up slightly from year-end 2014 and a 6% increase since March 31 a year ago. Our capital position is excellent. We continue to actively repurchase our shares. In addition, during the first quarter, we increased our common stock dividend by 14% to $2.28 per share on an annualized basis. It was Chubb's 33rd consecutive annual dividend increase, a continued indication of our consistent performance and financial strength.
And now I'll turn it over to Dino."

The first quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 3.4 points of the combined ratio in 2015 and 6.1 points in 2014. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's combined ratio in the first quarter of 2015 was 87.4% compared to 82.4% in the first quarter of 2014. This 5-point increase was almost all due to a reduction in the amount of favorable prior year reserve development in CCI, which, in turn, was mainly driven by a swing from favorable development in the year-ago quarter to modestly adverse development in this year's first quarter in the commercial property lines, including Multiple Peril Property. CCI's x-cat accident year combined ratio remained very strong at virtually the same level as in the first quarter a year ago.
Drilling down into the CCI lines, the all-up Multiple Peril combined ratio was 96.9% compared to 91.8% in the first quarter of 2014 with a similar impact of catastrophes in both periods. Property and Marine produced a combined ratio of 89% in the first quarter of this year and 89.1% in the same period last year with a lower impact of cats this year. The Casualty combined ratio for the first quarter of 2015 was 93.7%, which was higher than the 89.7% we reported for the first quarter last year but was more in line with our full year results for Casualty last year. And our Workers' Compensation combined ratio continued to be outstanding at 84.1%, essentially unchanged from the 84% that we posted in the first quarter of 2014.
In recent conference calls, we reported to you that in light of the rate increases we have secured for the past several years, we were increasingly focused on retention while at the same time, taking advantage of better-priced new business in the market segments we target. This focus is contributing to our positive growth. In CCI, first quarter net written premiums grew 2% to $1.4 billion. Growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was about 5%.
The Multiple Peril and Property and Marine lines grew at 3% and 1%, respectively, despite the drag from currency. In Workers' Comp, which is largely a U.S. business, growth was a strong 11%, but as we have pointed out in the past, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter-to-quarter due to the presence or absence of a few larger premium accounts. Lastly, in Casualty, net written premiums declined 5% largely due to the adverse impact of foreign currency translation to a slightly higher than the impact on our overall CCI business due to Casualty's higher percentage of business outside the United States in the first quarter.
Overall, renewal retention for CCI in the first quarter was 87% in the U.S. This is in line with our last 3 quarters and high by historical standards. Even with this high retention, we were able to achieve an average written renewal rate increase of 1% for the U.S. book. This was the 16th consecutive quarter in which CCI secured rate increases amounting to 3 years of rate on rate. Outside the U.S., CCI's average renewal rate increases in the first quarter were flat to slightly positive.
With respect to new business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise in products and services to target the market segments in which we specialize. In the first quarter, in the U.S., our new to lost business ratio was 1.4:1, equal to the ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014. This reflects the high retention rate and solid new business writings that we believe will meet our performance targets. Indeed, the vast majority of our new business was written for customers within our proven niche markets. Because we focus almost entirely on those target market segments, where we offer value-added products and services as well as unique expertise, winning the business is not exclusively a price-driven transaction, which in turn, helps us generate strong profit margins over time.
Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance, we experienced another very strong quarter with a combined ratio of 81.9%. This is a 7-point improvement over the first quarter of last year. Professional Liability, which represents the majority of the CSI portfolio, our combined ratio of 85.2% in the first quarter was similar to the 84.6% combined ratio in the first quarter of last year. The continued strong underwriting profitability of our Professional Liability business is a product of our disciplined underwriting, skillful management of the portfolio's business mix and calling actions informed by use of advanced analytics and predictive modeling. Of course, the compound effect of the rate increases on our U.S. book, which have exceeded 25% since January 2012, also contributed to our excellent combined ratio.
With respect to growth, Chubb Specialty Insurance net written premiums in the first quarter were flat at $621 million. Growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was about 4%. Net written premiums of the Professional Liability portion of CSI were down 1% to $545 million, reflecting growth in the United States and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation on our business outside the U.S.
In the first quarter, we secured average renewal rate increases of 4% for Professional Liability in the U.S. just as we did in the fourth quarter of last year. The first quarter was the 14th consecutive quarter that we achieved Professional Liability rate increases in the U.S. Despite our pressing for rate increases, we achieved strong renewal retention of 87% for that book. In markets outside the U.S., average renewal rates continued to be flat.
In terms of new business, Professional Liability had another good quarter in the U.S. with a new to loss ratio 1.2:1. As was the case with CCI, our strong underwriting expertise in value-added services enabled us to find better quality opportunities in our target markets following several great years of rate increases and underwriting actions.
Turning now to the Surety portion of the Specialty book. The combined ratio of 54.8% in the first quarter represented a significant improvement over the 2014 first quarter's combined ratio of 122.9%, which was adversely impacted by a single large loss. Net written premiums of $76 million were up 6%.
Bottom line, for our CSI business overall, we are very pleased with the strategies we have implemented, and we are well positioned to continue to grow profitably over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul, who will review our Personal Insurance operation and corporate-wide claim results."

Growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was about 5%. CPI produced a combined ratio of 105.1% in the first quarter of  2015 compared to 101.8% in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI's first quarter combined ratio was 18.4 points compared to 11.2 points in the first quarter of 2014. On an x-cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 86.7% in the first quarter of 2015, nearly a 4-point improvement compared to 90.6% in the first quarter a year ago.
For our Homeowners line, premiums grew 1%, and the combined ratio was 112.7% compared to 104.9% in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 30 points of the Homeowners combined ratio in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 17.9 points in the first quarter of last year. There were 9 U.S. winter storm catastrophe events in the first quarter, which affected 29 states in the District of Columbia. The majority of our losses were from burst pipes and ice damming, most of which occurred in February. While the damage was widespread across much of the eastern section of the United States, our New York and New England customers were the most affected.
Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the 2015 first quarter Homeowners combined ratio was 82.7%, a 4.3-point improvement compared to 87% in the same period a year ago. Most of the improvement is attributable to the fact that fire losses this year were in line with our 5- and 10-year averages. Whereas in the first quarter a year ago, fire losses were considerably higher than average. Not surprisingly, the impact of non-cat weather-related losses in the first quarter of 2015 was elevated compared to a typical first quarter. However, it was slightly lower than the first quarter a year ago. During the first quarter of 2015, we achieved an average Homeowners renewal rate and exposure increase of 5% in the United States compared to 6% in the fourth quarter of last year.
For our Personal Auto line, net written premiums grew 2% in the first quarter of 2015. The combined ratio was 92.9% compared to an unusually high 101.4% in the corresponding quarter of 2014. U.S. renewal policy retention in the first quarter of 2015 was a very strong 89% for both Homeowners and Personal Auto, identical to the fourth quarter of 2014.
Net written premiums for Other Personal, which includes our accident, personal excess liability and yacht lines, grew 5% in the first quarter. The combined ratio for other personal was 92.3% in the first quarter, consistent with the combined ratio of 92.4% in the first quarter a year ago.
Turning now to first quarter claims corporate wide. As we announced on April 7, we had catastrophe losses of $250 million before tax or 8.1 points on the combined ratio compared to $199 million or 6.6 points in the first quarter of 2014. The $250 million in this year's first quarter reflected about $264 million from 2015 cat events, almost entirely from the ones in the United States, slightly offset by a $14 million decrease in our estimated losses from catastrophes, which occurred in prior years. In the first quarter of this year, roughly 80% of the total catastrophe losses were attributable to CPI and 20% to CCI.
And with that, I will turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail."

As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I will also provide an update on the April 1 renewal of our major property reinsurance program. Looking first at our operating results. Underwriting income was $205 mil",951,"Thank you, Paul. As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I will also provide an update on the April 1 renewal of our major property reinsurance program. 
Looking first at our operating results. Underwriting income was $205 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 5% to $264 million due, once again, to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed maturity portfolios and to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign currency translation. Net income was slightly higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $11 million or $0.03 per share after tax, including $0.03 per share from alternative investments. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2014, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $116 million or $0.30 per share after tax, including $0.14 per share from alternative investments. Unrealized depreciation before tax at March 31 was $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion at year-end 2014. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of March 31, 2015. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4.1 years, and the average credit rating is Aa3.
We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At March 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investments, including approximately $470 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at March 31 was $70.33 compared to $70.12 at year-end 2014. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized costs, was, $64.75 compared to $65.03 at 2014 year end. the change in book value per share and the change in adjusted book value per share for the first quarter of 2015 both reflected an adverse impact of approximately $0.77 due to foreign currency translation.
As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2015 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had approximately $5 million; CCI had $35 million; CSI had $70 million; and reinsurance assumed had none, bringing our total favorable development to approximately $110 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of about 3.5 points overall, including a favorable impact of prior year catastrophes of $14 million. For comparison, in the first quarter 2014, we had about $160 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $5 million in CPI, $90 million in CCI, $65 million in CSI and none in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2014 was about 5.5 points, including a favorable impact of prior year catastrophes of $7 million.
For the first quarter 2015, our x-cat accident year combined ratio was 88.9% compared to 91.7% in last year's first quarter, an improvement of 2.8 points. During the first quarter, our loss reserves decreased by $107 million. The impact of foreign currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $370 million, and the effect of cats was the increased reserves by $184 million.
Turning to capital management. We repurchased 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $326 million during the quarter. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $100.77 per share. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1 billion available for share repurchases under our current authorization, and as we've said on our last earnings call, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2016. In addition, as John mentioned, our board raised the quarterly common stock dividend in February by 14% to $0.50 -- $0.57 per share or $2.28 on an annual basis.
I would now like to say a few words about our reinsurance program. On April 1, we renewed our major property treaties, including our North American cat treaty, our non-U.S. cat treaty and our commercial property for risk treaty. We renewed these programs with a similar limit structure to what we had in 2014 but with expanded coverage and improved terms and condition. The reinsurance market was orderly, and there was plenty of capacity meet our needs in each treaty. As you might expect, we are in an attractive steed [ph]. We achieved meaningful savings on all 3 treaties again this year with double-digit price decreases on our 2 major catastrophe treaties as well as a high single-digit price decrease on the commercial property for risk treaty.
In addition, in March, we successfully completed our seventh catastrophe bond offering to replace the maturing cat bond. The transaction was very well received by the market, and this enabled us to replace the existing limit of $250 million and expand the perils covered relative to the expiring arrangement at attractive pricing. Under this new arrangement, we purchased fully collateralized 5-year coverage to supplement our reinsurance program for our commercial and personal property exposures in the Northeast United States, running from Virginia to Maine. In terms of pricing, the coupon on the new cap bond is approximately 45% lower than the maturing bond.
Similar to our previous cat bonds, we have an indemnity-based trigger, which means that our right to collect is based on our actual incurred losses as opposed to industry- or index-based losses. We like the diversification that these cat bond arrangements bring to our overall reinsurance program, especially in our peak zone. Importantly, they provide us with a cost-effective, fully collateralized alternative to traditional reinsurance with pricing locked in for several years. 
And now I'll turn it back to John."

Over the past couple of years, John, I think that you talked a lot about how generally sort of conservative underwriters look to try to cover their cost of something like a 3% to 4% assumption for long-term loss trends, and it doesn't always work out that you need all that. But with pricing now more like 1% to 2% in a lot of places, should we be thinking simplistically that, that means that the business' margins are going to start to decline? Or is really the current business really adequately priced? And at 1% to 2%, you're going to be able to run and run in place and maintain the margins over the next few years."

Professional Liability was 4% in the U.S. Personal lines was 5% in the U.S. So when you look at it and if you look now for 2015 accident year, you're obviously also getting benefit of the lag impact of earned premium based on written premium that was higher in 2014, right? So if you look at the 2015 accident year and then you look at loss trends, which if you properly stated, 3% to 4% -- 4%, 3% is long term. We've made a point of saying but that doesn't look to be macroeconomic that'll take you to account underwriting action. We believe 2 to 3 points, let's say, 3 points is a more reasonable assumption. So if you look at that, I'd say all of our businesses in the U.S. will really probably on an earned premium basis in the 2015 accident year, a little bit margin neutral to slightly margin profit positive. With CCI, the 1 you alluded to, being margin negative to some degree, but even CCI at current rates would have a 2% -- 2-point earned premium, so it'll be only slightly negative; Professional Liability, being slightly positive in the U.S.; and Personal Lines, being 1 point or 2 point positive and a couple of points probably positive. So obviously, the challenge is in CCI, but right now it's not a terrible place to be. But overall, from our overall book, 2015 accident year does not necessarily imply margin contraction, could be margin neutral to slightly positive at today's rates in the U.S. Now you'll obviously have to make your own assumption as to where rates are going, and that could change it. Although, again, you have 5 -- you basically have 5 quarters in of the 2015 accident year already."

First off, yes, we're all anxious to make enough to get that yacht, and sure certainly hope you get there soon, so -- but I would start off by just level setting. There is a lot of energy around the high net worth space amongst the small handful of competitors here, especially in the United States, and I think what's exciting people about it is there is real opportunity to differentiate and to also take market share from regional carriers and from the direct writers. I would estimate that about 80% of the high-net-worth space is just large direct writers and regional carriers, often times just by default. Somebody comes out of business school and ends up being with a buddy from high school who's a local agent, and they tend to stay there for 10 or 15, 20 years. And they really don't know what an independent agent can bring to the party and what Chubb Personal Lines can bring to the party. So one of the tricks in the energy around us is to have certain campaigns that are trying to peel people out of the direct writer market. Another is to make certain that we're working very closely with our agents to educate them, so they speak the language of the high net worth and the ultra-high net worth people. We're obviously adding to our products as well so that we can service them. Clearly, our international network gives us a huge advantage when it comes to the ultra-high net worth because, as we all know, they have homes, and they park their yachts in all kinds of exotic places and that type of thing. And clearly, the fine art market is another thing. The art schedules are absolutely staggering for a lot of these families, and we have the ability to put together hundreds of millions of dollars in art coverage on a single phone call. So we have deep expertise when it comes to appraisal, to preservation. Just, for example, we have, I think, 17 fine art specialists around the globe that are working on just helping with our customers preserve those -- their fine art and that type of thing. So a lot of it is around product. A lot of it is around service, but we're working very hard to make certain that our independent agents have the ability to really sell to these families. And they know how to go out and pry them out of channels that they're currently not tapping into."

Clearly, we're growing in other places. I'd say, if you're looking at our overall growth, it was down a little bit, but you have to remember that we're also overseas, and currency impacted us on the Homeowners business, in particular the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the euro, so -- and then as well the Brazilian real came down.

And I proved generally wrong. Although we've had some incremental decline in favorable development, say, 1.5 points from 2010 to 2014. But that's 6.5 to 5, so it's pretty darn good. So pretty robust and I think it's fair to say, the most surprising aspect of our recent overall reserve development and actually been up significantly, it has been sustained at such strong levels. And you're right. The first quarter was 3.5 points. But development can move around quite a bit individual quarters without signaling a significant trend. So give you an example -- 2 examples, development we experienced in both the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2010 were $100 million to $115 million, now very similar to amount we had experienced initially at first quarter. The same concern could have been raised for those periods. As it turned out, development rebounded sharply in the ensuing quarters. So in retrospect, these less favorable development quarters turned out to be blips rather than a tipping point in the level of development. So I can't say whether or not this holds to be true with development for the balance of 2015. In the end, our reserves [indiscernible] over time is a function of actual loss experienced, which is obviously difficult to predict.

And that's sort of the overall philosophy. And I'd say it wasn't the stock price that drove the size of our share repurchase. We have a philosophy that we've articulated over the last few years that our intent, obviously, market conditions and other things all being equal, that our share buyback, in essence, be in line with our earnings less shareholder dividend. And that's how we came up with the size of the program. We do believe that we are in a very strong excess capital position. We do -- we think very -- we think a lot about our deployment of capital and what's the right amount. We -- and we think about all the different types of capital deployment strategies. We're very comfortable with our share repurchase. In years past, if you looked at what we've done, when we've had more opportunity from a valuation or others, we might do something slightly larger than our earnings less dividends. So we're very careful on how we manage it, and we're very aware of being good stewards of our capital for our shareholders. So we do think about all the different options. I'm not going to comment on which ones we may or may not think about in the future. I'll also point out, as John mentioned, we've increased our common dividend for the last 33 years, which is another piece of how we manage our capital position. So again, in sum, we feel very good about where we are and the way we approach this and nothing really different than what we've been doing over a number of years."

Bear in mind, when you think about the investment income piece, a large part of our after-tax investment income comes from the municipal bond portfolio here in the U.S., so it's a slightly disproportionate impact on investment income in the U.S. Last point I'd make on book value is, again, if currencies don't change from where they were at the end of March, which is a pretty big assumption, the impact on book value will probably be meaningfully less in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. It won't be 0 because we have some of our foreign operations that report on a 1-quarter lag, which we've highlighted in our 10-K. So there will be an impact, but it shouldn't be nearly as large as it was in the first quarter. Hopefully, that gives you some help."

As we said in our press release, Chubb produced solid financial results in the first quarter of 2015. These were achieved even with the adverse impact of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses, primarily in the Homeowners line, stemming from the harsh winter in the United States.
The market remained relatively stable, and we were pleased that we're able to secure rate increases while again achieving strong renewal retention in all 3 of our business units. Operating income per share was $1.57, a 5% increase over the $1.50 in last year's first quarter. The effect of catastrophes were $0.69 per share in this year's first quarter compared to $0.52 per share in last year's. Annualized operating ROE was 10.2% for the first quarter of this year. The combined ratio for the first quarter was 93.9% this year compared to 93.2% last year. Excluding the impact of cats, the combined ratio for the first quarter improved to 85.8% in 2015 from 86.6% a year ago. Net written premiums, which grew 1%, were negatively affected by currency. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, premiums were up 4%. First quarter net income per share was $1.60 resulting in an annualized ROE of 9.2%.
Cat book value per share at March 31 was $70.33, up slightly from year-end 2014 and a 6% increase since March 31 a year ago. Our capital position is excellent. We continue to actively repurchase our shares. In addition, during the first quarter, we increased our common stock dividend by 14% to $2.28 per share on an annualized basis. It was Chubb's 33rd consecutive annual dividend increase, a continued indication of our consistent performance and financial strength.
And now I'll turn it over to Dino."

In a marketplace that, while competitive, remained relatively stable with regard to pricing terms and conditions, CCI and CSI both had strong performance in the first quarter. Each unit produced solid underwriting profitability and continued to execute our business plan, which emphasizes the retention of our profitable portfolio while seeking rate increases on those accounts that still require them. We also leveraged our distinct underwriting and claims service advantages to write new business in our targeted niche markets.
Beginning with CCI. The first quarter combined ratio was 90.8% compared to 88.5% in the first quarter of 2014. The first quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 3.4 points of the combined ratio in 2015 and 6.1 points in 2014. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's combined ratio in the first quarter of 2015 was 87.4% compared to 82.4% in the first quarter of 2014. This 5-point increase was almost all due to a reduction in the amount of favorable prior year reserve development in CCI, which, in turn, was mainly driven by a swing from favorable development in the year-ago quarter to modestly adverse development in this year's first quarter in the commercial property lines, including Multiple Peril Property. CCI's x-cat accident year combined ratio remained very strong at virtually the same level as in the first quarter a year ago.
Drilling down into the CCI lines, the all-up Multiple Peril combined ratio was 96.9% compared to 91.8% in the first quarter of 2014 with a similar impact of catastrophes in both periods. Property and Marine produced a combined ratio of 89% in the first quarter of this year and 89.1% in the same period last year with a lower impact of cats this year. The Casualty combined ratio for the first quarter of 2015 was 93.7%, which was higher than the 89.7% we reported for the first quarter last year but was more in line with our full year results for Casualty last year. And our Workers' Compensation combined ratio continued to be outstanding at 84.1%, essentially unchanged from the 84% that we posted in the first quarter of 2014.
In recent conference calls, we reported to you that in light of the rate increases we have secured for the past several years, we were increasingly focused on retention while at the same time, taking advantage of better-priced new business in the market segments we target. This focus is contributing to our positive growth. In CCI, first quarter net written premiums grew 2% to $1.4 billion. Growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was about 5%.
The Multiple Peril and Property and Marine lines grew at 3% and 1%, respectively, despite the drag from currency. In Workers' Comp, which is largely a U.S. business, growth was a strong 11%, but as we have pointed out in the past, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter-to-quarter due to the presence or absence of a few larger premium accounts. Lastly, in Casualty, net written premiums declined 5% largely due to the adverse impact of foreign currency translation to a slightly higher than the impact on our overall CCI business due to Casualty's higher percentage of business outside the United States in the first quarter.
Overall, renewal retention for CCI in the first quarter was 87% in the U.S. This is in line with our last 3 quarters and high by historical standards. Even with this high retention, we were able to achieve an average written renewal rate increase of 1% for the U.S. book. This was the 16th consecutive quarter in which CCI secured rate increases amounting to 3 years of rate on rate. Outside the U.S., CCI's average renewal rate increases in the first quarter were flat to slightly positive.
With respect to new business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise in products and services to target the market segments in which we specialize. In the first quarter, in the U.S., our new to lost business ratio was 1.4:1, equal to the ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014. This reflects the high retention rate and solid new business writings that we believe will meet our performance targets. Indeed, the vast majority of our new business was written for customers within our proven niche markets. Because we focus almost entirely on those target market segments, where we offer value-added products and services as well as unique expertise, winning the business is not exclusively a price-driven transaction, which in turn, helps us generate strong profit margins over time.
Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance, we experienced another very strong quarter with a combined ratio of 81.9%. This is a 7-point improvement over the first quarter of last year. Professional Liability, which represents the majority of the CSI portfolio, our combined ratio of 85.2% in the first quarter was similar to the 84.6% combined ratio in the first quarter of last year. The continued strong underwriting profitability of our Professional Liability business is a product of our disciplined underwriting, skillful management of the portfolio's business mix and culling actions informed by use of advanced analytics and predictive modeling. Of course, the compound effect of the rate increases on our U.S. book, which have exceeded 25% since January 2012, also contributed to our excellent combined ratio.
With respect to growth, Chubb Specialty Insurance net written premiums in the first quarter were flat at $621 million. Growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was about 4%. Net written premiums of the Professional Liability portion of CSI were down 1% to $545 million, reflecting growth in the United States and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation on our business outside the U.S.
In the first quarter, we secured average renewal rate increases of 4% for Professional Liability in the U.S. just as we did in the fourth quarter of last year. The first quarter was the 14th consecutive quarter that we achieved Professional Liability rate increases in the U.S. Despite our pressing for rate increases, we achieved strong renewal retention of 87% for that book. In markets outside the U.S., average renewal rates continued to be flat.
In terms of new business, Professional Liability had another good quarter in the U.S. with a new-to-lost ratio 1.2:1. As was the case with CCI, our strong underwriting expertise in value-added services enabled us to find better quality opportunities in our target markets following several great years of rate increases and underwriting actions.
Turning now to the Surety portion of the Specialty book. The combined ratio of 54.8% in the first quarter represented a significant improvement over the 2014 first quarter's combined ratio of 122.9%, which was adversely impacted by a single large loss. Net written premiums of $76 million were up 6%.
Bottom line, for our CSI business overall, we are very pleased with the strategies we have implemented, and we are well positioned to continue to grow profitably over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul, who will review our Personal Insurance operation and corporate-wide claim results."

Growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was about 5%. CPI produced a combined ratio of 105.1% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 101.8% in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI's first quarter combined ratio was 18.4 points compared to 11.2 points in the first quarter of 2014. On an x-cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 86.7% in the first quarter of 2015, nearly a 4-point improvement compared to 90.6% in the first quarter a year ago.
For our Homeowners line, premiums grew 1%, and the combined ratio was 112.7% compared to 104.9% in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 30 points of the Homeowners combined ratio in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 17.9 points in the first quarter of last year. There were 9 U.S. winter storm catastrophe events in the first quarter, which affected 29 states in the District of Columbia. The majority of our losses were from burst pipes and ice damming, most of which occurred in February. While the damage was widespread across much of the eastern section of the United States, our New York and New England customers were the most affected.
Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the 2015 first quarter Homeowners combined ratio was 82.7%, a 4.3-point improvement compared to 87% in the same period a year ago. Most of the improvement is attributable to the fact that fire losses this year were in line with our 5- and 10-year averages. Whereas in the first quarter a year ago, fire losses were considerably higher than average. Not surprisingly, the impact of non-cat weather-related losses in the first quarter of 2015 was elevated compared to a typical first quarter. However, it was slightly lower than the first quarter a year ago. During the first quarter of 2015, we achieved an average Homeowners renewal rate and exposure increase of 5% in the United States compared to 6% in the fourth quarter of last year.
For our Personal Auto line, net written premiums grew 2% in the first quarter of 2015. The combined ratio was 92.9% compared to an unusually high 101.4% in the corresponding quarter of 2014. U.S. renewal policy retention in the first quarter of 2015 was a very strong 89% for both Homeowners and Personal Auto, identical to the fourth quarter of 2014.
Net written premiums for Other Personal, which includes our accident, personal excess liability and yacht lines, grew 5% in the first quarter. The combined ratio for other personal was 92.3% in the first quarter, consistent with the combined ratio of 92.4% in the first quarter a year ago.
Turning now to first quarter claims corporate wide. As we announced on April 7, we had catastrophe losses of $250 million before tax or 8.1 points on the combined ratio compared to $199 million or 6.6 points in the first quarter of 2014. The $250 million in this year's first quarter reflected about $264 million from 2015 cat events, almost entirely from the ones in the United States, slightly offset by a $14 million decrease in our estimated losses from catastrophes, which occurred in prior years. In the first quarter of this year, roughly 80% of the total catastrophe losses were attributable to CPI and 20% to CCI.
And with that, I will turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail."

As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I will also provide an update on the April 1 renewal of our major property reinsurance program. Looking first at our operating results. Underwriting income was $205 mil",952,"Thank you, Paul. As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I will also provide an update on the April 1 renewal of our major property reinsurance program. 
Looking first at our operating results. Underwriting income was $205 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 5% to $264 million due, once again, to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed maturity portfolios and to a lesser extent, the impact of foreign currency translation. Net income was slightly higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $11 million or $0.03 per share after tax, including $0.03 per share from alternative investments. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2014, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $116 million or $0.30 per share after tax, including $0.14 per share from alternative investments. Unrealized depreciation before tax at March 31 was $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion at year-end 2014. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of March 31, 2015. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 4.1 years, and the average credit rating is Aa3.
We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At March 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investments, including approximately $470 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at March 31 was $70.33 compared to $70.12 at year-end 2014. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized costs, was, $64.75 compared to $65.03 at 2014 year end. The change in book value per share and the change in adjusted book value per share for the first quarter of 2015 both reflected an adverse impact of approximately $0.77 due to foreign currency translation.
As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2015 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had approximately $5 million; CCI had $35 million; CSI had $70 million; and reinsurance assumed had none, bringing our total favorable development to approximately $110 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of about 3.5 points overall, including a favorable impact of prior year catastrophes of $14 million. For comparison, in the first quarter 2014, we had about $160 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $5 million in CPI, $90 million in CCI, $65 million in CSI and none in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2014 was about 5.5 points, including a favorable impact of prior year catastrophes of $7 million.
For the first quarter 2015, our x-cat accident year combined ratio was 88.9% compared to 91.7% in last year's first quarter, an improvement of 2.8 points. During the first quarter, our loss reserves decreased by $107 million. The impact of foreign currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $370 million, and the effect of cats was the increased reserves by $184 million.
Turning to capital management. We repurchased 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $326 million during the quarter. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $100.77 per share. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1 billion available for share repurchases under our current authorization, and as we've said on our last earnings call, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2016. In addition, as John mentioned, our board raised the quarterly common stock dividend in February by 14% to $0.50 -- $0.57 per share or $2.28 on an annual basis.
I would now like to say a few words about our reinsurance program. On April 1, we renewed our major property treaties, including our North American cat treaty, our non-U.S. cat treaty and our commercial property for risk treaty. We renewed these programs with a similar limit structure to what we had in 2014 but with expanded coverage and improved terms and condition. The reinsurance market was orderly, and there was plenty of capacity to meet our needs in each treaty. As you might expect, we are in an attractive steed [ph]. We achieved meaningful savings on all 3 treaties again this year with double-digit price decreases on our 2 major catastrophe treaties as well as a high single-digit price decrease on the commercial property for risk treaty.
In addition, in March, we successfully completed our seventh catastrophe bond offering to replace the maturing cat bond. The transaction was very well received by the market, and this enabled us to replace the existing limit of $250 million and expand the perils covered relative to the expiring arrangement at attractive pricing. Under this new arrangement, we purchased fully collateralized 5-year coverage to supplement our reinsurance program for our commercial and personal property exposures in the Northeast United States, running from Virginia to Maine. In terms of pricing, the coupon on the new cap bond is approximately 45% lower than the maturing bond.
Similar to our previous cat bonds, we have an indemnity-based trigger, which means that our right to collect is based on our actual incurred losses as opposed to industry- or index-based losses. We like the diversification that these cat bond arrangements bring to our overall reinsurance program, especially in our peak zone. Importantly, they provide us with a cost-effective, fully collateralized alternative to traditional reinsurance with pricing locked in for several years. 
And now I'll turn it back to John."

We are pleased with our x-currency growth of 4% in the quarter. In the U.S., retention rates remained at high levels, and we're able to achieve renewal rate increases generally in line with the prior quarter. We also continue to focus on capital management in the quarter, raising our dividend by 14% and repurchasing 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $326 million.
And with that, I'll open the line to questions."

Over the past couple of years, John, I think that you talked a lot about how generally sort of conservative underwriters look to try to cover their cost of something like a 3% to 4% assumption for long-term loss trends, and it doesn't always work out that you need all that. But with pricing now more like 1% to 2% in a lot of places, should we be thinking simplistically that, that means that the business' margins are going to start to decline? Or is really the current business really adequately priced? And at 1% to 2%, you're going to be able to run and run in place and maintain the margins over the next few years."

Professional Liability was 4% in the U.S. Personal lines was 5% in the U.S. So when you look at it and if you look now for 2015 accident year, you're obviously also getting benefit of the lag impact of earned premium based on written premium that was higher in 2014, right? So if you look at the 2015 accident year and then you look at loss trends, which if you properly stated, 3% to 4% -- 4% is long term. We've made a point of saying but that doesn't look to be macroeconomic that'll take you to account underwriting action. We believe 2 to 3 points, let's say, 3 points is a more reasonable assumption. So if you look at that, I'd say all of our businesses in the U.S. will really probably on an earned premium basis in the 2015 accident year, a little bit margin neutral to slightly margin profit positive. With CCI, the 1 you alluded to, being margin negative to some degree, but even CCI at current rates would have a 2% -- 2-point earned premium, so it'll be only slightly negative; Professional Liability, being slightly positive in the U.S.; and Personal Lines, being 1 point or 2 point positive and a couple of points probably positive. So obviously, the challenge is in CCI, but right now it's not a terrible place to be. But overall, from our overall book, 2015 accident year does not necessarily imply margin contraction, could be margin neutral to slightly positive at today's rates in the U.S. Now you'll obviously have to make your own assumption as to where rates are going, and that could change it. Although, again, you have 5 -- you basically have 5 quarters in of the 2015 accident year already."

There is a lot of energy around the high net worth space amongst the small handful of competitors here, especially in the United States, and I think what's exciting people about it is there is real opportunity to differentiate and to also take market share from regional carriers and from the direct writers. I would estimate that about 80% of the high-net-worth space is just large direct writers and regional carriers, often times just by default. Somebody comes out of business school and ends up being with a buddy from high school who's a local agent, and they tend to stay there for 10 or 15, 20 years. And they really don't know what an independent agent can bring to the party and what Chubb Personal Lines can bring to the party. So one of the tricks in the energy around us is to have certain campaigns that are trying to peel people out of the direct writer market. Another is to make certain that we're working very closely with our agents to educate them, so they speak the language of the high net worth and the ultra-high net worth people. We're obviously adding to our products as well so that we can service them. Clearly, our international network gives us a huge advantage when it comes to the ultra-high net worth because, as we all know, they have homes, and they park their yachts in all kinds of exotic places and that type of thing. And clearly, the fine art market is another thing. The art schedules are absolutely staggering for a lot of these families, and we have the ability to put together hundreds of millions of dollars in art coverage on a single phone call. So we have deep expertise when it comes to appraisal, to preservation. Just, for example, we have, I think, 17 fine art specialists around the globe that are working on just helping with our customers preserve those -- their fine art and that type of thing. So a lot of it is around product. A lot of it is around service, but we're working very hard to make certain that our independent agents have the ability to really sell to these families. And they know how to go out and pry them out of channels that they're currently not tapping into."

Can you sort of break down -- there are 2 different products and where Chubb is in both those products a little bit?. And when you think about -- one of your competitors mentioned that in getting new customers for their high net worth the business that the real opportunity is with people who are poorly insured by well-known carriers who aren't really high-net-worth carriers.

I'd tell you, that's one of the areas where we believe we have a real distinct advantage against the other high-net-worth carriers who are obviously trying to build some scale there. But we've had our Masterpiece product vehicle and our back office set up for over 30 years right now. So quite frankly, when an agent comes to us with a block or a book of mass affluent customers, frankly, what's so attractive is we have the back office to help them and can handle that volume.

And then when we sit with them and we get them to get their artwork, for example, independently appraised, that market is absolutely on fire.

Clearly, we're growing in other places. I'd say, if you're looking at our overall growth, it was down a little bit, but you have to remember that we're also overseas, and currency impacted us on the Homeowners business, in particular the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the euro, so -- and then as well the Brazilian real came down.

And I proved generally wrong. Although we've had some incremental decline in favorable development, say, 1.5 points from 2010 to 2014. But that's 6.5 to 5, so it's pretty darn good. So pretty robust and I think it's fair to say, the most surprising aspect of our recent overall reserve development and actually been up significantly, it has been sustained at such strong levels. And you're right. The first quarter was 3.5 points. But development can move around quite a bit individual quarters without signaling a significant trend. So give you an example -- 2 examples, development we experienced in both the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2010 were $100 million to $115 million, now very similar to amount we had experienced initially at first quarter. The same concern could have been raised for those periods. As it turned out, development rebounded sharply in the ensuing quarters. So in retrospect, these less favorable development quarters turned out to be blips rather than a tipping point in the level of development. So I can't say whether or not this holds to be true with development for the balance of 2015. In the end, our reserves development over time is a function of actual loss experienced, which is obviously difficult to predict. But I do think it'll be -- could be very premature to draw such a conclusion based on one quarter result."

It was a good quarter. Quarters fluctuate. And given the fact we're not getting a sizable amount of rate overseas, it'd be hard to say that there's going to be huge improvements on a term line basis. Obviously, quarters fluctuate by loss experience, and a lot of it is luck. I think we have good underwriting in place. But I wouldn't read too much into it. I think the last few quarters were a little high. This one was probably pretty good. We'll see."

I guess, last quarter, you guys gave us a share repurchase authorization. It was a little less than last year. And then I think you also indicated you felt good about excess capital position. And I think you said that the reason it was a little less than last year was you like to be able to move it around maybe based on what the share price is. Just curious if Chubb would consider deployment of capital in some other form other than share repo. And I guess, longer term along those lines, how does Chubb think about the right amount of capital that's required to kind of support the risk to this business through the cycle? And how does that compare to the way the businesses is currently capitalized?"

It's Ricky, I'll take a shot at answering that. First off, I think what we said last quarter when we announced the new share repurchase program was that it's sort of in line with what our expected earnings are for the year less shareholder dividends",317,"Sure. It's Ricky, I'll take a shot at answering that. First off, I think what we said last quarter when we announced the new share repurchase program was that it's sort of in line with what our expected earnings are for the year less shareholder dividends. And that's sort of the overall philosophy. And I'd say it wasn't the stock price that drove the size of our share repurchase. We have a philosophy that we've articulated over the last few years that our intent, obviously, market conditions and other things all being equal, that our share buyback, in essence, be in line with our earnings less shareholder dividend. And that's how we came up with the size of the program. We do believe that we are in a very strong excess capital position. We do -- we think very -- we think a lot about our deployment of capital and what's the right amount. We -- and we think about all the different types of capital deployment strategies. We're very comfortable with our share repurchase. In years past, if you looked at what we've done, when we've had more opportunity from a valuation perspective or others, we might do something slightly larger than our earnings less dividends. So we're very careful on how we manage it, and we're very aware of being good stewards of our capital for our shareholders. So we do think about all the different options. I'm not going to comment on which ones we may or may not think about in the future. I'll also point out, as John mentioned, we've increased our common dividend for the last 33 years, which is another piece of how we manage our capital position. So again, in sum, we feel very good about where we are and the way we approach this and nothing really different than what we've been doing over a number of years."

I would think that in the second and third quarters -- remember, most of the currency movement that has happened started in the fourth quarter of last year and then continued into the first quarter of this year. So all other things being equal, currency stays where it was at the end of March, then you will still see an impact on growth in certainly the second and third quarters. And I'm not saying whether it'd be similar to what we had in the first quarter. I don't know. But certainly, there will be an impact. We did -- in the guidance that we put out in January, we did say that we expect a 2-point impact for the full year, so maybe that can give you some help there as well. As John mentioned, from an earnings perspective, it doesn't have a very large impact on a quarterly basis, a couple of cents a share in the first quarter. Bear in mind, when you think about the investment income piece, a large part of our after-tax investment income comes from the municipal bond portfolio here in the U.S., so it's a slightly disproportionate impact on investment income in the U.S. Last point I'd make on book value is, again, if currencies don't change from where they were at the end of March, which is a pretty big assumption, the impact on book value will probably be meaningfully less in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. It won't be 0 because we have some of our foreign operations that report on a 1-quarter lag, which we've highlighted in our 10-K. So there will be an impact, but it shouldn't be nearly as large as it was in the first quarter. Hopefully, that gives you some help."
