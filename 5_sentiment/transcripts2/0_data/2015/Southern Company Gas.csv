Our performance during the year was driven by exceptionally strong results in the wholesale services business, but also reflected good -- very good results in our utilities and our retail segment as well. Building on a strong year, we initiated 2015 earnings per share guidance of $2.70 to $2.90 on a consolidated basis and between $2.65 and $2.75, excluding wholesale. We also are raising our target for medium and long-term growth John will discuss our forward-looking expectations in a few moments. 
Before I walk through some of the year-over-year drivers in each of the segments, I also want to note that we had a number of strategic successes during the year which we've summarized for you on Slide 4. First, we entered into 3 agreements during 2014 to invest in partnerships to construct Interstate Pipelines that will benefit our customers in Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey. We plan to invest approximately $670 million in these projects over the next 4 years and expect to generate returns consistent with FERC regulated pipeline projects, which are historically slightly higher than the state regulated utility returns. We also closed on the sale of Tropical Shipping, which we acquired from the NICOR acquisition in 2011. The sale generated in $225 million in after-tax proceeds, and importantly, allowed us to exit the business that was not quota of operations at a very attractive multiple of cash flow. We deployed $715 million of capital on our regulated utilities, of which approximately $165 million was underwriter based programs. We were successful during the year in obtaining regulatory approval in Illinois to launch what we call our investing in Illinois program, which will support the replacement renewal of infrastructure at Nicor Gas over a 9-year period. This system reliability program will allow us to invest between $200 million and $250 million annually under our writer program that effectively eliminates regulatory drag on collection traditionally associated with base rate recovery. We expect this investment, along with our normal investment and new customer growth, to nearly double our rate base for our largest utility over the next decade. 
As shown on Slide 5 of the presentation, earnings per share from continuing operations for 2014 were $4.71 compared to $2.45 in 2013. The year-over-year increase of 92% was driven primarily by record commercial activity in our Wholesale business combined with hedge gains during the year, net of lower of cost market for low comp inventory adjustments. Excluding wholesale services, our EPS for continuing operations was $2.55 in 2014 compared to $2.47 in 2013. We have strong results and our distribution operations segment in 2014 with $35 million year-over-year improvement in EBIT. The earnings increase in distribution reflects weather that was 4% colder in 2014 that in the prior year in Illinois where we have the most weather exposure. Our retail segments also performed well during the year, operationally, although temporal hedge movements and though, and adjustments recorded mainly during the fourth quarter decreased our reported earnings in the segment and resulted in 2014 EBIT being flat compared to '13. We expect to recapture these accounting losses in 2015. 
Fourth quarter results can be found on Slide 6. I won't spend much time here except to say that the steep decline in natural gas prices at the end of December resulted in mark-to-market hedge movement of that impacted our wholesale and retail segments. We had mark-to-market gains net of low comp of $84 million of wholesale in the fourth quarter and net mark-to-market losses is in low comp [ph] of $16 million at the retail segment. I'll speak to each of these in a few moments. 
Taking a closer look at each segment starting on Slide 7, you can see the $35 million or 6% year-over-year EBIT improvement for the distribution segment. The main drivers of the increase were higher non-weather-related customer usage and customer growth, as well as colder weather compared to the prior year and lower depreciation expense, which was the result of a change in depreciation rates for Nicor Gas that went into effect in August of 2013. We also had increased regulatory infrastructure revenue during the year, largely due to our Georgia programs. In 2014, we added approximately 34,000 net meters, an increase of more than 25% over 2013. Our O&M expenses in the distribution segment were up $12 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase largely reflects how your contractor expense related to pipe in compliance work and weather-related expenses. 
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 8. 2014 EBIT was flat to the prior year at $132 million. However, the strong operational performance and growth in the business during 2014 is masked by about $16 million of hedge losses and low comp inventory adjustment that occurred primarily in the fourth quarter. We offered fixed price contracts to some of our customers and new hedge our price risk associated with these contracts in the forward market. The steep December natural gas price decline caused us to report mark-to-market losses that will reverse when we deliver the commodity to our customers in '15. Excluding the accounting movements EBIT from our retail segment would have be improved year-over-year by about 12% in part due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2014, which added about $5 million to earnings compared to 2013 or $14 compared to number weather. Importantly, we saw growth in customer account in both our retail and our peak and retail services businesses our market share in Georgia remains stable. 
Turning to the wholesale services segment on Slide 9. 2014 was the strongest year ever for this business. EBIT was up over the prior year by $425 million. This record performance is due mainly to improved commercial activity related to our transportation storage positions primarily in the Northeast and Midwest regions during the first quarter of 2014. As you can see, commercial activity was $444 million in 2014 compared to $129 million in 2013. Further, we had pretty much the perfect series of events from an accounting perspective in that much of the hedge losses we recorded in 2013 were realized in '14 as expected. Then at the end of the year, we recorded hedge gains associated with some of our 2015 and 2016 positions. This latter event will have the impact of dampening [ph] our expected 2015 GAAP earnings for wholesale, which we will talk more about in a few minutes. 
On Slide 10, you can see our results on an economic earnings basis. As you know, we focus on economic earnings and evaluating the performance of this business. This allows us to strip out the impacts of mark-to-market accounting and assign the generation of earnings activity to the period in which it was earned. Economic earnings for 2014 were $277 million compared to $69 million in 2013. 
Looking at the midstream segment on Slide 9. We had a couple of one-time items impacting results in both years. In 2014, we recorded a $10 million true-up of retained fuel that is essentially nonrecurring. And in 2013, we had the $8 million write-off related to the Sawgrass Storage Facility. Excluding these items, give you a better look at operating performance for the segment. On this basis, EBIT was lower year-over-year by $5 million due mainly to recontracting capacity at our storage facilities and reduced subscription rates, as well as higher operating costs. While the segment remains challenged, we have seen some modest improvements in market rates and fundamentals in the recent months. 
You can see some of the balance sheet highlights on Slide 12. The combination of the sale of Tropical Shipping and the strong economic earnings generation at Sequent resulted in strong cash flows and a reduction in our short-term debt during 2014 as compared to the prior year. You can see this improvement in our debt-to-capitalization ratio, which was 55% at the end of 2014 compared to 57% at the end of 2013. 
Just to close out the internal controls issue that we discussed last quarter, our previously disclosed material weakness was remediated as of December 31, 2014. On the financing side, we redeemed $200 million of maturing debt in January of this year using commercial paper and expect to refinance this debt with the issuance later this year. With the infrastructure of pipeline investments I mentioned earlier, we expect to be a bit more active in the debt markets over the next 2 years to fund these investments and to refinance existing maturing debt. To provide some protection in the potentially rising interest rate environment, we took advantage of the significant decline in Treasury rates during January of this year to lock in the underlying rate associated with some of our plan debt issuances over the next 2 years. As more fully described in our 10-K filing, we executed 4 [ph] [indiscernible] interest rate swaps for a [indiscernible] amount of $800 million in both 10 and 30-year tranches at very attractive underlying rates. 
I'll now turn the call over to John for his remarks."
252517,284649020,760826,"AGL Resources Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Southern Company Gas","Executives","Thank you, Drew, and good morning everyone.

As Drew said, 2014 was an outstanding year for our company. Operationally, all of our segments performed well. Steady improvements in distribution, growth at retail, excluding the accounting movements, and truly exceptional performance of wholesale. We know the timing of reported earnings for the wholesale business is hard to predict, but no matter how you evaluate it, 2014 was a record year for Sequent. and his team have done a remarkable job managing our portfolio of assets in some periods of extreme volatility. Through the asset management agreement in place with our utilities, we returned $47 million in 2014 compared to $18 million in 2013 and $15 million in 2012. Our third-party asset management customers also had received significant revenue sharing, which is helping to further bolster Sequent business and competitive position. When we have outsized earnings years like last year, it enables us to deploy surplus cash into investments such as the pipelines that have a stable return more in line with our utilities. We were able to fund our significant capital expenditure plan with no expectation for equity issuance in part because of the strong results at wholesale, as well as other strategic initiatives such as the sale of Tropical Shipping. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'll shift to our forecast. We expect to earn between $2.70 and $2.90 per share on a consolidated basis in 2015. Excluding wholesale, our EPS guidance range is between $2.65 and $2.75. You can see the specific EBIT expectations for each segment on this table and our guidance assumptions on Slide 14. As a reminder, we had weather-related and onetime benefits of $29 million in the distribution segment in 2014. So a normalized 2014 basis is $552 million. In addition, our retail guidance includes the recapture of $16 million of hedge losses and low comp that we referred to earlier. And as Drew mentioned, due to booking hedge gains in 2014 related to some of our 2015 positions at wholesale, our wholesale EBIT expectation is lower than a typical year. That said, we still expect to generate economic earnings at wholesale of approximately $50 million. 
If you turn to Slide 15, you could see the main drivers of our guidance by segment. On a normalized basis, the midpoint of our guidance, excluding wholesale, represents nearly 12% year-over-year growth. If you further normalize for the mark-to-market changes in the retail segment, growth is about 6.5%. 
Slide 16 shows more detail of the year-over-year drivers for the distribution segment. The projected growth rate is 4.7%. The main drivers are increased margin from infrastructure programs, particularly investing in Illinois and in Georgia program and additional new customer margin. These primary factors offset by higher depreciation and pension expenses. 
Turning now to Slide 17, in addition to the 2015 outlook, we are updating our medium and long-term growth projections. As a result of the increased infrastructure spending and rate base investments, our pipeline investments and customer growth expectations, we are raising our target 3-year EPS growth rate to 5% to 8%, and our 5-year EPS growth target is now 6% to 9% or higher. We will provide more detail behind these projections at our Analyst Day that is scheduled for March 25 in New York. 
A few additional items to note on Slide 18. As mentioned, we are officially underway with our investing in the Illinois infrastructure program. We expect to spend approximately $200 million this year and $250 million in each of the next 2 years. Also, on our last call, we indicated that we expect to make a true-up filing in Georgia related to our Pipeline Replacement Program or PRP. Next week, Atlanta Gas Light intends to file a petition for authorization to collect additional revenues necessary to fully recover the revenue requirement associated with the actual cost of investments it made through December 31, 2013 when PRP ended. In the petition, we will request approval to increase the current surcharge collected from customers under the stride surcharge. Our final accounting for PRP program demonstrates that the actual program investments generate a revenue requirement in excess of a rate authorized by the commission due in part to our agreement to charge in 2005. If you have any questions once the filing is made, please don't hesitate to contact us. 
Also listed here is a summary of the pipeline agreements that we haven't announced this year. With the exception of the state pipeline, development of which is still under discussion, each project is in the prefiling process with FERC and environmental reviews are underway. As Drew mentioned, these projects should benefit our utility customers by diversifying our supply portfolio and transporting low-cost shale gas in the Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey. And this should benefit our shareholders, the stable returns in line with or slightly above our utility returns. We expect to see some earnings uplift in 2017 with acceleration 2018 and 2019 as the projects are placed in service. 
Turning to our 2015 priorities on Slide 19. Our business strategy is consistent with prior years and represented of our safety and customer focus data growth culture. Our focus is to capitalize our margin-enhancing opportunities across all business units, while ensuring efficient and safe operations. Several of our specific business objectives are detailed for you on the page. 
I'm grateful to our employees for the continued hard work and dedication as we generated record results and executed on several strategic initiatives during the year. I want to thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL resources.

Our performance during the year was driven by exceptionally strong results in the wholesale services business but also reflected good -- very good results in our utilities and our retail segment as well. Building on a strong year, we initiated 2015 earnings per share guidance of $2.70 to $2.90 on a consolidated basis and between $2.65 and $2.75 excluding wholesale. We also are raising our target for medium and long-term growth. John will discuss our forward-looking expectations in a few moments. 
Before I walk through some of the year-over-year drivers in each of the segments, I also want to note that we had a number of strategic successes during the year, which we've summarized for you on Slide 4. First, we entered into 3 agreements during 2014 to invest in partnerships to construct interstate pipelines that will benefit our customers in Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey. We plan to invest approximately $670 million in these projects over the next 4 years and expect to generate returns consistent with FERC-regulated pipeline projects, which are historically slightly higher than the state-regulated utility returns. We also closed on the sale of Tropical Shipping, which we acquired as part of the Nicor acquisition in 2011. The sale generated $225 million in after-tax proceeds and, importantly, allowed us to exit the business that was not core to our operations at a very attractive multiple of cash flow. We deployed $715 million of capital on our regulated utilities, of which approximately $165 million was under rider-based programs. We were successful during the year in obtaining regulatory approval in Illinois to launch what we call our Investing in Illinois program, which will support the replacement or renewal of infrastructure at Nicor Gas over a 9-year period. This system reliability program will allow us to invest between $200 million and $250 million annually under our rider program that effectively eliminates regulatory lag on collection traditionally associated with base rate recovery. We expect this investment, along with our normal investment and new customer growth, to nearly double our rate base for our largest utility over the next decade. 
As shown on Slide 5 of the presentation, earnings per share from continuing operations for 2014 were $4.71 compared to $2.45 in 2013. The year-over-year increase of 92% was driven primarily by record commercial activity in our wholesale business, combined with hedge gains during the year, net of lower cost of -- lower of cost or market, or LOCOM, inventory adjustments. Excluding wholesale services, our EPS from continuing operations was $2.55 in 2014 compared to $2.47 in 2013. We had strong results in our distribution operations segment in 2014, with $35 million year-over-year improvement in EBIT. The earnings increase in distribution reflects weather that was 4% colder in 2014 than in the prior year in Illinois, where we have the most weather exposure. Our retail segments also performed well during the year operationally, although temporal hedge movements and LOCOM adjustments recorded mainly during the fourth quarter decreased our reported earnings in the segment and resulted in 2014 EBIT being flat compared to '13. We expect to recapture these accounting losses in 2015. 
Fourth quarter results can be found on Slide 6. I won't spend much time here, except to say that the steep decline in natural gas prices at the end of December resulted in mark-to-market hedge movements that impacted our wholesale and retail segments. We had mark-to-market gains net of LOCOM of $84 million at wholesale in the fourth quarter and net mark-to-market losses in LOCOM of $16 million at the retail segment. I'll speak to each of these in a few moments. 
Taking a closer look at each segment, starting on Slide 7. You can see the $35 million or 6% year-over-year EBIT improvement for the distribution segment. The main drivers of the increase were higher non-weather-related customer usage and customer growth as well as colder weather compared to the prior year and lower depreciation expense, which was the result of a change in depreciation rates for Nicor Gas that went into effect in August of 2013. We also had increased regulatory infrastructure revenue during the year, largely due to our Georgia programs. In 2014, we added approximately 34,000 net meters, an increase of more than 25% over 2013. Our O&M expenses in the distribution segment were up $12 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase largely reflects higher contractor expense related to pipeline compliance work and weather-related expenses. 
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 8. 2014 EBIT was flat to the prior year at $132 million. However, the strong operational performance and growth in the business during 2014 is masked by about $16 million of hedge losses and LOCOM inventory adjustments that occurred primarily in the fourth quarter. We offered fixed price contracts to some of our customers, and we hedged our price risk associated with these contracts in the forward market. The steep December natural gas price decline caused us to report mark-to-market losses that will reverse when we deliver the commodity to our customers in '15. Excluding these accounting movements, EBIT from our retail segment would have improved year-over-year by about 12%, in part due to colder than -- colder weather during the first quarter of 2014, which added about $5 million to earnings compared to 2013 or $14 million compared to normal weather. Importantly, we saw a growth in customer count in both our retail energy and retail services businesses, and our market share in Georgia remains stable. 
Turning to the wholesale services segment on Slide 9. 2014 was the strongest year ever for this business. EBIT was up over the prior year by $425 million. This record performance is due mainly to improved commercial activity related to our transportation storage positions primarily in the Northeast and Midwest regions during the first quarter of 2014. As you can see, commercial activity was $444 million in 2014 compared to $129 million in 2013. Further, we had pretty much the perfect series of events from an accounting perspective, in that much of the hedge losses we recorded in 2013 were realized in '14 as expected. Then at the end of the year, we recorded hedge gains associated with some of our 2015 and 2016 positions. This latter event will have the impact of dampening our expected 2015 GAAP earnings for wholesale, which we will talk more about in a few minutes. 
On Slide 10, you can see our results on an economic earnings basis. As you know, we focus on economic earnings in evaluating the performance of this business. This allows us to strip out the impacts of mark-to-market accounting and assign the generation of earnings activity to the period in which it was earned. Economic earnings for 2014 were $277 million compared to $69 million in 2013. 
Looking at the midstream segment on Slide 9 (sic) [Slide 11]. We had a couple of one-time items impacting results in both years. In 2014, we recorded a $10 million true-up of retaining fuel that is essentially non-reoccurring. And in 2013, we had the $8 million write-off related to the Sawgrass Storage facility. Excluding these items gives you a better look at operating performance for the segment. On this basis, EBIT was lower year-over-year by $5 million, due mainly to recontracting capacity at our storage facilities and reduced subscription work rates as well as slightly higher operating costs. While the segment remains challenged, we have seen some modest improvement in market rates and fundamentals in the recent months. 
You can see some of the balance sheet highlights on Slide 12. The combination of the sale of Tropical Shipping and the strong economic earnings generation at Sequent resulted in strong cash flows and a reduction in our short-term debt during 2014 as compared to the prior year. You can see this improvement in our debt-to-capitalization ratio, which was 55% at the end of 2014 compared to 57% at the end of 2013. 
Just to close out the internal controls issue that we described -- discussed last quarter, our previously disclosed material weakness was remediated as of December 31, 2014. On the financing side, we redeemed $200 million of maturing debt in January of this year using commercial paper and expect to refinance this debt with an issuance later this year. With the infrastructure and pipeline investments I mentioned earlier, we expect to be a bit more active in the debt markets over the next 2 years to fund these investments and to refinance existing maturing debt. To provide some protection in the potentially rising interest rate environment, we took advantage of the significant decline in Treasury rates during January of this year to lock in the underlying rates associated with some of our planned debt issuances over the next 2 years. As more fully described in our 10-K filing, we executed forward-starting interest rate swaps for a notional amount of $800 million in both 10- and 30-year tranches at very attractive underlying rates. 
I'll now turn the call over to John for his remarks."
252517,284649020,761061,"AGL Resources Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Southern Company Gas","Executives","Thank you, Drew, and good morning, everyone.

Operationally, all of our segments performed well: steady improvements at distribution; growth at retail, excluding the accounting movements; and trul",950,"Thank you, Drew, and good morning, everyone. As Drew said, 2014 was an outstanding year for our company. Operationally, all of our segments performed well: steady improvements at distribution; growth at retail, excluding the accounting movements; and truly exceptional performance of wholesale. We know the timing of reported earnings for the wholesale business is hard to predict, but no matter how you evaluate it, 2014 was a record year for Sequent. Dino's [ph] team have done a remarkable job managing our portfolio of assets in some periods of extreme volatility. Through the asset management agreements in place with our utilities, we returned $47 million in 2014 compared to $18 million in 2013 and $15 million in 2012. Our third-party asset management customers also have received significant revenue sharing, which is helping to further bolster Sequent's business and competitive position. 
When we have outsized earnings years like last year, it enables us to deploy surplus cash into investments such as the pipelines that have a stable return more in line with our utilities. We are able to fund our significant capital expenditure plan with no expectation for equity issuance in part because of the strong results at wholesale as well as other strategic initiatives, such as the sale of Tropical Shipping. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'll shift to our forecasts. We expect to earn between $2.70 to $2.90 per share on a consolidated basis in 2015. Excluding wholesale, our EPS guidance range is between $2.65 and $2.75. You can see the specific EBIT expectations for each segment on this table and our guidance assumptions on Slide 14. As a reminder, we had weather-related and onetime benefits of $29 million in the distribution segment in 2014. So on a normalized 2014 basis, it's $552 million. In addition, our retail guidance includes the recapture of $16 million of hedge losses and LOCOM that we referred to earlier. And as Drew mentioned, due to booking hedge gains in 2014 related to some of our 2015 positions at wholesale, our wholesale EBIT expectation is lower than a typical year. That said, we still expect to generate economic earnings at wholesale of approximately $50 million. 
If you turn to Slide 15, you can see the main drivers of our guidance by segment. On a normalized basis, the midpoint of our guidance, excluding wholesale, represents nearly 12% year-over-year growth. If you further normalize for the mark-to-market changes in the retail segment, growth is about 6.5%. 
Slide 16 shows more detail of the year-over-year drivers for the distribution segment. The projected growth rate is 4.7%. The main drivers are increased margin from infrastructure programs, particularly Investing in Illinois and the Georgia STRIDE program, and additional new customer margin. These primary factors are offset by higher depreciation and pension expenses. 
Turning now to Slide 17. In addition to the 2015 outlook, we are updating our medium and long-term growth projections. As a result of the increased infrastructure spending and rate base investments, our pipeline investments and customer growth expectations, we are raising our target 3-year EPS growth rate to 5% to 8%, and our 5-year EPS growth target is now 6% to 9% or higher. We will provide more detail behind these projections at our Analyst Day that is scheduled for March 25 in New York. 
A few additional items to note on Slide 18. As mentioned, we are officially underway with our Investing in Illinois infrastructure program. We expect to spend approximately $200 million this year and $250 million in each of the next 2 years. 
Also, on our last call, we indicated that we expect to make a true-up filing in Georgia related to our Pipeline Replacement Program, or PRP. Next week, Atlanta Gas Light intends to file a petition for authorization to collect additional revenues necessary to fully recover the revenue requirement associated with the actual cost of investments it made through December 31, 2013, when PRP ended. In the petition, we will request approval to increase the current surcharge collected from customers under the STRIDE surcharge. Our final accounting for PRP program demonstrates that the actual program investments generate a revenue requirement in excess of the rate authorized by the commission due in part to our agreement to cap the surcharge in 2005. If you have any questions once the filing is made, please don't hesitate to contact us. 
Also listed here is a summary of the pipeline agreements that we have announced this year. With the exception of the Prairie State Pipeline, development of which is still under discussion, each project is in the prefiling process with FERC, and environmental reviews are underway. As Drew mentioned, these projects should benefit our utility customers by diversifying our supply portfolio and transporting low-cost shale gas in the Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey. And they should benefit our shareholders with stable returns in line with or slightly above our utility returns. We expect to see some earnings uplift in 2017, with acceleration in 2018 and 2019, as the projects are placed in service. 
Turning to our 2015 priorities on Slide 19. Our business strategy is consistent with prior years and representative of our safety and customer-focused steady growth culture. Our focus is to capitalize our margin-enhancing opportunities across all business units while ensuring efficient and safe operations. Several of our specific business objectives are detailed for you on the page. 
I'm grateful to our employees for their continued hard work and dedication as we generated record results and executed on several strategic initiatives during the year. I want to thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL Resources.

Our performance during the year was driven by exceptionally strong results in the wholesale services business but also reflected good -- very good results in our utilities and our retail segment as well. Building on a strong year, we initiated 2015 earnings per share guidance of $2.70 to $2.90 on a consolidated basis and between $2.65 and $2.75 excluding wholesale. We also are raising our target for medium and long-term growth. John will discuss our forward-looking expectations in a few moments. 
Before I walk through some of the year-over-year drivers in each of the segments, I also want to note that we had a number of strategic successes during the year, which we've summarized for you on Slide 4. First, we entered into 3 agreements during 2014 to invest in partnerships to construct interstate pipelines that will benefit our customers in Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey. We plan to invest approximately $670 million in these projects over the next 4 years and expect to generate returns consistent with FERC-regulated pipeline projects, which are historically slightly higher than the state-regulated utility returns. We also closed on the sale of Tropical Shipping, which we acquired as part of the Nicor acquisition in 2011. The sale generated $225 million in after-tax proceeds and, importantly, allowed us to exit the business that was not core to our operations at a very attractive multiple of cash flow. We deployed $715 million of capital on our regulated utilities, of which approximately $165 million was under rider-based programs. We were successful during the year in obtaining regulatory approval in Illinois to launch what we call our Investing in Illinois program, which will support the replacement or renewal of infrastructure at Nicor Gas over a 9-year period. This system reliability program will allow us to invest between $200 million and $250 million annually under our rider program that effectively eliminates regulatory lag on collection traditionally associated with base rate recovery. We expect this investment, along with our normal investment and new customer growth, to nearly double our rate base for our largest utility over the next decade. 
As shown on Slide 5 of the presentation, earnings per share from continuing operations for 2014 were $4.71 compared to $2.45 in 2013. The year-over-year increase of 92% was driven primarily by record commercial activity in our wholesale business, combined with hedge gains during the year, net of lower cost of -- lower of cost or market, or LOCOM, inventory adjustments. Excluding wholesale services, our EPS from continuing operations was $2.55 in 2014 compared to $2.47 in 2013. We had strong results in our distribution operations segment in 2014, with $35 million year-over-year improvement in EBIT. The earnings increase in distribution reflects weather that was 4% colder in 2014 than in the prior year in Illinois, where we have the most weather exposure. Our retail segments also performed well during the year operationally, although temporal hedge movements and LOCOM adjustments recorded mainly during the fourth quarter decreased our reported earnings in the segment and resulted in 2014 EBIT being flat compared to '13. We expect to recapture these accounting losses in 2015. 
Fourth quarter results can be found on Slide 6. I won't spend much time here, except to say that the steep decline in natural gas prices at the end of December resulted in mark-to-market hedge movements that impacted our wholesale and retail segments. We had mark-to-market gains net of LOCOM of $84 million at wholesale in the fourth quarter and net mark-to-market losses in LOCOM of $16 million at the retail segment. I'll speak to each of these in a few moments. 
Taking a closer look at each segment, starting on Slide 7. You can see the $35 million or 6% year-over-year EBIT improvement for the distribution segment. The main drivers of the increase were higher non-weather-related customer usage and customer growth as well as colder weather compared to the prior year and lower depreciation expense, which was the result of a change in depreciation rates for Nicor Gas that went into effect in August of 2013. We also had increased regulatory infrastructure revenue during the year, largely due to our Georgia programs. In 2014, we added approximately 34,000 net meters, an increase of more than 25% over 2013. Our O&M expenses in the distribution segment were up $12 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase largely reflects higher contractor expense related to pipeline compliance work and weather-related expenses. 
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 8. 2014 EBIT was flat to the prior year at $132 million. However, the strong operational performance and growth in the business during 2014 is masked by about $16 million of hedge losses and LOCOM inventory adjustments that occurred primarily in the fourth quarter. We offered fixed price contracts to some of our customers, and we hedged our price risk associated with these contracts in the forward market. The steep December natural gas price decline caused us to report mark-to-market losses that will reverse when we deliver the commodity to our customers in '15. Excluding these accounting movements, EBIT from our retail segment would have improved year-over-year by about 12%, in part due to colder than -- colder weather during the first quarter of 2014, which added about $5 million to earnings compared to 2013 or $14 million compared to normal weather. Importantly, we saw a growth in customer count in both our retail energy and retail services businesses, and our market share in Georgia remains stable. 
Turning to the wholesale services segment on Slide 9. 2014 was the strongest year ever for this business. EBIT was up over the prior year by $425 million. This record performance is due mainly to improved commercial activity related to our transportation storage positions primarily in the Northeast and Midwest regions during the first quarter of 2014. As you can see, commercial activity was $444 million in 2014 compared to $129 million in 2013. Further, we had pretty much the perfect series of events from an accounting perspective, in that much of the hedge losses we recorded in 2013 were realized in '14 as expected. Then at the end of the year, we recorded hedge gains associated with some of our 2015 and 2016 positions. This latter event will have the impact of dampening our expected 2015 GAAP earnings for wholesale, which we will talk more about in a few minutes. 
On Slide 10, you can see our results on an economic earnings basis. As you know, we focus on economic earnings in evaluating the performance of this business. This allows us to strip out the impacts of mark-to-market accounting and assign the generation of earnings activity to the period in which it was earned. Economic earnings for 2014 were $277 million compared to $69 million in 2013. 
Looking at the midstream segment on Slide 9 (sic) [Slide 11]. We had a couple of one-time items impacting results in both years. In 2014, we recorded a $10 million true-up of retaining fuel that is essentially non-reoccurring. And in 2013, we had the $8 million write-off related to the Sawgrass Storage facility. Excluding these items gives you a better look at operating performance for the segment. On this basis, EBIT was lower year-over-year by $5 million, due mainly to recontracting capacity at our storage facilities at reduced subscription work rates as well as slightly higher operating costs. While the segment remains challenged, we have seen some modest improvement in market rates and fundamentals in the recent months. 
You can see some of the balance sheet highlights on Slide 12. The combination of the sale of Tropical Shipping and the strong economic earnings generation at Sequent resulted in strong cash flows and a reduction in our short-term debt during 2014 as compared to the prior year. You can see this improvement in our debt-to-capitalization ratio, which was 55% at the end of 2014 compared to 57% at the end of 2013. 
Just to close out the internal controls issue that we described -- discussed last quarter, our previously disclosed material weakness was remediated as of December 31, 2014. On the financing side, we redeemed $200 million of maturing debt in January of this year using commercial paper and expect to refinance this debt with an issuance later this year. With the infrastructure and pipeline investments I mentioned earlier, we expect to be a bit more active in the debt markets over the next 2 years to fund these investments and to refinance existing maturing debt. To provide some protection in the potentially rising interest rate environment, we took advantage of the significant decline in Treasury rates during January of this year to lock in the underlying rates associated with some of our planned debt issuances over the next 2 years. As more fully described in our 10-K filing, we executed forward-starting interest rate swaps for a notional amount of $800 million in both 10- and 30-year tranches at very attractive underlying rates. 
I'll now turn the call over to John for his remarks."
252517,284649020,761227,"AGL Resources Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Southern Company Gas","Executives","Thank you, Drew, and good morning, everyone.

As Drew said, 2014 was an outstanding year for our company. Operationally, all of our segments performed well: steady improvements at distribution; growth at retail, excluding the accounting movements; and truly exceptional performance at wholesale. We know the timing of reported earnings for the wholesale business is hard to predict, but no matter how you evaluate it, 2014 was a record year for Sequent. Pete and his team have done a remarkable job managing our portfolio of assets in some periods of extreme volatility. Through the asset management agreements in place with our utilities, we returned $47 million in 2014 compared to $18 million in 2013 and $15 million in 2012. Our third-party asset management customers also have received significant revenue sharing, which is helping to further bolster Sequent's business and competitive position. 
When we have outsized earnings years like last year, it enables us to deploy surplus cash into investments such as the pipelines that have a stable return more in line with our utilities. We are able to fund our significant capital expenditure plan with no expectation for equity issuance in part as well as other strategic initiatives, such as the sale of Tropical Shipping. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'll shift to our forecasts. We expect to earn between $2.70 to $2.90 per share on a consolidated basis in 2015. Excluding wholesale, our EPS guidance range is between $2.65 and $2.75. You can see the specific EBIT expectations for each segment on this table and our guidance assumptions on Slide 14. As a reminder, we had weather-related and onetime benefits of $29 million in the distribution segment in 2014. So a normalized 2014 basis, is $552 million. In addition, our retail guidance includes the recapture of $16 million of hedge losses and LOCOM that we referred to earlier. And as Drew mentioned, due to booking hedge gains in 2014 related to some of our 2015 positions at wholesale, our wholesale EBIT expectation is lower than a typical year. That said, we still expect to generate economic earnings at wholesale of approximately $50 million. 
If you turn to Slide 15, you can see the main drivers of our guidance by segment. On a normalized basis, the midpoint of our guidance, excluding wholesale, represents nearly 12% year-over-year growth. If you further normalize for the mark-to-market changes in the retail segment, growth is about 6.5%. 
Slide 16 shows more detail of the year-over-year drivers for the distribution segment. The projected growth rate is 4.7%. The main drivers are increased margin from infrastructure programs, particularly Investing in Illinois and the Georgia STRIDE program, and additional new customer margin. These primary factors are offset by higher depreciation and pension expenses. 
Turning now to Slide 17. In addition to the 2015 outlook, we are updating our medium and long-term growth projections. As a result of the increased infrastructure spending and rate base investments, our pipeline investments and customer growth expectations, we are raising our target 3-year EPS growth rate to 5% to 8%, and our 5-year EPS growth target is now 6% to 9% or higher. We will provide more detail behind these projections at our Analyst Day that is scheduled for March 25 in New York. 
A few additional items to note on Slide 18. As mentioned, we are officially underway with our Investing in Illinois infrastructure program. We expect to spend approximately $200 million this year and $250 million in each of the next 2 years. 
Also, on our last call, we indicated that we expect to make a true-up filing in Georgia related to our Pipeline Replacement Program, or PRP. Next week, Atlanta Gas Light intends to file a petition for authorization to collect additional revenues necessary to fully recover the revenue requirement associated with the actual cost of investments it made through December 31, 2013, when PRP ended. In the petition, we will request approval to increase the current surcharge collected from customers under the STRIDE surcharge. Our final accounting for PRP program demonstrates that the actual program investments generate a revenue requirement in excess of the rate authorized by the commission due in part to our agreement to cap the surcharge in 2005. If you have any questions once the filing is made, please don't hesitate to contact us. 
Also listed here is a summary of the pipeline agreements that we have announced this year. With the exception of the Prairie State Pipeline, development of which is still under discussion, each project is in the prefiling process with FERC, and environmental reviews are underway. As Drew mentioned, these projects should benefit our utility customers by diversifying our supply portfolio and transporting low-cost shale gas in the Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey. And they should benefit our shareholders with stable returns in line with or slightly above our utility returns. We expect to see some earnings uplift in 2017, with acceleration in 2018 and 2019, as the projects are placed in service. 
Turning to our 2015 priorities on Slide 19. Our business strategy is consistent with prior years and representative of our safety and customer-focused steady growth culture. Our focus is to capitalize our margin-enhancing opportunities across all business units while ensuring efficient and safe operations. Several of our specific business objectives are detailed for you on the page.

Our performance during the year was driven by exceptionally strong results in the wholesale services business but also reflected good -- very good results in our utilities and our retail segment as well. Building on a strong year, we initiated 2015 earnings per share guidance of $2.70 to $2.90 on a consolidated basis and between $2.65 and $2.75 excluding wholesale. We also are raising our target for medium and long-term growth. John will discuss our forward-looking expectations in a few moments. 
Before I walk through some of the year-over-year drivers in each of the segments, I also want to note that we had a number of strategic successes during the year, which we've summarized for you on Slide 4. First, we entered into 3 agreements during 2014 to invest in partnerships to construct interstate pipelines that will benefit our customers in Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey. We plan to invest approximately $670 million in these projects over the next 4 years and expect to generate returns consistent with FERC-regulated pipeline projects, which are historically slightly higher than the state-regulated utility returns. We also closed on the sale of Tropical Shipping, which we acquired as part of the Nicor acquisition in 2011. The sale generated $225 million in after-tax proceeds and, importantly, allowed us to exit the business that was not core to our operations at a very attractive multiple of cash flow. We deployed $715 million of capital on our regulated utilities, of which approximately $165 million was under rider-based programs. We were successful during the year in obtaining regulatory approval in Illinois to launch what we call our Investing in Illinois program, which will support the replacement or renewal of infrastructure at Nicor Gas over a 9-year period. This system reliability program will allow us to invest between $200 million and $250 million annually under our rider program that effectively eliminates regulatory lag on collection traditionally associated with base rate recovery. We expect this investment, along with our normal investment and new customer growth, to nearly double our rate base for our largest utility over the next decade. 
As shown on Slide 5 of the presentation, earnings per share from continuing operations for 2014 were $4.71 compared to $2.45 in 2013. The year-over-year increase of 92% was driven primarily by record commercial activity in our wholesale business, combined with hedge gains during the year, net of lower cost of -- lower of cost or market, or LOCOM, inventory adjustments. Excluding wholesale services, our EPS from continuing operations was $2.55 in 2014 compared to $2.47 in 2013. We had strong results in our distribution operations segment in 2014, with $35 million year-over-year improvement in EBIT. The earnings increase in distribution reflects weather that was 4% colder in 2014 than in the prior year in Illinois, where we have the most weather exposure. Our retail segments also performed well during the year operationally, although temporal hedge movements and LOCOM adjustments recorded mainly during the fourth quarter decreased our reported earnings in the segment and resulted in 2014 EBIT being flat compared to '13. We expect to recapture these accounting losses in 2015. 
Fourth quarter results can be found on Slide 6. I won't spend much time here, except to say that the steep decline in natural gas prices at the end of December resulted in mark-to-market hedge movements that impacted our wholesale and retail segments. We had mark-to-market gains net of LOCOM of $84 million at wholesale in the fourth quarter and net mark-to-market losses in LOCOM of $16 million at the retail segment. I'll speak to each of these in a few moments. 
Taking a closer look at each segment, starting on Slide 7. You can see the $35 million or 6% year-over-year EBIT improvement for the distribution segment. The main drivers of the increase were higher non-weather-related customer usage and customer growth as well as colder weather compared to the prior year and lower depreciation expense, which was the result of a change in depreciation rates for Nicor Gas that went into effect in August of 2013. We also had increased regulatory infrastructure revenue during the year, largely due to our Georgia programs. In 2014, we added approximately 34,000 net meters, an increase of more than 25% over 2013. Our O&M expenses in the distribution segment were up $12 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase largely reflects higher contractor expense related to pipeline compliance work and weather-related expenses. 
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 8. 2014 EBIT was flat to the prior year at $132 million. However, the strong operational performance and growth in the business during 2014 is masked by about $16 million of hedge losses and LOCOM inventory adjustments that occurred primarily in the fourth quarter. We offered fixed price contracts to some of our customers, and we hedged our price risk associated with these contracts in the forward market. The steep December natural gas price decline caused us to report mark-to-market losses that will reverse when we deliver the commodity to our customers in '15. Excluding these accounting movements, EBIT from our retail segment would have improved year-over-year by about 12%, in part due to colder than -- colder weather during the first quarter of 2014, which added about $5 million to earnings compared to 2013 or $14 million compared to normal weather. Importantly, we saw a growth in customer count in both our retail energy and retail services businesses, and our market share in Georgia remains stable. 
Turning to the wholesale services segment on Slide 9. 2014 was the strongest year ever for this business. EBIT was up over the prior year by $425 million. This record performance is due mainly to improved commercial activity related to our transportation storage positions primarily in the Northeast and Midwest regions during the first quarter of 2014. As you can see, commercial activity was $444 million in 2014 compared to $129 million in 2013. Further, we had pretty much the perfect series of events from an accounting perspective, in that much of the hedge losses we recorded in 2013 were realized in '14 as expected. Then at the end of the year, we recorded hedge gains associated with some of our 2015 and 2016 positions. This latter event will have the impact of dampening our expected 2015 GAAP earnings for wholesale, which we will talk more about in a few minutes. 
On Slide 10, you can see our results on an economic earnings basis. As you know, we focus on economic earnings in evaluating the performance of this business. This allows us to strip out the impacts of mark-to-market accounting and assign the generation of earnings activity to the period in which it was earned. Economic earnings for 2014 were $277 million compared to $69 million in 2013. 
Looking at the midstream segment on Slide 9 (sic) [Slide 11]. We had a couple of one-time items impacting results in both years. In 2014, we recorded a $10 million true-up of retaining fuel that is essentially non-reoccurring. And in 2013, we had the $8 million write-off related to the Sawgrass Storage facility. Excluding these items gives you a better look at operating performance for the segment. On this basis, EBIT was lower year-over-year by $5 million, due mainly to recontracting capacity at our storage facilities at reduced subscription work rates as well as slightly higher operating costs. While the segment remains challenged, we have seen some modest improvement in market rates and fundamentals in the recent months. 
You can see some of the balance sheet highlights on Slide 12. The combination of the sale of Tropical Shipping and the strong economic earnings generation at Sequent resulted in strong cash flows and a reduction in our short-term debt during 2014 as compared to the prior year. You can see this improvement in our debt-to-capitalization ratio, which was 55% at the end of 2014 compared to 57% at the end of 2013. 
Just to close out the internal controls issue that we described -- discussed last quarter, our previously disclosed material weakness was remediated as of December 31, 2014. On the financing side, we redeemed $200 million of maturing debt in January of this year using commercial paper and expect to refinance this debt with an issuance later this year. With the infrastructure and pipeline investments I mentioned earlier, we expect to be a bit more active in the debt markets over the next 2 years to fund these investments and to refinance existing maturing debt. To provide some protection in the potentially rising interest rate environment, we took advantage of the significant decline in Treasury rates during January of this year to lock in the underlying rates associated with some of our planned debt issuances over the next 2 years. As more fully described in our 10-K filing, we executed forward-starting interest rate swaps for a notional amount of $800 million in both 10- and 30-year tranches at very attractive underlying rates. 
I'll now turn the call over to John for his remarks."
252517,284649020,762051,"AGL Resources Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Southern Company Gas","Executives","Thank you, Drew, and good morning, everyone.

As Drew said, 2014 was an outstanding year for our company. Operationally, all of our segments performed well: steady improvements at distribution; growth at retail, excluding the accounting movements; and truly exceptional performance at wholesale. We know the timing of reported earnings for the wholesale business is hard to predict, but no matter how you evaluate it, 2014 was a record year for Sequent. Pete and his team have done a remarkable job managing our portfolio of assets in some periods of extreme volatility. Through the asset management agreements in place with our utilities, we returned $47 million in 2014 compared to $18 million in 2013 and $15 million in 2012. Our third-party asset management customers also have received significant revenue sharing, which is helping to further bolster Sequent's business and competitive position. 
When we have outsized earnings years like last year, it enables us to deploy surplus cash into investments such as the pipelines that have a stable return more in line with our utilities. We are able to fund our significant capital expenditure plan with no expectation for equity issuance in part as well as other strategic initiatives, such as the sale of Tropical Shipping. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'll shift to our forecasts. We expect to earn between $2.70 to $2.90 per share on a consolidated basis in 2015. Excluding wholesale, our EPS guidance range is between $2.65 and $2.75. You can see the specific EBIT expectations for each segment on this table and our guidance assumptions on Slide 14. As a reminder, we had weather-related and onetime benefits of $29 million in the distribution segment in 2014. So a normalized 2014 basis, is $552 million. In addition, our retail guidance includes the recapture of $16 million of hedge losses and LOCOM that we referred to earlier. And as Drew mentioned, due to booking hedge gains in 2014 related to some of our 2015 positions at wholesale, our wholesale EBIT expectation is lower than a typical year. That said, we still expect to generate economic earnings at wholesale of approximately $50 million. 
If you turn to Slide 15, you can see the main drivers of our guidance by segment. On a normalized basis, the midpoint of our guidance, excluding wholesale, represents nearly 12% year-over-year growth. If you further normalize for the mark-to-market changes in the retail segment, growth is about 6.5%. 
Slide 16 shows more detail of the year-over-year drivers for the distribution segment. The projected growth rate is 4.7%. The main drivers are increased margin from infrastructure programs, particularly Investing in Illinois and the Georgia STRIDE program, and additional new customer margin. These primary factors are offset by higher depreciation and pension expenses. 
Turning now to Slide 17. In addition to the 2015 outlook, we are updating our medium and long-term growth projections. As a result of the increased infrastructure spending and rate base investments, our pipeline investments and customer growth expectations, we are raising our target 3-year EPS growth rate to 5% to 8%, and our 5-year EPS growth target is now 6% to 9% or higher. We will provide more detail behind these projections at our Analyst Day that is scheduled for March 25 in New York. 
A few additional items to note on Slide 18. As mentioned, we are officially underway with our Investing in Illinois infrastructure program. We expect to spend approximately $200 million this year and $250 million in each of the next 2 years. 
Also, on our last call, we indicated that we expect to make a true-up filing in Georgia related to our Pipeline Replacement Program, or PRP. Next week, Atlanta Gas Light intends to file a petition for authorization to collect additional revenues necessary to fully recover the revenue requirement associated with the actual cost of investments it made through December 31, 2013, when PRP ended. In the petition, we will request approval to increase the current surcharge collected from customers under the STRIDE surcharge. Our final accounting for PRP program demonstrates that the actual program investments generate a revenue requirement in excess of the rate authorized by the commission due in part to our agreement to cap the surcharge in 2005. If you have any questions once the filing is made, please don't hesitate to contact us. 
Also listed here is a summary of the pipeline agreements that we have announced this year. With the exception of the Prairie State Pipeline, development of which is still under discussion, each project is in the prefiling process with FERC, and environmental reviews are underway. As Drew mentioned, these projects should benefit our utility customers by diversifying our supply portfolio and transporting low-cost shale gas in the Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey. And they should benefit our shareholders with stable returns in line with or slightly above our utility returns. We expect to see some earnings uplift in 2017, with acceleration in 2018 and 2019, as the projects are placed in service. 
Turning to our 2015 priorities on Slide 19. Our business strategy is consistent with prior years and representative of our safety and customer-focused steady growth culture. Our focus is to capitalize our margin-enhancing opportunities across all business units while ensuring efficient and safe operations. Several of our specific business objectives are detailed for you on the page. 
I'm grateful to our employees for their continued hard work and dedication as we generated record results and executed on several strategic initiatives during the year. I want to thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL Resources.

AGL Resources had an excellent first quarter across all business segments. And as we discussed at our Analyst Day last month, we've increased our full year guidance to reflect these strong results. The main driv",898,"Thanks, Sara, and good afternoon, everyone. AGL Resources had an excellent first quarter across all business segments. And as we discussed at our Analyst Day last month, we've increased our full year guidance to reflect these strong results. The main driver of the improvement relevant to our initial expectations was colder-than-normal weather across distribution and retail as well as better-than-expected commercial activity in our wholesale business. 
As a reminder, for the full year, we expect to report consolidated earnings per share of between $2.85 and $3.10. Excluding wholesale services, we expect EPS to be between $2.70 and $2.80. 
Turning to Slide 4. We have provided a high-level view of consolidated EPS, EPS excluding wholesale and weather-normalized EPS. The gray bar, weather-normalized EPS, is most indicative of operating performance in our core businesses. You can see here that EPS on this basis was up $0.08 year-over-year. 
On Slide 5, you will see a more detailed view of our year-over-year results. Our consolidated earnings per share of $1.62 were lower than the first quarter of 2014 as expected, given that we had record earnings in last year's first quarter. 
You'll recall that last year's result were driven by exceptional wholesale services performance as well as strong distribution and retail earnings related to extreme prolonged cold and volatility associated with last year's polar vortex. 
Looking specifically at the weather impacts across distribution and retail. First quarter 2015 EPS includes a weather benefit of approximately $0.10, and last year's first quarter EPS included a weather benefit of approximately $0.16. We also realized the $0.07 benefited distribution related to higher infrastructure investment margin and increased margin related to customer growth. 
On the expense side, total operating expenses were lower this year by 3%, driven mainly by lower incentive compensation expense at wholesale services, where we pay up fixed percentage of economic earnings. 
Taking a closer look at each segment, starting with Slide 6. You can see that EBIT for the distribution segment was essentially in line with last year's first quarter. This reflects whether that was colder than normal in the first quarter of this year but warmer than last year. When you weather normalized, what stands out is EBIT growth of 3%, driven primarily by higher EBIT from our infrastructure programs and the customer growth that I just mentioned. 
Our O&M expenses in the distribution segment were in line with last year, and total operating expense was up modestly, driven by higher depreciation. 
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 7. First quarter 2015 EBIT was higher by $7 million. This is reflective of weather that was colder than normal in 2015 but warmer than 2014. When you weather normalized EBIT for the retail segment was higher by $11 million or 17%. This favorability is due to the partial reversal of mark-to-market hedge losses and lower of cost to market adjustments of $16 million that we recorded at the end of 2014 as well as strong performance from our expanded markets and improved Georgia retail margins. 
Turning to wholesale services on Slide 8. As I mentioned, 2014 was the strongest year ever for this business, with much of the earnings coming in the first quarter. As a reminder, last year's earnings were driven by volatility associated with record cold weather as well as reversal of mark-to-market hedge losses that we had recorded in prior periods. As a result, while we had excellent performance in the first quarter of this year relative to plan, EBIT was substantially lower when compared to last year. 
You can see here on the slide the difference in commercial activity year-over-year as well as the impact of mark-to-market hedge movements net of LOCOM. Commercial activity of $113 million represents our second-best quarter ever at Sequent, behind only last year's first quarter. Temporarily, muting this year's strong results were hedge losses in the first quarter of $32 million net of LOCOM, which we expect to realize in future periods, including approximately half in 2015. 
On an economic earnings basis, we generated $89 million in the first quarter, which compares very favorably to our average annual expectation of approximately $50 million, which was our economic earnings expectation at the start of the year. 
Our strong performance continues to be driven by a combination of weather-driven volatility, pipeline and storage constraints in the Northeast region, asset management for our utilities and third parties, producers services and gas supply to power generators. 
Looking at the midstream segment results on Slide 9. EBIT improved by $1 million year-over-year. The fundamentals around this business have improved slightly, but as we discussed on the Analyst Day, over the course of the 5-year plan, the real driver for this segment going forward will be our investment in interstate pipelines. 
You can see some of the balance sheet highlights on Slide 10. Our debt balances are lower than in the prior year due to strong earnings across our businesses and the sale of Tropical Shipping last year. Our debt to cap was 50% at the end of the quarter compared to 54% at the same time last year. 
From a financing perspective, we continue to anticipate an estimated $300 million bond issuance this fall, with the proceeds being used to refinance the $200 million January 2015 maturity we redeemed and also to fund higher capital expenditures. 
I'll now turn the call over to John for his remarks."

I will briefly touch on a couple of regulatory items before we take your questions. 
Starting with Georgia. I just want to remind you that in February, we submitted a true-up filing requesting approval to recover $178 million associated with our Georgia pipeline replacement program that concluded in December of 2013. This true-up filing was required by the commission upon completion of the PRP rider program. We are working with the commission and its staff to complete the review as quickly as possible. 
On another regulatory matter in Georgia, in March, the commission approved the synergy sharing filings that we made last year related to the Nicor transaction. Starting in June of this year, we will share approximately $5 million annually with customers in Georgia. This outcome was expected and is embedded in our 5-year plan. 
Moving to Florida. Hack mentioned at the Analyst Day that we expected to file for an infrastructure replacement program at Florida City Gas. We made our filing this month, and it calls for investment of approximately $10 million annually for a 10-year period. If approved, this program would be similar to infrastructural replacement programs in other jurisdictions, and that there would be minimal regulatory lag associated with the recovery of our investments. We expect the ruling by year end. 
While the future earnings impact is expected to be modest, it does represent upside to our 5-year plan and is consistent with our strategic objective to focus on investing in assets that improve the quality of our operating systems while generating stable, predictable returns for our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 12. Just to recap. We had an excellent first quarter that drove an increase to our expected full year EPS on both the consolidated basis and excluding wholesale basis. We continue to execute on our capital investment plans and expect to generate average annual growth of 6% to 9% over the next 5 years. 
I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work, particularly during another cold winter and their ability to focus today on initiatives that will allow us to successfully execute on our strategic initiatives for the future.  Thank you for your time today, and for your continued interest in AGL Resources.

But I was hoping maybe just to focus in on Sequent for a second with respect to certainly great first quarter. We now have this spread of $30 million or so for the year between $80 million and $110 million. And I'm trying to kind of get just a better sense of as you all look at that spread, typically, we think of neutral flat second quarter, third quarter, good fourth quarter. Is the spread the ability to continue capturing market here in April and May as volatility has continued? Or is it more just a normal seasonal, if you will, we don't know what fourth quarter is going to bring. So we keep it a wide spread."

And good afternoon, everyone.AGL Resources had an excellent first quarter across all business segments. And as we discussed at our Analyst Day last month, we've increased our full year guidance to reflect these strong results. The main dr",896,"Thanks, Sarah. And good afternoon, everyone.
AGL Resources had an excellent first quarter across all business segments. And as we discussed at our Analyst Day last month, we've increased our full year guidance to reflect these strong results. The main driver of the improvement relevant to our initial expectations was colder-than-normal weather across distribution and retail, as well as better-than-expected commercial activity in our wholesale business.
As a reminder, for the full year, we expect to report consolidated earnings per share of between $2.85 and $3.10. Excluding wholesale services, we expect EPS to be between $2.70 and $2.80.
Turning to Slide 4. We have provided a high-level view of consolidated EPS, EPS excluding wholesale and weather-normalized EPS. The gray bar, weather-normalized EPS, is most indicative of operating performance in our core businesses. You can see here that EPS on this basis was up $0.08 year-over-year.
On Slides -- 5, you will see a more detailed view of our year-over-year results. Our consolidated earnings per share of $1.62 were lower than the first quarter of 2014, as expected, given that we had record earnings in last year's first quarter. You'll recall that last year's results were driven by exceptional wholesale services performance as well as strong distribution and retail earnings related to extreme, prolonged cold and volatility associated with last year's polar vortex.
Looking specifically at the weather impacts across distribution and retail. First quarter 2015 EPS includes a weather benefit of approximately $0.10, and last year's first quarter EPS included a weather benefit of approximately $0.16. We also realized a $0.07 benefit at distribution related to higher infrastructure investment margin and increased margin related to customer growth.
On the expense side, total operating expenses were lower this year by 3%, driven mainly by lower incentive compensation expense at wholesale services, where we pay a fixed percentage of economic earnings.
Taking a closer look at each segment, starting with Slide 6. You can see that EBIT for the distribution segment was essentially in line with last year's first quarter. This reflects weather that was colder than normal in the first quarter of this year but warmer than last year. When you weather-normalize, what stands out is EBIT growth of 3% driven primarily by higher EBIT from our infrastructure programs and the customer growth I just mentioned.
Our O&M expenses in the distribution segment were in line with last year, and total operating expense was up modestly, driven by higher depreciation.
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 7. First quarter 2015 EBIT was higher by $7 million. This is reflective of weather that was colder than normal in 2015 but warmer than 2014. When you weather-normalize, EBIT for the retail segment was higher by $11 million or 17%. This favorability is due to the partial reversal of mark-to-market hedge losses and lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments of $16 million that we recorded at the end of 2014, as well as strong performance from our expanded markets and improved Georgia retail margins.
Turning to wholesale services on Slide 8. As I mentioned, 2014 was the strongest year ever for this business, with much of the earnings coming in the first quarter. As a reminder, last year's earnings were driven by volatility associated with record cold weather as well as reversal of mark-to-market hedge losses that we had recorded in prior periods. As a result, while we had excellent performance in the first quarter of this year relative to plan, EBIT was substantially lower than -- when compared to last year.
You can see here on the slide the difference in commercial activity year-over-year as well as the impact of mark-to-market hedge movements, net of LOCOM. Commercial activity of $113 million was -- represents our second best quarter ever at Sequent, behind only last year's first quarter. Temporarily muting this year's strong results were hedge losses in the first quarter of $32 million, net of LOCOM, which we expect to realize in future periods, including approximately half in 2015.
On an economic earnings basis, we generated $89 million in the first quarter, which compares very favorably to our average annual expectation of approximately $50 million, which was our economic earnings expectation at the start of the year. Our strong performance continues to be driven by a combination of weather-driven volatility, pipeline and storage constraints in the Northeast region, asset management for our utilities in third parties, producer services and gas supply to power generators.
Looking at the midstream segment results on Slide 9. EBIT improved by $1 million year-over-year. The fundamentals around this business have improved slightly, but as we discussed on the Analyst Day, over the course of the 5-year plan, the real driver for this segment going forward will be our investment in interstate pipelines.
You can see some of the balance sheet highlights on Slide 10. Our debt balances are lower than in the prior year due to strong earnings across our businesses and the sale of Tropical Shipping last year. Our debt-to-cap was 50% at the end of the quarter compared to 54% at the same time last year. From a financing perspective, we continue to anticipate an estimated $300 million bond issuance this fall, with the proceeds being used to refinance the $200 million January 2015 maturity we redeemed and also to fund higher capital expenditures.
I'll now turn the call over to John for his remarks."

As Drew said, our first quarter was strong, and we are off to an excellent start this year. I will briefly touch on a couple of regulatory items before we take your questions.
Starting with Georgia, I just want to remind you that, in February, we submitted a true-up filing requesting approval to recover $178 million associated with our Georgia pipeline replacement program that concluded in December of 2013. This true-up filing was required by the commission upon completion of the PRP rider program. We are working with the commission and its staff to complete the review as quickly as possible.
On another regulatory matter in Georgia, in March, the commission approved the synergy-sharing filing that we made last year related to the Nicor transaction. Starting in June of this year, we will share approximately $5 million annually with customers in Georgia. This outcome was expected and is embedded in our 5-year plan.
Moving to Florida. Hank mentioned at the Analyst Day that we expected to file for an infrastructure replacement program at Florida City Gas. We made our filing this month, and it calls for investment of approximately $10 million annually for a 10-year period. If approved, this program would be similar to infrastructural replacement programs in other jurisdictions in that there would be minimal regulatory lag associated with the recovery of our investments. We expect a ruling by year-end. While the future earnings impact is expected to be modest, it does represent upside to our 5-year plan and is consistent with our strategic objective to focus on investing in assets that improve the quality of our operating systems while generating stable, predictable returns for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 12, just to recap. We had an excellent first quarter that drove an increase to our expected full year EPS on both a consolidated basis and excluding wholesale basis. We continue to execute on our capital investment plans and expect to generate average annual growth of 6% to 9% over the next 5 years.
I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work, particularly during another cold winter, and their ability to focus today on initiatives that will allow us to successfully execute on our strategic initiatives for the future.
Thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL Resources.
Operator, I'll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."

We now have this spread of $30 million or so for the year, between $80 million and $110 million. And I'm trying to kind of get just a better sense of, as you all look at that spread, typically we think of a neutral flat second quarter, third quarter; good fourth quarter. Is the spread the ability to continue capturing market here in April and May as volatility has continued? Or is it more just the normal seasonal, if you will?

And good afternoon, everyone.AGL Resources had an excellent first quarter across all business segments.

AGL Resources had an excellent first quarter across all business segments. And as we discussed at our Analyst Day last month, we've increased our full year guidance to reflect these strong results. The main driver of the improvement relevant to our initial expectations was colder-than-normal weather across distribution and retail, as well as better-than-expected commercial activity in our wholesale business.
As a reminder, for the full year, we expect to report consolidated earnings per share of between $2.85 and $3.10. Excluding wholesale services, we expect EPS to be between $2.70 and $2.80.
Turning to Slide 4. We have provided a high-level view of consolidated EPS, EPS excluding wholesale and weather-normalized EPS. The gray bar, weather-normalized EPS, is most indicative of operating performance in our core businesses. You can see here that EPS on this basis was up $0.08 year-over-year.
On Slides -- 5, you will see a more detailed view of our year-over-year results. Our consolidated earnings per share of $1.62 were lower than the first quarter of 2014, as expected, given that we had record earnings in last year's first quarter. You'll recall that last year's results were driven by exceptional wholesale services performance as well as strong distribution and retail earnings related to extreme, prolonged cold and volatility associated with last year's polar vortex.
Looking specifically at the weather impacts across distribution and retail. First quarter 2015 EPS includes a weather benefit of approximately $0.10, and last year's first quarter EPS included a weather benefit of approximately $0.16. We also realized a $0.07 benefit at distribution related to higher infrastructure investment margin and increased margin related to customer growth.
On the expense side, total operating expenses were lower this year by 3%, driven mainly by lower incentive compensation expense at wholesale services, where we pay a fixed percentage of economic earnings.
Taking a closer look at each segment, starting with Slide 6. You can see that EBIT for the distribution segment was essentially in line with last year's first quarter. This reflects weather that was colder than normal in the first quarter of this year but warmer than last year. When you weather-normalize, what stands out is EBIT growth of 3% driven primarily by higher EBIT from our infrastructure programs and the customer growth I just mentioned.
Our O&M expenses in the distribution segment were in line with last year, and total operating expense was up modestly, driven by higher depreciation.
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 7. First quarter 2015 EBIT was higher by $7 million. This is reflective of weather that was colder than normal in 2015 but warmer than 2014. When you weather-normalize, EBIT for the retail segment was higher by $11 million or 17%. This favorability is due to the partial reversal of mark-to-market hedge losses and lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments of $16 million that we recorded at the end of 2014, as well as strong performance from our expanded markets and improved Georgia retail margins.
Turning to wholesale services on Slide 8. As I mentioned, 2014 was the strongest year ever for this business, with much of the earnings coming in the first quarter. As a reminder, last year's earnings were driven by volatility associated with record cold weather as well as reversal of mark-to-market hedge losses that we had recorded in prior periods. As a result, while we had excellent performance in the first quarter of this year relative to plan, EBIT was substantially lower than -- when compared to last year.
You can see here on the slide the difference in commercial activity year-over-year as well as the impact of mark-to-market hedge movements, net of LOCOM. Commercial activity of $113 million was -- represents our second best quarter ever at Sequent, behind only last year's first quarter. Temporarily muting this year's strong results were hedge losses in the first quarter of $32 million, net of LOCOM, which we expect to realize in future periods, including approximately half in 2015.
On an economic earnings basis, we generated $89 million in the first quarter, which compares very favorably to our average annual expectation of approximately $50 million, which was our economic earnings expectation at the start of the year. Our strong performance continues to be driven by a combination of weather-driven volatility, pipeline and storage constraints in the Northeast region, asset management for our utilities in third parties, producer services and gas supply to power generators.
Looking at the midstream segment results on Slide 9. EBIT improved by $1 million year-over-year. The fundamentals around this business have improved slightly, but as we discussed on the Analyst Day, over the course of the 5-year plan, the real driver for this segment going forward will be our investment in interstate pipelines.
You can see some of the balance sheet highlights on Slide 10. Our debt balances are lower than in the prior year due to strong earnings across our businesses and the sale of Tropical Shipping last year. Our debt-to-cap was 50% at the end of the quarter compared to 54% at the same time last year. From a financing perspective, we continue to anticipate an estimated $300 million bond issuance this fall, with the proceeds being used to refinance the $200 million January 2015 maturity we redeemed and also to fund higher capital expenditures.
I'll now turn the call over to John for his remarks."

As Drew said, our first quarter was strong, and we are off to an excellent start this year. I will briefly touch on a couple of regulatory items before we take your questions.
Starting with Georgia, I just want to remind you that, in February, we submitted a true-up filing requesting approval to recover $178 million associated with our Georgia pipeline replacement program that concluded in December of 2013. This true-up filing was required by the commission upon completion of the PRP rider program. We are working with the commission and its staff to complete the review as quickly as possible.
On another regulatory matter in Georgia, in March, the commission approved the synergy-sharing filing that we made last year related to the Nicor transaction. Starting in June of this year, we will share approximately $5 million annually with customers in Georgia. This outcome was expected and is embedded in our 5-year plan.
Moving to Florida. Hank mentioned at the Analyst Day that we expected to file for an infrastructure replacement program at Florida City Gas. We made our filing this month, and it calls for investment of approximately $10 million annually for a 10-year period. If approved, this program would be similar to infrastructural replacement programs in other jurisdictions in that there would be minimal regulatory lag associated with the recovery of our investments. We expect a ruling by year-end. While the future earnings impact is expected to be modest, it does represent upside to our 5-year plan and is consistent with our strategic objective to focus on investing in assets that improve the quality of our operating systems while generating stable, predictable returns for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 12, just to recap. We had an excellent first quarter that drove an increase to our expected full year EPS on both a consolidated basis and excluding wholesale basis. We continue to execute on our capital investment plans and expect to generate average annual growth of 6% to 9% over the next 5 years.
I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work, particularly during another cold winter, and their ability to focus today on initiatives that will allow us to successfully execute on our strategic initiatives for the future.
Thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL Resources.

We now have this spread of $30 million or so for the year, between $80 million and $110 million. And I'm trying to kind of get just a better sense of, as you all look at that spread, typically we think of a neutral flat second quarter, third quarter; good fourth quarter. Is the spread the ability to continue capturing market here in April and May as volatility has continued? Or is it more just the normal seasonal, if you will? We don't know what fourth quarter is going to bring, so we keep it a wide spread."

Another part of the range will be, when you get into fourth quarter, whether that's going to be normal or a little colder than normal, and so the midpoint of that range is normal-weather oriented. And then the other, probably third, major component is the ongoing constraints in the Marcellus. Will those constraints be more advantageous for our transportation and storage portfolio or consistent with where we're building the midpoint? So those are 3 kind of major components for that range."

April, there's no major event-driven activity economically right now at this point in time. What could be upside to the summertime is the storage values potentially getting better. We are seeing storage values better this year than last year. Spreads are widening between summer and winter, so that could be some upside. Some challenges to that just could be some milder weather in the summertime, so -- but right now, I'd say we're right in-line to our expectations."

Before getting into the details of the quarter, I would like to congratulate Drew, and Pete on their new leadership roles for our company.

Before getting into the details of the quarter, I would like to congratulate Drew, and Pete on their new leadership roles for our company. In May, we announced that Drew would be taking on new responsibilities as our President and Chief Operating Officer, that Beth would become Chief Financial Officer and that Pete would assume oversight for all of our nonregulated businesses. We have a very deep and experienced bench of managers at AGL, and these changes allow us to take greater advantage of their talents. Over the coming months, we look forward to these executive spending time with the investment community in their new roles.
Moving on to the quarter, starting with Slide 3 of our presentation, we had a very solid though seasonally quite second quarter across all of our business segments. Quarterly earnings per share of $0.35 on a consolidated basis and $0.39 excluding wholesale services were in line with our expectation. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance target of $2.85 to $3.10 on a consolidated basis and $2.70 to $2.80 excluding wholesale services. As a reminder, we raised our guidance targets in March following a colder-than-normal start to the year.
Turning to Slide 4, I want to highlight our operational performance year-to-date. Excluding the wholesale services segment, which had a record 2014, our EPS is higher by $0.05 year-to-date. However, some strong fundamentals are masked by weather impacts on our distribution and retail businesses. Excluding $0.08 of whether benefit through June of this year and $0.17 of benefit to the same period last year, our EPS is higher by $0.14 or 9%. The favorability is driven by a number of factors including higher margin for infrastructure investment program, customer growth and well-managed operating expenses. Strategically, we are executing on all fronts with a robust capital investment program we laid out for you at our Analyst Day a few months ago. As such, our targeted 5-year EPS growth Drew will provide additional details on our key utility and pipeline initiatives in just a few minutes. With that, I will turn the call over to our newly minted Chief Financial Officer, Beth Reese."

I'm happy to be participating in our first earnings call as AGL's CFO, and I look forward to meeting many of you in person in the coming weeks and months. As John mentioned, we had solid quarter across all business segment, with results in line with our expectation. 
Turning to Slide 5, our consolidated EPS declined year-over-year by 27%, but you will recall that last year's results were driven by exceptional wholesale services performance. In fact, the second quarter of 2014 was the strongest second quarter in wholesale's history. Excluding wholesale, earnings per share for the second quarter were higher by $0.03 or 8% despite weather was warmer-than-normal during the quarter. Looking specifically as the weather impact across distribution and retail, second quarter 2015 EPS included a negative weather impact of approximately $0.02, while last year's second quarter EPS included a whether benefit of a $0.01. So once you take out weather impact and just look at the underlying performance of the business, the real story is a $0.06 improvement over last year, driven largely by margin improvement in the distribution segment, related to higher infrastructure and customer growth, offset by higher pension and depreciation expense, both of which were expected. In addition, we have some favorability in the midstream segment year-over-year related to the absence of a one-time throughout the 2014.
On Slide 6, you can see our results through June, again, a positive story with EPS excluding wholesales up 3% year-to-date, and as John mentioned, up 9% normalized for weather impact. Taking a closer look at each segment starting with Slide 7, you can see that EBIT for the distribution segment was down just slightly from last year's second quarter. Our utility is performing well operationally, with margin from infrastructure investment program and customer growth driving our results year-to-date. Our customer count is higher by over 0.5% and we're seeing a positive growth trend across our service territory. Year-to-date our O&M expenses in the distribution segment are up just 1% compared to last year and total operating expense was up modestly driven by higher depreciation.
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 8, second quarter 2015 a EBIT was in line with the last year's second quarter. This is reflective of weather that was warmer-than-normal in the second quarter of this year. When you weather-normalize quarterly EBIT for the retail segment was higher by 19%. Year-to-date, weather-normalized EBIT is higher by $14 million. This year-to-date favorability is due to the partial reversal of mark-to-market hedge losses and a lower cost to market adjustment of $16 million that we reported at the end of 2014 as well as slightly lower operating expense.
Turning to wholesale services on Slide 9. As I mentioned, 2014 was the strongest year ever for this business, including the strongest second quarter in its history. On the GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $8 million for the quarter, as compared to a gain of $24 million last year. Economic earnings for the quarter were $2 million, compared to an unusually robust $9 million last year. Typically we expect to report an EBIT loss with roughly breakeven economic earnings for the second quarter due to the seasonality of this business, and our results this year were actually better than our expectations driven by positive commercial activity.
Year-to-date, our economic earnings are $91 million, which compares very favorably to our average annual expectation of approximately $50 million. Our strong performance continue to be driven by a combination of weather-related volatility, pipeline and storage constraints in the Northeast region, asset management for our utilities and third parties, producer services and provide gas supply to power generators. We remain on track to achieve economic earnings of between $80 million and $110 million this year with GAAP EBIT of $40 million to $50 million expected.
Looking at the midstream segment results on Slide 10, EBIT improved by $5 million in second quarter compared to last year. This primary driver is the absence of the true up expense that we incurred in 2014. The fundamentals around this business has improved slightly, but as we discussed that will stay over the course of our 5-year plan, the real driver for this segment going forward will be our investments in interstate pipeline. 
You can see some of the balance sheet highlights on Slide 11. Our debt balances sale of Tropical Shipping last year and lower gas Our debt to capital is 49% at the end of the quarter compared to 51% at the same time last year. From a financing perspective, we continue to anticipate an estimated $300 million bond issuance this fall, with being used to refinance the $200 million January 2015 maturity that we redeemed and higher capital expenditures. Finally, you may have seen that on July 22, Moody's placed the rating of AGL Capital Corporation on review for possible downgrade. Our AGL Capital rating with Moody's is A3, and we would anticipate it being lover to 1 notch to be BAA1 if they take the actions they have signaled. The profitability of a 1 notch downgrade has been on our watch list and was not unexpected given the robust capital investment plan that we laid out earlier this year related to our utility and pipeline investments. Prior to a broad industry upgrade in 2014, we had been in this BAA1 category for many years, which was reflective of our cash flow coverage metrics, and we do not view this potential action is problematic from the standpoint of our expected upcoming financing activity.
As part of this review, Moody's has affirmed the A2 issue a rating for and importantly, affirms that our commercial paper ratings are not under review. Thank you for your time this morning, and now I'll now turn it over to Drew for some strategic update."

After reviewing the quarterly financial results with you for 38th quarters at AGL, I'm more than happy to pass the torch. Well done. Beth and I look forward to working with you closely -- working closely together in our new roles and spending time on the road talking with all of you. As John said, it was a quite quarter, so my remarks will be short. 
On Slide 12, you will find an update on some of our strategic initiatives of the utilities in particular. Starting at Illinois, as you know, this is the first full year of our investing in Illinois infrastructure program under which we expect to spend between $200 million and $300 million scheduled with approximately $75 million deployed through June, with our focus on some of the oldest pipe in the system. Our capital rate base commissioning is also ahead of schedule in Illinois, which is a key threshold we must meet before applying capital to the program. In Georgia, no update to provide at this juncture, but just a reminder that in February, we submitted a true-up filing requesting approval to recover a $178 million associated with our Georgia pipeline replacement program that concluded in December 2013. We are working with the commissioning and its staff to complete the review as quickly as possible. 
In Virginia, we continue to negotiate an agreement that would allow Virginia Natural Gas to invest in proven natural gas reserves in Marcellus shale region, which would help us provide long-term price stability for BMG customers. Assuming that we reach an acceptable agreement, we would expect to file a proposal with Virginia's State Corporation Commission in the third. For example, Town Gas, a system that is well over a 100 years old, we have more than 600 miles of steel and cast iron that needs to replace in order to modernize our system. AGL has been an industry-leader in pipeline replacement for nearly 15 years, and we've made significant progress on upgrading and modernizing our system, but we still have some work to do. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'll give you a brief review of the 3 interstate pipeline projects in which we're participating as both an investor and a utility customer. For the Dalton project in Georgia, the FERC application was filed in March, designed, surveys and land acquisition are underway. On the project, the partners are expected to file with FERC later this year. Surveys with Atlanta coast, the FERC filing is also expected later this year, design and surveys are underway and community meetings are ongoing. As a reminder, these projects have in-service states in the 2017 to 2018 timeframe. Our partners projects are doing an excellent job leading us to through the community meetings, locking in construction cost, seeking regulatory approvals and keeping us on track to meet our target. Importantly, each project is nearly a 100% contracted with long-term utility-based customers including our own. 
Finally, on pipeline, something that we discussed within the past, we are still working with to develop an appropriately scaled and pipeline that would meet the needs of the Chicago area market participants. No concrete updates to provide at this time, but we continue to believe that additional market solutions are needed to adequately serve the region. Again, a solid quarter for our company. We are on track to achieve our objective both operationally and financially for 2015. And even more importantly, we are laying the groundwork for accelerated growth from stable predictable sources over the next 5 years.

Before getting into the details of the quarter, I would like to congratulate Drew, Beth and Pete on their new leadership roles for our company. 
In May, we announced that Drew would be taking on new responsibilities as our President and Chief Operating Officer and that Beth would become our Chief Financial Officer and that Pete would assume oversight for all of our nonregulated businesses. We have a very deep and experienced bench of managers at AGL, and these changes allow us to take greater advantage of their talents. Over the coming months, we look forward to these executive spending time with the investment community in their new roles.
Moving on to the quarter, starting with Slide 3 of our presentation. We had a very solid though seasonally quiet second quarter across all of our business segments. Quarterly earnings per share of $0.35 on a consolidated basis and $0.39 excluding wholesale services were in line with our expectations. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance targets of $2.85 to $3.10 on a consolidated basis and $2.70 to $2.80 excluding wholesale services. As a reminder, we raised our guidance targets in March following a colder-than-normal start to the year.
Turning to Slide 4. I want to highlight our operational performance year-to-date. Excluding the wholesale services segment, which had a record 2014, our EPS is higher by $0.05 year-to-date. However, some strong fundamentals are masked by weather impacts on our distribution and retail businesses. Excluding $0.08 of weather benefit through June of this year and $0.17 of benefit to the same period last year, our EPS is higher by $0.14 or 9%. The favorability is driven by a number of factors, including higher margin for infrastructure investment programs, customer growth and well-managed operating expenses. 
Strategically, we are executing on all fronts with the robust capital investment program we laid out for you at our Analyst Day a few months ago. As such, our targeted 5-year EPS growth rate of 6% to 9% remains in tact and very achievable. Drew will provide additional details on our key utility and pipeline initiatives in just a few minutes. 
With that, I will turn the call over to our newly minted Chief Financial Officer, Beth Reese."
252517,306079153,841863,"AGL Resources Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Southern Company Gas","Executives","Thank you, John. I'm happy to be participating in our first earnings call as AGL's CFO, and I look forward to meeting many of you in person in the coming weeks and months. As John mentioned, we had a solid quarter across all business segments, with result",995,"Thank you, John. I'm happy to be participating in our first earnings call as AGL's CFO, and I look forward to meeting many of you in person in the coming weeks and months. As John mentioned, we had a solid quarter across all business segments, with results in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our consolidated EPS declined year-over-year by 27%, but you will recall that last year's results were driven by exceptional wholesale services performance. In fact, the second quarter of 2014 was the strongest second quarter in wholesale's history. Excluding wholesale, earnings per share for the second quarter were higher by $0.03 or 8% despite weather that was warmer than normal during the quarter. Looking specifically at the weather impact across distribution and retail. Second quarter 2015 EPS included a negative weather impact of approximately $0.02 while last year's second quarter EPS included a weather benefit of $0.01. 
So once you take out weather impact and just look at the underlying performance of the business, the real story is a $0.06 improvement over last year, driven largely by margin improvements in the distribution segment related to higher infrastructure investment and customer growth, offset by higher pension and depreciation expense, both of which were expected. In addition, we had some favorability in the midstream segment year-over-year related to the absence of a onetime retained fuel inventory true-up in 2014.
On Slide 6, you can see our results through June. Again, a positive story with EPS excluding wholesale up 3% year-to-date and, as John mentioned, up 9% once you normalize for weather impact. 
Taking a closer look at each segment, starting with Slide 7. You can see that EBIT for the distribution segment was down just slightly from last year's second quarter. Our utilities are performing well operationally, with margin from infrastructure investment program and customer growth driving our results year-to-date. Our customer count is higher by over 0.5%, and we are seeing a positive growth trend across our service territories. Year-to-date, our O&M expenses in the distribution segment are up just 1% compared to last year, and total operating expense was up modestly, driven by higher depreciation.
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 8. Second quarter 2015 EBIT was in line with last year's second quarter. This is reflective of weather that was warmer than normal in the second quarter of this year. When you weather-normalize quarterly EBIT for the retail segment was higher by 19%. Year-to-date, weather-normalized EBIT is higher by $14 million. This year-to-date favorability is due to the partial reversal of mark-to-market hedge losses and a lower-of-cost-or-market adjustment of $16 million that we reported at the end of 2014 as well as slightly lower operating expense.
Turning to wholesale services on Slide 9. As I mentioned, 2014 was the strongest year ever for this business, including the strongest second quarter in its history. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $8 million for the quarter as compared to a gain of $24 million last year. Economic earnings for the quarter were $2 million compared to an unusually robust $9 million last year. Typically, we expect to report an EBIT loss with roughly breakeven economic earnings for the second quarter due to the seasonality of this business, and our results this year were actually better than our expectations, driven by positive commercial activity.
Year-to-date, our economic earnings are $91 million, which compares very favorably to our average annual expectation of approximately $50 million. Our strong performance continues to be driven by a combination of weather-related volatility, pipeline and storage constraints in the Northeast region, asset management for our utilities and third parties, producer services and providing gas supply to power generators. We remain on track to achieve economic earnings of between $80 million and $110 million this year, with GAAP EBIT of $40 million to $50 million expected.
Looking at the midstream segment results on Slide 10. EBIT improved by $5 million in the second quarter compared to last year. The primary driver is the absence of the retained fuel true-up expense that we incurred in 2014. The fundamentals around this business has improved slightly, but as we discussed at the Analyst Day, over the course of our 5-year plan, the real driver for this segment going forward will be our investments in interstate pipeline. 
You can see some of the balance sheet highlights on Slide 11. Our debt balances are lower than the prior year due to strong earnings across our businesses, the sale of Tropical Shipping last year and lower gas costs. Our debt-to-cap was 49% at the end of the quarter compared to 51% at the same time last year. From a financing perspective, we continue to anticipate an estimated $300 million bond issuance this fall, with proceeds being used to refinance the $200 million January 2015 maturity that we redeemed and to fund higher capital expenditures. 
Finally, you may have seen that on July 22, Moody's placed the rating of AGL Capital Corporation on review for possible downgrade. Our AGL Capital rating with Moody's is A3, and we would anticipate it being lowered 1 notch to Baa1 if they take the action they have signaled. The possibility of a 1-notch downgrade has been on our watch list and was not unexpected given the robust capital investment plan that we laid out earlier this year related to our utility and pipeline investments. 
Prior to a broad industry upgrade in 2014, we had been in this Baa1 category for many years, which was reflective of our cash flow coverage metrics, and we do not view this potential action as problematic from the standpoint of our expected upcoming financing activity. As part of this review, Moody's has affirmed the A2 issuer rating for Nicor Gas and, importantly, affirms that our commercial paper ratings are not under review. 
Thank you for your time this morning, and I'll now turn it over to Drew for some strategic update."

After reviewing the quarterly financial results with you for 38 quarters at AGL, I'm more than happy to pass the torch. Well done. Beth and I look forward to working with you closely -- working closely together in our new roles and spending time on the road talking with all of you. As John said, it was a quiet quarter, so my remarks will be short. 
On Slide 12, you'll find an update on some of our strategic initiatives at the utilities in particular. Starting in Illinois. As you know, this is the first full year of our investing in Illinois infrastructure rider program, under which we expect to spend between $200 million and $300 million annually over the next 9 years. We're off to a good start, and we're running ahead of schedule with approximately $75 million deployed through June, with our focus on some of the oldest pipe in the system. Our capital rate base commissioning is also ahead of schedule in Illinois, which is a key threshold we must meet before applying capital to the rider program. 
In Georgia, no update to provide at this juncture, but just a reminder that in February, we've submitted a true-up filing, requesting approval to recover $178 million associated with our Georgia pipeline replacement program that concluded in December of 2013. We are working with the commission and its staff to complete the review as quickly as possible. 
In Virginia, we continue to negotiate an agreement that would allow Virginia Natural Gas to invest in proven natural gas reserves in the Marcellus shale region, which would help us provide long-term price stability for VNG customers. Assuming that we reach an acceptable agreement, we would expect to file a proposal with the Virginia State Corporation Commission in the third quarter. 
In addition, as we mentioned at our Analyst Day, we are evaluating additional infrastructure programs in jurisdictions where our current programs are set to expire in the next few years. For example, in Elizabethtown Gas, a system that is well over 100 years old, we have more than 600 miles of bare steel and cast iron main that needs to be replaced in order to modernize our system. AGL has been an industry-leader in pipeline replacement for nearly 15 years, and we have made significant progress on upgrading and modernizing our system, but we still have some work to do. 
Turning to Slide 13. I'll give you a brief review of the 3 interstate pipeline projects in which we're participating as both an investor and a utility customer. For the Dalton project in Georgia, the FERC application was filed in March. Design, surveys and land acquisition are underway. On the PennEast project, the partners are expected to file with FERC later this year. Surveys are underway, and we continue to meet with respective landowners. For Atlantic Coast, FERC filing is also expected later this year. Design, survey -- and surveys are underway, and community meetings are ongoing. 
As a reminder, these projects have in-service dates in the 2017 to 2018 time frame. Our partners in these projects are doing an excellent job leading us through the community meetings, locking in construction costs, seeking regulatory approvals and keeping us on track to meet our target. Importantly, each project is nearly 100% contracted with long-term utility-based customers, including our own. 
Finally, on Prairie State Pipeline, something that we have discussed with you in the past, we're still working with Tallgrass to develop an appropriately scaled and sized pipeline that would meet the needs of the Chicago area market participants. No concrete updates to provide at this time, but we continue to believe that additional market solutions are needed to adequately serve the region. 
Again, a solid quarter for our company. We're on track to achieve our objectives both operationally and financially for 2015. And even more importantly, we are laying the groundwork for accelerated growth from stable, predictable sources over the next 5 years. 
I want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication as we lead the company forward, and thank you for your time today and your interest in AGL Resources. And with that operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for Q&A."

Before getting into the details of the quarter, I would like to congratulate Drew, Beth and Pete on their new leadership roles for our company. 
In May, we announced that Drew would be taking on new responsibilities as our President and Chief Operating Officer and that Beth would become our Chief Financial Officer and that Pete would assume oversight for all of our nonregulated businesses. We have a very deep and experienced bench of managers at AGL, and these changes allow us to take greater advantage of their talents. Over the coming months, we look forward to these executives spending time with the investment community in their new roles.
Moving on to the quarter, starting with Slide 3 of our presentation. We had a very solid though seasonally quiet second quarter across all of our business segments. Quarterly earnings per share of $0.35 on a consolidated basis and $0.39 excluding wholesale services were in line with our expectations. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance targets of $2.85 to $3.10 on a consolidated basis and $2.70 to $2.80 excluding wholesale services. As a reminder, we raised our guidance targets in March following a colder-than-normal start to the year.
Turning to Slide 4. I want to highlight our operational performance year-to-date. Excluding the wholesale services segment, which had a record 2014, our EPS is higher by $0.05 year-to-date. However, some strong fundamentals are masked by weather impacts on our distribution and retail businesses. Excluding $0.08 of weather benefit through June of this year and $0.17 of benefit to the same period last year, our EPS is higher by $0.14 or 9%. The favorability is driven by a number of factors, including higher margin for infrastructure investment programs, customer growth and well-managed operating expenses. 
Strategically, we are executing on all fronts with the robust capital investment program we laid out for you at our Analyst Day a few months ago. As such, our targeted 5-year EPS growth rate of 6% to 9% remains intact and very achievable. Drew will provide additional details on our key utility and pipeline initiatives in just a few minutes. 
With that, I will turn the call over to our newly minted Chief Financial Officer, Beth Reese."
252517,306079153,842178,"AGL Resources Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Southern Company Gas","Executives","Thank you, John. I'm happy to be participating in our first earnings call as AGL's CFO, and I look forward to meeting many of you in person in the coming weeks and months. As John mentioned, we had a solid quarter across all business segments, with result",995,"Thank you, John. I'm happy to be participating in our first earnings call as AGL's CFO, and I look forward to meeting many of you in person in the coming weeks and months. As John mentioned, we had a solid quarter across all business segments, with results in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our consolidated EPS declined year-over-year by 27%, but you will recall that last year's results were driven by exceptional wholesale services performance. In fact, the second quarter of 2014 was the strongest second quarter in wholesale's history. Excluding wholesale, earnings per share for the second quarter were higher by $0.03 or 8% despite weather that was warmer than normal during the quarter. Looking specifically at the weather impact across distribution and retail, second quarter 2015 EPS included a negative weather impact of approximately $0.02 while last year's second quarter EPS included a weather benefit of $0.01. 
So once you take out weather impact and just look at the underlying performance of the business, the real story is a $0.06 improvement over last year, driven largely by margin improvements in the distribution segment related to higher infrastructure investment and customer growth, offset by higher pension and depreciation expense, both of which were expected. In addition, we had some favorability in the midstream segment year-over-year related to the absence of a onetime retained fuel inventory true-up in 2014.
On Slide 6, you can see our results through June. Again, a positive story with EPS excluding wholesale up 3% year-to-date and, as John mentioned, up 9% once you normalize for weather impact. 
Taking a closer look at each segment, starting with Slide 7, you can see that EBIT for the distribution segment was down just slightly from last year's second quarter. Our utilities are performing well operationally, with margin from infrastructure investment programs and customer growth driving our results year-to-date. Our customer count is higher by over 0.5%, and we are seeing a positive growth trend across our service territories. Year-to-date, our O&M expenses in the distribution segment are up just 1% compared to last year, and total operating expense was up modestly, driven by higher depreciation.
Turning to the retail segment on Slide 8. Second quarter 2015 EBIT was in line with last year's second quarter. This is reflective of weather that was warmer than normal in the second quarter of this year. When you weather-normalize quarterly EBIT for the retail segment, was higher by 19%. Year-to-date, weather-normalized EBIT is higher by $14 million. This year-to-date favorability is due to the partial reversal of mark-to-market hedge losses and a lower-of-cost-or-market adjustment of $16 million that we reported at the end of 2014 as well as slightly lower operating expense.
Turning to wholesale services on Slide 9. As I mentioned, 2014 was the strongest year ever for this business, including the strongest second quarter in its history. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $8 million for the quarter as compared to a gain of $24 million last year. Economic earnings for the quarter were $2 million compared to an unusually robust $9 million last year. Typically, we expect to report an EBIT loss with roughly breakeven economic earnings for the second quarter due to the seasonality of this business, and our results this year were actually better than our expectations, driven by positive commercial activity.
Year-to-date, our economic earnings are $91 million, which compares very favorably to our average annual expectation of approximately $50 million. Our strong performance continues to be driven by a combination of weather-related volatility, pipeline and storage constraints in the Northeast region, asset management for our utilities and third parties, producer services and providing gas supply to power generators. We remain on track to achieve economic earnings of between $80 million and $110 million this year, with GAAP EBIT of $40 million to $50 million expected.
Looking at the midstream segment results on Slide 10. EBIT improved by $5 million in the second quarter compared to last year. The primary driver is the absence of the retained fuel true-up expense that we incurred in 2014. The fundamentals around this business has improved slightly, but as we discussed at the Analyst Day, over the course of our 5-year plan, the real driver for this segment going forward will be our investments in interstate pipeline. 
You can see some of the balance sheet highlights on Slide 11. Our debt balances are lower than the prior year due to strong earnings across our businesses, the sale of Tropical Shipping last year and lower gas costs. Our debt-to-cap was 49% at the end of the quarter compared to 51% at the same time last year. From a financing perspective, we continue to anticipate an estimated $300 million bond issuance this fall, with proceeds being used to refinance the $200 million January 2015 maturity that we redeemed and to fund higher capital expenditures. 
Finally, you may have seen that on July 22, Moody's placed the rating of AGL Capital Corporation on review for possible downgrade. Our AGL Capital rating with Moody's is A3, and we would anticipate it being lowered 1 notch to Baa1 if they take the action they have signaled. The possibility of a 1-notch downgrade has been on our watch list and was not unexpected given the robust capital investment plan that we laid out earlier this year related to our utility and pipeline investments. 
Prior to a broad industry upgrade in 2014, we had been in this Baa1 category for many years, which was reflective of our cash flow coverage metrics, and we do not view this potential action as problematic from the standpoint of our expected upcoming financing activity. As part of this review, Moody's has affirmed the A2 issuer rating for Nicor Gas and, importantly, affirms that our commercial paper ratings are not under review. 
Thank you for your time this morning, and I'll now turn it over to Drew for some strategic update."

After reviewing the quarterly financial results with you for 38 quarters at AGL, I'm more than happy to pass the torch. Well done. Beth and I look forward to working with you closely -- working closely together in our new roles and spending time on the road talking with all of you. As John said, it was a quiet quarter, so my remarks will be short. 
On Slide 12, you'll find an update on some of our strategic initiatives at the utilities in particular. Starting in Illinois. As you know, this is the first full year of our investing in Illinois infrastructure rider program, under which we expect to spend between $200 million and $300 million annually over the next 9 years. We're off to a good start, and we're running ahead of schedule with approximately $75 million deployed through June, with our focus on some of the oldest pipe in the system. Our capital rate base commissioning is also ahead of schedule in Illinois, which is a key threshold we must meet before applying capital to the rider program. 
In Georgia, no update to provide at this juncture, but just a reminder that in February, we've submitted a true-up filing, requesting approval to recover $178 million associated with our Georgia pipeline replacement program that concluded in December of 2013. We are working with the commission and its staff to complete the review as quickly as possible.
In Virginia, we continue to negotiate an agreement that would allow Virginia Natural Gas to invest in proven natural gas reserves in the Marcellus shale region, which would help us provide long-term price stability for VNG customers. Assuming that we reach an acceptable agreement, we would expect to file a proposal with the Virginia State Corporation Commission in the third quarter. 
In addition, as we mentioned at our Analyst Day, we are evaluating additional infrastructure programs in jurisdictions where our current programs are set to expire in the next few years. For example, in Elizabethtown Gas, a system that is well over 100 years old, we have more than 600 miles of bare steel and cast iron main that needs to be replaced in order to modernize our system. AGL has been an industry-leader in pipeline replacement for nearly 15 years, and we have made significant progress on upgrading and modernizing our system, but we still have some work to do. 
Turning to Slide 13. I'll give you a brief review of the 3 interstate pipeline projects in which we're participating as both an investor and a utility customer. For the Dalton project in Georgia, the FERC application was filed in March. Design, surveys and land acquisition are underway. On the PennEast project, the partners are expected to file with FERC later this year. Surveys are underway, and we continue to meet with respective landowners. For Atlantic Coast, FERC filing is also expected later this year. Design, survey -- and surveys are underway, and community meetings are ongoing. 
As a reminder, these projects have in-service dates in the 2017 to 2018 time frame. Our partners in these projects are doing an excellent job leading us through the community meetings, locking in construction costs, seeking regulatory approvals and keeping us on track to meet our target. Importantly, each project is nearly 100% contracted with long-term utility-based customers, including our own. 
Finally, on Prairie State Pipeline, something that we have discussed with you in the past, we're still working with Tallgrass to develop an appropriately scaled and sized pipeline that would meet the needs of the Chicago area market participants. No concrete updates to provide at this time, but we continue to believe that additional market solutions are needed to adequately serve the region. 
Again, a solid quarter for our company. We're on track to achieve our objectives both operationally and financially for 2015. And even more importantly, we are laying the groundwork for accelerated growth from stable, predictable sources over the next 5 years. 
I want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication as we lead the company forward, and thank you for your time today and your interest in AGL Resources. And with that, operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for Q&A."
