I would also like to remind you about our notice regarding forward-looking statements, which is included on our press release this morning, can be found on our website, aramark.com, and is included in our other SEC filings. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our SEC filings. We disclaim any duty to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events or otherwise.
Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted corporate expenses and adjusted EPS, which are adjusted as defined. A reconciliation of these items can be found both in this morning's press release and on our website as well.
Before I turn the call over to Eric, I did want to provide a brief reminder regarding the 53rd week calendar shift. As many of you are aware, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a 53rd week in our financials. While it only has a small negative impact for the full year fiscal 2015, the 53rd week in 2014 actually has a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015 quarterly results as each quarter in 2015 starts and ends roughly a week later than the comparable quarter in 2014.
In the first quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to have reduced first quarter sales by approximately 3%, adjusted operating income was reduced by approximately 5% and adjusted net earnings per share will reduce by approximately $0.03. As Fred will detail in a moment, the impact on our North America segment was more significant. You should be mindful of the shift, particularly when making comparisons to prior year results.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric?"

I'm pleased to report another quarter of positive momentum and continued progress on our transformation journey.Keeping in mind the calendar shift that Ian mentioned, our underlying",1469,"Thanks, Ian, and good morning, and thanks to everybody for joining us. I'm pleased to report another quarter of positive momentum and continued progress on our transformation journey.
Keeping in mind the calendar shift that Ian mentioned, our underlying business fundamentals are solid and unchanged from our last update. Our new business wins in the quarter were encouraging, and we recorded double-digit earnings growth before the impact of the calendar shift. We remain optimistic about our growth prospects and confident in our long-term framework, and we're clearly focused on continuing to create sustainable long-term shareholder value.
In Q1, we saw organic growth of 1%. We estimate the calendar shift reduced this growth rate by about 3%. Taking this adjustment into account, first quarter growth was well aligned with our 3% to 5% sales growth expectations, an integral part of our long-term financial framework.
Adjusted operating income in the quarter declined 1%, with the calendar shift estimated to have reduced AOI by about 5%. That being said, the adjusted operating income growth in the first quarter is a bit below the run rate we've posted over the past several quarters. This relates primarily to the timing of our transformation initiatives, particularly as we move into Phase 2 of the transformation where we're beginning to implement significant frontline operational changes. We also incurred startup costs on several significant Education and Healthcare accounts that came online in the back half of 2014. We've previously described the timing of large account integration and the transformation investment and initiatives as potentially resulting in some quarterly lumpiness, and you're seeing a little bit of that in our first quarter.
Adjusted EPS in first quarter was $0.47 on adjusted net income of $116 million. Taking the calendar shift into account, adjusted net income rose double-digit over the first quarter of last year.
As we've discussed before, our strategy is really built around what I call the principle of 3 As: accelerating growth; activating productivity; and attracting the best talent. And let me share with you our progress and results on each of these 3 strategic imperatives.
First, we remain pleased with our progress around our accelerating growth strategy. Our top line growth in the quarter was fueled by moderate price increases, solid retention rates and strong new sales, which were consistent with the last 2 record years. Significant wins in the quarter reached across businesses and include new healthcare, education and business and industry clients such as Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Carnegie Mellon University and the U.S. Postal Service.
As we look forward, we also remain encouraged by our new business pipeline and the opportunities ahead of us. In Q1, our retention rate remains strong and tracked consistently with our mid-90s target for the year. On one note related to retention, our client, Live Nation, has informed us that they intend to switch to an alternative provider. Under our contract with Live Nation, we provide food and beverage services to their amphitheaters across the nation, which totaled about 1% of our total annual sales. And we're mostly concentrated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. While we've had a long, productive and positive relationship with Live Nation, they were looking for a different economic and relationship arrangement which didn't make sense for us.
One of the many strengths of Aramark's business model is our diversity and resilience of our business base, and we've already put contingencies in motion to minimize this impact. A recent highlight that reflects the strength of our company and our brand was our execution of the recently completed Super Bowl. Many of you know Aramark as a food facility and uniform company, but we also have a long history managing retail merchandise programs for 16 professional sports teams and many preeminent sporting events. This year, for the first time, the NFL selected us to operate all merchandise for the leagues NFL experience shop at the Super Bowl. Our work for the NFL is yet another proof point of the scale and exceptional quality of service that Aramark team members strive to deliver each and every day.
In fact, a recent sports industry survey rated Aramark as the strongest foodservice brand in sports.
Our second strategic imperative is to activate productivity savings to reinvest in growth and expand our margins. We kicked off the second phase of our transformation efforts in earnest during the first quarter. In this phase, we'll begin the full front-line implementation of many of the food and labor tools, both process and technology based, that will allow us to unlock margin opportunities. As you would expect, the in-unit change process is one of the more complicated undertakings in our transformation roadmap. And it's imperative that we don't disrupt our existing high levels of customer service.
That caveat aside, we made some great progress in the first quarter with our implementations, and we're encouraged by our initial results. Let me give you a couple of examples of these rollouts to provide some color where our efforts are focused. On the labor front, we're in their early stages of our rollout of the standard in-unit organizational structure, which we expect to reduce labor cost by 1% to 2%. We also continue to install new scheduling technology that will enable us to better manage overtime and agency costs.
On the food side, we're improving our processes to control waste, starting with a more effective ordering and receiving system, more efficient production in the food prep process and proper portioning. Initial locations have reduced waste by approximately 10% to 20%, and we're also implementing a more formal set of standard SKUs that will eliminate SKUs while improving quality.
At the same time, we remain focused on consumer insights and trends. For example, we continue to develop our Healthy for Life initiative, which I've referenced on earlier calls. Aramark's chefs have now created over 1,000 recipes that are under 500 calories and over 600 recipes that are vegetarian or vegan-free offerings. So as you can see, innovation remains an important priority for our consumers and clients and therefore, our company.
We continue to see growth in the convenience retailing sector as well, especially across our Higher Education portfolio. We now operate about 450 convenience stores on college campuses across North America, and we have a plan to add an additional 100 Xpress stores within the next 12 months. The Xpress stores are located in high-traffic areas on campuses, often in academic buildings that allow students to fuel on-the-go with convenient and healthy meals, snacks and beverage.
As I've also mentioned previously, we continue to ramp up our technology investments across our portfolio with the goal of engaging our clients and consumers in real time and using those insights and analytics to drive business performance. In our healthcare business, we're now using a mobile technology platform called Patient Connect that allows us to survey patients in order to improve service, food quality, cleanliness and other critical indicators before the patient leaves the hospital. The platform includes robust data analytics that allow our team to benchmark patient satisfaction scores and interview responses by the type of patient care, patient diet type, duration of stay and other variables. This technology is adding value to our hospital partners because patient satisfaction is a key component of a health system's reimbursement rates. In the locations where Patient Connect is in place, we've seen a 5-point increase in patient satisfaction.
Our third strategic pillar is about attracting the best talent and making sure we create the right culture to enable our employees to build great careers. Engagement, recognition, diversity and training all continue to be center stage on leading our people agenda. I lead our newly established Aramark diversity advisory board to ensure our workforce, workplace and marketplace reflect a culture that values and leverages differences.
Recent accomplishments in this area include earning a perfect score on the 2015 corporate quality index, being named one of the 2015 top 40 best companies for diversity by Black Enterprise Magazine and achieving a top 50 ranking by careers in the disabled for providing a positive work environment for people with disabilities.
We also just learned that Aramark was once again recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies as determined by Ethisphere Institute, a leading international think tank dedicated to best practices and business ethics, corporate social responsibility and sustainability. This is the fifth time Aramark's received this honor, and it's truly a testament to our 270,000 associates around the world who live our core values to act with integrity and respect always.
So all in, a good start to the year. We continue to see solid progress in strengthening the foundation of this company and continue on our transformation journey.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Fred."

As Eric mentioned, sales of $3.7 billion with organic growth of 1%, and adjusted operating income in the quarter was $252 million, a 1% decline. Now the calendar shift is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately 3% and adjusted operating income by approximately 5%.
Adjusted net income was $116 million or $0.47 a share versus adjusted net income of $109 million or $0.51 per share for the first quarter of 2014. The calendar shift is estimated to have reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share and adjusted net income by approximately $8 million. [ph]
The diluted share count average in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 was 244.7 million shares, up from 215.3 million shares in fiscal 2014, primarily, as everyone knows, as a result of the company's IPO in December of 2013.
Now looking at our business segments in a little more detail. In our North America Food and Support Services segment, sales were $2.6 billion with an organic sales decline of 1%, and adjusted operating income was $186 million, a decline of 4% versus the prior year. The North American segment was by far the most significantly affected by the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately 4% and adjusted operating income by approximately 6%.
Additionally, the timing of transformation initiatives and some key new accounts startup cost, particularly in healthcare and education, as well as some softness in our Canadian remote services business, influenced the quarter. Sales growth in healthcare hospitality as Leisure and Corrections that there were strong as 2014 client wins continued on board and 2015 first quarter wins remain good.
Sales in the international segment reached $759 million with organic growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 18%. The international segment was modestly affected by the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately 1% and operating income also by approximately 1%. Organic growth in Europe remains positive, and both the European and emerging markets businesses made significant progress with productivity initiatives during the quarter.
We've received a number of regarding our exposure to the oil -- to oil and gas clients over the past few months. Generally speaking, our exposure is principally through our remote services operations and is relatively small with less than 5% of Aramark sales being generated from remote-located, energy-related clients, although these clients are typically more profitable than average. Our portfolio is also fairly diversified across the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada.
Now having said that, in the first quarter, we have experienced some disruptions in our Canadian remote services sites that we service, including several camp shutdowns and headcount reductions which will continue into the spring, which is the completion of the exploratory drilling season. Our teams are responding to minimize the impact, and we will continue to monitor our oil and gas client base closely.
In our uniform and career apparel segment, sales increased to $379 million with organic growth of 3%. Adjusted operating net income for the segment was up 11% from the continued success of our productivity initiatives. Our sales growth in the quarter was affected somewhat by recent changes in our sales and service organizations and by weaker direct sales resulting from a West Coast dock worker slowdown that affected inbound product. We experienced a record level of new installed sales in the quarter and expect growth to increase throughout the year. The calendar shift did not materially impact our uniforms segment.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total debt at quarter end was $5.8 billion. The company's total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a trailing 12-month basis was 4.6x in the first quarter, up modestly from Q4 as a result of a normal seasonal cash flow timing, and liquidity remains strong. Company had about $400 million of availability on its revolving credit facility at quarter end. We expect continued debt ratio reduction year-over-year prior to the effect of any acquisitions from a combination of higher EBITDA and lower debt.
Net CapEx for the quarter was $126 million, up from $77 million in fiscal 2014, largely as a result of several large account wins and key client renewals that were previously discussed as well as increased expending for capacity expansion in our uniforms sector.
As I'm sure everybody knows, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly over the past few months, with the euro and Canadian dollar each down over 10% and sterling down over 5% since our last earnings report. Although we have currency translation on our non-U.S. sales, fortunately almost all of our non-U.S. sales and corresponding costs are in the local currency of the country, so we have very limited currency transaction exposure.
As you know, our non-GAAP schedule adjusts for currency translation from the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, but remember that the relative movement will affect the absolute level of our results.
Our international sales are about $3 billion annually with approximately 60% in Europe and 40% in emerging markets. Of the European exposure, about 1/3 is in the U.K. with the remaining a -- the remainder coming from the Eurozone countries. And the majority of the emerging markets exposure comes from South America. Our sales in Canada, as you know, are contained within our North American business and represents somewhat less than 10% of segment sales.
If currency rates were to remain at current levels, we estimate that the full year impact on our adjusted EPS to be a decrease of approximately $0.07. And as Eric has already mentioned, absent currency translation, our general business outlook is essentially unchanged for the year.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Eric."

I think let me talk a little about how we look at the financial framework and then I'll talk to our confidence level relative to margins. Again, I think what we said before is the framework in which we run this company for the long term is 3% to 5% top line growth. That delivers with some margin expansion mid-to high single digit adjusted operating income, which translates into a double-digit EPS. And that's the framework we're going to stay with. We've stuck with it since the IPO and we'll continue to stick with it. We have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver against that. Relative to margin, here would be my specific comments. I think, first of all, we've made a lot of progress on the margin fronts as we talked about in 2014. Our Phase 1 journey was completed in 2014, which was a year early. We're now in the midst of some very detailed planning and a very comprehensive development approach to Phase 2. I can tell you, we've got a very high degree of conviction and confidence in delivering against that program. That program will continue to address food, labor above unit cost. Again, you'll continue to see us invest to get more visibility against the key metrics that will allow us to operate more efficiently and compete more effectively in the marketplace. And again, as we look at 2015 -- well, let me talk a bit about first quarter. As we talked about in first quarter, we did have some startup costs that impacted that. Again, as we win some of this new business and in this instance, both in our Education sector, in our healthcare sector, there was some headwind. I think the good news is that, that business continues to evolve, this is good business, as it matures but you do have to be willing, if you want to win new business, to deal with that new business headwind. So at the end of the day, we continue to remain highly convicted and highly confident in our ability to continue to drive margin expansion as we said before and you can expect that in 2015 as well."

But the drop-through on those sales are higher than our average margin because during that week, we have all of our overhead in place, all of our fixed cost. But the unit level margin essentially is gone on those sales. So the impact -- the calendar shift on our operating income is clearly more significant than the impact on our sales.

So if we're talking about some of the larger client wins, in most instances  you're going to have startup costs connected to that business for the first year associated with that particular client. And so that tends to change as we get into the year 2 where you're breakeven and above.

Frankly, those are obviously the big cost areas of the business. But at that time, coming out of the IPO, you that announced or talked about that you tested a lot of these initiatives. Can you just talk about where we are on that rollout? It was testing and then, and has it been more broadly rolled out now? And what's this window for cadence of rolling out these initiatives?

I think we've said consistently we're very much in the early innings of the rollout of these productivity plans. I think what we said is really up through the end of 2014, the majority of our focus on cost savings was focused on SG&A and that we had a variety of span and layer work and a variety of things we were doing to try to consolidate some of the shared services into Nashville and that, that was the majority of the cost savings as we came out of 2013 and obviously 2014 as well. As we go forward, and I think [indiscernible] prepared remarks, we are now starting to pilot a lot more of the food and labor initiatives. And again, the majority of our focus right now, from a labor standpoint, is really focused on overtime and agency labor and making sure we can schedule labor properly. And then the second dimension of that is on the food side. And again, the majority of our focus on the food side is to make sure we're focused on managing waste. So as I talked about some of the pilots that we have in place in Q1, those have not been rolled out broadly. They will, as we come out of pilot, be rolled out. But to a large extent, you're going to see our 2015 focus be in the area of overtime and agency labor management as well as waste on the food side, and obviously, continuing on SG&A. So early, early innings. We are not addressing the holistic opportunity yet. Again, as we get into the in-unit dynamic, we want to make sure we're not disrupting the customer service experience. So we'll be very planful. But again, we remain with a very high degree of confidence and conviction in our ability to continue to drive margin improvement into 2015."

That comes off a year in 2014 where we showed 70 basis points of margin improvement. So expect us to continue to dribble with both hands both in terms of the top line growth and the margin expansion. I think as we look forward, as Fred mentioned, one of the things that has impacted our growth a little bit were some of the strikes on the West Coast in the ports. Hopefully, that will alleviate itself.

But I think again, there's just a high degree in our confidence in our ability to do that. I don't know how else to state it. I'd probably keep saying we have a very high account for this. From a pricing standpoint, again, we think the pricing environment is pretty stable. We did see our base business grow in Q1. We did see pricing. So our whole approach to pricing is to make sure we've got the right quality and convenience offering. So let's call it value beyond price. Again, it's critical for us that we don't eat margin and make sure that we've got pricing to offset any inflationary pressures. And again, it's very important for us to make sure we use these consumer insights that we talk about with our clients to make sure we're helping them make the right decisions for our ultimate consumers. So you'll see us continue the talk about pricing. It's a skill and capability that we think the industry has opportunity and we certainly as a company have opportunity to ramp up our skills in this area.

We're early innings still relative to the brand and what we're trying to do there. And while we've seen early improvements in our brand equity, this is something that relative to investing behind any brand and building any brand takes time. And so I think you'll continue to see us -- again, we were encouraged by the brand recognition we received in Sports and Entertainment, but the fact is, that this is a multiyear run. This isn't something that you flip the lights switch and immediately the next quarter or even the next year begin to see tangible payoffs. The other dimension I would mention relative to kind of marketing and branding is we think there's a real opportunity in this whole area of pricing. And so I think the combination of brand building, innovation, pricing and consumer insights are things that we're, again, all in the process of starting up over the last 6 months really and we'll continue to talk more about it.

I would like to remind you that any recording, use or transmission of this audio may not be done without the prior written consent of Aramark.
I would also like to remind you about our notice regarding forward-looking statements, which is included on our press release this morning, can be found on our website, aramark.com, and is included in our other SEC filings. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our SEC filings. We disclaim any duty to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events or otherwise.
Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted corporate expenses and adjusted EPS, which are adjusted as defined. A reconciliation of these items can be found both in this morning's press release and on our website as well.
Before I turn the call over to Eric, I did want to provide a brief reminder regarding the 53rd week calendar shift. As many of you are aware, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a 53rd week in our financials. While it only has a small negative impact for the full year fiscal 2015, the 53rd week in 2014 actually has a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015 quarterly results as each quarter in 2015 starts and ends roughly a week later than the comparable quarter in 2014.
In the first quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to have reduced first quarter sales by approximately 3%, adjusted operating income was reduced by approximately 5% and adjusted net earnings per share will reduce by approximately $0.03. As Fred will detail in a moment, the impact on our North America segment was more significant. You should be mindful of this shift, particularly when making comparisons to prior year results.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric?"

I'm pleased to report another quarter of positive momentum and continued progress on our transformation journey.Keeping in mind the calendar shift that Ian mentioned, our underlying",1471,"Thanks, Ian, and good morning, and thanks to everybody for joining us. I'm pleased to report another quarter of positive momentum and continued progress on our transformation journey.
Keeping in mind the calendar shift that Ian mentioned, our underlying business fundamentals are solid and unchanged from our last update. Our new business wins in the quarter were encouraging, and we recorded double-digit earnings growth before the impact of the calendar shift. We remain optimistic about our growth prospects and confident in our long-term framework, and we're clearly focused on continuing to create sustainable long-term shareholder value.
In Q1, we saw organic growth of 1%. We estimate the calendar shift reduced this growth rate by about 3%. Taking this adjustment into account, first quarter growth was well aligned with our 3% to 5% sales growth expectations, an integral part of our long-term financial framework.
Adjusted operating income in the quarter declined 1%, with the calendar shift estimated to have reduced AOI by about 5%. That being said, the adjusted operating income growth in the first quarter is a bit below the run rate we've posted over the past several quarters. This relates primarily to the timing of our transformation initiatives, particularly as we move into Phase 2 of the transformation where we're beginning to implement significant frontline operational changes. We also incurred startup cost on several significant Education and Healthcare accounts that came online in the back half of 2014. We've previously described the timing of large account integration and the transformation investment and initiatives as potentially resulting in some quarterly lumpiness, and you're seeing a little bit of that in our first quarter.
Adjusted EPS in first quarter was $0.47 on adjusted net income of $116 million. Taking the calendar shift into account, adjusted net income rose double-digit over the first quarter of last year.
As we've discussed before, our strategy is really built around what I call the principle of 3 As: accelerating growth; activating productivity; and attracting the best talent. And let me share with you our progress and results on each of these 3 strategic imperatives.
First, we remain pleased with our progress around our accelerating growth strategy. Our top line growth in the quarter was fueled by moderate price increases, solid retention rates and strong new sales, which were consistent with the last 2 record years. Significant wins in the quarter reached across businesses and include new healthcare, education and business and industry clients, such as Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Carnegie Mellon University and the U.S. Postal Service.
As we look forward, we also remain encouraged by our new business pipeline and the opportunities ahead of us. In Q1, our retention rate remains strong and tracked consistently with our mid-90s target for the year. On one note related to retention, our client, Live Nation, has informed us that they intend to switch to an alternative provider. Under our contract with Live Nation, we provide food and beverage services to their amphitheaters across the nation, which totaled about 1% of our total annual sales. And we're mostly concentrated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. While we've had a long, productive and positive relationship with Live Nation, they were looking for a different economic and relationship arrangement, which didn't make sense for us.
One of the many strengths of Aramark's business model is our diversity and resilience of our business base, and we've already put contingencies in motion to minimize this impact. A recent highlight that reflects the strength of our company and our brand was our execution of the recently completed Super Bowl. Many of you know Aramark as a food facility and uniform company, but we also have a long history managing retail merchandise programs for 16 professional sports teams and many preeminent sporting events. This year, for the first time, the NFL selected us to operate all merchandise for the leagues' NFL Experience shop at the Super Bowl. Our work for the NFL is yet another proof point of the scale and exceptional quality of service that Aramark team members strive to deliver each and every day. In fact, a recent sports industry survey rated Aramark as the strongest food service brand in sports.
Our second strategic imperative is to activate productivity savings to reinvest in growth and expand our margins. We kicked off the second phase of our transformation efforts in earnest during the first quarter. In this phase, we'll begin the full front-line implementation of many of the food and labor tools, both process and technology-based, that will allow us to unlock margin opportunities. As you would expect, the in-unit change process is one of the more complicated undertakings in our transformation roadmap. And it's imperative that we don't disrupt our existing high levels of customer service.
That caveat aside, we made some great progress in the first quarter with our implementations, and we're encouraged by our initial results. Let me give you a couple of examples of these rollouts to provide some color where our efforts are focused. On the labor front, we're in the early stages of our rollout of a standard, in-unit organizational structure, which we expect to reduce labor costs by 1% to 2%. We also continue to install new scheduling technology that will enable us to better manage overtime and agency costs.
On the food side, we're improving our processes to control waste, starting with a more effective ordering and receiving system, more efficient production in the food prep process and proper portioning. Initial locations have reduced waste by approximately 10% to 20%, and we're also implementing a more formal set of standard SKUs that will eliminate SKUs while improving quality.
At the same time, we remain focused on consumer insights and trends. For example, we continue to develop our Healthy for Life initiative, which I've referenced on earlier calls. Aramark's chefs have now created over 1,000 recipes that are under 500 calories and over 600 recipes that are vegetarian or vegan-free offerings. So as you can see, innovation remains an important priority for our consumers and our clients and therefore, our company.
We continue to see growth in the convenience retailing sector as well, especially across our Higher Education portfolio. We now operate about 450 convenience stores on college campuses across North America, and we have a plan to add an additional 100 express stores within the next 12 months. The express stores are located in high-traffic areas on campuses, often in academic buildings that allow students to fuel on-the-go with convenient and healthy meals, snacks and beverages.
As I've also mentioned previously, we continue to ramp up our technology investments across our portfolio with the goal of engaging our clients and consumers in real time and using those insights and analytics to drive business performance. In our healthcare business, we're now using a mobile technology platform called Patient Connect that allows us to survey patients in order to improve service, food quality, cleanliness and other critical indicators before the patient leaves the hospital. The platform includes robust data analytics that allow our team to benchmark patient satisfaction scores and interview responses by the type of patient care, patient diet type, duration of stay and other variables. This technology is adding value to our hospital partners because patient satisfaction is a key component of a health system's reimbursement rates. In the locations where Patient Connect is in place, we've seen a 5-point increase in patient satisfaction.
Our third strategic pillar is about attracting the best talent and making sure we create the right culture to enable our employees to build great careers. Engagement, recognition, diversity and training all continue to be center stage on our leading our people agenda. I lead our newly established Aramark diversity advisory board to ensure our workforce, workplace and marketplace reflect a culture that values and leverages differences.
Recent accomplishments in this area include earning a perfect score on the 2015 corporate equality index, being named one of the 2015 Top 40 Best Companies for Diversity by Black Enterprise Magazine and achieving a top 50 ranking by careers in the disabled for providing a positive work environment for people with disabilities.
We also just learned that Aramark was once again recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies as determined by Ethisphere Institute, a leading international think tank dedicated to best practices and business ethics, corporate social responsibility and sustainability. This is the fifth time Aramark's received this honor, and it's truly a testament to our 270,000 associates around the world who live our core values to act with integrity and respect always.
So all in, a good start to the year. We continue to see solid progress in strengthening the foundation of this company and continue on our transformation journey.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Fred."

As Eric mentioned, sales were $3.7 billion with organic growth of 1%, and adjusted operating income in the quarter was $252 million, a 1% decline. Now the calendar shift is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately 3% and adjusted operating income by approximately 5%.
Adjusted net income was $116 million or $0.47 a share versus adjusted net income of $109 million or $0.51 per share for the first quarter of 2014. The calendar shift is estimated to have reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share and adjusted net income by approximately $8 million.
The diluted share count average in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 was 244.7 million shares, up from 215.3 million shares in fiscal 2014, primarily, as everyone knows, as a result of the company's IPO in December of 2013.
Now looking at our business segments in a little more detail. In our North America Food and Support Services segment, sales were $2.6 billion with an organic sales decline of 1%, and adjusted operating income was $186 million, a decline of 4% versus the prior year. The North American segment was by far the most significantly affected by the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately 4% and adjusted operating income by approximately 6%.
Additionally, the timing of transformation initiatives and some key new accounts startup cost, particularly in healthcare and education, as well as some softness in our Canadian remote services business, influenced the quarter. Sales growth in healthcare hospitality and Sports, Leisure and Correction sectors there were strong as 2014 client wins continued to onboard and 2015 first quarter wins remained good.
Sales in the international segment reached $759 million with organic growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 18%. The international segment was modestly affected by the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately 1% and operating income also by approximately 1%. Organic growth in Europe remains positive, and both the European and emerging markets businesses made significant progress with productivity initiatives during the quarter.
We've received a number of inquiries regarding our exposure to the oil -- to oil and gas clients over the past few months. Generally speaking, our exposure is principally through our remote services operations and is relatively small with less than 5% of Aramark sales being generated from remote-located, energy-related clients, although these contracts are typically more profitable than average. Our portfolio is also fairly diversified across the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada.
Now having said that, in the first quarter, we have experienced some disruptions in our Canadian remote services sites that we service, including several camp shutdowns and headcount reductions which will continue until the spring, which is the completion of the exploratory drilling season. Our teams are responding to minimize the impact, and we will continue to monitor our oil and gas client base closely.
In our uniform and career apparel segment, sales increased to $379 million with organic growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 11% from the continued success of our productivity initiatives. Our sales growth in the quarter was affected somewhat by recent changes in our sales and service organizations and by weaker direct sales resulting from a West Coast dock worker slowdown that affected inbound product. We experienced a record level of new installed sales in the quarter and expect growth to increase throughout the year. The calendar shift did not materially impact our uniforms segment.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total debt at quarter end was $5.8 billion. The company's total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a trailing 12-month basis was 4.6x in the first quarter, up modestly from Q4 as a result of a normal seasonal cash flow timing, and liquidity remains strong. Company had about $400 million of availability on its revolving credit facility in quarter end. We expect continued debt ratio reduction year-over-year prior to the effect of any acquisitions from a combination of higher EBITDA and lower debt.
Net CapEx for the quarter was $126 million, up from $77 million in fiscal 2014, largely as a result of several large account wins and key client renewals that were previously discussed as well as increased expending for capacity expansion in our uniforms sector.
As I'm sure everybody knows, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly over the past few months, with the euro and Canadian dollar each down over 10% and sterling down over 5% since our last earnings report. Although we have currency translation up on our non-U.S. sales, fortunately almost all of our non-U.S. sales and corresponding costs are in the local currency of the country, so we have very limited currency transaction exposure.
As you know, our non-GAAP schedules adjust for currency translation from the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, but remember that the relative movement will affect the absolute level of our results.
Our international sales are about $3 billion annually with approximately 60% in Europe and 40% in emerging markets. Of the European exposure, about 1/3 is in the U.K. with the remaining -- remainder coming from the Eurozone countries. And the majority of the emerging markets exposure comes from South America. Our sales in Canada, as you know, are contained within our North American business and represents somewhat less than 10% of segment sales.
If currency rates were to remain at current levels, we estimate that the full year impact on our adjusted EPS to be a decrease of approximately $0.07. And as Eric has already mentioned, absent currency translation, our general business outlook is essentially unchanged for the year.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Eric."

I think, first of all, we've made a lot of progress on the margin front as we talked about in 2014. Our Phase 1 journey was completed in 2014, which was a year early. We're now in the midst of some very detailed planning and a very comprehensive development approach to Phase 2. I can tell you, we've got a very high degree of conviction and confidence in delivering against that program. That program will continue to address food, labor above unit costs. Again, you'll continue to see us invest to get more visibility against the key metrics that will allow us to operate more efficiently and compete more effectively in the marketplace. And again, as we look at 2015 -- well, let me talk a little bit about first quarter. As we talked about in first quarter, we did have some startup cost that impacted that. Again, as we win some of this new business and in this instance, both in our Education sector, in our healthcare sector, there was some headwind. I think the good news is, is that business continues to evolve, this is good business, as it matures, but you do have to be willing, if you want to win new business, to deal with that new business headwind. So at the end of the day, we continue to remain highly convicted and highly confident in our ability to continue to drive margin expansion as we said before and you can expect that in 2015 as well."

And that's driven particularly by our education businesses. And outside of the U.S. education is a much smaller percentage of the overall business. And when we lose a good week and trade it for a close week, obviously it affects our sales. But the drop-through on those sales are higher than our average margin because during that week, we have all of our overhead in place, all of our fixed cost. But the unit level margin essentially is gone on those sales. So the impact on -- the calendar shift on our operating income is clearly more significant than the impact on our sales. And you might remember in our fourth quarter earnings report we had a table at the end that estimated the impact on the top line and the bottom line. And you remember for every quarter, the impact on the bottom line was more significant. So that clearly -- before looking at the calendar shift, that clearly has a negative impact on our overall margin. But adjusted for the calendar shift, that margin impact essentially is reversed."

So when we talk about that we've announced in the second half of 2014, many of those end up starting up in first quarter of 2015. I think as we've talked in the past, the way we'd ask you to think about our startup cost is really startup costs impact, I would say, kind of the first 12 months of that business, particularly in the large startup. So if we're talking about some of the larger client wins, in most instances you're going to have startup costs connected to that business for the first year associated with that particular client. And so that tends to then change as we get into year 2, where you're breakeven and above. And I think as we've said in the past, as you get into year 3 and 4, you end up in a more normalized kind of average margin rate for the particular sector, and then it creeps going forward with an average contract tenure, client tenure something like a decade.

I think we've said consistently we're very much in the early innings of the rollout of these productivity plans. I think what we said is really up through the end of 2014, the majority of our focus on cost savings was focused on SG&A and that we had a variety of span and layer work and a variety of things we were doing to try to consolidate some of the shared services into Nashville and that, that was the majority of the cost savings as we came out of 2013 and obviously 2014 as well. As we go forward, and I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are now starting to pilot a lot more of the food and labor initiatives. And again, the majority of our focus right now, from a labor standpoint, is really focused on overtime and agency labor and making sure we can schedule labor properly. And then the second dimension of that is on the food side. And again, the majority of our focus on the food side is to make sure we're focused on managing waste. So as I talked about some of the pilots that we have in place in Q1, those have not been rolled out broadly. They will, as we come out of pilot, be rolled out. But to a large extent, you're going to see our 2015 focus be in the area of overtime and agency labor management as well as waste on the food side, and obviously, continuing down SG&A. So early, early innings. We are not addressing the holistic opportunity yet. Again, as we get into the in-unit dynamic, we want to make sure we're not disrupting the customer service experience. So we'll be very planful. But again, we remain with a very high degree of confidence and conviction in our ability to continue to drive margin improvement into 2015."

I'd probably keep stating we have a very high degree of confidence in that. From a pricing standpoint, again, we think the pricing environment is pretty stable. We did see our base business grow in Q1. We did see pricing. So our whole approach to pricing is to make sure we've got the right quality and convenience offering. So let's call it value beyond price. Again, it's critical for us to make sure that we don't eat margin and make sure that we've got pricing to offset any inflationary pressures.

And while we've seen early improvements in our brand equity, this is something that relative to investing behind any brand and building any brand, takes time. And so I think you'll continue to see us -- again, we were encouraged by the brand recognition we received in Sports and Entertainment, but the fact is, is this is a multiyear run. This isn't something you flip the lights switch and immediately the next quarter or even the next year begin to see tangible payoffs. The other dimension I would mention, relative to kind of marketing and branding is, we think there's a real opportunity in this whole area of pricing.

I would like to remind you that any recording, use or transmission of this audio may not be done without the prior written consent of Aramark.
I would also like to remind you about our notice regarding forward-looking statements, which is included on our press release this morning, can be found on our website, aramark.com, and is included in our other SEC filings. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our SEC filings. We disclaim any duty to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events or otherwise.
Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted corporate expenses and adjusted EPS, which are adjusted as defined. A reconciliation of these items can be found both in this morning's press release and on our website as well.
Before I turn the call over to Eric, I did want to provide a brief reminder regarding the 53rd week calendar shift. As many of you are aware, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a 53rd week in our financials. While it only has a small negative impact for the full year fiscal 2015, the 53rd week in 2014 actually has a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015 quarterly results as each quarter in 2015 starts and ends roughly a week later than the comparable quarter in 2014.
In the first quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to have reduced first quarter sales by approximately 3%, adjusted operating income was reduced by approximately 5% and adjusted net earnings per share will reduce by approximately $0.03. As Fred will detail in a moment, the impact on our North America segment was more significant. You should be mindful of this shift, particularly when making comparisons to prior year results.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric?"

I'm pleased to report another quarter of positive momentum and continued progress on our transformation journey.Keeping in mind the calendar shift that Ian mentioned, our underlying",1471,"Thanks, Ian, and good morning, and thanks to everybody for joining us. I'm pleased to report another quarter of positive momentum and continued progress on our transformation journey.
Keeping in mind the calendar shift that Ian mentioned, our underlying business fundamentals are solid and unchanged from our last update. Our new business wins in the quarter were encouraging, and we recorded double-digit earnings growth before the impact of the calendar shift. We remain optimistic about our growth prospects and confident in our long-term framework, and we're clearly focused on continuing to create sustainable long-term shareholder value.
In Q1, we saw organic growth of 1%. We estimate the calendar shift reduced this growth rate by about 3%. Taking this adjustment into account, first quarter growth was well aligned with our 3% to 5% sales growth expectations, an integral part of our long-term financial framework.
Adjusted operating income in the quarter declined 1%, with the calendar shift estimated to have reduced AOI by about 5%. That being said, the adjusted operating income growth in the first quarter is a bit below the run rate we've posted over the past several quarters. This relates primarily to the timing of our transformation initiatives, particularly as we move into Phase 2 of the transformation where we're beginning to implement significant frontline operational changes. We also incurred startup cost on several significant Education and Healthcare accounts that came online in the back half of 2014. We've previously described the timing of large account integration and the transformation investment and initiatives as potentially resulting in some quarterly lumpiness, and you're seeing a little bit of that in our first quarter.
Adjusted EPS in first quarter was $0.47 on adjusted net income of $116 million. Taking the calendar shift into account, adjusted net income rose double-digit over the first quarter of last year.
As we've discussed before, our strategy is really built around what I call the principle of 3 As: accelerating growth; activating productivity; and attracting the best talent. And let me share with you our progress and results on each of these 3 strategic imperatives.
First, we remain pleased with our progress around our accelerating growth strategy. Our top line growth in the quarter was fueled by moderate price increases, solid retention rates and strong new sales, which were consistent with the last 2 record years. Significant wins in the quarter reached across businesses and include new healthcare, education and business and industry clients, such as Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Carnegie Mellon University and the U.S. Postal Service.
As we look forward, we also remain encouraged by our new business pipeline and the opportunities ahead of us. In Q1, our retention rate remains strong and tracked consistently with our mid-90s target for the year. On one note related to retention, our client, Live Nation, has informed us that they intend to switch to an alternative provider. Under our contract with Live Nation, we provide food and beverage services to their amphitheaters across the nation, which totaled about 1% of our total annual sales. And we're mostly concentrated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. While we've had a long, productive and positive relationship with Live Nation, they were looking for a different economic and relationship arrangement, which didn't make sense for us.
One of the many strengths of Aramark's business model is our diversity and resilience of our business base, and we've already put contingencies in motion to minimize this impact. A recent highlight that reflects the strength of our company and our brand was our execution of the recently completed Super Bowl. Many of you know Aramark as a food facility and uniform company, but we also have a long history managing retail merchandise programs for 16 professional sports teams and many preeminent sporting events. This year, for the first time, the NFL selected us to operate all merchandise for the leagues' NFL Experience shop at the Super Bowl. Our work for the NFL is yet another proof point of the scale and exceptional quality of service that Aramark team members strive to deliver each and every day. In fact, a recent sports industry survey rated Aramark as the strongest food service brand in sports.
Our second strategic imperative is to activate productivity savings to reinvest in growth and expand our margins. We kicked off the second phase of our transformation efforts in earnest during the first quarter. In this phase, we'll begin the full front-line implementation of many of the food and labor tools, both process and technology-based, that will allow us to unlock margin opportunities. As you would expect, the in-unit change process is one of the more complicated undertakings in our transformation roadmap. And it's imperative that we don't disrupt our existing high levels of customer service.
That caveat aside, we made some great progress in the first quarter with our implementations, and we're encouraged by our initial results. Let me give you a couple of examples of these rollouts to provide some color where our efforts are focused. On the labor front, we're in the early stages of our rollout of a standard, in-unit organizational structure, which we expect to reduce labor costs by 1% to 2%. We also continue to install new scheduling technology that will enable us to better manage overtime and agency costs.
On the food side, we're improving our processes to control waste, starting with a more effective ordering and receiving system, more efficient production in the food prep process and proper portioning. Initial locations have reduced waste by approximately 10% to 20%, and we're also implementing a more formal set of standard SKUs that will eliminate SKUs while improving quality.
At the same time, we remain focused on consumer insights and trends. For example, we continue to develop our Healthy for Life initiative, which I've referenced on earlier calls. Aramark's chefs have now created over 1,000 recipes that are under 500 calories and over 600 recipes that are vegetarian or vegan-free offerings. So as you can see, innovation remains an important priority for our consumers and our clients and therefore, our company.
We continue to see growth in the Convenience Retailing sector as well, especially across our Higher Education portfolio. We now operate about 450 convenience stores on college campuses across North America, and we have a plan to add an additional 100 express stores within the next 12 months. The express stores are located in high-traffic areas on campuses, often in academic buildings that allow students to fuel on-the-go with convenient and healthy meals, snacks and beverages.
As I've also mentioned previously, we continue to ramp up our technology investments across our portfolio with the goal of engaging our clients and consumers in real time and using those insights and analytics to drive business performance. In our Healthcare business, we're now using a mobile technology platform called Patient Connect that allows us to survey patients in order to improve service, food quality, cleanliness and other critical indicators before the patient leaves the hospital. The platform includes robust data analytics that allow our team to benchmark patient satisfaction scores and interview responses by the type of patient care, patient diet type, duration of stay and other variables. This technology is adding value to our hospital partners because patient satisfaction is a key component of a health system's reimbursement rates. In the locations where Patient Connect is in place, we've seen a 5-point increase in patient satisfaction.
Our third strategic pillar is about attracting the best talent and making sure we create the right culture to enable our employees to build great careers. Engagement, recognition, diversity and training all continue to be center stage on our leading our people agenda. I lead our newly established Aramark diversity advisory board to ensure our workforce, workplace and marketplace reflect a culture that values and leverages differences.
Recent accomplishments in this area include earning a perfect score on the 2015 corporate equality index, being named one of the 2015 Top 40 Best Companies for Diversity by Black Enterprise Magazine and achieving a top 50 ranking by careers in the disabled for providing a positive work environment for people with disabilities.
We also just learned that Aramark was once again recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies as determined by Ethisphere Institute, a leading international think tank dedicated to best practices and business ethics, corporate social responsibility and sustainability. This is the fifth time Aramark's received this honor, and it's truly a testament to our 270,000 associates around the world who live our core values to act with integrity and respect always.
So all in, a good start to the year. We continue to see solid progress in strengthening the foundation of this company and continue on our transformation journey.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Fred."

As Eric mentioned, sales were $3.7 billion with organic growth of 1%, and adjusted operating income in the quarter was $252 million, a 1% decline. Now the calendar shift is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately 3% and adjusted operating income by approximately 5%.
Adjusted net income was $116 million or $0.47 a share versus adjusted net income of $109 million or $0.51 per share for the first quarter of 2014. The calendar shift is estimated to have reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share and adjusted net income by approximately $8 million.
The diluted share count average in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 was 244.7 million shares, up from 215.3 million shares in fiscal 2014, primarily, as everyone knows, as a result of the company's IPO in December of 2013.
Now looking at our business segments in a little more detail. In our North America Food and Support Services segment, sales were $2.6 billion with an organic sales decline of 1%, and adjusted operating income was $186 million, a decline of 4% versus the prior year. The North American segment was by far the most significantly affected by the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately 4% and adjusted operating income by approximately 6%.
Additionally, the timing of transformation initiatives and some key new accounts startup cost, particularly in healthcare and education, as well as some softness in our Canadian Remote Services business, influenced the quarter. Sales growth in healthcare hospitality and Sports, Leisure and Correction sectors were strong as 2014 client wins continued to onboard and 2015 first quarter wins remained good.
Sales in the international segment reached $759 million with organic growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 18%. The international segment was modestly affected by the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately 1% and operating income also by approximately 1%. Organic growth in Europe remains positive, and both the European and emerging markets businesses made significant progress with productivity initiatives during the quarter.
We've received a number of inquiries regarding our exposure to the oil -- to oil and gas clients over the past few months. Generally speaking, our exposure is principally through our remote services operations and is relatively small with less than 5% of Aramark sales being generated from remote-located, energy-related clients, although these contracts are typically more profitable than average. Our portfolio is also fairly diversified across the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada.
Now having said that, in the first quarter, we have experienced some disruptions in our Canadian remote services sites that we service, including several camp shutdowns and headcount reductions which will continue until the spring, which is the completion of the exploratory drilling season. Our teams are responding to minimize the impact, and we will continue to monitor our oil and gas client base closely.
In our uniform and career apparel segment, sales increased to $379 million with organic growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 11% from the continued success of our productivity initiatives. Our sales growth in the quarter was affected somewhat by recent changes in our sales and service organizations and by weaker direct sales resulting from a West Coast dock worker slowdown that affected inbound product. We experienced a record level of new installed sales in the quarter and expect growth to increase throughout the year. The calendar shift did not materially impact our uniforms segment.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total debt at quarter end was $5.8 billion. The company's total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a trailing 12-month basis was 4.6x in the first quarter, up modestly from Q4 as a result of a normal seasonal cash flow timing, and liquidity remains strong. Company had about $400 million of availability on its revolving credit facility in quarter end. We expect continued debt ratio reduction year-over-year prior to the effect of any acquisitions from a combination of higher EBITDA and lower debt.
Net CapEx for the quarter was $126 million, up from $77 million in fiscal 2014, largely as a result of several large account wins and key client renewals that were previously discussed as well as increased expending for capacity expansion in our Uniforms sector.
As I'm sure everybody knows, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly over the past few months, with the euro and Canadian dollar each down over 10% and sterling down over 5% since our last earnings report. Although we have currency translation up on our non-U.S. sales, fortunately almost all of our non-U.S. sales and corresponding costs are in the local currency of the country, so we have very limited currency transaction exposure.
As you know, our non-GAAP schedules adjust for currency translation from the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, but remember that the relative movement will affect the absolute level of our results.
Our international sales are about $3 billion annually with approximately 60% in Europe and 40% in emerging markets. Of the European exposure, about 1/3 is in the U.K. with the remaining -- remainder coming from the Eurozone countries. And the majority of the emerging markets exposure comes from South America. Our sales in Canada, as you know, are contained within our North American business and represents somewhat less than 10% of segment sales.
If currency rates were to remain at current levels, we estimate that the full year impact on our adjusted EPS to be a decrease of approximately $0.07. And as Eric has already mentioned, absent currency translation, our general business outlook is essentially unchanged for the year.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Eric."

I think, let me talk a little about how we look at the financial framework and then I'll talk to our confidence level relative to margins. Again, I think what we said before is the framework in which we run this company for the long term is 3% to 5% top line growth. That delivers with some margin expansion mid-to high-single-digit adjusted operating income, which translates into double-digit EPS. And that's the framework we're going to stay with. We've stuck with it since the IPO and we'll continue to stick with it. We have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver against that. Relative to margin, here would be my specific comments. I think, first of all, we've made a lot of progress on the margin front as we talked about in 2014. Our Phase 1 journey was completed in 2014, which was a year early. We're now in the midst of some very detailed planning and a very comprehensive development approach to Phase 2. I can tell you, we've got a very high degree of conviction and confidence in delivering against that program. That program will continue to address food, labor, above unit costs. Again, you'll continue to see us invest to get more visibility against the key metrics that will allow us to operate more efficiently and compete more effectively in the marketplace. And again, as we look at 2015 -- well, let me talk a little bit about first quarter. As we talked about in first quarter, we did have some startup cost that impacted that. Again, as we win some of this new business and in this instance, both in our Education sector, in our Healthcare sector, there was some headwind. I think the good news is, as that business continues to evolve, this is good business, as it matures, but you do have to be willing, if you want to win new business, to deal with that new business headwind. So at the end of the day, we continue to remain highly convicted and highly confident in our ability to continue to drive margin expansion as we said before and you can expect that in 2015 as well."

And that's driven particularly by our Education businesses. And outside of the U.S. education is a much smaller percentage of the overall business. And when we lose a good week and trade it for a closed week, obviously it affects our sales. But the drop-through on those sales are higher than our average margin because during that week, we have all of our overhead in place, all of our fixed cost. But the unit level margin essentially is gone on those sales. So the impact on -- the calendar shift on our operating income is clearly more significant than the impact on our sales. And you might remember in our fourth quarter earnings report we had a table at the end that estimated the impact on the top line and the bottom line. And you remember for every quarter, the impact on the bottom line was more significant. So that clearly -- before looking at the calendar shift, that clearly has a negative impact on our overall margin. But adjusted for the calendar shift, that margin impact essentially is reversed."

I think as we've talked in the past, the way we'd ask you to think about our startup cost is really startup costs impact, I would say, kind of the first 12 months of that business, particularly in the large startup. So if we're talking about some of the larger client wins, in most instances you're going to have startup costs connected to that business for the first year associated with that particular client. And so that tends to then change as we get into year 2, where you're breakeven and above. And I think as we've said in the past, as you get into year 3 and 4, you end up in a more normalized kind of average margin rate for the particular sector, and then it creeps going forward with an average contract tenure, client tenure something like a decade.

I think we've said consistently we're very much in the early innings of the rollout of these productivity plans. I think what we said is really up through the end of 2014, the majority of our focus on cost savings was focused on SG&A and that we had a variety of span and layer work and a variety of things we were doing to try to consolidate some of the shared services into Nashville and that, that was the majority of the cost savings as we came out of 2013 and obviously 2014 as well. As we go forward, and I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are now starting to pilot a lot more of the food and labor initiatives. And again, the majority of our focus right now, from a labor standpoint, is really focused on overtime and agency labor and making sure we can schedule labor properly. And then the second dimension of that is on the food side. And again, the majority of our focus on the food side is to make sure we're focused on managing waste. So as I talked about some of the pilots that we have in place in Q1, those have not been rolled out broadly. They will, as we come out of pilot, be rolled out. But to a large extent, you're going to see our 2015 focus be in the area of overtime and agency labor management as well as waste on the food side, and obviously, continuing down SG&A. So early, early innings. We are not addressing the holistic opportunity yet. Again, as we get into the in-unit dynamic, we want to make sure we're not disrupting the customer service experience. So we'll be very planful. But again, we remain with a very high degree of confidence and conviction in our ability to continue to drive margin improvement into 2015."

Again, it was a quarter that showed 3% top line and double-digit profit improvement. We've continued to focus on the margin opportunity there. And again, a very strong and significant margin expansion that we showed as a result of our productivity gains in Q1. That comes off a year in 2014 where we showed 70 basis points of margin improvement. So expect us to continue to dribble with both hands both in terms of the top line growth and the margin expansion. I think as we look forward, as Fred mentioned, one of the things that has impacted our growth a little bit were some of the strikes on the West Coast in the ports. Hopefully, that will alleviate itself. And we continue to feel like, from a uniform perspective, this is a mid-single digit growth business for us. So that continues to be how we view that business."

Relative to your last question, I think there are more moving parts. But again, I think the reason why I'd say it's not more difficult is our planful approach to this. So the fact is, is from an SG&A standpoint, you don't have to do a lot of piloting. As you get into food and labor, it's important that you pilot, you understand and have those learnings before you enter rollout mode. But I think, again, there's just a high degree of confidence in our ability to do that. I don't know how else to state it. I'd probably keep stating we have a very high degree of confidence in that. From a pricing standpoint, again, we think the pricing environment is pretty stable. We did see our base business grow in Q1. We did see pricing. So our whole approach to pricing is to make sure we've got the right quality and convenience offering. So let's call it value beyond price. Again, it's critical for us to make sure that we don't eat margin and make sure that we've got pricing to offset any inflationary pressures. And again, it's very important for us to make sure we use these consumer insights that we talk about with our clients to make sure we're helping them make the right decisions for our ultimate consumers. So you'll see us continue to talk about pricing. It's a skill and capability that we think the industry has opportunity and we certainly as a company, have opportunity to ramp up our skills in this area. But overall, the pricing environment continues to be very stable."

We're early innings still, relative to the brand and what we're trying to do there. And while we've seen early improvements in our brand equity, this is something that relative to investing behind any brand and building any brand, takes time. And so I think you'll continue to see us -- again, we were encouraged by the brand recognition we received in Sports and Entertainment, but the fact is, is this is a multiyear run. This isn't something you flip the lights switch and immediately the next quarter or even the next year begin to see tangible payoffs. The other dimension I would mention, relative to kind of marketing and branding is, we think there's a real opportunity in this whole area of pricing.

Well, as you can see from our release this morning, we delivered another quarter of strong performance as evidenced by meaningful growth in sales, margins and earnings.Adjusted earnings per share were $",1456,"Thanks, Ian and thanks to everyone for joining us. Well, as you can see from our release this morning, we delivered another quarter of strong performance as evidenced by meaningful growth in sales, margins and earnings.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.37, an increase of 28% versus prior year. Our underlying business fundamentals are solid, and our outlook remains unchanged for the year on a constant currency basis. This quarter serves as yet another validation that our balanced strategy, sales growth, coupled with operating income growth is both attainable and is the right path forward for long-term shareholder value creation.
The second quarter was another quarter of strong performance against all pillars of our 3 A strategy: accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent.
Looking at the growth component. Total company organic sales increased 6% with FSS North America up 7%, FSS international, up 6%, and uniforms up 4% in the quarter. The calendar shift increased total company and FSS North America by approximately 2 and 3 points, respectively. This growth was broad-based across geography and across business sectors.
In North America, our growth was led by our education and healthcare hospitality businesses. In international, we achieved solid growth in Europe, while in emerging markets, we saw an increase of 9%, led by strong growth in China. These gains were driven by a combination of new business wins, coupled with good performance on our base business.
Significant new business wins year-to-date reached across our businesses and include emerging market clients like Codelco and Anglo-American, South America, parks and destination clients like the Bolger Center, medical centers such as Vanderbilt University and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital; and education clients like the University of Calgary and Carnegie Mellon.
A recent win worth noting is our sports and entertainment team being named the NFL's retail partner at the NFL Experience for the 50th anniversary Super Bowl next year. We served the NFL successfully in that role at this year's Super Bowl for the first time and had already earned the full retail rights for Super Bowl 51 in 2017. We're very proud of the work we do for the NFL and our business partnerships with 17 of the NFL's 32 teams and we value their business.
As these comments indicate, our new business pipeline remains encouraging, our retention rates are strong and are tracking consistently with our mid-90% target for the year, and we remain bullish on the strong conversion opportunity that exists in the marketplace.
And as I've emphasized previously, innovation continues to be a key component to retaining and winning new clients. It's also imperative that throughout the transformation, we continue to provide exceptional customer service that our clients have come to expect from us as well as deserve.
In support of this imperative and consistent with our desire to drive innovation, we recently rolled out our Voice of the Consumer program. This is a Web-enabled feedback tool that allows direct consumer impact regarding consumer service levels and product offerings. In accounts where we've rolled out this tool, including where we've implemented standardized menus, we've seen meaningful increases in our satisfaction scores. And we all know that strong satisfaction scores lead to improved retention, higher per cap spending and stronger pricing power with the consumer.
In addition to driving innovation by capitalizing on insights, we continue to invest in building the Aramark brand. Yesterday, we launched an entirely new Aramark website as the latest stop on our branding campaign. And it goes without saying that digital tools like corporate websites have become one of the most effective ways for companies to communicate with constituents and harness the value of the brand. And we look to this investment to aid in the selling process again of acquiring new clients and more broadly, just expand the awareness of the Aramark brand.
Looking at our second pillar, activating productivity to reinvest in growth and expand margins. Productivity gains were a real point of encouragement in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the total company increased 11% in the quarter. And as with sales, this profitability improvement was broad-based. In FSS North America, we saw a 9% improvement in profit, FSS international increased 25% and our uniform adjusted operating income increased double-digit at 11%.
The calendar shift contributed approximately 4% and 5% to the total company and FSS North America AOI, respectively.
In the quarter, we saw significant savings across food, labor and SG&A costs. All in, that generated a 20 basis point improvement in margins, net of reinvestment in people and technology as well as investments we made in new accounts start-up costs.
We remain focused on these labor cost reductions through the management of both overtime and agency labor, and our food cost focus is on effective management of waste. Again, technology is a meaningful facilitator of these gains, and the benefits of our technology investments, I think, are evident in our results.
Reinvestment in growth, people capabilities and technology will remain priorities as we continue along this journey. We continue to focus on balancing this investment dynamic on an annual basis so that while we continue to invest in the business, we also maintain momentum in our profitability improvement. You may recall in the first quarter, we saw a bit of lumpiness around adjusted operating income expansion, particularly in North America, which is primarily related to start-up costs and transformation-related investments.
As we've talked previously, the phasing of these programs will skew heavier in the first several quarters of this year. North America adjusted operating income and margins started to accelerate in the second quarter, and we expect further improvement as the year progresses, particularly in the fourth quarter as we lap certain new account cost opening.
Moving to third pillar of our focus strategy. Let me share a few updates on attracting the best talent. Attracting talent is all about creating the right culture, and we continue to make progress by building a company with shared values that focus on developing a committed, engaged and trained workforce that people are proud to be part of. We recently completed our third annual employee appreciation day celebrations. We also continue to focus on diversity, and recently, we were recognized and awarded a top spot on Diversity Inc.'s prestigious 25 noteworthy diversity companies list. We also recently launched a major commitment to recruit veterans and military personnel.
In addition to dedicated recruiting initiatives focused on veterans, we've also entered into a partnership with a veterans recruiting organization where we will participate in this leading support groups career fairs and events for people who have served in our armed services.
Now these are just a few examples of our ongoing commitment to advance our people and invest in the development of their skills. These continued investments drive higher client and consumer satisfaction levels and improve employee engagement, which lowers turnover costs, all very important factors in creating shareholder value.
So overall, a very good quarter and first half of year, coupled with an unchanged and encouraging outlook. We will contend with some well-known revenue headwinds in the back half of this year, but our productivity results are strong and our commitment to addressing the margin opportunity that lies before us has never been stronger.
On a final and more personal note, as many of you know, Fred Sutherland announced his retirement as CFO last month. Although Fred agreed to stay on as an adviser through the end of the year, I'd like to thank Fred for his many years of contributions to the company. Over the course of 3 decades, 17 of which he served as CFO, Fred has been an invaluable member of our management team that's built a great company.
Over the past 3 years, I personally look to Fred for his advice, been the benefactor of his counsel and enjoyed both his partnership and his friendship. And along with the entire Aramark family, I wish Fred and his family all the best in his hard-earned and well-deserved retirement.
At the same time, we're fortunate to have a very strong successor to Fred with Steve Bramlage's appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Steve joins us with an excellent reputation as a seasoned leader with broad experience that includes being a public company CFO, operating across global markets and transforming complex businesses. Steve has been actively engaged since the moment he joined about a month ago, and I'm highly confident of the positive impact he's already making and will continue to make. I look forward to partnering with Steve on this transformation journey we have underway to unlock even greater shareholder value here at Aramark.
And with that, let me introduce you to Steve. Steve?"
1004106,295569579,813461,"Aramark, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, May 13, 2015",2015-05-13,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning.

Let me start by expressing how excited I am to be able to join Eric and the broader team here at Aramark. I look forward to contributing to an organization that has so much positive momentum and opportunity in front of it. And I also want to take a moment and acknowledge Fred Sutherland. I cannot imagine someone in his position being more generous with his time and his counsel during my first month with the company. I am grateful, and I can see how his passion for this business and his confidence have served this company so well over the past several decades. He leaves a deep legacy on this organization, and the entire finance team will do our best to uphold and to advance it.
Turning to the numbers for the quarter. I want to start on Slide 4 with a topic that I must admit I needed to spend some time familiarizing myself with since I've arrived, which is how the company's closing calendar is impacting comparable results for the year. As most of you realize, the company follows a fiscal calendar ending on the Friday closest to September 30th each year. As a result of this, every 5 or 6 years, we report a 53rd week of business in the fiscal year. 2014 was such a year, and thus, 2 things happened as a result relative to 2015.
The first is that since 2015 will have 52 weeks in it, as you would expect. We will report 1 less week of revenue in earnings in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We will adjust the prior year for this week when we will compare 2015 fourth quarter and full year to 2014 organic results. However, on a U.S. GAAP basis, the lack of the extra week in 2015 is an approximate 7% and 2% sales and adjusted operating income reduction for the fourth quarter and the full year, respectively.
The second less intuitive impact is on the phasing of results between the quarters. Because of the 53rd week in 2014, each quarter in 2015 will begin 1 week later than normal, which means, especially in North America, certain businesses will have a strong week of business moved between quarters due to professional sports schedules and higher education holiday periods. That means in the second quarter, our reported numbers look a little bit better versus the prior year period, which is the exact opposite of what we experienced in the first quarter.
All of the figures that we discuss today will not be adjusted for this calendar impact. Where it's appropriate, we will highlight the estimated impact from this 1-week shift. But in general, I would note, it does not have any significant impact on our trends or on our conclusions as to what is happening or what we expect to happen in the underlying business now or in the future.
As you can see from the slide, the first half and the second half net impact are not expected to be remarkable in total. And for the year, this phenomenon will create an approximate 1% net headwind and adjusted operating income.
So with that, let's transition to Q2 results and our outlook in a bit more detail. On Slide 5, we provided a revenue bridge. In the prior year, we reported revenues of $3.5 billion. Our current year reported revenues are nearly $3.6 billion, an increase of approximately 2.5%. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced our reported revenue by $125 million in the quarter or 4%. The 2 largest contributors to the negative translation we experienced were the euro and the Canadian dollar, which were 13% and 10% weaker, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The impact from merger and acquisition activity was not significant in the quarterly reconciliation.
Organic sales growth in the quarter was 6%, and estimated revenue benefit from the calendar shift during the quarter was approximately 2%, essentially all of which was in North America.
Retention levels, which are included in our organic growth line here, are, as Eric mentioned, strong and consistent with our mid-90s target for the year.
On Slide 6, we used the same format to walk through adjusted operating income or AOI. In the prior year, we reported $191 million of adjusted operating income. AOI increased to $213 million in the second quarter this year, growth of 11%, of which approximately 4% was related to the calendar shift. Our prior year AOI figure is already adjusted for currency, as shown in the reconciling tables of the press release. But for your benefit, it includes an approximately $7 million reduction due to the stronger U.S. dollar, again led by the euro and the Canadian dollar.
As you saw in our press release, adjusted net income was $91 million or $0.37 per share versus adjusted net income of $71 million or $0.29 per share in the second quarter of 2014. The calendar shift is estimated to have increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02 a share and adjusted net income by approximately $5 million in the quarter. The diluted share count average in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 was 246 million shares, which is a modest increase from the prior year's 243 million shares.
I'd like to make a comment specifically on the non-GAAP reconciliation that's contained in the supporting schedules of our press release. The significant reconciling items consist of incremental amortization related to the 2007 leverage buyout transaction, noncash share-based compensation as well as transformation-related restructuring expenses, all of which are completely consistent with our prior adjustments to our U.S. GAAP earnings numbers.
On Slide 7, we'll provide a little bit more detail on the second quarter segment results. In our North America Food and Support Services segment, organic sales were $2.5 billion, with an increase of 7%. The North American segment was the most significantly affected by the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have increased the reported of sales by approximately 3%.
Sales growth in the Healthcare, Education and Sports Leisure and Corrections sectors were strong as 2014 client wins continued to come on stream and 2015 second quarter wins remained solid. As we've mentioned previously, we have experienced continued pressure in our Canadian remote services business, which, from a reporting standpoint, falls under the North American business and industry sector. Remote sales are likely to continue to remain under pressure in the second half of the year given the ongoing dynamics in the broader energy markets.
Organic sales in the international segment were $699 million with growth of 6%. Organic sales growth in Europe was in the low single digits and was quite encouraging given the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in that geography. Our team on the ground is doing a great job there of moving our business forward, especially in light of these conditions.
We continue to generate nearly double-digit organic growth in our emerging markets businesses. Our emerging market teams are also doing a very good job navigating volatile economic environment, particularly in South America in the face of weakening commodity markets.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, organic sales increased to $375 million with growth of 4%, an improvement over the first quarter. The investments that we're making in capacity expansion and automation are beginning to show traction.
Looking at our business segment adjusted operating income on the right-hand slide -- side of the slide in a bit more detail. In our North America FSS segment, adjusted operating income was $154 million, an increase of 9% versus the prior year. As we have previously noted, this segment was the largest beneficiary of the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have increased the AOI by approximately 5%. Productivity gains associated with labor efficiency and food waste initiatives, partially offset by reinvestments in the on boarding of new accounts, drove clear improvements in base costs in the quarter.
In the international segment, adjusted operating income increased 25%. And in our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 11%. Neither of these segments were materially impacted by the calendar shift.
Productivity initiatives continue to improve both segments' respective operating results, along with the drop-through from the higher volumes that we discussed a few minutes ago.
Slide 8 provide some salient points regarding the company's balance sheet and capital structure. Our liquidity remains very strong. And as of quarter's end, we had $690 million available through a combination of cash on hand and undrawn committed revolver capacity.
Having already addressed both rates and tenor through 2 large refinancings, which occurred in 2013 and 2014, we're very well positioned from a debt profile standpoint with no significant maturities until 2019. As of the quarter end, the total debt was $5.6 billion.
The company's trailing 12-month total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.3x, which is an improvement of 30 basis points versus prior year. This improvement resulted from a combination of both adjusted EBITDA growth as well as lower average debt levels.
Our year-to-date free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities, less purchases of PPE and client investments, while negative at an approximately $142 million use of cash, is running nicely ahead of the prior year first half, primarily due to much better working capital performance. Working capital for the business is seasonal with the first quarter generally being a fairly significant use of cash. Second and third quarters tend to be more modest uses and then the fourth quarter is a strong source of cash as room and board planned deposits and education and seasonal cash flows from the sports and the leisure businesses are collected.
Year-to-date net capital expenditures and client investments were $221 million, which is up from $160 million at the same point in fiscal 2014, mainly a result of several large client account wins and renewals that we have previously discussed.
The company continues to expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year to total between 3% and 3.5% of total sales.
As for capital allocation, we will apply the free cash flow that we generate first, of course, to servicing the dividend and then take the surplus and reduce debt, as we had previously committed to do.
Financial flexibility remains important to the company and certainly to me personally. We will continue to move the balance sheet in the direction of 3.5 to 3x leverage ratio through a combination of both EBITDA growth and absolute deleveraging while always ensuring that we have adequate liquidity and market access to pursue the necessary strategic growth opportunities that we have in front of us.
On Slide 9, we summarize our outlook for the second half of the year. For organic sales, we're anticipating a slightly negative back half of the year in North America, driven by a large client loss and a significant nonrecurring facilities project that occurred in 2014 at another major client site, each of which we have previously discussed in some detail. Because both of these items fall fully in the second half, together they comprise nearly 5% of North America and about 3% of the total company for that period.
The uniform segment is expected to maintain its current sales momentum, and the international segment is expected to continue to show solid but likely a little more volatile growth in the second half.
At the total company level, sales are expected to remain roughly flat, largely influenced by the relative size of North America.
As Eric alluded to earlier, we expect sequential improvement in year-over-year adjusted operating income growth from the third to the fourth quarter. This is similar to the pattern that we saw in the first half of the year for where the second quarter was stronger than the first. There are 3 primary contributors to this. First, also similar to the first half, the calendar shift will penalize the third quarter year-over-year performance comparisons and benefit the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the year-over-year AOI performance will be stronger in the fourth quarter than in the third due to the timing of our reinvestment phasing and the fact that we will not be lapping certain start-up accounts until the fourth quarter. Therefore, we expect, in total, fourth quarter AOI year-on-year growth to be significantly better than the low single-digit increase that we're expecting in the third quarter.
Slide 10 recaps our adjusted EPS outlook for the year, which as we stated earlier, remains unchanged on a constant currency basis. The company's initial fiscal 2015 constant currency guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 and adjusted EPS was provided in November 2014. In February of 2015, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar was expected to have an approximately $0.07 per share headwind to EPS for the year. The USD has continued to modestly strengthen since that time. And therefore, we're currently estimating about a dime impact on a year-over-year basis. The $0.10 impact equates to an approximately 4% headwind both on an as reported sales and as reported operating income basis for the year.
So as a reminder, our international segment sales are about $3 billion annually with approximately 60% of that in Europe and 40% on international -- or in emerging markets, excuse me. Of the European exposure, about 1/3 is in the U.K. with sterling exposure and 2/3 comes from the Eurozone. Most of the emerging markets currency exposure comes from South America, with Chile being the largest single exposure in that region. Our sales of Canada are contained within our North America business, and they represent somewhat less than 10% of that total segment sales.
Taking all of these factors into account, along with the averaging that we use within the quarters and based on the current exchange rates, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share to fall within the range of $1.50 to $1.60 per change, which again equates to an unchanged constant currency outlook for the year.
With that, I want to turn back the call to Eric for some closing remarks. Eric?"

As you mentioned, our international margins in the first half of the year showed strong performance as well as the top half revenue growth. If you look at it, it was, again, very broad-based. So it was strong in Europe, it was strong across the emerging markets, strong in South America, strong in China. So we continue to be focused on this. As we said, I think, a while ago, if you look at our margin structure, as we think about these emerging market businesses, it's not just about driving the top line growth but it's also about making sure we make progress on the margin side as well. We think, like all of the geographies, including North America, while we've made a lot of progress on margins, there's a long runway ahead of us. Again, what's driving it is similar to what's driving it in North America, which is we continue to focus on managing food, labor and SG&A. And the initiatives that we have in place really focus on managing waste in the area of food, it's focused on managing overtime and agency labor in the in-unit labor model, and it's focused on the above unit SG&A costs. And so I think both on the international side and on the uniform side, we would expect that to continue. Again, uniforms had, in 2014 and will again have in full year 2015, a significant ramp-up in our margins. And the reality is, you didn't ask about North America, but I think as Steve highlighted, as we look to the second half of the year, you will also see an acceleration of the margins in North America as well."

I do believe on the other 2 buckets, both capability and technology, you will continue to see us over the foreseeable future invest in that area.

Again, I guess the best way to characterize it is in the early innings. Again, if you think about, Gary, there's a fairly holistic approach relative to how we think about productivity and margin. So let me define how we think about that on the food",314,"Sure. Again, I guess the best way to characterize it is in the early innings. Again, if you think about, Gary, there's a fairly holistic approach relative to how we think about productivity and margin. So let me define how we think about that on the food side and tell you where we are, talk about on the labor side and tell you where we are. So kind of our holistic approach on the food deals with a couple of big buckets. Everything from strategic sourcing and how we manage suppliers and SKUs to second, menu optimization to third, the whole food production process to fourth, the management of waste. To a large extent, our efforts in food today in terms of broad application of those initiatives only rest in the bucket of waste. And while we have some pilot initiatives in those other buckets, those have yet to be rolled out and deployed. On the labor side, again, the way we think about managing our labor is making sure that we get an effective handle on headcount, schedule that headcount appropriately, make sure we're managing turnover and other costs. And if you think about the broad bucket of how we manage labor, most of what we've deployed to this point solely focuses on managing overtime and agency labor. So as we begin, in the foreseeable future, to stand up a new standardized in-unit labor model, our ability to manage that headcount and making sure we're driving headcount productivity and scheduling that headcount and flexing it appropriately are initiatives that, again, while we've got some pilots in motion, that also has yet to be deployed. So that's why I characterize, if you really look at where we're driving savings and we did in the quarter and we have year-to-date across food and labor, it's largely in the area of waste, overtime and agency labor."

And again, as we looked at that, we defined it both in terms of the growth potential of the business and the margin expansion potential. And as you've seen us play out over the last couple of years, there's a real opportunity -- that business has really attractive margins and again, has performed steadily both in terms of top line increases and actually the margin improvement has been even ahead of what we've seen on the food side.

So as we think about this, I think we'll continue to monitor it and look at it.

Well, as you can see from our release this morning, we delivered another quarter of strong performance as evidenced by meaningful growth in sales, margins and earnings.Adjusted earnin",1465,"Thanks, Ian, and good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Well, as you can see from our release this morning, we delivered another quarter of strong performance as evidenced by meaningful growth in sales, margins and earnings.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.37, an increase of 28% versus prior year. Our underlying business fundamentals are solid, and our outlook remains unchanged for the year on a constant currency basis. This quarter serves as yet another validation that our balanced strategy, sales growth, coupled with operating income growth, is both attainable and is the right path forward for long-term shareholder value creation.
The second quarter was another quarter of strong performance against all pillars of our 3 A strategy: accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent.
Looking at the growth component, total company organic sales increased 6% with FSS North America up 7%, FSS International up 6%; and uniforms up 4% in the quarter. The calendar shift increased total company and FSS North America by approximately 2 and 3 points, respectively. This growth was broad-based across geography and across business sectors.
In North America, our growth was led by our Education and Healthcare Hospitality businesses. In international, we achieved solid growth in Europe, while in emerging markets, we saw an increase of 9% led by a strong growth in China. These gains were driven by a combination of new business wins, coupled with good performance on our base business.
Significant new business wins year-to-date reached across our businesses and include emerging market clients like Codelco and Anglo America in South America; parks and destination clients, like the Bolger Center; medical centers, such as Vanderbilt University and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital; and education clients, like the University of Calgary and Carnegie Mellon.
A recent win worth noting is our Sports & Entertainment team being named the NFL's retail partner at the NFL Experience for the 50th anniversary Super Bowl next year. We served the NFL successfully in that role at this year's Super Bowl for the first time and had already earned the full retail rights for Super Bowl 51 in 2017. We're very proud of the work we do for the NFL and our business partnerships with 17 of the NFL's 32 teams, and we value their business.
As these comments indicate, our new business pipeline remains encouraging, our retention rates are strong and are tracking consistently with our mid-90% target for the year, and we remain bullish on the strong self-op conversion opportunity that exists in the marketplace.
And as I've emphasized previously, innovation continues to be a key component to retaining and winning new clients. It's also imperative that throughout the transformation, we continue to provide exceptional customer service that our clients have come to expect from us as well as deserve.
In support of this imperative and consistent with our desire to drive innovation, we recently rolled out our Voice of the Consumer program. This is a web-enabled feedback tool that allows direct consumer impact regarding consumer service levels and product offerings. In accounts where we've rolled out this tool, including where we've implemented standardized menus, we've seen meaningful increases in our satisfaction scores. And we all know that strong satisfaction scores lead to improved retention, higher per cap spending and stronger pricing power with the consumer.
In addition to driving innovation by capitalizing on insights, we continue to invest in building the Aramark brand. Yesterday, we launched an entirely new Aramark website as the latest stop on our branding campaign. And it goes without saying that digital tools like corporate websites have become one of the most effective ways for companies to communicate with constituents and harness the value of the brand. And we look to this investment to aid in the selling process again of acquiring new clients and, more broadly, just expand the awareness of the Aramark brand.
Looking at our second pillar, activating productivity to reinvest in growth and expand margins. Productivity gains were a real point of encouragement in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the total company increased 11% in the quarter. And as with sales, this profitability improvement was broad-based. In -- FSS North America saw a 9% improvement in profit. FSS International increased 25%, and our uniform adjusted operating income increased double digit at 11%.
The calendar shift contributed approximately 4% and 5% to the total company and FSS North America AOI, respectively.
In the quarter, we saw significant savings across food, labor and SG&A costs. All in, that generated a 20 basis point improvement in margins, net of reinvestment in people and technology as well as investments we made in new accounts start-up costs.
We remain focused on these labor cost reductions through the management of both overtime and agency labor, and our food cost focus is on effective management of waste. Again, technology is a meaningful facilitator of these gains, and the benefits of our technology investments, I think, are evident in our results.
Reinvestment in growth, people capabilities and technology will remain priorities as we continue along this journey. We continue to focus on balancing this investment dynamic on an annual basis, so that while we continue to invest in the business, we also maintain momentum in our profitability improvement. You may recall in the first quarter, we saw a bit of lumpiness around adjusted operating income expansion, particularly in North America, which is primarily related to start-up costs and transformation-related investments. As we've talked previously, the phasing of these programs will skew heavier in the first several quarters of this year. North America adjusted operating income and margins started to accelerate in the second quarter, and we expect further improvement as the year progresses, particularly in the fourth quarter as we lap certain new account cost opening.
Moving to third pillar of our focus strategy, let me share a few updates on attracting the best talent. Attracting talent is all about creating the right culture, and we continue to make progress by building a company with shared values that focus on developing a committed, engaged and trained workforce that people are proud to be part of. We recently completed our third annual employee appreciation day celebrations. We also continue to focus on diversity, and recently, we were recognized and awarded a top spot on DiversityInc's prestigious 25 Noteworthy Diversity Companies list. We also recently launched a major commitment to recruit veterans and military personnel.
In addition to dedicated recruiting initiatives focused on veterans, we've also entered into a partnership with the veterans recruiting organization where we will participate in this leading support group's career fairs and events for people who have served in our armed services.
Now these are just a few examples of our ongoing commitment to advance our people and invest in the development of their skills. These continued investments drive higher client and consumer satisfaction levels and improve employee engagement, which lowers turnover costs, all very important factors in creating shareholder value.
So overall, a very good quarter and first half of the year, coupled with an unchanged and encouraging outlook. We will contend with some well-known revenue headwinds in the back half of this year, but our productivity results are strong and our commitment to addressing the margin opportunity that lies before us has never been stronger.
On a final and more personal note, as many of you know, Fred Sutherland announced his retirement as CFO last month. Although Fred's agreed to stay on as an adviser through the end of the year, I'd like to thank Fred for his many years of contributions to the company. Over the course of 3 decades, 17 of which he served as CFO, Fred has been an invaluable member of our management team that's built a great company.
Over the past 3 years, I personally look to Fred for his advice, been the benefactor of his counsel and enjoyed both his partnership and his friendship. And along with the entire Aramark family, I wish Fred and his family all the best in his hard-earned and well-deserved retirement.
At the same time, we're fortunate to have a very strong successor to Fred with Steve Bramlage's appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Steve joins us with an excellent reputation as a seasoned leader with broad experience that includes being a public company CFO operating across global markets and transforming complex businesses. Steve has been actively engaged since the moment he joined about a month ago, and I'm highly confident of the positive impact he's already making and will continue to make. I look forward to partnering with Steve on this transformation journey we have underway to unlock even greater shareholder value here at Aramark.
And with that, let me introduce you to Steve Bramlage. Steve?"

Let me start by expressing how excited I am to be able to join Eric and the broader team here at Aramark. I look forward to contributing to an organization that has so much positive momentum and opportunity in front of it. And I also want to take a moment and acknowledge Fred Sutherland. I cannot imagine someone in his position being more generous with his time and his counsel during my first month with the company. I am grateful, and I can see how his passion for this business and his confidence have served this company so well over the past several decades. He leaves a deep legacy on this organization, and the entire finance team will do our best to uphold and to advance it.
Turning to the numbers for the quarter. I want to start on Slide 4 with the topic that I must admit, I've needed to spend some time familiarizing myself with since I've arrived, which is how the company's closing calendar is impacting comparable results for the year. As most of you realize, the company follows a fiscal calendar ending on the Friday closest to September 30th each year. As a result of this, every 5 or 6 years, we report a 53rd week of business in the fiscal year. 2014 was such a year, and thus, 2 things happened as a result relative to 2015.
The first is that since 2015 will have 52 weeks in it, as you would expect, we will report 1 less week of revenue in earnings in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We will adjust the prior year for this week when we will compare 2015 fourth quarter and full year to 2014 organic results. However, on a U.S. GAAP basis, the lack of the extra week in 2015 is an approximate 7% and 2% sales and adjusted operating income reduction for the fourth quarter and the full year, respectively.
The second less intuitive impact is on the phasing of results between the quarters. Because of the 53rd week in 2014, each quarter in 2015 will begin 1 week later than normal, which means, especially in North America, certain businesses will have a strong week of business move between quarters due to professional sports schedules and higher education holiday periods. That means, in the second quarter, our reported numbers look a little bit better versus the prior year period, which is the exact opposite of what we experienced in the first quarter.
All of the figures that we discuss today will not be adjusted for this calendar impact. Where it's appropriate, we will highlight the estimated impact from this 1-week shift. But in general, I would note, it does not have any significant impact on our trends or on our conclusions as to what is happening or what we expect to happen in the underlying business now or in the future.
As you can see from the slide, the first half and the second half net impacts are not expected to be remarkable in total. And for the year, this phenomenon will create an approximate 1% net headwind and adjusted operating income.
So with that, let's transition to Q2 results and our outlook in a bit more detail. On Slide 5, we provided a revenue bridge. In the prior year, we reported revenues of $3.5 billion. Our current year reported revenues are nearly $3.6 billion, an increase of approximately 2.5%. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced our reported revenue by $125 million in the quarter or 4%. The 2 largest contributors to the negative translation we experienced were the euro and the Canadian dollar, which were 13% and 10% weaker, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The impact from merger and acquisition activity was not significant in the quarterly reconciliation.
Organic sales growth in the quarter was 6%, and the estimated revenue benefit from the calendar shift during the quarter was approximately 2%, essentially all of which was in North America.
Retention levels, which are included in our organic growth line here, are, as Eric mentioned, strong and consistent with our mid-90s target for the year.
On Slide 6, we used the same format to walk through adjusted operating income or AOI. In the prior year, we reported $191 million of adjusted operating income. AOI increased to $213 million in the second quarter this year; growth of 11%, of which approximately 4% was related to the calendar shift. Our prior year AOI figure is already adjusted for currency as shown in the reconciling tables of the press release. But for your benefit, it includes an approximately $7 million reduction due to the stronger U.S. dollar, again, led by the euro and the Canadian dollar.
As you saw in our press release, adjusted net income was $91 million or $0.37 per share versus adjusted net income of $71 million or $0.29 per share in the second quarter of 2014. The calendar shift is estimated to have increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02 a share and adjusted net income by approximately $5 million in the quarter. The diluted share count average in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 was 246 million shares, which is a modest increase from the prior year's 243 million shares.
I'd like to make a comment specifically on the non-GAAP reconciliation that's contained in the supporting schedules of our press release. The significant reconciling items consist of incremental amortization related to the 2007 leverage buyout transaction, noncash share-based compensation as well as transformation-related restructuring expenses, all of which are completely consistent with our prior adjustments to our U.S. GAAP earnings numbers.
On Slide 7, we'll provide a little bit more detail on the second quarter segment results. In our North America Food and Support Services segment, organic sales were $2.5 billion, with an increase of 7%. The North American segment was the most significantly affected by the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have increased the reported of sales by approximately 3%.
Sales growth in the Healthcare, Education and Sports, Leisure & Corrections sectors were strong as 2014 client wins continued to come on stream and 2015 second quarter wins remained solid. As we've mentioned previously, we have experienced continued pressure in our Canadian remote services business, which, from a reporting standpoint, falls under the North American business and industry sector. Remote sales are likely to continue to remain under pressure in the second half of the year given the ongoing dynamics in the broader energy markets.
Organic sales in the international segment were $699 million with growth of 6%. Organic sales growth in Europe was in the low single digits and was quite encouraging given the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in that geography. Our team on the ground is doing a great job there of moving our business forward, especially in light of those conditions.
We continue to generate nearly double-digit organic growth in our emerging markets businesses. Our emerging market teams are also doing a very good job navigating volatile economic environments, particularly in South America in the face of weakening commodity markets.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, organic sales increased to $375 million with growth of 4%, an improvement over the first quarter. The investments that we're making in capacity expansion and automation are beginning to show traction.
Looking at our business segment adjusted operating income on the right-hand slide -- side of the slide in a bit more detail. In our North America FSS segment, adjusted operating income was $154 million, an increase of 9% versus the prior year. As we have previously noted, this segment was the largest beneficiary of the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have increased the AOI by approximately 5%. Productivity gains associated with labor efficiency and food waste initiatives, partially offset by reinvestments in the on-boarding of new accounts, drove clear improvements in base costs in the quarter.
In the international segment, adjusted operating income increased 25%. And in our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 11%. Neither of these segments were materially impacted by the calendar shift.
Productivity initiatives continue to improve both segments' respective operating results, along with the drop-through from the higher volumes that we discussed a few minutes ago.
Slide 8 provides some salient points regarding the company's balance sheet and capital structure. Our liquidity remains very strong. And as of quarter's end, we had $690 million available through a combination of cash on hand and undrawn committed revolver capacity.
Having already addressed both rates and tenor through 2 large refinancings, which occurred in 2013 and 2014, we are very well positioned from a debt profile standpoint with no significant maturities until 2019. As of the quarter end, the total debt was $5.6 billion.
The company's trailing 12-month total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.3x, which is an improvement of 30 basis points versus prior year. This improvement resulted from a combination of both adjusted EBITDA growth as well as lower average debt levels.
Our year-to-date free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities, less purchases of PP&E and client investments, while negative at an approximately $142 million use of cash, is running nicely ahead of the prior year first half, primarily due to much better working capital performance. Working capital for the business is seasonal with the first quarter generally being a fairly significant use of cash. Second and third quarters tend to be more modest uses, and then the fourth quarter is a strong source of cash as room and board planned deposits in education and seasonal cash flows from the Sports and the Leisure businesses are collected.
Year-to-date net capital expenditures and client investments were $221 million, which is up from $160 million at the same point in fiscal 2014, mainly a result of several large client account wins and renewals that we have previously discussed. The company continues to expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year to total between 3% and 3.5% of total sales.
As for capital allocation, we will apply the free cash flow that we generate first, of course, to servicing the dividend and then take the surplus and reduce debt, as we have previously committed to do.
Financial flexibility remains important to the company and certainly to me, personally. We will continue to move the balance sheet in the direction of 3.5 to 3x leverage ratio through a combination of both EBITDA growth and absolute deleveraging while always ensuring that we have adequate liquidity and market access to pursue the necessary strategic growth opportunities that we have in front of us.
On Slide 9, we summarize our outlook for the second half of the year. For organic sales, we're anticipating a slightly negative back half of the year in North America, driven by a large client loss and a significant nonrecurring facilities project that occurred in 2014 at another major client site, each of which we have previously discussed in some detail. Because both of these items fall fully in the second half, together, they comprise nearly 5% of North America and about 3% of the total company for that period.
The uniform segment is expected to maintain its current sales momentum, and the international segment is expected to continue to show solid but likely a little more volatile growth in the second half.
At the total company level, sales are expected to remain roughly flat, largely influenced by the relative size of North America.
As Eric alluded to earlier, we expect sequential improvement in year-over-year adjusted operating income growth from the third to the fourth quarter. This is similar to the pattern that we saw in the first half of the year for where the second quarter was stronger than the first. There are 3 primary contributors to this. First, also similar to the first half, the calendar shift will penalize the third quarter year-over-year performance comparisons and benefit the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the year-over-year AOI performance will be stronger in the fourth quarter than in the third due to the timing of our reinvestment phasing and the fact that we will not be lapping certain start-up accounts until the fourth quarter. Therefore, we expect, in total, fourth quarter AOI year-on-year growth to be significantly better than the low single-digit increase that we're expecting in the third quarter.
Slide 10 recaps our adjusted EPS outlook for the year, which, as we stated earlier, remains unchanged on a constant currency basis. The company's initial fiscal 2015 constant currency guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 in adjusted EPS was provided in November 2014. In February of 2015, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar was expected to have an approximately $0.07 per share headwind to EPS for the year. The USD has continued to modestly strengthen since that time. And therefore, we're currently estimating about $0.10 impact on a year-over-year basis. The $0.10 impact equates to an approximately 4% headwind both on an as reported sales and as reported operating income basis for the year.
So as a reminder, our international segment sales are about $3 billion annually with approximately 60% of that in Europe and 40% in international -- or in emerging markets, excuse me. Of the European exposure, about 1/3 is in the U.K. with sterling exposure and 2/3 comes from the Eurozone. Most of the emerging markets currency exposure comes from South America, with Chile being the largest single exposure in that region. Our sales of Canada are contained within our North America business, and they represent somewhat less than 10% of that total segment sales.
Taking all of these factors into account, along with the averaging that we use within the quarters and based on the current exchange rates, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share to fall within the range of $1.50 to $1.60 per share, which again equates to an unchanged constant currency outlook for the year.
With that, I want to turn back the call to Eric for some closing remarks. Eric?"

So in summary, we had, obviously, a very strong second quarter. Again, momentum on both the top line and bottom line. And I think, encouragingly, those momentum in gains were balanced across our portfolio.
The business fundamentals are strong, and we've got the right strategy in place to leverage opportunities in the marketplace. And this strategy is going to allow us to capture that margin opportunity that we've talked to you about and sits before us.
So as we look to the future, we remain encouraged. I think the fundamental strength of the business as well as the depth of the marketplace opportunity, particularly that outsourcing opportunity, gives us confidence in our opportunity to continue to create shareholder value over time as we go forward.
And with that, Hannah, I'd like to turn it back over to you, and we can begin the question-and-answer session."

As you mentioned, our international margins in the first half of the year showed strong performance as well as the top line revenue growth. If you look at it, it was, again, very broad-based. So it was strong in Europe, it was strong across the emerging markets, strong in South America, strong in China. So we continue to be focused on this. As we said, I think, a while ago, if you look at our margin structure, as we think about these emerging market businesses, it's not just about driving the top line growth, but it's also about making sure we make progress on the margin side as well. We think, like all of the geographies, including North America, while we've made a lot of progress on margins, there's a long runway ahead of us. Again, what's driving it is similar to what's driving it in North America, which is we continue to focus on managing food, labor and SG&A. And the initiatives that we have in place really focus on managing waste in the area of food, it's focused on managing overtime and agency labor in the in-unit labor model, and it's focused on the above-unit SG&A costs. So I think both on the international side and on the uniform side, we would expect that to continue. Again, uniforms had, in 2014 and will again have in full year 2015, a significant ramp-up in our margins. And the reality is, you didn't ask about North America, but I think as Steve highlighted, as we look to the second half of the year, you will also see an acceleration of the margins in North America as well."

I do believe on the other 2 buckets, both capability and technology, you will continue to see us over the foreseeable future invest in that area.

Again, I guess the best way to characterize it is in the early innings, again, if you think about it, Gary, there's a fairly holistic approach relative to how we think about productivity and margin. So let me define how we think about that on the food side and tell you where we are; talk about on the labor side and tell you where we are. So kind of our holistic approach on the food deals with a couple of big buckets. Everything from strategic sourcing and how we manage suppliers and SKUs to; second, menu optimization to; third, the whole food production process to; fourth, the management of waste. To a large extent, our efforts in food today in terms of broad application of those initiatives only rest in the bucket of waste. And while we have some pilot initiatives in those other buckets, those have yet to be rolled out and deployed. On the labor side, again, the way we think about managing our labor is making sure we get an effective handle on headcount, schedule that headcount appropriately, make sure we're managing turnover and other costs. And if you think about the broad bucket of how we manage labor, most of what we've deployed to this point solely focuses on managing overtime and agency labor. So as we begin, in the foreseeable future, to stand up a standardized in-unit labor model, our ability to manage that headcount and making sure we're driving headcount productivity and scheduling that headcount and flexing it appropriately, are initiatives that, again, while we've got some pilots in motion, that also has yet to be deployed. So that's why I characterize, if you really look at where we're driving savings and we did in the quarter and we have year-to-date across food and labor, it's largely in the area of waste, overtime and agency labor."

When we look at it before we went public, and again, one of the things that was important to me was, if you really think about the business we're in, a lot of people might classify us as your food service company or your facilities company or a uniform company. At the end of the day, what we do across all of those businesses and across all of those geographies is we're really in the people and the customer service. And when you're in the customer service business, irregardless of whether it's uniforms or food service, it's all about that repeatable model and how you sell, serve and execute at that moment of truth. And so the business models are actually quite similar. After we answer that question, we also then looked at what was value-creation opportunity. And again, as we looked at that, we defined it both in terms of the growth potential of the business and the margin expansion potential. And as you've seen us play out over the last couple of years, there's a real opportunity. That business has really attractive margins and again, has performed steadily both in terms of top line increases, and actually, the margin improvement has been even ahead of what we've seen on the food side. So I think we're pleased with what we see from that business. And again, the team's done an excellent job focusing on the strategy and what matters. And I think it's a relevant business for us at Aramark, is really what -- where we stand at this point."

But we really, from a lapping standpoint, I think it will run its course in terms of showing negative comps at the current levels. Certainly, through the second half of this year, we really started feeling the pain in the first half. And then on the EBIT side, that business has a relatively high drop-through for us.

I think roughly 30 states are -- have either acted or considering acting on the minimum wage question. A number of those that have acted have been pretty modest. So again, for us, I think any change, as we look at it, has to be weighed, hopefully, as the decision gets made, on the broad economic impact. I think any change that's out there that has been implemented affects all competitors, including self-operated accounts, the same way. So as we think about this, I think we'll continue to monitor it and look at it.

Well, as you can see from our release this morning, we delivered another quarter of strong performance as evidenced by meaningful growth in sales, margins and earnings.Adjusted earnin",1464,"Thanks, Ian, and good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Well, as you can see from our release this morning, we delivered another quarter of strong performance as evidenced by meaningful growth in sales, margins and earnings.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.37, an increase of 28% versus prior year. Our underlying business fundamentals are solid, and our outlook remains unchanged for the year on a constant currency basis. This quarter serves as yet another validation that our balanced strategy, sales growth, coupled with operating income growth, is both attainable and is the right path forward for long-term shareholder value creation.
The second quarter was another quarter of strong performance against all pillars of our 3 A strategy: accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent.
Looking at the growth component, total company organic sales increased 6% with FSS North America up 7%, FSS International up 6%; and uniforms up 4% in the quarter. The calendar shift increased total company and FSS North America by approximately 2 and 3 points, respectively. This growth was broad-based across geography and across business sectors.
In North America, our growth was led by our Education and Healthcare Hospitality businesses. In international, we achieved solid growth in Europe, while in emerging markets, we saw an increase of 9% led by strong growth in China. These gains were driven by a combination of new business wins, coupled with good performance on our base business.
Significant new business wins year-to-date reach across our businesses and include emerging market clients like Codelco and Anglo America in South America; parks and destination clients, like the Bolger Center; medical centers, such as Vanderbilt University and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital; and education clients, like the University of Calgary and Carnegie Mellon.
A recent win worth noting is our Sports & Entertainment team being named the NFL's retail partner at the NFL Experience for the 50th anniversary Super Bowl next year. We served the NFL successfully in that role at this year's Super Bowl for the first time and had already earned the full retail rights for Super Bowl 51 in 2017. We're very proud of the work we do for the NFL and our business partnerships with 17 of the NFL's 32 teams, and we value their business.
As these comments indicate, our new business pipeline remains encouraging, our retention rates are strong and are tracking consistently with our mid-90% target for the year, and we remain bullish on the strong self-op conversion opportunity that exists in the marketplace.
And as I've emphasized previously, innovation continues to be a key component to retaining and winning new clients. It's also imperative that throughout the transformation, we continue to provide exceptional customer service that our clients have come to expect from us as well as deserve.
In support of this imperative and consistent with our desire to drive innovation, we recently rolled out our Voice of the Consumer program. This is a web-enabled feedback tool that allows direct consumer impact regarding consumer service levels and product offerings. In accounts where we've rolled out this tool, including where we've implemented standardized menus, we've seen meaningful increases in our satisfaction scores. And we all know that strong satisfaction scores lead to improved retention, higher per cap spending and stronger pricing power with the consumer.
In addition to driving innovation by capitalizing on insights, we continue to invest in building the Aramark brand. Yesterday, we launched an entirely new Aramark website as the latest stop on our branding campaign. And it goes without saying that digital tools like corporate websites have become one of the most effective ways for companies to communicate with constituents and harness the value of the brand. And we look to this investment to aid in the selling process again of acquiring new clients and, more broadly, just expand the awareness of the Aramark brand.
Looking at our second pillar, activating productivity to reinvest in growth and expand margins. Productivity gains were a real point of encouragement in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the total company increased 11% in the quarter. And as with sales, this profitability improvement was broad-based. In -- FSS North America saw a 9% improvement in profit. FSS International increased 25%, and our uniform adjusted operating income increased double digit at 11%.
The calendar shift contributed approximately 4% and 5% to the total company and FSS North America AOI, respectively.
In the quarter, we saw significant savings across food, labor and SG&A cost. All in, that generated a 20 basis point improvement in margins, net of reinvestment in people and technology as well as investments we made in new accounts start-up costs.
We remain focused on these labor cost reductions through the management of both overtime and agency labor, and our food cost focus is on effective management of waste. Again, technology is a meaningful facilitator of these gains, and the benefits of our technology investments, I think, are evident in our results.
Reinvestment in growth, people capabilities and technology will remain priorities as we continue along this journey. We continue to focus on balancing this investment dynamic on an annual basis, so that while we continue to invest in the business, we also maintain momentum in our profitability improvement. You may recall in the first quarter, we saw a bit of lumpiness around adjusted operating income expansion, particularly in North America, which is primarily related to start-up costs and transformation-related investments. As we've talked previously, the phasing of these programs will skew heavier in the first several quarters of this year. North America adjusted operating income and margins started to accelerate in the second quarter, and we expect further improvement as the year progresses, particularly in the fourth quarter as we lap certain new account cost openings.
Moving to third pillar of our focus strategy, let me share a few updates on attracting the best talent. Attracting talent is all about creating the right culture, and we continue to make progress by building a company with shared values that focus on developing a committed, engaged and trained workforce that people are proud to be part of. We recently completed our third annual employee appreciation day celebrations. We also continue to focus on diversity, and recently, we were recognized and awarded a top spot on DiversityInc's prestigious 25 Noteworthy Diversity Companies list. We also recently launched a major commitment to recruit veterans and military personnel.
In addition to dedicated recruiting initiatives focused on veterans, we've also entered into a partnership with the veterans recruiting organization where we will participate in this leading support group's career fairs and events for people who have served in our armed services.
Now these are just a few examples of our ongoing commitment to advance our people and invest in the development of their skills. These continued investments drive higher client and consumer satisfaction levels and improve employee engagement, which lowers turnover costs, all very important factors in creating shareholder value.
So overall, a very good quarter and first half of the year, coupled with an unchanged and encouraging outlook. We will contend with some well-known revenue headwinds in the back half of this year, but our productivity results are strong and our commitment to addressing the margin opportunity that lies before us has never been stronger.
On a final and more personal note, as many of you know, Fred Sutherland announced his retirement as CFO last month. Although Fred's agreed to stay on as an adviser through the end of the year, I'd like to thank Fred for his many years of contributions to the company. Over the course of 3 decades, 17 of which he served as CFO, Fred has been an invaluable member of our management team that's built a great company.
Over the past 3 years, I've personally looked to Fred for his advice, been the benefactor of his counsel and enjoyed both his partnership and his friendship. And along with the entire Aramark family, I wish Fred and his family all the best in his hard-earned and well-deserved retirement.
At the same time, we're fortunate to have a very strong successor to Fred with Steve Bramlage's appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Steve joins us with an excellent reputation as a seasoned leader with broad experience that includes being a public company CFO operating across global markets and transforming complex businesses. Steve has been actively engaged since the moment he joined about a month ago, and I'm highly confident of the positive impact he's already making and will continue to make. I look forward to partnering with Steve on this transformation journey we have underway to unlock even greater shareholder value here at Aramark.
And with that, let me introduce you to Steve Bramlage. Steve?"
1004106,295569579,813986,"Aramark, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, May 13, 2015",2015-05-13,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let me start by expressing how excited I am to be able to join Eric and the broader team here at Aramark.

Let me start by expressing how excited I am to be able to join Eric and the broader team here at Aramark. I look forward to contributing to an organization that has so much positive momentum and opportunity in front of it. And I also want to take a moment and acknowledge Fred Sutherland. I cannot imagine someone in his position being more generous with his time and his counsel during my first month with the company. I am grateful, and I can see how his passion for this business and his confidence have served this company so well over the past several decades. He leaves a deep legacy on this organization, and the entire finance team will do our best to uphold and to advance it.
Turning to the numbers for the quarter. I want to start on Slide 4 with the topic that I must admit, I've needed to spend some time familiarizing myself with since I've arrived, which is how the company's closing calendar is impacting comparable results for the year. As most of you realize, the company follows a fiscal calendar ending on the Friday closest to September 30th each year. As a result of this, every 5 or 6 years, we report a 53rd week of business in the fiscal year. 2014 was such a year, and thus, 2 things happened as a result relative to 2015.
The first is that since 2015 will have 52 weeks in it, as you would expect, we will report 1 less week of revenue in earnings in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We will adjust the prior year for this week when we will compare 2015 fourth quarter and full year to 2014 organic results. However, on a U.S. GAAP basis, the lack of the extra week in 2015 is an approximate 7% and 2% sales and adjusted operating income reduction for the fourth quarter and the full year, respectively.
The second less intuitive impact is on the phasing of results between the quarters. Because of the 53rd week in 2014, each quarter in 2015 will begin 1 week later than normal, which means, especially in North America, certain businesses will have a strong week of business move between quarters due to professional sports schedules and higher education holiday periods. That means, in the second quarter, our reported numbers look a little bit better versus the prior year period, which is the exact opposite of what we experienced in the first quarter.
All of the figures that we discuss today will not be adjusted for this calendar impact. Where it's appropriate, we will highlight the estimated impact from this 1-week shift. But in general, I would note, it does not have any significant impact on our trends or on our conclusions as to what is happening or what we expect to happen in the underlying business now or in the future.
As you can see from the slide, the first half and the second half net impacts are not expected to be remarkable in total. And for the year, this phenomenon will create an approximate 1% net headwind and adjusted operating income.
So with that, let's transition to Q2 results and our outlook in a bit more detail. On Slide 5, we provided a revenue bridge. In the prior year, we reported revenues of $3.5 billion. Our current year reported revenues are nearly $3.6 billion, an increase of approximately 2.5%. The stronger U.S. dollar reduced our reported revenue by $125 million in the quarter or 4%. The 2 largest contributors to the negative translation we experienced were the euro and the Canadian dollar, which were 13% and 10% weaker, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The impact from merger and acquisition activity was not significant in the quarterly reconciliation.
Organic sales growth in the quarter was 6%, and the estimated revenue benefit from the calendar shift during the quarter was approximately 2%, essentially all of which was in North America.
Retention levels, which are included in our organic growth line here, are, as Eric mentioned, strong and consistent with our mid-90s target for the year.
On Slide 6, we used the same format to walk through adjusted operating income or AOI. In the prior year, we reported $191 million of adjusted operating income. AOI increased to $213 million in the second quarter this year; growth of 11%, of which approximately 4% was related to the calendar shift. Our prior year AOI figure is already adjusted for currency as shown in the reconciling tables of the press release. But for your benefit, it includes an approximately $7 million reduction due to the stronger U.S. dollar, again, led by the euro and the Canadian dollar.
As you saw in our press release, adjusted net income was $91 million or $0.37 per share versus adjusted net income of $71 million or $0.29 per share in the second quarter of 2014. The calendar shift is estimated to have increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.02 a share and adjusted net income by approximately $5 million in the quarter. The diluted share count average in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 was 246 million shares, which is a modest increase from the prior year's 243 million shares.
I'd like to make a comment specifically on the non-GAAP reconciliation that's contained in the supporting schedules of our press release. The significant reconciling items consist of incremental amortization related to the 2007 leverage buyout transaction, noncash share-based compensation as well as transformation-related restructuring expenses, all of which are completely consistent with our prior adjustments to our U.S. GAAP earnings numbers.
On Slide 7, we'll provide a little bit more detail on the second quarter segment results. In our North America Food and Support Services segment, organic sales were $2.5 billion, with an increase of 7%. The North American segment was the most significantly affected by the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have increased the reported of sales by approximately 3%.
Sales growth in the Healthcare, Education and Sports, Leisure & Corrections sectors were strong as 2014 client wins continued to come on stream and 2015 second quarter wins remained solid. As we've mentioned previously, we have experienced continued pressure in our Canadian remote services business which, from a reporting standpoint, falls under the North American business and industry sector. Remote sales are likely to continue to remain under pressure in the second half of the year given the ongoing dynamics in the broader energy markets.
Organic sales in the international segment were $699 million with growth of 6%. Organic sales growth in Europe was in the low single digits and was quite encouraging given the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in that geography. Our team on the ground is doing a great job there of moving our business forward, especially in light of those conditions.
We continue to generate nearly double-digit organic growth in our emerging markets businesses. Our emerging market teams are also doing a very good job navigating volatile economic environments, particularly in South America in the face of weakening commodity markets.
In our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, organic sales increased to $375 million with growth of 4%, an improvement over the first quarter. The investments that we're making in capacity expansion and automation are beginning to show traction.
Looking at our business segment adjusted operating income on the right-hand slide -- side of the slide in a bit more detail. In our North America FSS segment, adjusted operating income was $154 million, an increase of 9% versus the prior year. As we have previously noted, this segment was the largest beneficiary of the calendar shift in the quarter, which is estimated to have increased the AOI by approximately 5%. Productivity gains associated with labor efficiency and food waste initiatives, partially offset by reinvestments in the on-boarding of new accounts, drove clear improvements in base costs in the quarter.
In the international segment, adjusted operating income increased 25%. And in our Uniform and Career Apparel segment, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 11%. Neither of these segments were materially impacted by the calendar shift.
Productivity initiatives continue to improve both segments' respective operating results, along with the drop-through from the higher volumes that we discussed a few minutes ago.
Slide 8 provides some salient points regarding the company's balance sheet and capital structure. Our liquidity remains very strong. And as of quarter's end, we had $690 million available through a combination of cash on hand and undrawn committed revolver capacity.
Having already addressed both rates and tenor through 2 large refinancings, which occurred in 2013 and 2014, we are very well positioned from a debt profile standpoint with no significant maturities until 2019. As of the quarter end, the total debt was $5.6 billion.
The company's trailing 12-month total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.3x, which is an improvement of 30 basis points versus prior year. This improvement resulted from a combination of both adjusted EBITDA growth as well as lower average debt levels.
Our year-to-date free cash flow, which we define as cash from operating activities, less purchases of PP&E and client investments, while negative at an approximately $142 million use of cash, is running nicely ahead of the prior year first half, primarily due to much better working capital performance. Working capital for the business is seasonal with the first quarter generally being a fairly significant use of cash. Second and third quarters tend to be more modest uses, and then the fourth quarter is a strong source of cash as room and board plan deposits in education and seasonal cash flows from the Sports and the Leisure businesses are collected.
Year-to-date net capital expenditures and client investments were $221 million, which is up from $160 million at the same point in fiscal 2014, mainly a result of several large client account wins and renewals that we have previously discussed. The company continues to expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year to total between 3% and 3.5% of total sales.
As for capital allocation, we will apply the free cash flow that we generate first, of course, to servicing the dividend and then take the surplus and reduce debt, as we have previously committed to do.
Financial flexibility remains important to the company and certainly to me, personally. We will continue to move the balance sheet in the direction of 3.5 to 3x leverage ratio through a combination of both EBITDA growth and absolute deleveraging while always ensuring that we have adequate liquidity and market access to pursue the necessary strategic growth opportunities that we have in front of us.
On Slide 9, we summarize our outlook for the second half of the year. For organic sales, we're anticipating a slightly negative back half of the year in North America, driven by a large client loss and a significant nonrecurring facilities project that occurred in 2014 at another major client site, each of which we have previously discussed in some detail. Because both of these items fall fully in the second half, together, they comprise nearly 5% of North America and about 3% of the total company for that period.
The uniform segment is expected to maintain its current sales momentum, and the international segment is expected to continue to show solid, but likely a little more volatile growth in the second half.
At the total company level, sales are expected to remain roughly flat, largely influenced by the relative size of North America.
As Eric alluded to earlier, we expect sequential improvement in year-over-year adjusted operating income growth from the third to the fourth quarter. This is similar to the pattern that we saw in the first half of the year where the second quarter was stronger than the first. 
There are 3 primary contributors to this. First, also similar to the first half, the calendar shift will penalize the third quarter year-over-year performance comparisons and benefit the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the year-over-year AOI performance will be stronger in the fourth quarter than in the third due to the timing of our reinvestment phasing and the fact that we will not be lapping certain start-up accounts until the fourth quarter. Therefore, we expect, in total, fourth quarter AOI year-on-year growth to be significantly better than the low single-digit increase that we're expecting in the third quarter.
Slide 10 recaps our adjusted EPS outlook for the year, which, as we stated earlier, remains unchanged on a constant currency basis. The company's initial fiscal 2015 constant currency guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 in adjusted EPS was provided in November 2014. In February of 2015, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar was expected to have an approximately $0.07 per share headwind to EPS for the year. The USD has continued to modestly strengthen since that time. And therefore, we're currently estimating about $0.10 impact on a year-over-year basis. The $0.10 impact equates to an approximately 4% headwind both on an as reported sales and as reported operating income basis for the year.
So as a reminder, our international segment sales are about $3 billion annually with approximately 60% of that in Europe and 40% in international -- or in emerging markets, excuse me. Of the European exposure, about 1/3 is in the U.K. with sterling exposure and 2/3 comes from the Eurozone. Most of the emerging markets currency exposure comes from South America, with Chile being the largest single exposure in that region. Our sales of Canada are contained within our North America business, and they represent somewhat less than 10% of that total segment's sales.
Taking all of these factors into account, along with the averaging that we use within the quarters and based on the current exchange rates, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share to fall within the range of $1.50 to $1.60 per share, which again equates to an unchanged constant currency outlook for the year.
With that, I want to turn back the call to Eric for some closing remarks. Eric?"

So it was strong in Europe, it was strong across the emerging markets, strong in South America, strong in China. So we continue to be focused on this. As we said, I think, a while ago, if you look at our margin structure, as we think about these emerging market businesses, it's not just about driving the top line growth, but it's also about making sure we make progress on the margin side as well. We think, like all of the geographies, including North America, while we've made a lot of progress on margins, there's a long runway ahead of us. Again, what's driving it is similar to what's driving it in North America, which is we continue to focus on managing food, labor and SG&A. And the initiatives that we have in place really focus on managing waste in the area of food, it's focused on managing overtime and agency labor in the in-unit labor model, and it's focused on the above-unit SG&A costs. So I think both on the international side and on the uniform side, we would expect that to continue. Again, uniforms had, in 2014 and will again have in full year 2015, a significant ramp-up in our margins. And the reality is, you didn't ask about North America, but I think as Steve highlighted, as we look to the second half of the year, you will also see an acceleration of the margins in North America as well."

I do believe on the other 2 buckets, both capability and technology, you will continue to see us over the foreseeable future invest in that area. And while, as you mentioned, we've talked about some of the technology investments in the area of Kronos to help us get schedule labor or Salesforce.com to help on the revenue generation front and a variety of others, we are really playing catch up on the technology front.

Again, if you think about it, Gary, there's a fairly holistic approach relative to how we think about productivity and margin. So let me define how we think about that on the food side and tell you where we are; talk about on the labor side and tell you where we are. So kind of our holistic approach on the food deals with a couple of big buckets. Everything from strategic sourcing and how we manage suppliers and SKUs to, second, menu optimization to, third, the whole food production process to, fourth, the management of waste. To a large extent, our efforts in food to date in terms of broad application of those initiatives only rest in the bucket of waste. And while we have some pilot initiatives in those other buckets, those have yet to be rolled out and deployed. On the labor side, again, the way we think about managing our labor is making sure we get an effective handle on headcount, schedule that headcount appropriately, make sure we're managing turnover and other costs. And if you think about the broad bucket of how we manage labor, most of what we've deployed to this point solely focuses on managing overtime and agency labor. So as we begin, in the foreseeable future, to stand up a standardized in-unit labor model, our ability to manage that headcount and making sure we're driving headcount productivity and scheduling that headcount and flexing it appropriately, are initiatives that, again, while we've got some pilots in motion, that also has yet to be deployed. So that's why I characterize, if you really look at where we're driving savings and we did in the quarter and we have year-to-date across food and labor, it's largely in the area of waste, overtime and agency labor."

So again, if you look at the growth number broadly, 4% in second quarter and about 3.5% year-to-date, it's really driven, Andy, by 2 key components. It's driven by our base business performance, a combination of incremental volume and pricing to cover inflation, coupled with strong new business. And again, if you take out the large account loss that we've referenced earlier, if you look at this year's new business results, they are very much in line year-to-date with the past 2 record years. So we continue to see very good sales productivity and a payoff of the resources that we're deploying. I would say, in addition to that, as we look at the pipeline of selling opportunities and the pending selling opportunities, we continue to be very encouraged by what we see. And again, one of the things that's also playing out for us is really strong retention rates broadly across our businesses. Does that answer your productivity?"

It's been well received by consumers and clients. It's also a part of our employment brand. And again, as we look at brand equity and other awareness-type scores over time, we'll continue to monitor the kind of return we're seeing on that investment as well as the linkage to the new business results.

At the end of the day, what we do across all of those businesses and across all of those geographies is we're really in the people and the customer service business. And when you're in the customer service business, irregardless of whether it's uniforms or food service, it's all about that repeatable model and how you sell, serve and execute at that moment of truth. And so the business models are actually quite similar. After we answered that question, we also then looked at what was value-creation opportunity. And again, as we looked at that, we defined it both in terms of the growth potential of the business and the margin expansion potential. And as you've seen us play out over the last couple of years, there's a real opportunity. That business has really attractive margins and, again, has performed steadily both in terms of top line increases, and actually, the margin improvement has been even ahead of what we've seen on the food side. So I think we're pleased with what we see from that business. And again, the team's done an excellent job focusing on the strategy and what matters. And I think it's a relevant business for us at Aramark, is really what -- where we stand at this point."

I think roughly 30 states are -- have either acted or are considering acting on the minimum wage question. A number of those that have acted have been pretty modest. So again, for us, I think any change, as we look at it, has to be weighed, hopefully, as the decision gets made, on the broad economic impact. I think any change that's out there that has been implemented affects all competitors, including self-operated accounts, the same way. So as we think about this, I think we'll continue to monitor it and look at it.

I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements, which is included in our press release this morning can also be found on our website. It is also detailed on Page 2 of our earnings slide deck, which is additionally, available on our website in the Investor Relations tab. 
During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our SEC filings. We disclaim any duty to update or revise such forward-looking statements whether as a result of future events or otherwise. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found both on this morning's press release and on our website.
Before I turn the call over to Eric, I did want to provide a brief reminder regarding the 53rd-week calendar shift. Recall that this shift has only a small negative impact for the full year fiscal 2015, but it has a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015 quarterly results. In the third quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to produce third quarter sales by approximately 2%, adjusted operating income by approximately 4% and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.02. You may also recall the impact on our North America segment is more significant. You should be mindful of this shift, particularly when making comparisons to prior year results. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric?"

As we reported in this morning's news release, third quarter results were solidly in line with our previously committed expectations. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.29 and excluding the calendar shift, we estimate total company organic sales were up about 2%. We continue to make good progress and start transformation agenda and we're reaffirming our earnings outlook for the fiscal year of $1.50 to $1.60 in adjusted EPS. 
As you know, I like to anchor these calls in the 3 pillars of our transformation strategy or what I referred to as our 3 As: accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent. Looking at sales growth in the quarter, excluding the calendar impact, total company sales were up about 2%. In our North America segment, our Sports and Entertainment business was impacted negatively by the previously disclosed large account nonrenewal, which resulted in a flattish net organic sales result in the quarter as anticipated and previously communicated. 
In our largest sector, Education as well as our Healthcare Hospitality business, we saw mid-single digit growth. In both cases, we continued on board strong net new account wins and our base business performed well as we saw strong retention rates. In our international segment, we experienced another strong quarter. Revenue growth was up 6%, European sales grew in the mid-single digits led by Germany. Emerging markets was up double-digit with strong double-digit performance in China. In our uniform segment, organic sales increased another 4% and the business remains on track for another year of solid growth. 
Our selling strategy and efforts continue to meet with success in the marketplace and resulted in some great new client additions in the quarter, including the recently awarded Yosemite contract from the National Park Service. This is the biggest client contract win in Aramark's history. Yosemite becomes the ninth park that we are serving for the national park system. Under a 15-year contract scheduled to begin at March of 2016, we will begin to manage all of Yosemite's hospitality programs, including lodging, food and beverage, retail, recreational, and transportation services. The addition of Yosemite reconfirms that our Parks business is a core competency for us. As a matter of fact, in 2014, Aramark hosted over 22 million visitors at our 16 different national state parks. 
In addition to Yosemite, other notable wins include Archdiocese of Chicago, Flotel international in the U.K., several higher end self op conversions and a number of new facility in Healthcare clients. On a nearer term note, we've also been named the official provider of food and beverages as well as retail merchandise in conjunction with Pope Frances' visit to Philadelphia next month, which is expected to bring over 1 million visitors to the city. Aramark will also provide uniforms to the over 10,000 volunteers staffing this event. 
As I've mentioned before, our mission at Aramark is all about dreaming and doing to make sure we enrich and nourish lives and in Aramark, dreaming is all about innovation. Innovation is important in retaining and winning clients by creating a superior and differentiated customer experience. Over the longer term, it's also a significant driver of shareholder value creation. And to these points, there are several important innovation developments worth mentioning in the areas of convenience, culinary and the community. 
In the area of convenience, we know the value of convenience to enhance the overall consumer experience and technology really affords us the greatest opportunity to deliver against that promise. We continue to expand the number of locations, utilizing Apple Pay and we'll have several hundred campuses using the system as the school year opens. We are also increasing the number of Sports and Entertainment venues featuring Apple Pay as the fall sports seasons begins to kick off. 
In the area of culinary, we've relied on consumer insights to set the table and we're keeping pace with that ever-changing interests of consumers. That includes testing health and wellness concepts like greens to go, which are tossed to order salads, customized protein bowls, along with fast casual offerings like the Republic of Spice Indian fair that appeals to the growing variety need states of consumers. 
In the community, our recently announced American Heart Association initiative really represents the most innovative alliance in Aramark's history. The initiative is titled Healthy for Life 20 by 20 and it's a 5-year commitment aimed at improving American's diets and health by 20% by the year 2020. The initiative includes industry-leading menu commitments that will reduce calories, reduce saturated fats and sodium levels 20%, while increasing fruits, vegetables and whole grains to 20%. And these changes will touch more than 2 billion meals that Aramark serves annually at thousands of schools, businesses, hospitals and sports venues with the expected impact of 10 billion meals by 2020. 
Our partnership with the American Heart Association reinforces both the alignment with our marketplace preferences and trends that ensures we're doing our part to contribute to the health and wellness of our consumers. Our commitment to innovation is a critical driver of both client retention and new business wins and I'm convinced that these efforts are meaningful contributor to new business wins year-to-date as well as the healthy retention rates we're experiencing, which remain at the mid 90s run rate for the year. 
Now let me turn to the second pillar, activating productivity. I'm pleased with the progress we're making with our initiatives in this area, in the third quarter and year-to-date, we estimate that we have achieved a 40 and 50 basis points of margin expansion, respectively, driven by these pace productivity improvements. These improvements are being, driven by one, in food cost. We continue to benchmark our supply chain across the value chain for procurement to distribution to preparation, while also making sure we improve our processes and tools to eliminate menu complexity, reduce waste and leverage our scale.
We focused on reducing our labor cost as we drive productivity through standardizing our in-unit labor model which addresses staffing, scheduling, overtime and agency expense. As well as by lowering our SG&A cost by optimizing the above unit spans and layers, and implementing zero-based budgeting cost controls. As I previously shared, investments in growth, capability and technology are significant facilitators to unlock the productivity opportunity that lies before us. And we're currently reinvesting heavily in these areas. As expected, the time of these reinvestments, combined with the start-up costs on a few significant new accounts, has been a headwind to margin expansion year-to-date. Also as expected, we will begin to lap these start-up costs and our reinvestment levels are lower in fourth quarter, which should result in meaningful margin expansion during the quarter. 
In fact, over the next few years, we expect this level of reinvestment to normalize at which point, we anticipate more of the gross productivity savings will flow through to margin. We continue to expect those savings to meaningfully close the margin gap to industry-leading peers. Ultimately through these cost actions, additional purchasing initiatives and improvement in our pricing strategies, we believe industry-leading margins are achievable. And this is going to be more of a marathon that an overnight road race. But again, our quarterly results will vary, but ultimately, we have the right strategy and a very good line of sight to our goals. 
I'll move up to our third pillar of our focus strategy, attracting the best talent. We continue to build our culture and provide tools to ensure that we obtain and retain the best team, capitalizing on new technology to help achieve that goal. During the third quarter, we introduced new tools that will accelerate the hiring process, reduce our time to fill open positions and improve the candidate experience. This technology will also free our front-line manager schedules, enabling them to spend more time on delivering great experiences for our key stakeholders. The well-being of our employees also remains a top priority and we continue to expand our health and wellness programs to educate, enable our employees to lead healthier lifestyles. 
Our program has expanded beyond assessments and screening, and we've taken an outcomes-based approach that includes quarterly fitness challenges for employees to earn incentives and rewards for participation and completion. We'll also be leveraging our American Heart Association alliance to expand the health and wellness impact to our own employees and their families. 
Finally, I'm pleased to report that our efforts in this area have again earned us national recognition as a best employer for healthy lifestyles for the fifth consecutive year. 
In the area of recognition, which is an integral component of our employee engagement, we recently announced that our top front-line associates who have earned our highest employee recognition, what we refer to as Aramark's Ring of Stars. And this annual recognition really aligns the entire company with our front-line first and focused strategy and really spotlights our service stars who deliver exceptional experiences at the moment of truth for our consumers and compliance every day. 
All of these efforts continue to serve to ensure that Aramark continues to be an employer of choice and a great place to work. So overall, a solid quarter, complete with great new account wins, productivity momentum and an innovative partnership that will help shape our consumer offerings for the future. Despite the choppy earnings seasons and the uncertain macroenvironment we're navigating, I'm pleased to reaffirm our earnings outlook for the year and look forward to a calendar shift free 2016, that will benefit from our multi-year sales and productivity framework. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Steve."

I will start on Slide 4 with a year-over-year third quarter sales reconciliation. We achieved nearly $3.5 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2015, compared to $3.6 billion in the third quarter the prior",1771,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 4 with a year-over-year third quarter sales reconciliation. We achieved nearly $3.5 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2015, compared to $3.6 billion in the third quarter the prior year. This is a decline of 4%. As you can see from this slide, adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar provided the largest single reconciling items compared to the prior year and on a net basis, account for essentially all of the year-over-year change. 
In the third quarter, we were most impacted by the Canadian dollar and the euro, which strengthened by 11% and 21%, respectively versus a year ago. The impact of M&A year-over-year was not material. The calendar shift impact was a negative 2% or almost $70 million of a headwind. These impacts have been discussed at great length previously and disclosed in our earnings materials, so I will not revisit those specifics other than to note that the calendar shift impact was completely consistent with our expectations. 
Adjusting for the aforementioned items, growth for the company as a whole was a positive 2%. This includes an approximate 1% headwind due to the previously discussed loss of a large client account in our business, excluding this single account, the remainder of our business would've grown at approximately 3% or more than $100 million in the quarter versus the prior year. 
Let's now move to Slide 5, for a discussion of our adjusted operating income, year-over-year performance. Please note, that we adjust our prior year, adjusted operating income figure for currency changes. Therefore, the 2014 adjusted operating income figure of $185 million has already been reduced by approximately $7.5 million versus the $192 million we reported a year ago for the impact of 4% due to currency translation. The calendar shift impact was approximately $7 million negative or 4% in the quarter, coming almost exclusively from our North American FSS segment. The underlying base business, AOI performance was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. 
In our North America FSS segment, we reported adjusted AOI of $107 million in the second quarter. This is a 10% decline from our prior year reported figure of $120 million. The calendar shift is most visible in this line item, accounting for approximately 6% of the 10% headwind or approximately $7 million to $18 million -- or $7 million to $8 million, of the $13 million change. The base business experienced a 4% declined in adjusted operating income of roughly $5 million.
As we disclosed previously, the timing of reinvestment in the business and account start ups are the largest factors influencing the cadence of quarterly results this year. Additionally, in Q3, the large Sports and Entertainment account loss as well as modest deterioration in our Canadian oil and gas business also impacted North America AOI in the quarter. As you would imagine with oil back of $40 per barrel range, we're receiving many inquiries regarding our exposure to the oil and gas sector. Our global exposure remains relatively small as we have approximately $400 million depending on the exchange rates or less than 3% of our total revenue being derived from this sector. 
While our North American FSS segment contains less than half of our global energy exposure in this business especially the Canadian remote business is more susceptible to short-term volatility due to its higher extraction costs. While we have experienced pressures in this area, we have been able to largely offset the volume declines with new business wins and sectors outside of Canada, thus far in 2015. While our energy-related businesses in Europe, in general, with held up better in North America, we remain cautious and prudent in our global outlook and we'll manage our cost base appropriately going forward. 
Our adjusted operating income in international FSS was $38 million, an increase of 9% versus the prior year. We achieved double-digit improvements in AOI across most of our European businesses through the combination of new business margin dropthrough and productivity initiatives. Our Chinese business also contributed a double-digit increase in AOI growth, driven by both revenue and progress and productivity. The uniform segment was up 8% on a year-over-year basis to $49 million. New business wins, better their efficiency in our plants and overall progress on productivity initiatives have all contributed once again to a good quarter for this segment. Neither uniforms or international were materially impacted by the calendar shift. 
Unallocated corporate expense was up $2 million to $17 million. This increase is reflected of our ongoing investment programs in both capability and systems. I'd like to spend a moment on Slide 6 expanding on Eric's earlier comments regarding the productivity progress in our base business. 
While reiterating that these initiatives don't move in straight lines, we are very pleased with the productivity progress we're making across all of our businesses. As Eric mentioned year-to-date, we estimate on average margins on our base accounts have increased by about 50 basis points. We are becoming more efficient each and every day in the management of food, labor and overhead across all of our businesses and geographies. We have a long way to go relative to the opportunity in front of us, but the progress is real an dits tangible. 
As the slide illustrates, during the first 9 months of the year, we did continue to reinvest in the business through improvements in our systems and capabilities, which we refer to as transformation investments as well as start-up accounts, which include the ramping of several very large new accounts. As you know, over the last few years, the company has accelerated its top line growth, which has been achieved in part by securing many large notable new accounts. In general, we're quite pleased with the state of this new business and confident in its prospects, but not surprisingly both the magnitude of the start ups, as well as the speed of the ramp-up, has influence the rate of our margin flow-through over the past 3 quarters.
In the rare cases where we're not happy with some aspect of the new business and we're unable to find confidence in the path to achieve our expected returns on capital and margin levels, we will take action to protect our financial performance and preserve shareholder value. As an example, we've recently undertaken just such a step with respect to one account in our corrections line of business. The account initiative is a large contributor to the year-to-date investment in this category and our exit from it over the next several months will have positive outcomes for us financially in fiscal 2016. 
As my last note on this slide, I would point out that the calendar shift is a 10 basis point headwind to margins for the 9-month period. This will reverse in Q4, which combined with the timing of reinvestments, should lead to significant margin expansion in Q4. As we will discuss in a moment, our expectations for performance are unchanged for the year and remain consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. 
On Slide 7, I'll touch on just a few aspects of our balance sheet and cash flow. Our liquidity remains quite strong and in this seasonally lower earnings quarter, our cash revolver availability is good at over $600 million. We continue to retain quite a bit of flexibility to strategically manage our debt maturity profile given the lack of any maturities of note for the next several years. 
For the year, our anticipated capital spending should be between 3.25% and 3.5% of sales. As we anticipated, we're well ahead of prior year free cash flow given the impact of the 53rd-week in 2014. We continue to expect to be significantly better than the prior year on a full year basis on cash flow. We're pleased to have recently received a 1 notch upgrade from Moody's, which we believe is reflective both of our improving overall leverage profile as well as our commitment to prudently manage the capital structure of the company. We are committed to preserving the appropriate financial flexibility to ensuring we're optimizing our cost of capital, to investing in appropriate growth opportunities that meet our return expectations and to allocating capital to create value by balancing dividends and deleveraging. 
Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.4x was a 30 basis point improvement from prior year and we continue to expect improvement in this figure to around 4 to 4.1x on year-end.
On Slide 8, we are reaffirming our views on the second half of the year as well as our full year for fiscal 2015. These are all unchanged from our prior communications. In general, as it relates to Q4, I would remind you the calendar impact will positively affect our reported results so both sales and adjusted operating income will likely be higher by 2% and 4%, respectively for the company and more so within the North America FSS segment. In that segment specifically, we do continue to expect organic revenue to be down year-over-year for the second half. The revenue loss from the previously mentioned client account in S&E and the previously discussed nonrecurring facilities work that took place in the fourth quarter of 2014 will present 4% and 3% headwinds, specifically. Again, in spite of the substantial revenue headwind, we continue to expect strong year-over-year adjusted operating income improvement in FSS North America as our productivity initiatives accelerate. 
I would summarize our second half and thus, fourth quarter expectations for international in uniform segment's quite simply. It should be more of the same, consistent revenue, operating income growth as well as progress on productivity initiatives. For Aramark as a whole, the previously mentioned items in North America will prevent us from exceeding prior year reported figures for second half revenue. Though the company's adjusted operating income and profitability levels will be better than 2014. Currency remains essentially unchanged from the time of our last call. And as Eric referenced, our currency adjusted EPS expectations for the whole year remain unchanged at $1.50 to $1.60. And at this point in time, we would expect to be around the midpoint of that range by the time the year closes. 
Before I turn the call back to Shannon for Q&A, I did want to make the audience aware that the company is planning to hold a market day event in the fourth quarter of the calendar year of 2015. More details will soon be forthcoming. And with that, Shannon, I'd ask you to please start putting people in the queue for the question-and-answer session. Thank you."

We will start that up in March, so literally, it will be a second half impact to our fiscal 2016. It's a business that has attractive margins, and I would say relative to some of our businesses, if you really think about the degree of difficulty of start ups, think about the very heavy people intensive businesses. I would say, certainly our K-12 business, our corrections business, are much higher degree of difficulty, our sports business probably a higher degree of difficulty. The parks business therefore, this account will be a much smoother transition than the typical start up. So I think as we look at this, this is an account that will be accretive to the top line and accretive to the bottom line very, very early."

We've also, fund the labor side, really begun to put in place a pilot across our lines of business about the more standardized in-unit labor model. And so again, you'll continue to see this evolve. The heavy lifting to date has been largely in the area of managing overtime and agency on the labor side, managing on the food side waste and then getting it the above unit SG&A. Going forward, we'll be far more holistic, particularly on the food and labor side as we look to streamline activities across the value chain. On the food side, anything from procurement the distribution through the food production process were -- the need for us to simplify that drives a lot of savings. So this is a multi-year journey. Again, very early innings. But the good news is as evidenced in the improvement of our base productivity, the initiatives are paying off. And relative to what is -- relative to the timing and how many accounts, we will always be at various points on different initiatives from piloting in a couple of accounts to in-process of the role out to full implementations.

So I'd say imagine in that instance, we're actually clicking on all cylinders across each and every one of those businesses. I think as you look at our North America business as Steve has highlighted and as we've talked about, and we've had a variety of things, one is the calendar shift, the second is most of that investment bucket goes into North America. Most of that new business headwind goes into North America. I guess, what I would say is, as we look to the full year, you will see us expand margins in North America."

I mean the way I think about it is, there is all 3 disclosed segments, benefit to some extent, pro rata from progress on the productivity initiatives because many of the productivity initiatives, certainly on things like labor are applicable to all of them. However, as Eric referenced, the reality is North America takes a disproportionate amount of the headwinds on both capability investment because a lot of that is system infrastructure and where we're probably most pressing system issues are, a little more North America-centric than anywhere and certainly, the start up. So everybody's getting the benefit of the progress, but one of them is taking a lot of the weight associated with the investment side."

Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in both this morning's release and on our website as well.
Before I turn the call over to Eric, I did want to provide a brief reminder regarding the 53rd-week calendar shift. Recall that this shift has only a small negative impact for the full year fiscal 2015, but it has a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015's quarterly results. In the third quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to have reduced third quarter sales by approximately 2%, adjusted operating income by approximately 4% and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.02. You may also recall, the impact on our North America segment is more significant. You should be mindful of this shift, particularly when making comparisons to prior year results. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric?"
1004106,308445406,857707,"Aramark, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 12, 2015",2015-08-12,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Ian. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us. As we reported in this morning's news release, third quarter results were solidly in line with our previously committed expectations. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.29, and excluding t",1602,"Thanks, Ian. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us. As we reported in this morning's news release, third quarter results were solidly in line with our previously committed expectations. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.29, and excluding the calendar shift, we estimate total company organic sales were up about 2%. We continue to make good progress against our transformation agenda, and we're reaffirming our earnings outlook for the fiscal year of $1.50 to $1.60 in adjusted EPS. 
As you know, I like to anchor these calls in the 3 pillars of our transformation strategy, or what I refer to as our 3 As: accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent. Looking at sales growth in the quarter, excluding the calendar impact, total company sales were up about 2%. In our North America segment, our Sports & Entertainment business was impacted negatively by the previously disclosed large account nonrenewal, which resulted in a flattish net organic sales result in the quarter, as anticipated and previously communicated. 
In our largest sector, Education, as well as our Healthcare Hospitality business, we saw mid-single-digit growth. In both cases, we continued to onboard strong net new account wins and our base business performed well as we saw strong retention rates broadly. In our international segment, we experienced another strong quarter. Revenue growth was up 6%; European sales grew in the mid-single digits, led by Germany; emerging markets was up double-digit with strong double-digit performance in China. In our uniform segment, organic sales increased another 4% and the business remains on track for another year of solid growth. 
Our selling strategy and efforts continue to meet with success in the marketplace and resulted in some great new client additions in the quarter, including the recently awarded Yosemite contract from the National Park Service. This is the biggest client contract win in Aramark's history. Yosemite becomes the ninth park that we are serving for the national park system. Under a 15-year contract scheduled to begin in March of 2016, we will begin to manage all of Yosemite's hospitality programs, including lodging, food and beverage, retail, recreational, and transportation services. The addition of Yosemite reconfirms that our parks business is a core competency for us. As a matter of fact, in 2014, Aramark hosted over 22 million visitors at our 16 different national state parks. 
In addition to Yosemite, other notable wins include the Archdiocese of Chicago, Floatel International in the U.K., several higher-ed self-op conversions and a number of new facility and health care clients. On a nearer-term note, we've also been named the official provider of food and beverages as well as retail merchandise in conjunction with Pope Francis' visit to Philadelphia next month, which is expected to bring over 1 million visitors to the city. Aramark will also provide uniforms to the over 10,000 volunteers staffing this event. 
As I've mentioned before, our mission at Aramark is all about dreaming and doing, to make sure we enrich and nourish lives. And at Aramark, dreaming is all about innovation. Innovation is important in retaining and winning clients by creating a superior and differentiated customer experience. Over the longer term, it's also a significant driver of shareholder value creation. And to these points, there are several important innovation developments worth mentioning in the areas of convenience, culinary and the community. 
In the area of convenience, we know the value of convenience to enhance the overall consumer experience, and technology really affords us the greatest opportunity to deliver against that promise. We continue to expand the number of locations utilizing Apple Pay, and we'll have several hundred campuses using the system as the school year opens. We are also increasing the number of sports and entertainment venues to feature an Apple Pay as the fall sports seasons begins to kick off. 
In the area of culinary, we relied on consumer insights to set the table, and we're keeping pace with that ever-changing interest of consumers. That includes testing health and wellness concepts like greens to go, which are toss-to-order salads; customized protein bowls; along with fast-casual offerings like the Republic of Spice Indian fare that appeals to the growing variety-need states of consumers. 
In the community, our recently announced American Heart Association initiative really represents the most innovative alliance in Aramark's history. The initiative is titled Healthy for Life 20 by 20, and it's a 5-year commitment aimed at improving Americans' diets and health by 20% by the year 2020. The initiative includes industry-leading menu commitments that will reduce calories, reduce saturated fats and sodium levels 20%, while increasing fruits, vegetables and whole grains 20%. And these changes will touch more than 2 billion meals that Aramark serves annually at thousands of schools, businesses, hospitals and sports venues, with the expected impact of 10 billion meals by 2020. Our partnership with the American Heart Association reinforces both the alignment with our marketplace preferences and trends that ensures we're doing our part to contribute to the health and wellness of our consumers. 
Our commitment to innovation is a critical driver of both client retention and new business wins, and I'm convinced that these efforts are a meaningful contributor to new business wins year-to-date as well as the healthy retention rates we're experiencing, which remain at a mid-90s run rate for the year. 
Now let me turn to the second pillar, activating productivity. I'm pleased with the progress we're making with our initiatives in this area. In the third quarter and year-to-date, we estimate that we have achieved 40 and 50 basis points of margin expansion, respectively, driven by these base productivity improvements. These improvements are being driven by: One, in food cost, we continue to benchmark our supply chain across the value chain, from procurement to distribution to preparation, while also making sure we improve our processes and tools to eliminate menu complexity, reduce waste and leverage our scale.
We focused on reducing our labor costs as we drive productivity through standardizing our in-unit labor model, which addresses staffing, scheduling, overtime and agency expenses, as well as by lowering our SG&A cost by optimizing the above unit spans and layers and implementing zero-based budgeting cost controls. 
As I've previously shared, investments in growth, capability and technology are significant facilitators to unlock the productivity opportunity that lies before us, and we're currently reinvesting heavily in these areas. As expected, the timing of these reinvestments, combined with the start-up costs on a few significant new accounts, has been a headwind to margin expansion year-to-date. Also, as expected, we will begin to lap these start-up costs, and our reinvestment levels are lower in fourth quarter, which should result in meaningful margin expansion during the quarter. 
In fact, over the next few years, we expect this level of reinvestment to normalize, at which point, we anticipate more of the gross productivity savings will flow through to margin. We continue to expect those savings to meaningfully close the margin gap to industry-leading peers. Ultimately, through these cost actions, additional purchasing initiatives and improvement in our pricing strategies, we believe industry-leading margins are achievable. And this is going to be more of a marathon than an overnight road race, but again, our quarterly results will vary, but ultimately, we have the right strategy and a very good line of sight to our goals. 
I'll move up to our third pillar of our focus strategy, attracting the best talent. We continue to build our culture and provide tools to ensure that we obtain and retain the best team, capitalizing on new technology to help achieve that goal. During the third quarter, we introduced new tools that will accelerate the hiring process, reduce our time to fill open positions and improve the candidate experience. This technology will also free our frontline manager schedules, enabling them to spend more time on delivering great experiences for our key stakeholders. The well-being of our employees also remains a top priority, and we continue to expand our health and wellness programs to educate, enable and encourage our employees to lead healthier lifestyles. 
Our program has expanded beyond assessments and screening, and we've taken an outcomes-based approach that includes quarterly fitness challenges where employees earn incentives and rewards for participation and completion. We'll also be leveraging our American Heart Association alliance to expand the health and wellness impact to our own employees and their families. 
Finally, I'm pleased to report that our efforts in this area have again earned us national recognition as the best employer for healthy lifestyles for the fifth consecutive year. 
In the area of recognition, which is an integral component of our employee engagement, we recently announced that our top frontline associates who have earned our highest employee recognition, what we refer to as Aramark's Ring of Stars. And this annual recognition really aligns the entire company with our frontline-first and focused strategy and really spotlights our service stars who deliver exceptional experiences at the moment of truth for our consumers and clients every day. All of these efforts continue to serve to ensure that Aramark continues to be an employer of choice and a great place to work. 
So overall, a solid quarter replete with great new account wins, productivity momentum and an innovative partnership that will help shape our consumer offerings for the future. Despite the choppy earnings seasons and the uncertain macro environment we're navigating, I'm pleased to reaffirm our earnings outlook for the year and look forward to a calendar-shift-free 2016 that will benefit from our multiyear sales and productivity framework. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve."

I will start on Slide 4 with a year-over-year third quarter sales reconciliation. We achieved nearly $3.5 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in the third quarter of the prio",1775,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 4 with a year-over-year third quarter sales reconciliation. We achieved nearly $3.5 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in the third quarter of the prior year. This is a decline of 4%. As you can see from the slide, adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar provided the largest single reconciling item compared to the prior year and, on a net basis, account for essentially all of the year-over-year change. 
In the third quarter, we were most impacted by the Canadian dollar and the euro, which strengthened by 11% and 21%, respectively, versus a year ago. The impact of M&A year-over-year was not material. The calendar shift impact was a negative 2% or almost $70 million of a headwind. These impacts have been discussed at great length previously and disclosed in our earnings materials, so I will not revisit the specifics, other than to note that the calendar shift impact was completely consistent with our expectations. 
Adjusting for the aforementioned items, growth for the company as a whole was a positive 2%. This includes an approximate 1% headwind due to the previously discussed loss of a large client account in our S&E business. Excluding this single account, the remainder of our business would've grown at approximately 3% or more than $100 million in the quarter versus the prior year. 
Let's now move to Slide 5 for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. Please note that we adjust our prior year adjusted operating income figure for currency changes. Therefore, the 2014 adjusted operating income figure of $185 million has already been reduced by approximately $7.5 million versus the $192 million we reported a year ago for the impact of 4% due to currency translation. The calendar shift impact was approximately $7 million negative or 4% in the quarter, coming almost exclusively from our North American FSS segment. The underlying base business AOI performance was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. 
In our North America FSS segment, we reported adjusted AOI of $107 million in the quarter. This is a 10% decline from our prior year reported figure of $120 million. The calendar shift is most visible in this line item, accounting for approximately 6% of the 10% headwind or approximately $7 million to $18 million -- or $7 million to $8 million, excuse me, of the $13 million change. The base business experienced a 4% declined in adjusted operating income of roughly $5 million.
As we disclosed previously, the timing of reinvestment in the business and account start-ups are the largest factors influencing the cadence of quarterly results this year. Additionally, in Q3, the large Sports & Entertainment account loss as well as some modest deterioration in our Canadian oil and gas business also impacted North America AOI in the quarter. As you would imagine, with oil back in the $40-per-barrel range, we are receiving many inquiries regarding our exposure to the oil and gas sector. Our global exposure remains relatively small, as we have approximately $400 million, depending on the exchange rates, or less than 3% of our total revenue being derived from this sector. 
While our North American FSS segment contains less than half of our global energy exposure, this business, especially the Canadian remote business, is more susceptible to short-term volatility due to its higher extraction costs. While we have experienced pressures in this area, we have been able to largely offset the volume declines with new business wins in other sectors outside of Canada thus far in 2015. While our energy-related businesses in Europe, in general, had held up better than in North America, we remain cautious and prudent in our global outlook, and we'll manage our cost base appropriately going forward. 
Our adjusted operating income in international FSS was $38 million, an increase of 9% versus the prior year. We achieved double-digit improvements in AOI across most of our European businesses through the combination of new business margin drop-through and productivity initiatives. Our Chinese business also contributed a double-digit increase in AOI growth, driven by both revenue and progress in productivity. 
The uniform segment was up 8% on a year-over-year basis to $49 million. New business wins, better efficiency in our plants and overall progress on productivity initiatives have all contributed once again to a good quarter for this segment. Neither uniforms or international were materially impacted by the calendar shift. 
Unallocated corporate expense was up $2 million to $17 million. This increase is reflective of our ongoing investment programs in both capability and systems. 
I'd like to spend a moment on Slide 6, expanding on Eric's earlier comments regarding the productivity progress in our base business. 
While reiterating that these initiatives don't move in straight lines, we are very pleased with the productivity progress we're making across all of our businesses. As Eric mentioned year-to-date, we estimate that, on average, margins in our base accounts have increased by about 50 basis points. We are becoming more efficient each and every day in the management of food, labor and overhead across all of our businesses and geographies. We have a long way to go relative to the opportunity in front of us, but the progress is real and it's tangible. 
As the slide illustrates, during the first 9 months of the year, we did continue to reinvest in the business through improvements in our systems and capabilities, which we refer to as transformation investments, as well as start-up accounts, which include the ramping of several very large new accounts. As you know, over the last few years, the company has accelerated its top line growth, which has been achieved, in part, by securing many large, notable new accounts. In general, we're quite pleased with the state of this new business and confident in its prospects. But not surprisingly, both the magnitude of the start-ups as well as the speed of the ramp-up has influenced the rate of our margin flow-through over the past 3 quarters.
In the rare cases where we're not happy with some aspects of the new business and we're unable to find confidence in a path to achieve our expected returns on capital and margin levels, we will take action to protect our financial performance and preserve shareholder value. As an example, we've recently undertaken just such a step with respect to one account in our corrections line of business. The account at issue is a large contributor to the year-to-date investment in this category, and our exit from it over the next several months will have positive outcomes for us financially in fiscal 2016. 
As my last note on this slide, I would point out that the calendar shift is a 10 basis point headwind to margins for the 9-month period. This will reverse in Q4, which, combined with the timing of reinvestments, should lead to significant margin expansion in Q4. As we will discuss in a moment, our expectations for performance are unchanged for the year and remain consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. 
On Slide 7, I'll touch on just a few aspects of our balance sheet and cash flow. Our liquidity remains quite strong, and in this seasonally lower earnings quarter, our cash and revolver availability is good at over $600 million. We continue to retain quite a bit of flexibility to strategically manage our debt maturity profile, given the lack of any maturities of note for the next several years. 
For the year, our anticipated capital spending should be between 3.25% and 3.5% of sales. As we anticipated, we're well ahead of prior year free cash flow, given the impact of the 53rd week in 2014. We continue to expect to be significantly better than the prior year on a full year basis on cash flow. 
We're pleased to have recently received a 1-notch upgrade from Moody's, which, we believe, is reflective both of our improving overall leverage profile as well as our commitment to prudently manage the capital structure of the company. We are committed to preserving the appropriate financial flexibility, to ensuring we're optimizing our cost of capital, to investing in appropriate growth opportunities that meet our return expectations and to allocating capital to create value by balancing dividends and deleveraging. 
Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.4x was a 30 basis point improvement from prior year, and we continue to expect improvement in this figure to around 4 to 4.1x by year-end.
On Slide 8, we are reaffirming our views on the second half of the year as well as the full year for fiscal 2015. These are all unchanged from our prior communications. In general, as it relates to Q4, I would remind you, the calendar impact will positively affect our reported results, so both sales and adjusted operating income will likely be higher by 2% and 4%, respectively, for the company and more so within the North America FSS segment. 
In that segment specifically, we do continue to expect organic revenue to be down year-over-year for the second half. The revenue loss from the previously mentioned client account in S&E and the previously discussed nonrecurring facilities work that took place in the fourth quarter of 2014 will present 4% and 3% headwinds, specifically. Again, in spite of the substantial revenue headwind, we continue to expect strong year-over-year adjusted operating income improvement in FSS North America as our productivity initiatives accelerate. 
I would summarize our second half, and thus fourth quarter, expectations for international and uniform segments quite simply. It should be more of the same: consistent revenue, operating income growth as well as progress on productivity initiatives. 
For Aramark as a whole, the previously mentioned items in North America will prevent us from exceeding prior year reported figures for second half revenue, so the company's adjusted operating income and profitability levels will be better than 2014. Currency remains essentially unchanged from the time of our last call. And as Eric referenced, our currency-adjusted EPS expectations for the whole year remain unchanged at $1.50 to $1.60. And at this point in time, we would expect to be around the midpoint of that range by the time the year closes. 
Before I turn the call back to Shannon for Q&A, I did want to make the audience aware that the company is planning to hold a market day event in the fourth quarter of the calendar year of 2015. More details will soon be forthcoming. 
And with that, Shannon, I'd ask you to please start putting people into the queue for the question-and-answer session. Thank you."

It's a business that has attractive margins, and I would say, relative to some of our businesses, if you really think about the degree of difficulty of start-ups, think about the very heavy, people-intensive businesses. I would say, certainly, our K-12 business, our corrections business, our much higher degree of difficulty, our sports business, probably a little higher degree of difficulty.

And again, as we articulated on the call and have demonstrated in the slides, we're seeing strong base productivity gains, both in Q3 as well as year-to-date. And that's driven by everything we've talked about, from food and labor, SG&A, et cetera. As we get into the fourth quarter, just like as we signaled to you at the end of second quarter, you will begin to see some of the start-up headwinds as well as some of the investments begin to trail off. So if you look at our investment bucket for the year, the majority of that has already been spent. And so as the start-ups and investments fall off, you will see increased margin growth in fourth quarter. And I think, to answer your specific last question, yes, that 20 basis points is a number that I think you'll see on a full year basis."

Again, I think, the way we've tried to describe it is this is very much a journey, and you've heard us use the term we continue to be in the early innings. So I guess, the best way to describe it is, if you think about what we've done to date, we've worked really hard on the SG&A side, looking at spans and layers. We've worked really, really hard in the area of food this year, specifically, in the area of waste. We've also, on the labor side, really begun to put in place a pilot across our lines of business about a more standardized in-unit labor model. And so again, you'll continue to see this evolve. The heavy lifting to date has been largely in the area of managing overtime and agency on the labor side; managing, on the food side, waste; and then, getting it the above-unit SG&A. Going forward, we'll be far more holistic, particularly on the food and labor side, as we look to streamline activities across the value chain. On the food side, everything from procurement through distribution through the food production process where the need for us to simplify that drives a lot of savings. So this is a multiyear journey. Again, very early innings. But the good news is, as is evidenced by the improvement on our base productivity, the initiatives are paying off. And relative to -- what is -- relative to the timing and how many accounts, we will always be, at various points, on different initiatives from piloting in a couple of accounts to in-process of the rollout to full implementation. So it's almost impossible to give you a sense of how many accounts are through these. It's -- really, they're at varying stages, depending on the particular initiative."

The reality is, I think, what I'd take you back to is our -- the long-term framework that we have talked to you about at multiple times. So if you look at that revenue growth number, the 3% to 5%, if you look at that, it drives mid-to high single-digit AOI, and that translates into double-digit EPS.

And just to be clear, I want to make sure that I don't misrepresent or you don't misunderstand my point, we will continue to have investments. So that, along with the start-ups, which creates the lumpiness of the business, those 2 do not go away. Certainly, again, we'll continue to win new business, hopefully. We're encouraged by the pipeline, and we will continue to invest in the areas of growth, capability and technology, as we have.

Our China momentum is very strong. It's strong at the top line. Again, we saw very good growth in the quarter, and we'll post very good growth for the year. So if you look at our third quarter, our China business was up about 18% at the top line. So at this point in time, and maybe just a reminder, just so you understand the actual composition of our China business, it actually is more heavily skewed to facilities than it is food. But we have a very good business there. We've got a great local leadership team on the ground. And so they have over the last several years, and will continue [indiscernible] their results this year, be a strong, strong contributor to Aramark's overall growth and profitability."

I mean, we haven't -- we're not in the deflationary environment, for sure. However, it's very low single-digit inflation. And so is there some benefit for us as we make progress on the food side of our productivity initiatives because we have less of a headwind year-over-year on food inflation than we might otherwise have had? For sure, and that's helping us. But it also -- we had to think of the nature of our contracts, right? So food inflation does directly impact how much pricing we're able to achieve in a portion of our contracts that are essentially cost-plus type of contracts. So to the extent there's lower inflation, there's actually lower revenue associated with some of those contracts as well. But by and large, clearly, low inflation is a good thing for us, and that it's obviously helping us on food in general. And we don't see any reason that, that's going to radically change here within the remainder of the fiscal year right now."

On the sports side, it would be a higher percentage where we might have retail connected to the food service business. So because of the parks, the dynamic in that segment, they bid all of those services as one. That's different from the go-to-market model in the other channels where, again, if you look at our 2 big businesses, food service and facilities, those tend to be bid separately in each and every client, whether that's an education client, health care client, sports and entertainment client, et cetera.

Before I turn the call over to Eric, I did want to provide a brief reminder regarding the 53rd-week calendar shift. Recall that this shift has only a small negative impact for the full year fiscal 2015, but it has a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015's quarterly results. In the third quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to have reduced third quarter sales by approximately 2%, adjusted operating income by approximately 4% and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.02. You may also recall, the impact on our North America segment is more significant. You should be mindful of this shift, particularly when making comparisons to prior year results. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric?"
1004106,308445406,857795,"Aramark, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 12, 2015",2015-08-12,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Ian. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us.

As we reported in this morning's news release, third quarter results were solidly in line with our previously committed expectations. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.29, and excluding the calendar shift, we estimate total company organic sales were up about 2%. We continue to make good progress against our transformation agenda, and we're reaffirming our earnings outlook for the fiscal year of $1.50 to $1.60 in adjusted EPS. 
As you know, I like to anchor these calls in the 3 pillars of our transformation strategy, or what I refer to as our 3 As: accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent. Looking at sales growth in the quarter, excluding the calendar impact, total company sales were up about 2%. In our North America segment, our Sports & Entertainment business was impacted negatively by the previously disclosed large account nonrenewal, which resulted in a flattish net organic sales result in the quarter, as anticipated and previously communicated. 
In our largest sector, Education, as well as our Healthcare Hospitality business, we saw mid-single-digit growth. In both cases, we continued to onboard strong net new account wins and our base business performed well as we saw strong retention rates broadly. In our international segment, we experienced another strong quarter. Revenue growth was up 6%; European sales grew in the mid-single digits, led by Germany; emerging markets was up double-digit with strong double-digit performance in China. In our uniform segment, organic sales increased another 4% and the business remains on track for another year of solid growth. 
Our selling strategy and efforts continue to meet with success in the marketplace and resulted in some great new client additions in the quarter, including the recently awarded Yosemite contract from the National Park Service. This is the biggest client contract win in Aramark's history. Yosemite becomes the ninth park that we are serving for the national park system. Under a 15-year contract scheduled to begin in March 2016, we will begin to manage all of Yosemite's hospitality programs, including lodging, food and beverage, retail, recreational, and transportation services. The addition of Yosemite reconfirms that our parks business is the core competency for us. As a matter of fact, in 2014, Aramark hosted over 22 million visitors at our 16 different national state parks. 
In addition to Yosemite, other notable wins include Archdiocese of Chicago, Floatel International in the U.K., several higher-ed self-op conversions and a number of new facility and health care clients. On a nearer-term note, we've also been named the official provider of food and beverages as well as retail merchandise in conjunction with Pope Francis' visit to Philadelphia next month, which is expected to bring over 1 million visitors to the city. Aramark will also provide uniforms to the over 10,000 volunteers staffing this event. 
As I've mentioned before, our mission at Aramark is all about dreaming and doing, to make sure we enrich and nourish lives. And at Aramark, dreaming is all about innovation. Innovation is important in retaining and winning clients by creating a superior and differentiated customer experience. Over the longer term, it's also a significant driver of shareholder value creation. And to these points, there are several important innovation developments worth mentioning in the areas of convenience, culinary and the community. 
In the area of convenience, we know the value of convenience to enhance the overall consumer experience, and technology really affords us the greatest opportunity to deliver against that promise. We continue to expand the number of locations utilizing Apple Pay, and we'll have several hundred campuses using the system as the school year opens. We are also increasing the number of sports and entertainment venues to feature an Apple Pay as the fall sports seasons begins to kick off. 
In the area of culinary, we've relied on consumer insights to set the table, and we're keeping pace with that ever-changing interest of consumers. That includes testing health and wellness concepts like greens to go, which are toss-to-order salads; customized protein bowls; along with fast-casual offerings like the Republic of Spice Indian fare that appeals to the growing variety-need states of consumers. 
In the community, our recently announced American Heart Association initiative really represents the most innovative alliance in Aramark's history. The initiative is titled Healthy for Life 20 by 20, and it's a 5-year commitment aimed at improving Americans' diets and health by 20% by the year 2020. The initiative includes industry-leading menu commitments that will reduce calories, reduce saturated fats and sodium levels 20%, while increasing fruits, vegetables and whole grains 20%. And these changes will touch more than 2 billion meals that Aramark serves annually at thousands of schools, businesses, hospitals and sports venues, with the expected impact of 10 billion meals by 2020. Our partnership with the American Heart Association reinforces both the alignment with our marketplace preferences and trends that ensures we're doing our part to contribute to the health and wellness of our consumers. 
Our commitment to innovation is a critical driver of both client retention and new business wins, and I'm convinced that these efforts are a meaningful contributor to new business wins year-to-date as well as the healthy retention rates we're experiencing, which remain at a mid-90s run rate for the year. 
Now let me turn to the second pillar, activating productivity. I'm pleased with the progress we're making with our initiatives in this area. In the third quarter and year-to-date, we estimate that we have achieved 40 and 50 basis points of margin expansion, respectively, driven by these base productivity improvements. These improvements are being driven by: One, in food cost, we continue to benchmark our supply chain across the value chain, from procurement to distribution to preparation, while also making sure we improve our processes and tools to eliminate menu complexity, reduce waste and leverage our scale.
We focused on reducing our labor costs as we drive productivity through standardizing our in-unit labor model, which addresses staffing, scheduling, overtime and agency expenses, as well as by lowering our SG&A cost by optimizing the above unit spans and layers and implementing zero-based budgeting cost controls. 
As I've previously shared, investments in growth, capability and technology are significant facilitators to unlock the productivity opportunity that lies before us, and we're currently reinvesting heavily in these areas. As expected, the timing of these reinvestments, combined with the start-up costs on a few significant new accounts, has been a headwind to margin expansion year-to-date. Also, as expected, we will begin to lap these start-up costs, and our reinvestment levels are lower in fourth quarter, which should result in meaningful margin expansion during the quarter. 
In fact, over the next few years, we expect this level of reinvestment to normalize, at which point, we anticipate more of the gross productivity savings will flow through to margin. We continue to expect those savings to meaningfully close the margin gap to industry-leading peers. Ultimately, through these cost actions, additional purchasing initiatives and improvement in our pricing strategies, we believe industry-leading margins are achievable. And this is going to be more of a marathon than an overnight road race, but again, our quarterly results will vary, but ultimately, we have the right strategy and a very good line of sight to our goals. 
I'll move up to our third pillar of our focus strategy, attracting the best talent. We continue to build our culture and provide tools to ensure that we obtain and retain the best team, capitalizing on new technology to help achieve that goal. During the third quarter, we introduced new tools that will accelerate the hiring process, reduce our time to fill open positions and improve the candidate experience. This technology will also free our frontline manager schedules, enabling them to spend more time on delivering great experiences for our key stakeholders. The well-being of our employees also remains a top priority, and we continue to expand our health and wellness programs to educate, enable and encourage our employees to lead healthier lifestyles. 
Our program has expanded beyond assessments and screening, and we've taken an outcomes-based approach that includes quarterly fitness challenges where employees earn incentives and rewards for participation and completion. We'll also be leveraging our American Heart Association alliance to expand the health and wellness impact to our own employees and their families. 
Finally, I'm pleased to report that our efforts in this area have again earned us national recognition as a best employer for healthy lifestyles for the fifth consecutive year. 
In the area of recognition, which is an integral component of our employee engagement, we recently announced that our top frontline associates who have earned our highest employee recognition, what we refer to as Aramark's Ring of Stars. And this annual recognition really aligns the entire company with our frontline-first and focused strategy and really spotlights our service stars who deliver exceptional experiences at the moment of truth for our consumers and clients every day. All of these efforts continue to serve to ensure that Aramark continues to be an employer of choice and a great place to work. 
So overall, a solid quarter replete with great new account wins, productivity momentum and an innovative partnership that will help shape our consumer offerings for the future. Despite the choppy earnings seasons and the uncertain macro environment we're navigating, I'm pleased to reaffirm our earnings outlook for the year and look forward to a calendar-shift-free 2016 that will benefit from our multiyear sales and productivity framework. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve."

I will start on Slide 4 with a year-over-year third quarter sales reconciliation. We achieved nearly $3.5 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in the third quarter of the prio",1773,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 4 with a year-over-year third quarter sales reconciliation. We achieved nearly $3.5 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in the third quarter of the prior year. This is a decline of 4%. As you can see from the slide, adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar provided the largest single reconciling item compared to the prior year and, on a net basis, account for essentially all of the year-over-year change. 
In the third quarter, we were most impacted by the Canadian dollar and the euro, which strengthened by 11% and 21%, respectively, versus a year ago. The impact of M&A year-over-year was not material. The calendar shift impact was a negative 2% or almost $70 million of a headwind. These impacts have been discussed at great length previously and disclosed in our earnings materials, so I will not revisit the specifics, other than to note that the calendar shift impact was completely consistent with our expectations. 
Adjusting for the aforementioned items, growth for the company as a whole was a positive 2%. This includes an approximate 1% headwind due to the previously discussed loss of a large client account in our S&E business. Excluding this single account, the remainder of our business would've grown at approximately 3% or more than $100 million in the quarter versus the prior year. 
Let's now move to Slide 5 for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. Please note that we adjust our prior year adjusted operating income figure for currency changes. Therefore, the 2014 adjusted operating income figure of $185 million has already been reduced by approximately $7.5 million versus the $192 million we reported a year ago for the impact of 4% due to currency translation. The calendar shift impact was approximately $7 million negative or 4% in the quarter, coming almost exclusively from our North American FSS segment. The underlying base business AOI performance was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. 
In our North America FSS segment, we reported adjusted AOI of $107 million in the quarter. This is a 10% decline from our prior year reported figure of $120 million. The calendar shift is most visible in this line item, accounting for approximately 6% of the 10% headwind or approximately $7 million to $18 million -- or $7 million to $8 million, excuse me, of the $13 million change. The base business experienced a 4% declined in adjusted operating income of roughly $5 million.
As we disclosed previously, the timing of reinvestment in the business and account start-ups are the largest factors influencing the cadence of quarterly results this year. Additionally, in Q3, the large Sports & Entertainment account loss as well as some modest deterioration in our Canadian oil and gas business also impacted North America AOI in the quarter. As you would imagine, with oil back in the $40-per-barrel range, we are receiving many inquiries regarding our exposure to the oil and gas sector. Our global exposure remains relatively small, as we have approximately $400 million, depending on the exchange rates, or less than 3% of our total revenue being derived from this sector. 
While our North American FSS segment contains less than half of our global energy exposure, this business, especially the Canadian remote business, is more susceptible to short-term volatility due to its higher extraction costs. While we have experienced pressures in this area, we have been able to largely offset the volume declines with new business wins in other sectors outside of Canada thus far in 2015. While our energy-related businesses in Europe, in general, had held up better than in North America, we remain cautious and prudent in our global outlook, and we'll manage our cost base appropriately going forward. 
Our adjusted operating income in international FSS was $38 million, an increase of 9% versus the prior year. We achieved double-digit improvements in AOI across most of our European businesses through the combination of new business margin drop-through and productivity initiatives. Our Chinese business also contributed a double-digit increase in AOI growth, driven by both revenue and progress in productivity. 
The uniform segment was up 8% on a year-over-year basis to $49 million. New business wins, better efficiency in our plants and overall progress on productivity initiatives have all contributed once again to a good quarter for this segment. Neither uniforms or international were materially impacted by the calendar shift. 
Unallocated corporate expense was up $2 million to $17 million. This increase is reflective of our ongoing investment programs in both capability and systems. 
I'd like to spend a moment on Slide 6, expanding on Eric's earlier comments regarding the productivity progress in our base business. 
While reiterating that these initiatives don't move in straight lines, we are very pleased with the productivity progress we're making across all of our businesses. As Eric mentioned year-to-date, we estimate that, on average, margins in our base accounts have increased by about 50 basis points. We are becoming more efficient each and every day in the management of food, labor and overhead across all of our businesses and geographies. We have a long way to go relative to the opportunity in front of us, but the progress is real and it's tangible. 
As the slide illustrates, during the first 9 months of the year, we did continue to reinvest in the business through improvements in our systems and capabilities, which we refer to as transformation investments, as well as start-up accounts, which include the ramping of several very large new accounts. As you know, over the last few years, the company has accelerated its top line growth, which has been achieved, in part, by securing many large, notable new accounts. In general, we're quite pleased with the state of this new business and confident in its prospects. But not surprisingly, both the magnitude of the start-ups as well as the speed of the ramp-up has influenced the rate of our margin flow-through over the past 3 quarters.
In the rare cases where we're not happy with some aspects of the new business and we're unable to find confidence in a path to achieve our expected returns on capital and margin levels, we will take action to protect our financial performance and preserve shareholder value. As an example, we've recently undertaken just such a step with respect to one account in our corrections line of business. The account at issue is a large contributor to the year-to-date investment in this category, and our exit from it over the next several months will have positive outcomes for us financially in fiscal 2016. 
As my last note on this slide, I would point out that the calendar shift is a 10-basis-point headwind to margins for the 9-month period. This will reverse in Q4, which, combined with the timing of reinvestments, should lead to significant margin expansion in Q4. As we will discuss in a moment, our expectations for performance are unchanged for the year and remain consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. 
On Slide 7, I'll touch on just a few aspects of our balance sheet and cash flow. Our liquidity remains quite strong, and in this seasonally low earnings quarter, our cash and revolver availability is good at over $600 million. We continue to retain quite a bit of flexibility to strategically manage our debt maturity profile, given the lack of any maturities of note for the next several years. 
For the year, our anticipated capital spending should be between 3.25% and 3.5% of sales. As we anticipated, we're well ahead of prior year free cash flow, given the impact of the 53rd week in 2014. We continue to expect to be significantly better than the prior year on a full year basis on cash flow. 
We're pleased to have recently received a 1-notch upgrade from Moody's which, we believe, is reflective both of our improving overall leverage profile as well as our commitment to prudently manage the capital structure of the company. We are committed to preserving the appropriate financial flexibility, to ensuring we're optimizing our cost of capital, to investing in appropriate growth opportunities that meet our return expectations and to allocating capital to create value by balancing dividends and deleveraging. 
Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.4x was a 30 basis point improvement from prior year, and we continue to expect improvement in this figure to around 4 to 4.1x by year-end.
On Slide 8, we are reaffirming our views on the second half of the year as well as the full year for fiscal 2015. These are all unchanged from our prior communications. In general, as it relates to Q4, I would remind you, the calendar impact will positively affect our reported results, so both sales and adjusted operating income will likely be higher by 2% and 4%, respectively, for the company and more so within the North America FSS segment. 
In that segment specifically, we do continue to expect organic revenue to be down year-over-year for the second half. The revenue loss from the previously mentioned client account in S&E and the previously discussed nonrecurring facilities work that took place in the fourth quarter of 2014 will present 4% and 3% headwinds, specifically. Again, in spite of the substantial revenue headwind, we continue to expect strong year-over-year adjusted operating income improvement in FSS North America as our productivity initiatives accelerate. 
I would summarize our second half, and thus fourth quarter, expectations for international and uniform segments quite simply. It should be more of the same: consistent revenue, operating income growth as well as progress on productivity initiatives. 
For Aramark as a whole, the previously mentioned items in North America will prevent us from exceeding prior year reported figures for second half revenue, though the company's adjusted operating income and profitability levels will be better than 2014. Currency remains essentially unchanged from the time of our last call. And as Eric referenced, our currency-adjusted EPS expectations for the whole year remain unchanged at $1.50 to $1.60. And at this point in time, we would expect to be around the midpoint of that range by the time the year closes. 
Before I turn the call back to Shannon for Q&A, I did want to make the audience aware that the company is planning to hold a market day event in the fourth quarter of the calendar year of 2015. More details will soon be forthcoming. 
And with that, Shannon, I'd ask you to please start putting people into the queue for the question-and-answer session. Thank you."

And that's driven by everything we've talked about, from food and labor, SG&A, et cetera. As we get into the fourth quarter, just like as we signaled to you at the end of second quarter, you will begin to see some of the start-up headwinds as well as some of the investments begin to trail off. So if you look at our investment bucket for the year, the majority of that has already been spent.

So I guess, the best way to describe it is, if you think about what we've done to date, we've worked really hard on the SG&A side, looking at spans and layers. We've worked really, really hard in the area of food this year, specifically, in the area of waste. We've also, on the labor side, really begun to put in place a pilot across our lines of business about a more standardized in-unit labor model. And so again, you'll continue to see this evolve. The heavy lifting to date has been largely in the area of managing overtime and agency on the labor side; managing, on the food side, waste; and then, getting it the above-unit SG&A. Going forward, we'll be far more holistic, particularly on the food and labor side, as we look to streamline activities across the value chain. On the food side, everything from procurement through distribution through the food production process where the need for us to simplify that drives a lot of savings. So this is a multiyear journey. Again, very early innings. But the good news is, as is evidenced by the improvement in our base productivity, the initiatives are paying off. And relative to -- what is -- relative to the timing and how many accounts, we will always be, at various points, on different initiatives from piloting in a couple of accounts to in-process of the rollout to full implementation. So it's almost impossible to give you a sense of how many accounts are through these. It's -- really, they're at varying stages, depending on the particular initiative."

The reality is, I think, what I'd take you back to is our -- the long-term framework that we have talked to you about at multiple times. So if you look at that revenue growth number, the 3% to 5%, if you look at that, it drives mid-to high single-digit AOI, and that translates into double-digit EPS. I think that's the long-term algorithm you should continue to model. And just to be clear, I want to make sure that I don't misrepresent or you don't misunderstand my point, we will continue to have investments. So that, along with the start-ups, which creates the lumpiness of the business, those 2 do not go away. Certainly, again, we'll continue to win new business, hopefully. We're encouraged by the pipeline, and we will continue to invest in the areas of growth, capability and technology, as we have. So my point around it falling off in fourth quarter is when we put the plan together for this year, 2015, we heavy-ed up the annual investments into the first 3 quarters. That will fall off in fourth quarter. As we build the 2016 plan, we'll calendarize it -- calendarize those investments as needed for the -- from the business."

For sure, and that's helping us. But it also -- we had to think of the nature of our contracts, right? So food inflation does directly impact how much pricing we're able to achieve in a portion of our contracts that are essentially cost-plus type of contracts. So to the extent there's lower inflation, there's actually lower revenue associated with some of those contracts as well. But by and large, clearly, low inflation is a good thing for us in that it's obviously helping us on food in general. And we don't see any reason that, that's going to radically change here within the remainder of the fiscal year right now."

On the sports side, it would be a higher percentage where we might have retail connected to the food service business. So because of the parks, the dynamic in that segment, they bid all of those services as one. That's different from the go-to-market model in the other channels where, again, if you look at our 2 big businesses, food service and facilities, those tend to be bid separately in each and every client, whether that's an education client, health care client, sports and entertainment client, et cetera.

It is also detailed on Page 2 of our earnings slide deck, which is additionally available on our website in the Investor Relations tab.

Before I turn the call over to Eric, I did want to provide a brief reminder regarding the 53rd-week calendar shift. Recall that this shift has only a small negative impact for the full year fiscal 2015, but it has a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015's quarterly results. In the third quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to have reduced third quarter sales by approximately 2%, adjusted operating income by approximately 4% and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.02. You may also recall, the impact on our North America segment is more significant. You should be mindful of this shift, particularly when making comparisons to prior year results. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Eric?"
1004106,308445406,859203,"Aramark, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 12, 2015",2015-08-12,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Ian. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us.

As we reported in this morning's news release, third quarter results were solidly in line with our previously committed expectations. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.29, and excluding the calendar shift, we estimate total company organic sales were up about 2%. We continue to make good progress against our transformation agenda, and we're reaffirming our earnings outlook for the fiscal year of $1.50 to $1.60 in adjusted EPS. 
As you know, I like to anchor these calls in the 3 pillars of our transformation strategy, or what I refer to as our 3 As: accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent. Looking at sales growth in the quarter, excluding the calendar impact, total company sales were up about 2%. In our North America segment, our Sports & Entertainment business was impacted negatively by the previously disclosed large account nonrenewal, which resulted in a flattish net organic sales result in the quarter, as anticipated and previously communicated. 
In our largest sector, Education as well as our Healthcare Hospitality business, we saw mid-single-digit growth. In both cases, we continued to onboard strong net new account wins and our base business performed well as we saw strong retention rates broadly. In our international segment, we experienced another strong quarter. Revenue growth was up 6%; European sales grew in the mid-single digits, led by Germany; emerging markets was up double-digit with strong double-digit performance in China. In our uniform segment, organic sales increased another 4% and the business remains on track for another year of solid growth. 
Our selling strategy and efforts continue to meet with success in the marketplace and resulted in some great new client additions in the quarter, including the recently awarded Yosemite contract from the National Park Service. This is the biggest client contract win in Aramark's history. Yosemite becomes the ninth park that we are serving for the national park system. Under a 15-year contract scheduled to begin in March 2016, we will begin to manage all of Yosemite's hospitality programs, including lodging, food and beverage, retail, recreational, and transportation services. The addition of Yosemite reconfirms that our parks business is the core competency for us. As a matter of fact, in 2014, Aramark hosted over 22 million visitors at our 16 different national state parks. 
In addition to Yosemite, other notable wins include Archdiocese of Chicago, Floatel International in the U.K., several higher-ed self-op conversions and a number of new facility and health care clients. On a nearer-term note, we've also been named the official provider of food and beverages as well as retail merchandise in conjunction with Pope Francis' visit to Philadelphia next month, which is expected to bring over 1 million visitors to the city. Aramark will also provide uniforms to the over 10,000 volunteers staffing this event. 
As I've mentioned before, our mission at Aramark is all about dreaming and doing, to make sure we enrich and nourish lives. And at Aramark, dreaming is all about innovation. Innovation is important in retaining and winning clients by creating a superior and differentiated customer experience. Over the longer term, it's also a significant driver of shareholder value creation. And to these points, there are several important innovation developments worth mentioning in the areas of convenience, culinary and the community. 
In the area of convenience, we know the value of convenience to enhance the overall consumer experience, and technology really affords us the greatest opportunity to deliver against that promise. We continue to expand the number of locations utilizing Apple Pay, and we'll have several hundred campuses using the system as the school year opens. We are also increasing the number of sports and entertainment venues to feature an Apple Pay as the fall sports seasons begins to kick off. 
In the area of culinary, we've relied on consumer insights to set the table, and we're keeping pace with that ever-changing interest of consumers. That includes testing health and wellness concepts like greens to go, which are toss-to-order salads; customized protein bowls; along with fast-casual offerings like the Republic of Spice Indian fare that appeals to the growing variety-need states of consumers. 
In the community, our recently announced American Heart Association initiative really represents the most innovative alliance in Aramark's history. The initiative is titled Healthy for Life 20 by 20, and it's a 5-year commitment aimed at improving Americans' diets and health by 20% by the year 2020. The initiative includes industry-leading menu commitments that will reduce calories, reduce saturated fats and sodium levels 20%, while increasing fruits, vegetables and whole grains 20%. And these changes will touch more than 2 billion meals that Aramark serves annually at thousands of schools, businesses, hospitals and sports venues, with the expected impact of 10 billion meals by 2020. Our partnership with the American Heart Association reinforces both the alignment with our marketplace preferences and trends that ensures we're doing our part to contribute to the health and wellness of our consumers. 
Our commitment to innovation is a critical driver of both client retention and new business wins, and I'm convinced that these efforts are a meaningful contributor to new business wins year-to-date as well as the healthy retention rates we're experiencing, which remain at a mid-90s run rate for the year. 
Now let me turn to the second pillar, activating productivity. I'm pleased with the progress we're making with our initiatives in this area. In the third quarter and year-to-date, we estimate that we have achieved 40 and 50 basis points of margin expansion, respectively, driven by these base productivity improvements. These improvements are being driven by: One, in food cost, we continue to benchmark our supply chain across the value chain, from procurement to distribution to preparation, while also making sure we improve our processes and tools to eliminate menu complexity, reduce waste and leverage our scale.
We focused on reducing our labor costs as we drive productivity through standardizing our in-unit labor model, which addresses staffing, scheduling, overtime and agency expenses as well as by lowering our SG&A cost by optimizing the above unit spans and layers and implementing zero-based budgeting cost controls. 
As I've previously shared, investments in growth, capability and technology are significant facilitators to unlock the productivity opportunity that lies before us, and we're currently reinvesting heavily in these areas. As expected, the timing of these reinvestments, combined with the start-up costs on a few significant new accounts, has been a headwind to margin expansion year-to-date. Also, as expected, we will begin to lap these start-up costs, and our reinvestment levels are lower in fourth quarter, which should result in meaningful margin expansion during the quarter. 
In fact, over the next few years, we expect this level of reinvestment to normalize, at which point, we anticipate more of the gross productivity savings will flow through to margin. We continue to expect those savings to meaningfully close the margin gap to industry-leading peers. Ultimately, through these cost actions, additional purchasing initiatives and improvement in our pricing strategies, we believe industry-leading margins are achievable. And this is going to be more of a marathon than an overnight road race, but again, our quarterly results will vary, but ultimately, we have the right strategy and a very good line of sight to our goals. 
I'll move up to our third pillar of our focus strategy, attracting the best talent. We continue to build our culture and provide tools to ensure that we obtain and retain the best team, capitalizing on new technology to help achieve that goal. During the third quarter, we introduced new tools that will accelerate the hiring process, reduce our time to fill open positions and improve the candidate experience. This technology will also free our frontline manager schedules, enabling them to spend more time on delivering great experiences for our key stakeholders. The well-being of our employees also remains a top priority, and we continue to expand our health and wellness programs to educate, enable and encourage our employees to lead healthier lifestyles. 
Our program has expanded beyond assessments and screening, and we've taken an outcomes-based approach that includes quarterly fitness challenges where employees earn incentives and rewards for participation and completion. We'll also be leveraging our American Heart Association alliance to expand the health and wellness impact to our own employees and their families. 
Finally, I'm pleased to report that our efforts in this area have again earned us national recognition as a best employer for healthy lifestyles for the fifth consecutive year. 
In the area of recognition, which is an integral component of our employee engagement, we recently announced that our top frontline associates who have earned our highest employee recognition, what we refer to as Aramark's Ring of Stars. And this annual recognition really aligns the entire company with our frontline-first and focused strategy and really spotlights our service stars who deliver exceptional experiences at the moment of truth for our consumers and clients every day. All of these efforts continue to serve to ensure that Aramark continues to be an employer of choice and a great place to work. 
So overall, a solid quarter replete with great new account wins, productivity momentum and an innovative partnership that will help shape our consumer offerings for the future. Despite the choppy earnings seasons and the uncertain macro environment we're navigating, I'm pleased to reaffirm our earnings outlook for the year and look forward to a calendar-shift-free 2016 that will benefit from our multiyear sales and productivity framework. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve."

I will start on Slide 4 with a year-over-year third quarter sales reconciliation. We achieved nearly $3.5 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in the third quarter of the prio",1775,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 4 with a year-over-year third quarter sales reconciliation. We achieved nearly $3.5 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in the third quarter of the prior year. This is a decline of 4%. As you can see from the slide, adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar provided the largest single reconciling item compared to the prior year and, on a net basis, account for essentially all of the year-over-year change. 
In the third quarter, we were most impacted by the Canadian dollar and the euro, which strengthened by 11% and 21%, respectively, versus a year ago. The impact of M&A year-over-year was not material. The calendar shift impact was a negative 2% or almost $70 million of a headwind. These impacts have been discussed at great length previously and disclosed in our earnings materials, so I will not revisit the specifics, other than to note that the calendar shift impact was completely consistent with our expectations. 
Adjusting for the aforementioned items, growth for the company as a whole was a positive 2%. This includes an approximate 1% headwind due to the previously discussed loss of a large client account in our S&E business. Excluding this single account, the remainder of our business would've grown at approximately 3% or more than $100 million in the quarter versus the prior year. 
Let's now move to Slide 5 for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. Please note that we adjust our prior year adjusted operating income figure for currency changes. Therefore, the 2014 adjusted operating income figure of $185 million has already been reduced by approximately $7.5 million versus the $192 million we reported a year ago for the impact of 4% due to currency translation. The calendar shift impact was approximately $7 million negative or 4% in the quarter, coming almost exclusively from our North American FSS segment. The underlying base business AOI performance was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. 
In our North America FSS segment, we reported adjusted AOI of $107 million in the quarter. This is a 10% decline from our prior year reported figure of $120 million. The calendar shift is most visible in this line item, accounting for approximately 6% of the 10% headwind or approximately $7 million to $18 million -- or $7 million to $8 million, excuse me, of the $13 million change. The base business experienced a 4% declined in adjusted operating income of roughly $5 million.
As we disclosed previously, the timing of reinvestment in the business and account start-ups are the largest factors influencing the cadence of quarterly results this year. Additionally, in Q3, the large Sports & Entertainment account loss as well as some modest deterioration in our Canadian oil and gas business also impacted North America AOI in the quarter. As you would imagine, with oil back in the $40-per-barrel range, we are receiving many inquiries regarding our exposure to the oil and gas sector. Our global exposure remains relatively small, as we have approximately $400 million, depending on the exchange rates, or less than 3% of our total revenue being derived from this sector. 
While our North American FSS segment contains less than half of our global energy exposure, this business, especially the Canadian remote business, is more susceptible to short-term volatility due to its higher extraction costs. While we have experienced pressures in this area, we have been able to largely offset the volume declines with new business wins in other sectors outside of Canada thus far in 2015. While our energy-related businesses in Europe, in general, had held up better than in North America, we remain cautious and prudent in our global outlook, and we'll manage our cost base appropriately going forward. 
Our adjusted operating income in international FSS was $38 million, an increase of 9% versus the prior year. We achieved double-digit improvements in AOI across most of our European businesses through the combination of new business margin drop-through and productivity initiatives. Our Chinese business also contributed a double-digit increase in AOI growth, driven by both revenue and progress in productivity. 
The uniform segment was up 8% on a year-over-year basis to $49 million. New business wins, better efficiency in our plants and overall progress on productivity initiatives have all contributed once again to a good quarter for this segment. Neither uniforms or international were materially impacted by the calendar shift. 
Unallocated corporate expense was up $2 million to $17 million. This increase is reflective of our ongoing investment programs in both capability and systems. 
I'd like to spend a moment on Slide 6, expanding on Eric's earlier comments regarding the productivity progress in our base business. 
While reiterating that these initiatives don't move in straight lines, we are very pleased with the productivity progress we're making across all of our businesses. As Eric mentioned year-to-date, we estimate that, on average, margins in our base accounts have increased by about 50 basis points. We are becoming more efficient each and every day in the management of food, labor and overhead across all of our businesses and geographies. We have a long way to go relative to the opportunity in front of us, but the progress is real and it's tangible. 
As the slide illustrates, during the first 9 months of the year, we did continue to reinvest in the business through improvements in our systems and capabilities, which we refer to as transformation investments as well as start-up accounts, which include the ramping of several very large new accounts. As you know, over the last few years, the company has accelerated its top line growth, which has been achieved, in part, by securing many large, notable new accounts. In general, we're quite pleased with the state of this new business and confident in its prospects. But not surprisingly, both the magnitude of the start-ups as well as the speed of the ramp-up has influenced the rate of our margin flow-through over the past 3 quarters.
In the rare cases where we're not happy with some aspects of the new business and we're unable to find confidence in a path to achieve our expected returns on capital and margin levels, we will take action to protect our financial performance and preserve shareholder value. As an example, we've recently undertaken just such a step with respect to one account in our corrections line of business. The account at issue is a large contributor to the year-to-date investment in this category, and our exit from it over the next several months will have positive outcomes for us financially in fiscal 2016. 
As my last note on this slide, I would point out that the calendar shift is a 10 basis point headwind to margins for the 9-month period. This will reverse in Q4, which, combined with the timing of reinvestments, should lead to significant margin expansion in Q4. As we will discuss in a moment, our expectations for performance are unchanged for the year and remain consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. 
On Slide 7, I'll touch on just a few aspects of our balance sheet and cash flow. Our liquidity remains quite strong, and in this seasonally low earnings quarter, our cash and revolver availability is good at over $600 million. We continue to retain quite a bit of flexibility to strategically manage our debt maturity profile, given the lack of any maturities of note for the next several years. 
For the year, our anticipated capital spending should be between 3.25% and 3.5% of sales. As we anticipated, we're well ahead of prior year free cash flow, given the impact of the 53rd week in 2014. We continue to expect to be significantly better than the prior year on a full year basis on cash flow. 
We're pleased to have recently received a 1-notch upgrade from Moody's which, we believe, is reflective both of our improving overall leverage profile as well as our commitment to prudently manage the capital structure of the company. We are committed to preserving the appropriate financial flexibility, to ensuring we're optimizing our cost of capital, to investing in appropriate growth opportunities that meet our return expectations and to allocating capital to create value by balancing dividends and deleveraging. 
Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.4x was a 30 basis point improvement from prior year, and we continue to expect improvement in this figure to around 4 to 4.1x by year-end.
On Slide 8, we are reaffirming our views on the second half of the year as well as the full year for fiscal 2015. These are all unchanged from our prior communications. In general, as it relates to Q4, I would remind you, the calendar impact will positively affect our reported results, so both sales and adjusted operating income will likely be higher by 2% and 4%, respectively, for the company and more so within the North America FSS segment. 
In that segment specifically, we do continue to expect organic revenue to be down year-over-year for the second half. The revenue loss from the previously mentioned client account in S&E and the previously discussed nonrecurring facilities work that took place in the fourth quarter of 2014 will present 4% and 3% headwinds, specifically. Again, in spite of the substantial revenue headwind, we continue to expect strong year-over-year adjusted operating income improvement in FSS North America as our productivity initiatives accelerate. 
I would summarize our second half, and thus fourth quarter, expectations for international and uniform segments quite simply. It should be more of the same: consistent revenue, operating income growth as well as progress on productivity initiatives. 
For Aramark as a whole, the previously mentioned items in North America will prevent us from exceeding prior year reported figures for second half revenue, though the company's adjusted operating income and profitability levels will be better than 2014. Currency remains essentially unchanged from the time of our last call. And as Eric referenced, our currency-adjusted EPS expectations for the whole year remain unchanged at $1.50 to $1.60. And at this point in time, we would expect to be around the midpoint of that range by the time the year closes. 
Before I turn the call back to Shannon for Q&A, I did want to make the audience aware that the company is planning to hold a market day event in the fourth quarter of the calendar year of 2015. More details will soon be forthcoming. 
And with that, Shannon, I'd ask you to please start putting people into the queue for the question-and-answer session. Thank you."

We've also, on the labor side, really begun to put in place a pilot across our lines of business about a more standardized in-unit labor model. And so again, you'll continue to see this evolve. The heavy lifting to date has been largely in the area of managing overtime and agency on the labor side; managing, on the food side, waste; and then, getting it the above-unit SG&A. Going forward, we'll be far more holistic, particularly on the food and labor side, as we look to streamline activities across the value chain. On the food side, everything from procurement through distribution through the food production process where the need for us to simplify that drives a lot of savings. So this is a multiyear journey. Again, very early innings. But the good news is, as is evidenced by the improvement in our base productivity, the initiatives are paying off.

So I'd say, in that instance, we're actually clicking on all cylinders across each and every one of those businesses. I think, as you look at our North America business, as Steve has highlighted and as we've talked about, again, we've had a variety of things. One is the calendar shift. The second is most of that investment bucket goes into North America. Most of that new business headwind goes into North America.

However, as Eric referenced, the reality is North America takes a disproportionate amount of the headwinds on both capability investment, because a lot of that is system infrastructure and where our, probably, most pressing system issues are a little more North America-centric than anywhere, and certainly, to the start-up piece. So everybody's getting the benefit of the progress, but one of them is taking a lot of the weight associated with the investment side."

So if you look at that revenue growth number, the 3% to 5%, if you look at that, it drives mid-to high single-digit AOI, and that translates into double-digit EPS.

And just to be clear, I want to make sure that I don't misrepresent or you don't misunderstand my point, we will continue to have investments. So that, along with the start-ups, which creates the lumpiness of the business, those 2 do not go away. Certainly, again, we'll continue to win new business, hopefully. We're encouraged by the pipeline, and we will continue to invest in the areas of growth, capability and technology, as we have.

For sure, and that's helping us. But it also -- we had to think of the nature of our contracts, right? So food inflation does directly impact how much pricing we're able to achieve in a portion of our contracts that are essentially cost-plus type of contracts. So to the extent there's lower inflation, there's actually lower revenue associated with some of those contracts as well. But by and large, clearly, low inflation is a good thing for us in that it's obviously helping us on food in general.

Here with me today are Eric Foss, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Bramlage, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I would like to remind you of our notice regarding forward-looking statements, which is included in our press release, can be found on our website and is also detailed on Page 2 of our earnings slide deck. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our SEC filings. 
Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found on this morning's press release and on our website as well. Before I turn the call over to Erik, I did want to provide a brief and thankfully, final reminder regarding the 53rd-week calendar shift. Recall that this calendar shift has only a small negative impact for full year fiscal 2015, but it has had a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015 quarterly results. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to have increased sales via approximately 2%, adjusted operating income by approximately 3%, and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.02. As we look to our 2016 disclosures, we will have fully lapped 53rd-week calendar shift impact and 2016's quarters will be comparable to 2015's without these calendar adjustments. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric"

As you saw in this morning's release, we reported a strong quarter and a record-setting year with record-setting revenue and the highest adjusted operating income and margins in the company's history. It's gratifying to see the crisp execution of our clear focus strategy, translate into double-digit comparable adjusted EPS growth, while also driving significant improvement in cash flow and meaningful strengthening of the balance sheet. 
I'm very proud of what the company and our 270,000 team members accomplished this year and feel that the board's recent decision to increase our quarterly common dividend by 10% validates both our progress as well as the confidence and the opportunity that lies before us. 
Turning to the numbers. I'm going to review our full year results. Steve will then go deeper into a detailed reconciliation for last year's 53rd-week in the calendar shift. But to keep it simple, my comments are based on our estimate of the comparable 52-week periods. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $1.57, a 10% increase last year on a comparable basis. Total company organic sales were up 2%, which meant our underlying sales growth remained consistent with our multiyear framework. Meaningful food, labor and SG&A productivity gains were achieved during the year, which supported those reinvestments and concurrent expansion in total, company AOI margins to 6.2%, which was a 30 basis point improvement. It also drove an increase in adjusted operating income to $881 million. 
Solid balance sheet improvement was seen through an almost $300 million improvement in year-over-year cash flow, which facilitated approximately $150 million in net debt repayments and approximately a 25 basis point reduction in our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 4.2x. 
Broadly speaking, our performance for the year was strong anyway you slice it. Looking at the year versus our strategic priorities which were accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent, we demonstrated progress across every category. You can see on slide for our progress was broad-based and consistent across our businesses. Our ability to accelerate growth was, driven by strong retention rates at 94% for the year. Our principle to ensure we cover inflationary increases through pricing was effective and our base business, we not only captured price, but also saw a slight volume improvement. 
We also achieved new business sales of $1.2 billion in the year, a level consistent with our multiyear framework. 2015 also saw us when our largest client ever in the company's history, Yosemite National Park, which will come online in March of 2016. North America organic sales were flattish for the year. Recall that our biggest impact was from the nonrecurring events in the Canadian remote services that occurred in this segment. 
We did see strong growth performance in our Education, Healthcare and Parks and Destination, and our international business saw organic sales growth of 5%, driven by continued expansion in Europe, up 2%; mid-single digit growth in South America and strong double-digit growth of 18% in China. Uniforms continued to benefit from our investments and capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth up 5% in the fourth quarter and 4% on a full year basis. 
Our selling efforts continue to yield results where we signed a number of new accounts, including the University of Akron, a self op higher ed conversion, several new Business & Industry clients and a number of new health care clients including Kennedy Health Systems. As we look forward, the pipeline of new business remains healthy which bodes well for continued execution alone our framework. 
As I mentioned earlier, innovation is a critical component of Aramark's right to win new clients and our ability to maintain healthy retention rates. Recent successes on the innovation front include the area of mobile technology, which is really fundamental to our growth, which builds consumer engagement and streamlines our operations and we're currently testing a first-in-class tool in stadiums that allow fans to place and pay for their orders using an iPad at the concession stand. They receive a text as soon as their order is ready and are back in their seats without missing any game time. 
In higher ed, we partnered with the app, Tap N Go, to offer students mobile food ordering and have plans to roll that out at more universities in the coming months. In the area of product innovation, we've launched a micromarket concept called Vibe that brings fresh, health and go foods to businesses, hospitals and schools that don't have cafeterias or have variable hours outside the normal operations. 
And we're also piloting a pop-up kitchen in Sports and Entertainment, which will feature rotating menus centered on the latest food trends and the hottest chefs. The kitchen is outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment, which enables us to rotate the food and beverage concept throughout the season at the flip of a switch. Progress is also being made on our health and wellness initiative, which we announced with the American Heart Association. Our culinary teams are taking a 3 pronged approach to impact the 2 billion meals that we serve annually by changing our menus towards healthier offerings, reengineering recipes to reduce calories, fat and sodium, and working with suppliers to source healthier ingredients. 
And starting next year, you're going to see these improvements along with our health education programs that we're launching with American Heart Association in underserved communities, and we look forward to keeping you posted on this important initiative. 
Another area of substantial progress for the company is our second strategic initiative, activating productivity. We saw increased productivity in savings across food, labor and SG&A, which facilitated a 30 basis point margin expansion. Our base productivity was very strong, which allowed us to reinvest in the growth and capability. 
Importantly, these margin gains were broad based across our segments, with margins improving 50 basis points in uniforms, 40 basis points in our international food and facilities business and a 20 basis point improvement in North America. I would point out that North America's strong performance in the fourth quarter as we saw the timing of our reinvestments and the lapping of start ups came in exactly as we expected and had communicated earlier. 
Our focus on driving a cultural mindset around efficiency and cost improvement remains vigilant. In the area of food, we're driving meaningful reductions through our waste initiatives and continue to see good future opportunities in reducing menu complexity and leveraging our scale across the supply chain. Labor costs are being lowered through active management of overtime and agency labor, and our continued rollout of our standard unit labor model, which provides a lot of runway for further efficiency capture. And we're also driving further reductions in SG&A by ensuring we simplify and streamline our above unit structure to ensure we have clear roles and accountabilities. 
And we'll use our Investor Day on December 1 for a deeper dive on this productivity. Now I'd like to move to the third pillar of our focus strategy, attracting the best talent where we're continuing to invest in the capability of our people. because to us, an engaged workforce helps us reduce turnover, increase productivity and improve service levels that we provide to our clients, all of which is accretive to shareholder value. 
Q4 saw continued action on our part to engage and reward our employees, and we continue to garner external recognition for these efforts. Last month, to honor those who deliver outstanding service to our customers, the company recognized 200 front-line employees as part of our inaugural ring of stars program. Winners were nominated by coworkers, managers and business leaders and were selected for demonstrating excellence in living Aramark's core values, delivering greatness at the moment of truth, and innovating the everyday while demonstrating a high degree of involvement in the communities that we serve. 
As I just mentioned our engagement efforts are not going unnoticed. Over the past 2 weeks, we remained a top 40 companies for diversity by Black Enterprise, and we received a perfect score on the 2016 Corporate Quality Index, a national benchmarking study and report on corporate policies administered by the human rights campaign foundation. So overall, we're extremely encouraged with the progress we made in 2015 along our transformation journey. We posted strong, broad-based financial results while balancing the need to reinvest in the business and also expand margins. And with that said, we also see a lot of runway to look forward to. 
This feels like a good set of for 2016 and our productivity momentum should allow us to be on our multiyear framework for the year. I look forward to taking deeper into our future prospects on our December 1 I Day webcast. And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve."
1004106,316157718,905680,"Aramark, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Now that we're able to discuss full year results, much of the noise associated our quarterly numbers from the calendar shift and the extra week dissipates. I would point out that in the appendix to the slides, you",1315,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Now that we're able to discuss full year results, much of the noise associated our quarterly numbers from the calendar shift and the extra week dissipates. I would point out that in the appendix to the slides, you will find sales and adjusted operating income reconciliations for the fourth quarter and my commentary on the mechanics of the annual roll forwards applied equally to the fourth quarter as well. 
Quickly commenting on the fourth quarter, our results are completely consistent with our prior expectations, a somewhat noisy top line due to comparables and a very strong bottom line improvement, driven by productivity gains in our North America FSS segment. We did book approximately $44 million of transformation and restructuring charges in the quarter, a portion of which relates to severance as we continue to look for ways to become more efficient with overhead spending. 
This number also includes a charge of $6 million for oil and gas asset impairment in Canada related to the macros and the energy sector. And $14 million for exiting certain emerging market operations that were not meeting and are not likely to meet our return expectations. In the interest of time, the remainder of my comments will focus on full year fiscal 2015, and I will start on Slide 5 with a year-over-year sales reconciliation. 
We achieved $14.3 billion in sales on a GAAP basis during 2015 compared to $14.8 billion last year. This is a decline of 3%. As you can see from the slide, adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar provided the largest single reconciling item compared to the prior year. We were most impacted by the Canadian dollar and the euro, which weakened by 12% and 15%, respectively, on average over our fiscal year. The impact of M&A on a year-over-year basis was not material. 
Recall that we reported a 53rd-week in the fourth quarter of 2014, which accounts for about $260 million of the year-over-year change. While the calendar shift in 2015 related to the extra week was meaningful on a quarterly basis, it is fairly negligible for the year, only about $31 million. The previously disclosed nonrecurring revenue from prior periods, which is the combination of the large account nonrenewal and the nonrecurring facilities work in the fourth quarter of last year, totaled about $200 million or roughly 1% of the change. 
Adjusting for these items, organic sales growth for the company was a positive 2%, absent the previously disclosed revenue items, the remainder of our business grew at over 3% or more than $450 million versus the prior year. I think I can speak for all of us that we look forward to a simpler roll forward in 2016. Let's now move to Slide 6, for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. 
Please note that we currently adjust our prior year adjusted operating income figure for currency changes. Therefore, the 2014 adjusted operating income figure of $852 million, has already been reduced by approximately $28 million versus the $878 million that we reported a year ago for the impact of currency translation or approximately 3%. 
Unlike the organic sales calculation, which adjusted the 53rd-week out, the $852 million in AOI that we generated in 2014 contained a $14 million estimated benefit from the 53rd-week. We did not break this number out separately in the prior year, hence, we're trying to be clear regarding this magnitude in our annual figures. As with sales, the calendar shift is not significant on a full year basis and represented only about a $7 million headwind. Taking all of these factors into account, we generated about $50 million or a 5% improvement in AOI year-over-year on a comparable apples-to-apples basis. Margins improved 30 basis points. 
Slide 7 provide the roll forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year. As with AOI, the 53rd-week was included in the $1.51 per share we reported last year. As indicated, the extra week impact was approximately $0.02 per share and currency was an approximately $0.06 a share headwind. Share dilution is a notable factor in the bridge. But this relates primarily to legacy pre-IPO grants, which will not be as relevant in the future. It was also impacted favorably by a 1.5 million share repurchase in the quarter, executed in conjunction with our former private equity sponsors, completing their exit from their ownership positions. Taking all of these factors into account, adjusted EPS was therefore, up 10% for the year. 
On Slide 8, I will touch on our balance sheet and cash flow. The strong results that we have been discussing throughout this call facilitated meaningful balance sheet improvement. Our year-end liquidity remains strong and our cash and revolver availability was just over $765 million when it closed out the year. Free cash flow improved by $297 million year-over-year, partially due to improved working capital management, higher earnings and the lack of a 53rd-week. This measurement includes an approximate $45 million voluntary contributions we made to fully fund our largest defined benefit pension obligations in Canada and the United Kingdom. 
Excess free cash flow was used to prepay almost $160 million in debt obligations and to repurchase the aforementioned 1.5 million shares. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was reduced by approximately 25 basis points to 4.15x and net capital expenditures for the year were $505 million, in line with our prior guidance of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales. You should expect more of the same from us regarding capital allocation in 2016. We will continue to allocate the majority of our free cash flow to deleveraging as we continue to enhance our financial flexibility. 
I would expect our total debt to EBITDA to end 2016 under 4x. Slide 9 details our current expectations for 2016. A few full-year comments first. Adjusted EPS should be between $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Based on current exchange rates, which we have listed in the appendix for your benefit, we would have around $0.03 of currency headwind year-over-year, primarily in the first quarter, as we lap the mid-teens decline of the Canadian dollar and the euro that occurred since the first quarter of 2015. 
CapEx is expected to be consistent with the last few years with the range of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales and free cash flow should increase with earnings and therefore, should exceed $200 million for the year. I will spend more time on the 2016 specifics of the Investor Day in a few weeks. Regarding segment expectations in the first half of 2016 for the company as a whole, we expect higher year-over-year revenues and earnings. The major pieces within our segments were as follows. 
In FSS North America, both revenues and earnings will be up versus the prior year, but not by as much as they will be in the second half. This is partially due to our first half investments, specifically in Yosemite account, which is not substantially come online until the second half of the year. In FSS International, we expect some incremental pressure in revenues from the offshore North Sea business in the United Kingdom due to oil prices as well as from the aforementioned decision to wind down several small businesses that are not meeting our return expectations. 
Uniforms is adding a new laundry facility in the first half. And as a result, we'll have some duplicative costs as we start up the new location, but continued to operate at the current site. In summary, we expect to be up on prior-year for the company on both revenue and earnings in both the first half and the second half. However, the stronger year-over-year performance will be in the second half due to timing of both comparables and energy and currency, and our investment schedule. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Eric"

But certainly, something in the 2% or lower number from an aggregate perspective and specifically on the minimum-wage, with everything that has been in active thus far, the net impact to us in 2016 is a couple of million dollars that's reflected in our overall algorithm.

This is a leading brand in Ireland. It's a leading consumer retail brand, one of the most successful retailers in Ireland. And so, as we look at this, we think it's a small tuck-in acquisition. They operate cafés and food halls and some destination stores, and they have a very successful catering company as well. And so our ability to take a small tuck-in acquisition and enhance our industry-leading position in this country, we felt it was a good strategic fit.

So I know that some of this is because you like to be conservative, and that's definitely nice. And it sounds like you expect the back half to be a little bit better than the first half. But maybe you could delve into a little bit of where you see some of the costs that are making you a little bit more conservative there, given the strong Q4 performance and even the strong 2015 performance. Is it the start-up costs? Is it may be more spending on innovation? I think may be you used up a little bit of the low-hanging fruit of margin expansion. Maybe you could elaborate there."

I think at the end of the day, what we feel great about right now, Denny, is we're coming off a year where we've had very strong results. We continue to execute well behind the clear and focus strategy where we're making good progress. You saw us this year and will continue to see us going forward on the productivity and margin march front, be very focused on enhancing our margins. And in addition to all that, make meaningful improvements on the balance sheet. So I would say as we look to the future, we are very positive and again, continue to see the same outsourcing potential that the sector's seen, the pipeline of new business is encouraging. We're very confident in our ability to go activate these productivity initiatives to capture margin. And so, I don't think there's anything as we look at 2016 that doesn't give us confidence that the guidance we've put out there is well within reach."

And that should lead to double-digit EPS performance over the medium-term. So I think if you look at the range that we put out for 2016, that works pretty well associated with the -- with those set of numbers, especially once you make the adjustment for currency, which we try to highlight to folks. I think the one word of caution I would give in general, is the exit rate for the fourth quarter, if you look at it in isolation, should not necessarily be construed to be the same as the entry rates for the first quarter next year, right? We had several one-off events in '14 above and beyond all of the noise we've talked about that helped our percentage improvements year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Those will not replicate in the first quarter and then as we've discussed before, we've got some investments on some pretty big accounts that we're going to be making in the front part of the year as we build-out teams, et cetera that won't have any corresponding revenue associated with them. So I certainly do expect the first half of the year as we had tried to indicate before, to be better than the prior year, but not as strong on a year-over-year basis since the second half will be in that, largely a function of what we need to do to get ourselves ready to onboard some accounts."

Starting up a model like a Chicago public school, it's very labor-intensive and some of that labor is transitioning is a very high degree of difficulty relative to start up. A place like Yosemite, where we will actually take 99% of the employees over is a much easier type of start-up. My only point is Yosemite, I hope is not our only large start up in 2016. So as we look at the pipeline, expect more start-up costs on clients that we have yet to win. And therefore, I think a good assumption is that you will see start-up costs that will be a result of some great new business wins, which we absolutely hope comes to fruition."

I think it's consistent, certainly consistent with the experience with last year or 2, and it's consistent with my expectation over the next couple of years. A large portion of what we're doing currently outside of investment required simply to support the on boarding of new client accounts, we're making significant investments in technology. Eric referenced that a couple of times, we'll give a deeper dive on that on the investor discussion. But when we talk about activating productivity along the lines of improving outcomes and food specifically are improving labor, a lot of that is technology either led or dependent. And so we have spent significant amounts of capital and time in the last couple of years both procuring and implementing technological system enhancements, and we will expect to continue to do that in the fiscal '16. And as we will talk about Investor Day, certainly for the next year or 2, as we continue to drive the margin March on the framework, I think it's realistic to expect the overall intensity of capital to be somewhat consistent with what we've had. The individual pieces, right, the types of things we invest in will move -- invest in, will move around a little bit as we complete investments in the labor space.

And I think within food costs, the way I at least, kind of bucket our cost opportunities. One is in the area of strategic sourcing. And I'll come back to that because that's where the core of your question is. But let me take you through the whole pipeline before I come back. The second is in the area of menu optimization and our ability to really simplify our menu, which simplifies SKUs, which simplifies the number of suppliers we have, which consolidates our purchasing strength, which adds to our scale and leverage. The third bucket is the whole food production process, kind of the manufacturing process. And then the fourth bucket is waste. We have opportunities across all of those. Most of our historical focus has been focused on waste bucket. And so when you talk about strategic sourcing, menu optimization or the food production process, we have opportunities across each and every one of those. On the strategic sourcing side, we do have a GPO in Canada. It is growing. It is something we're investing in. it is something that is a priority for us. But as you think about that margin March, I think you should think about it that we can certainly strengthen our position relative to the GPO. But understand, we have a lot of strength and leverage with suppliers today given our size and scale. So it's something we'll continue to look at. But at this moment in time, I think it's fair for you to walk away with our margin March rests largely on our ability to get it, those 4 buckets of food, plus what we need to do on the labor and SG&A to deliver against that margin."

I think in the medium-term, we have modest opportunity to improve the tax rate as it relates to both cash taxes and book taxes. I don't think we -- the nature of our business is not such where we have maybe the scale of opportunities with some companies with a different profile around intellectual property and transfer pricing and software moving across-border, we tend to be very local as a matter of course. But I think there is some opportunity there. It will take realistically, a little bit of time for us. We will need to do some structural things in terms of how we finance ourselves internally and how ultimately, we approach some aspects of the limit to transfer pricing that we have. So in the medium-term, there is some modest improvement potential there for us, I do not believe, again based on the fact of us being a U.S. domiciled in the nature of our business, there's probably not something that will significantly change that number in the next couple of years, at least under the current legislative environment that we have around taxes."

I think if you look at the performance of our uniform business, you should walk away with the following conclusions whether it's 2015 or whether it's the last several years. One is that the broad-based momentum continues in terms of our ability to grow the top line mid-single digit. Our ability to capture margin, I think the 50 basis points of margin expansion you saw in the year was built off a couple of years of -- 70 basis point margin improvement. So we feel very good about our continued ability to grow the top line, as well as expand margins. What you did see, and will continue to see as we invest in capacity is a shorter term impact on that margin expansion. And so I just want to make sure that as you think about the performance of the business, it has been very good relative to the momentum it has. And I think that will continue. But you do have this investment in capacity that we much need to do, particularly on the West Coast for top line purposes."

We will incur some implicative cost in the first half because we're essentially -- we're starting up something new, so we got -- with a single stream of revenue. And so we got to pay twofold to get the new one up before we can make changes to the old one. And so the lion's share of the improvement in the fiscal year will be in the second half, just based on the nature of that investment. And I think if you went back and looked at the cadence of our uniform business over the last 5 or 10 years, you would see something actually quite similar as we make money available from an investment standpoint, we tend to tread water for a period or 2 to get that embedded down. But it's that incremental capacity that then facilitates our ability to drive the incremental growth. And to Eric's point, we have great investment opportunities in uniforms business that generates very good returns. Obviously, as you can see for us, and as a -- it's a good problem for us to have for sure. And in terms of where our capacity currently is, and we'll make sure we're doing the right thing for them to drive the financial returns that we know they're capable of."

So on oil and gas generally, most of our impact in the fiscal of '15 was North America focus. So I would tell you, we probably incurred about $40 million of negative revenue headwinds over the course of the year, almost all in Canada and the remote oil or tar sands, or oil sands business and revenue -- or EBIT was probably high single digits, close to $10 million of year-over-year reduction. We really did not see a lot of direct oil and gas headwind outside of Canada in fiscal '15. And part of the reason we're trying to set expectations for the first half of this year -- I do think the headwinds that we currently see are growing specifically in Europe, specifically in the North Sea offshore platform business. It seems to be lagging in terms of the reactivity relative to what North America did. So I think we will probably have 1 more quarter based on the cadence. If energy stays where it is, we probably have 1 quarter of down in North America as we cycle through where things seem to have landed. And I do think we have some incremental -- modest incremental headwind in the U.K., which is what's partially driving our expectations for their revenue performance in the first half of the year. As it relates to uniform specifically, yes, we clearly benefited somewhat from diesel as a general rule. Now we tend to hedge our perspective diesel and fuel requirements out over a longer period of time in the next year. So we kind of layered in. So there was some modest improvement in general. And then I guess, the last thing, back to Europe real quickly, I would point out that our offshore business in general, oil and gas, I think we said is about 3% of the total company. So the European portion of that is obviously, that much smaller. So I don't believe it's material. But I think it'll be a-determiunder a little bit of pressure."

Here with me today are Eric Foss, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Bramlage, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I would like to remind you of our notice regarding forward-looking statements, which is included in our press release, can be found on our website and is detailed on Page 2 of the earnings slide deck. 
During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our SEC filings. 
Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in this morning's press release and on our website as well. 
Before I turn the call over to Eric, I did want to provide a brief and thankfully final reminder regarding the 53rd-week calendar shift. Recall that this calendar shift has only a small negative impact for full year fiscal 2015, but it has had a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015 quarterly results. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to have increased sales via approximately 2%, adjusted operating income by approximately 3% and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.02. As we look to our 2016 disclosures, we will have fully lapped the 53rd-week calendar shift impact and 2016's quarters will be comparable to 2015's without these calendar adjustments. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric."

As you saw in this morning's release, we reported a strong quarter and a record-setting year with record-setting revenue and the highest adjusted operating income and margins in the company's history. It's gratifying to see the crisp execution of our clear and focused strategy translate into double-digit comparable adjusted EPS growth while also driving significant improvement in cash flow and meaningful strengthening of the balance sheet. 
I'm very proud of what the company and our 270,000 team members accomplished this year and feel that the board's recent decision to increase our quarterly common dividend by 10% validates both our progress as well as the confidence and the opportunity that lies before us. 
Turning to the numbers. I'm going to review our full year results. Steve will then go deeper into a detailed reconciliation for last year's 53rd-week in the calendar shift. But to keep it simple, my comments are based on our estimate of the comparable 52-week periods. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $1.57, a 10% increase from last year on a comparable basis. Total company organic sales were up 2%, which meant our underlying sales growth remained consistent with our multiyear framework. Meaningful food, labor and SG&A productivity gains were achieved during the year, which supported those reinvestments and concurrent expansion in total company AOI margins to 6.2%, which was a 30 basis point improvement. It also drove an increase in adjusted operating income to $881 million. 
Solid balance sheet improvement was seen through an almost $300 million improvement in year-over-year cash flow, which facilitated approximately $150 million in net debt repayments and approximately a 25 basis point reduction in our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 4.2x. 
Broadly speaking, our performance for the year was strong any way you slice it. Looking at the year versus our strategic priorities, which were accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent, we demonstrated progress across every category. You can see on Slide 4 our progress was broad-based and consistent across our businesses. Our ability to accelerate growth was driven by strong retention rates at 94% for the year. Our principle to ensure we cover inflationary increases through pricing was effective. In our base business, we not only captured price, but also saw a slight volume improvement. We also achieved new business sales of $1.2 billion in the year, a level consistent with our multiyear framework. 2015 also saw us win our largest client ever in the company's history, Yosemite National Park, which will come online in March of 2016. 
North America organic sales were flattish for the year. Recall that our biggest impact was from the nonrecurring events in the Canadian remote services that occurred in this segment. We did see strong growth performance in our Education, Healthcare and parks and destinations business. And our international business saw organic sales growth of 5%, driven by continued expansion in Europe, up 2%; mid-single-digit growth in South America; and strong double-digit growth of 18% in China. Uniforms continued to benefit from our investments in capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth of 5% in the fourth quarter and 4% on a full year basis. 
Our selling efforts continued to yield results where we signed a number of new accounts including the University of Akron, a self-op higher ed conversion, several new business and industry clients and a number of new health care clients including Kennedy Health systems. As we look forward, the pipeline of new business remains healthy, which bodes well for continued execution along our framework. 
As I mentioned earlier, innovation is a critical component of Aramark's right to win new clients and our ability to maintain healthy retention rates. Recent successes on the innovation front include the area of mobile technology, which is really fundamental to our growth, which builds consumer engagement and streamlines our operations and we're currently testing a first-in-class tool at stadiums that allow fans to place and pay for their orders using an iPad at the concession stand. They receive a text as soon as their order is ready and are back in their seats without missing any game time. 
In higher ed, we've partnered with the app, Tap & Go, to offer students mobile food ordering and have plans to roll that out at more universities in the coming months. 
In the area of product innovation, we've launched a micromarket concept called vibe that brings fresh, health-and-go foods to businesses, hospitals and schools that don't have cafeterias or have variable hours outside the normal operations. 
And we're also piloting a pop-up kitchen in Sports & Entertainment, which will feature rotating menus centered on the latest food trends and the hottest chefs. The kitchen is outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment, which enables us to rotate the food and beverage concept throughout the season at the flip of a switch. 
Progress is also being made on our health and wellness initiative, which we announced with the American Heart Association. Our culinary teams are taking a 3-pronged approach to impact the 2 billion meals that we serve annually by changing our menus towards healthier offerings, reengineering recipes to reduce calories, fat and sodium and working with suppliers to source healthier ingredients. And starting next year, you're going to see these improvements along with our health education programs that we're launching with American Heart Association in underserved communities and we look forward to keeping you posted on this important initiative. 
Another area of substantial progress for the company is our second strategic initiative, activating productivity. We saw increased productivity in savings across food, labor and SG&A, which facilitated a 30 basis point margin expansion. Our base productivity was very strong, which allowed us to reinvest into growth and capability. Importantly, these margin gains were broad based across our segments with margins improving 50 basis points in uniforms, 40 basis points in our international food and facilities business and a 20 basis point improvement in North America. I would point out that North America's strong performance in the fourth quarter as we saw the timing of our reinvestments and the lapping of start-ups came in exactly as we expected and had communicated earlier. 
Our focus on driving a cultural mindset around efficiency and cost improvement remains vigilant. In the area of food, we're driving meaningful reductions through our waste initiatives and continue to see good future opportunities in reducing menu complexity and leveraging our scale across the supply chain. Labor costs are being lowered through active management of overtime and agency labor, and our continued rollout of our standard in-unit labor model, which provides a lot of runway for further efficiency capture. And we're also driving further reductions in SG&A by ensuring we simplify and streamline our above-unit structure to ensure we have clear roles and accountabilities. 
And we'll use our Investor Day on December 1 for a deeper dive on this productivity pillar. 
Now I'd like to move to the third pillar of our focused strategy, attracting the best talent, where we're continuing to invest in the capability of our people because to us an engaged workforce helps us reduce turnover, increase productivity and improve service levels that we provide to our clients, all of which is accretive to shareholder value. Q4 saw a continued action on our part to engage and reward our employees, and we continue to garner external recognition for these efforts. 
Last month, to honor those who deliver outstanding service to our customers, the company recognized 200 front-line employees as part of our inaugural Ring of Stars program. Winners were nominated by coworkers, managers and business leaders and were selected for demonstrating excellence in living Aramark's core values, delivering greatness at the moment of truth and innovating the everyday while demonstrating a high degree of involvement in the communities that we serve. 
As I just mentioned, our engagement efforts are not going unnoticed. Over the past 2 weeks, we remained a top 40 company for diversity by Black Enterprise, and we received a perfect score on the 2016 Corporate Quality Index, a national benchmarking study and report on corporate policies administered by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. 
So overall, we're extremely encouraged with the progress we made in 2015 along our transformation journey. We posted strong, broad-based financial results while balancing the need to reinvest in the business and also expand margins. And with that said, we also see a lot of runway to look forward to. 
This feels like a good setup for 2016 and our productivity momentum should allow us to be on our multiyear framework for the year. I look forward to digging deeper into our future prospects on our December 1 I Day webcast. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve."

Quickly commenting on the fourth quarter. Our results were completely consistent with our prior expectations, a somewhat noisy top line due to comparables and a very strong bottom line improvement, driven by productivity gains in our North America FSS segment. We did book approximately $44 million of transformation and restructuring charges in the quarter, a portion of which relates to severance as we continue to look for ways to become more efficient with overhead spending. This number also includes a charge of $6 million for oil and gas asset impairment in Canada related to the macros in the energy sector and $14 million for exiting certain emerging market operations that were not meeting and are not likely to meet our return expectations. 
In the interest of time, the remainder of my comments will focus on full year fiscal 2015, and I will start on Slide 5 with a year-over-year sales reconciliation. 
We achieved $14.3 billion in sales on a GAAP basis during 2015 compared to $14.8 billion last year. This is a decline of 3%. As you can see from the slide, adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar provided the largest single reconciling item compared to the prior year. We were most impacted by the Canadian dollar and the euro, which weakened by 12% and 15%, respectively, on average over our fiscal year. The impact of M&A on a year-over-year basis was not material. 
Recall that we reported a 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2014, which accounts for about $260 million of the year-over-year change. While the calendar shift in 2015 related to the extra week was meaningful on a quarterly basis, it is fairly negligible for the year, only about $31 million. The previously disclosed nonrecurring revenue from prior periods, which is the combination of a large account nonrenewal and a nonrecurring facilities work in the fourth quarter of last year, totaled about $200 million or roughly 1% of the change. Adjusting for these items, organic sales growth for the company was a positive 2%. Absent the previously disclosed revenue items, the remainder of our business grew at over 3% or more than $450 million versus the prior year. I think I can speak for all of us that we look forward to a simpler roll-forward in 2016. 
Let's now move to Slide 6 for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. Please note that we currently adjust our prior year adjusted operating income figure for currency changes. Therefore, the 2014 adjusted operating income figure of $852 million, has already been reduced by approximately $28 million versus the $878 million that we reported a year ago for the impact of currency translation or approximately 3%. Unlike the organic sales calculation, which adjusted the 53rd week out, the $852 million in AOI that we generated in 2014 contained a $14 million estimated benefit from the 53rd week. We did not break this number up separately in the prior year, hence, we're trying to be clear regarding its magnitude in our annual figures. 
As with sales, the calendar shift is not significant on a full year basis and represented only about a $7 million headwind. 
Taking all of these factors into account, we generated about $50 million or a 5% improvement in AOI year-over-year on a comparable apples-to-apples basis. Margins improved 30 basis points. 
Slide 7 provides the roll-forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year. As with AOI, the 53rd week was included in the $1.51 per share we reported last year. As indicated, the extra week impact was approximately $0.02 per share and currency was an approximately $0.06 a share headwind. Share dilution is a notable factor in the bridge, but this relates primarily to legacy pre-IPO grants, which will not be as relevant in the future. It was also impacted favorably by a 1.5 million share repurchase in the quarter executed in conjunction with our former private equity sponsors completing their exit from their ownership positions. Taking all of these factors into account, adjusted EPS was therefore up 10% for the year. 
On Slide 8, I will touch on our balance sheet and cash flow. The strong results that we have been discussing throughout this call facilitated meaningful balance sheet improvement. Our year-end liquidity remained strong and our cash and revolver availability was just over $765 million when we closed out the year. Free cash flow improved by $297 million year-over-year, partially due to improved working capital management, higher earnings and the lack of a 53rd week. This measurement includes an approximate $45 million voluntary contributions we made to fully fund our largest defined benefit pension obligations in Canada and the United Kingdom. 
Excess free cash flow was used to prepay almost $160 million in debt obligations and to repurchase the aforementioned 1.5 million shares. 
Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was reduced by approximately 25 basis points to 4.15x and net capital expenditures for the year were $505 million, in line with our prior guidance of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales. 
You should expect more of the same from us regarding capital allocation in 2016. We will continue to allocate the majority of our free cash flow to deleveraging as we continue to enhance our financial flexibility. I would expect total debt-to-EBITDA to end 2016 under 4x. 
Slide 9 details our current expectations for 2016. A few full year comments first. Adjusted EPS should be between $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Based on current exchange rates, which we have listed in the appendix for your benefit, we would have around $0.03 of currency headwind year-over-year, primarily in the first quarter, as we lap the mid-teens decline of the Canadian dollar and the euro that occurred since the first quarter of 2015. CapEx is expected to be consistent with the last few years within a range of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales, and free cash flow should increase with earnings and therefore should exceed $200 million for the year. 
I will spend more time on the 2016 specifics at the Investor Day in a few weeks. 
Regarding segment expectations in the first half of 2016. For the company as a whole, we expect higher year-over-year revenues and earnings. The major pieces within our segments are as follows:
in FSS North America, both revenues and earnings will be up versus the prior year, but not by as much as they will be in the second half. This is partially due to our first half investments, specifically in the Yosemite account, which does not substantially come online until the second half of the year. 
In FSS International, we expect some incremental pressure in revenues from the offshore North Sea business in the United Kingdom due to oil prices as well as from the aforementioned decision to wind down several small businesses that are not meeting our return expectations. 
Uniforms is adding a new laundry facility in the first half, and as a result, we'll have some duplicative costs as we start up the new location, but continue to operate at the current site. 
In summary, we expect to be up on prior year for the company on both revenue and earnings in both the first half and the second half. However, the stronger year-over-year performance will be in the second half due to timing of both comparables in energy and currency and our investment schedule. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Eric."

I would just add from a modeling standpoint, right, we will -- if you think about our experience in 2015, broadly, it should be comparable in '16 and would expect generally pricing initiatives will offset -- more than offset whatever inflationary pressures we have from all sources. We generally would expect modest commodity food-type of inflation given the macro environment, a little bit more wage inflation, but certainly something in the 2% or lower number from an aggregate perspective. And specifically on the minimum-wage, with everything that has been enacted thus far, the net impact to us in 2016 is a couple of million dollars that's reflected in our overall algorithm, so I would not expect with what is currently on the table today further to be a material impact from what we know about."

I think now that we've done that, we feel comfortable relative to how we begin to look at what I would call bolt-on M&A activities. So again, we'll be very thoughtful. We'll make sure we evaluate each of those opportunities in terms of strategic fit and the value that they offer. Obviously, as we look at opportunities to add scale or competencies or improve our ability to compete, we will do it. Specifically to the Avoca acquisition in Ireland, this is a leading brand in Ireland. It's a leading consumer retail brand, one of the most successful retailers in Ireland. And so as we look at this, we think it's a small tuck-in acquisition. They operate cafés and food halls and some destination stores and they have a very successful catering company as well. And so our ability to take a small tuck-in acquisition and enhance our industry-leading position in this country, we felt it was a good strategic fit. And we're also very happy that the Pratt family will remain involved in the company."

I think at the end of the day, what we feel great about right now, Denny, is we're coming off a year where we've had very strong results. We continue to execute well behind a clear and focused strategy where we're making good progress. You saw us this year and will continue to see us going forward on the productivity and margin march front be very focused on enhancing our margins, and in addition to all that, made meaningful improvements on the balance sheet. So I would say as we look to the future, we are very positive and again continue to see the same outsourcing potential that the sector has seen. The pipeline of new business is encouraging. We're very confident in our ability to go activate these productivity initiatives to capture margin. And so, I don't think there's anything as we look at 2016 that doesn't give us confidence that the guidance we've put out there is well within reach."

So I think if you look at the range that we've put out for 2016, that works pretty well associated with the -- with those set of numbers, especially once you make the adjustment for currency, which we've tried to highlight to folks. I think the one word of caution I would give, in general, is the exit rate for the fourth quarter, if you look at it in isolation, should not necessarily be construed to be the same as the entry rate for the first quarter next year, right? We had several one-off events in '14 above and beyond all of the noise we've talked about that helped our percentage improvements year-over-year in the fourth quarter, those will not replicate in the first quarter. And then as we had discussed before, we've got some investments on some pretty big accounts that we're going to be making in the front part of the year as we build up teams, et cetera, that won't have any corresponding revenue associated with them. So I certainly do expect the first half of the year, as we had tried to indicate before, to be better than prior year, but not as strong on a year-over-year basis as the second half will be and that's largely a function of what we need to do to get ourselves ready to onboard some accounts."

We've continued to emphasize that this can be a lumpy business because of the way new business is onboarded and the revenue tailwind that can create, and in some instances, the start-up costs that Steve referenced earlier. So I think our confidence level is this a 3% to 5% growth business, that's what's in the long-term algorithm. And if you look at 2016, I think the combination of our ability to grow our base business and bring on new business both equally weighted at about 50% of the contribution to the top line growth.

Starting up a model like a Chicago public school, it's very labor-intensive and some of that labor is transitioning is a very high degree of difficulty relative to start-up. A place like Yosemite where we will actually take 99% of the employees over is a much easier type of start-up. My only point is Yosemite, I hope, is not our only large start-up in 2016. So as we look at the pipeline, expect more start-up costs on clients that we have yet to win and therefore I think a good assumption is that you will see start-up costs that will be a result of some great new business wins, which we absolutely hope comes to fruition."

I would not characterize it as elevated from what we would have expected to be the case for 2016. I think it's consistent, certainly consistent with the experience from the last year or 2, and it's consistent with my expectation over the next couple of years. A large portion of what we're doing currently outside of investment required simply to support the onboarding of new client accounts, we're making significant investments in technology. Eric referenced that a couple of times. We'll give a deeper dive on that at the Investor Day discussion. But when we talk about activating productivity along the lines of improving outcomes in food, specifically on improving labor, a lot of that is technology either led or dependent. And so we have spent significant amounts of capital and time in the last couple of years both procuring and implementing technological system enhancements and we will expect to continue to do that into fiscal '16. And as we will talk about Investor Day, certainly for the next year or 2, as we continue to drive the margin march on the framework, I think it's realistic to expect the overall intensity of capital to be somewhat consistent with what we've had. The individual pieces, right, the types of things we investment will move  -- we invest in will move around a little bit as we complete investments in the labor space. We will move to things like investments in point-of-sale, but it still will be technology-driven investment."

Well, there are several questions in there, so let me try to approach it the way we think about food costs strategically, and I think within food costs, the way I at least kind of bucket our cost opportunities. One is in the area of strategic sourcing and I'll come back to that because that's where the core of your question is, but let me take you through the whole pipeline before I come back. The second is in the area of menu optimization and our ability to really simplify our menu, which simplifies SKUs, which simplifies the number of suppliers we have, which consolidates our purchasing strength, which adds to our scale and leverage. The third bucket is the whole food production process, kind of the manufacturing process. And then the fourth bucket is waste. We have opportunities across all of those. Most of our historical focus has been focused on waste bucket. And so when you talk about strategic sourcing, menu optimization or the food production process, we have opportunities across each and every one of those. On the strategic sourcing side, we do have a GPO in Canada. It is growing. It is something we're investing in. It is something that's a priority for us. But as you think about that margin march, I think you should think about it that we can certainly strengthen our position relative to the GPO. But understand, we have a lot of strength and leverage with suppliers today given our size and scale. So it's something we'll continue to look at. But at this moment in time, I think it's fair for you to walk away with our margin march rests largely on our ability to get at those 4 buckets of food plus what we need to do on the labor and SG&A to deliver against that margin."

I don't think we -- the nature of our business is not such where we have maybe the scale of opportunities as some companies with a different profile around intellectual property and transfer pricing and stuff moving across borders. We tend to be very local as a matter of course. But I think there is some opportunity there. It will take realistically a little bit of time for us. We will need to do some structural things in terms of how we finance ourselves internally and how ultimately we approach some aspects of the limited transfer pricing that we have. So in the medium term, there is some modest improvement potential there for us.

I think if you look at the performance of our uniform business, you should walk away with the following conclusions whether it's 2015 or whether it's the last several years. One is that the broad-based momentum continues in terms of our ability to grow the top line mid-single-digit, our ability to capture margin. I think the 50 basis points of margin expansion you saw in the year was built off a couple of years of 70 basis point margin improvement. So we feel very good about our continued ability to grow the top line as well as expand margins. What you did see and will continue to see as we invest in capacity is a shorter-term impact on that margin expansion. And so I just want to make sure that as you think about the performance of the business, it has been very good relative to the momentum it has and I think that will continue. But you do have this investment in capacity that we much need to do, particularly on the West Coast, for top line purposes."

We will incur some duplicative costs in the first half because we're essentially -- we're starting up something new, so we've got -- with a single stream of revenue. And so we've got to pay twofold to get the new one up before we can make changes to the old one. And so the lion's share of the improvement in the fiscal year will be in the second half just based on the nature of that investment. And I think if you went back and looked at the cadence of our uniform business over the last 5 or 10 years, you would see something actually quite similar. As we make money available from an investment standpoint, we tend to tread water for a period or 2 to get that bedded down. But it's that incremental capacity that then facilitates our ability to drive the incremental growth. And to Eric's point, we have great investment opportunities in uniforms business that generates very good returns. Obviously, as you can see for us and as -- it's a good problem for us to have for sure in terms of where our capacity currently is and we'll make sure we're doing the right thing for them to drive the financial returns that we know they're capable of."

So I would tell you we probably incurred about $40 million of negative revenue headwinds over the course of the year, almost all in Canada in the remote oil or tar sands, oil sands business and revenue -- or EBIT was probably high single digits, close to $10 million of year-over-year reduction. We really did not see a lot of direct oil and gas headwind outside of Canada in fiscal '15 and part of the reason we're trying to set expectations for the first half of this year. I do think the headwinds that we currently see are growing specifically in Europe, specifically in the North Sea offshore platform business. It seems to be lagging in terms of the reactivity relative to what North America did. So I think we will probably have 1 more quarter based on the cadence. If energy stays where it is, we probably have 1 more quarter of down in North America as we cycle through where things seem to have landed and I do think we have some incremental -- modest incremental headwind in the U.K., which is what's partially driving our expectations for their revenue performance in the first half of the year. As it relates to uniform specifically, yes, we clearly benefited somewhat from diesel as a general rule. Now we do tend to hedge our prospective diesel and fuel requirements out over a longer period of time in the next year, so we kind of layer in. So there was some modest improvement in general. And then I guess, the last thing, back to Europe real quickly, I would point out that our offshore business in general, oil and gas, I think we said is about 3% of the total company. So the European portion of that is obviously that much smaller, so I don't believe it's material. But it will be under a little bit of pressure."

I think I'd actually go back to a comment that Eric made around our total cost of investment that we anticipate over the course of the year whether it's start-up-related or whether it's technology-related. To some extent, we do not know yet the specifics of some of the start-ups associated costs because of some of those accounts. So we're certainly making some assumptions that our overall experience around the intensity required for both start-ups as well as the cadence of technology will be comparable proportionally to what we experienced in '15. And so to the extent it's better than that, obviously we'll benefit but it's a little too early in the year for us to make an assumption different than it should be comparable on a year-over-year basis."

Here with me today are Eric Foss, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Bramlage, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I would like to remind you of our notice regarding forward-looking statements, which is included in our press release, can be found on our website and is detailed on Page 2 of the earnings slide deck.  During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our SEC filings. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in this morning's press release and on our website as well. 
Before I turn the call over to Eric, I did want to provide a brief and thankfully final reminder regarding the 53rd-week calendar shift. Recall that this calendar shift has only a small negative impact for full year fiscal '15, but it has had a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015 quarterly results. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to have increased sales via approximately 2%, adjusted operating income by approximately 3% and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.02. As we look to our 2016 disclosures, we will have fully lapped the 53rd-week calendar shift impact and 2016's quarters will be comparable to 2015's without these calendar adjustments. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric."
1004106,316157718,905951,"Aramark, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Ian, and good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us.

As you saw in this morning's release, we reported a strong quarter and a record-setting year with record-setting revenue and the highest adjusted operating income and margins in the company's history. It's gratifying to see the crisp execution of our clear and focused strategy translate into double-digit comparable adjusted EPS growth while also driving significant improvement in cash flow and meaningful strengthening of the balance sheet. I'm very proud of what the company and our 270,000 team members accomplished this year and feel that the board's recent decision to increase our quarterly common dividend by 10% validates both our progress as well as the confidence and the opportunity that lies before us. 
Turning to the numbers. I'm going to review our full year results. Steve will then go deeper into a detailed reconciliation for last year's 53rd week in the calendar shift. But to keep it simple, my comments are based on our estimate of the comparable 52-week periods. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $1.57, a 10% increase from last year on a comparable basis. Total company organic sales were up 2%, which meant our underlying sales growth remained consistent with our multiyear framework. Meaningful food, labor and SG&A productivity gains were achieved during the year, which supported those reinvestments and concurrent expansion in total company AOI margins to 6.2%, which was a 30 basis point improvement. It also drove an increase in adjusted operating income to $881 million. Solid balance sheet improvement was seen through an almost $300 million improvement in year-over-year cash flow, which facilitated approximately $150 million in net debt repayments and approximately a 25 basis point reduction in our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 4.2x. 
Broadly speaking, our performance for the year was strong any way you slice it. Looking at the year versus our strategic priorities, which were accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent, we demonstrated progress across every category. You can see on Slide 4 our progress was broad-based and consistent across our businesses. Our ability to accelerate growth was driven by strong retention rates at 94% for the year. Our principle to ensure we cover inflationary increases through pricing was effective. In our base business, we not only captured price, but also saw a slight volume improvement. We also achieved new business sales of $1.2 billion in the year, a level consistent with our multiyear framework. 2015 also saw us win our largest client ever in the company's history, Yosemite National Park, which will come online in March of 2016. 
North America organic sales were flattish for the year. Recall that our biggest impact was from the nonrecurring events in the Canadian remote services that occurred in this segment. We did see strong growth performance in our Education, Healthcare and parks and destinations business. And our international businesses saw organic sales growth of 5%, driven by continued expansion in Europe, up 2%; mid-single-digit growth in South America; and strong double-digit growth of 18% in China. Uniforms continued to benefit from our investments in capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth of 5% in the fourth quarter and 4% on a full year basis. 
Our selling efforts continued to yield results where we signed a number of new accounts including the University of Akron, a self-op higher ed conversion, several new business and industry clients and a number of new health care clients including Kennedy Health systems. As we look forward, the pipeline of new business remains healthy, which bodes well for continued execution along our framework. 
As I mentioned earlier, innovation is a critical component of Aramark's right to win new clients and our ability to maintain healthy retention rates. Recent successes on the innovation front include the area of mobile technology, which is really fundamental to our growth, which builds consumer engagement and streamlines our operations and we're currently testing a first-in-class tool at stadiums that allow fans to place and pay for their orders using an iPad at the concession stand. They receive a text as soon as their order is ready and are back in their seats without missing any game time. In higher ed, we've partnered with the app, Tap & Go, to offer students mobile food ordering and have plans to roll that out at more universities in the coming months. 
In the area of product innovation, we've launched a micromarket concept called vibe that brings fresh, health-and-go foods to businesses, hospitals and schools that don't have cafeterias or have variable hours outside the normal operations. And we're also piloting a pop-up kitchen in Sports & Entertainment, which will feature rotating menus centered on the latest food trends and the hottest chefs. The kitchen is outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment, which enables us to rotate the food and beverage concept throughout the season at the flip of a switch. 
Progress is also being made on our health and wellness initiative, which we announced with the American Heart Association. Our culinary teams are taking a 3-pronged approach to impact the 2 billion meals that we serve annually by changing our menus towards healthier offerings, reengineering recipes to reduce calories, fat and sodium and working with suppliers to source healthier ingredients. And starting next year, you're going to see these improvements along with our health education programs that we're launching with American Heart Association in underserved communities and we look forward to keeping you posted on this important initiative. 
Another area of substantial progress for the company is our second strategic initiative, activating productivity. We saw increased productivity in savings across food, labor and SG&A, which facilitated a 30 basis point margin expansion. Our base productivity was very strong, which allowed us to reinvest into growth and capability. Importantly, these margin gains were broad based across our segments with margins improving 50 basis points in uniforms, 40 basis points in our international food and facilities business and a 20 basis point improvement in North America. I would point out that North America's strong performance in the fourth quarter as we saw the timing of our reinvestments and the lapping of start-ups came in exactly as we expected and had communicated earlier. 
Our focus on driving a cultural mindset around efficiency and cost improvement remains vigilant. In the area of food, we're driving meaningful reductions through our waste initiatives and continue to see good future opportunities in reducing menu complexity and leveraging our scale across the supply chain. Labor costs are being lowered through active management of overtime and agency labor, and our continued rollout of our standard in-unit labor model, which provides a lot of runway for further efficiency capture. And we're also driving further reductions in SG&A by ensuring we simplify and streamline our above-unit structure to ensure we have clear roles and accountabilities. And we'll use our Investor Day on December 1 for a deeper dive on this productivity pillar. 
Now I'd like to move to the third pillar of our focused strategy, attracting the best talent, where we're continuing to invest in the capability of our people because to us an engaged workforce helps us reduce turnover, increase productivity and improve service levels that we provide to our clients, all of which is accretive to shareholder value. Q4 saw a continued action on our part to engage and reward our employees, and we continue to garner external recognition for these efforts. 
Last month, to honor those who deliver outstanding service to our customers, the company recognized 200 front-line employees as part of our inaugural Ring of Stars program. Winners were nominated by coworkers, managers and business leaders and were selected for demonstrating excellence in living Aramark's core values, delivering greatness at the moment of truth and innovating the everyday while demonstrating a high degree of involvement in the communities that we serve.  As I just mentioned, our engagement efforts are not going unnoticed. Over the past 2 weeks, we remained a top 40 company for diversity by Black Enterprise, and we received a perfect score on the 2016 Corporate Equality Index, a national benchmarking study and report on corporate policies administered by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. 
So overall, we're extremely encouraged with the progress we made in 2015 along our transformation journey. We posted strong, broad-based financial results while balancing the need to reinvest in the business and also expand margins. And with that said, we also see a lot of runway to look forward to. This feels like a good setup for 2016 and our productivity and momentum should allow us to be on our multiyear framework for the year. I look forward to digging deeper into our future prospects on our December 1 I Day webcast. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve."
1004106,316157718,905951,"Aramark, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Now that we're able to discuss full year results, much of the noise associated with our quarterly numbers from the calendar shift and the extra week dissipates. I would point out that in the appendix to the slides",1318,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Now that we're able to discuss full year results, much of the noise associated with our quarterly numbers from the calendar shift and the extra week dissipates. I would point out that in the appendix to the slides, you will find sales and adjusted operating income reconciliations for the fourth quarter and my commentary on the mechanics of the annual roll-forwards applies equally to the fourth quarter as well. 
Quickly commenting on the fourth quarter. Our results were completely consistent with our prior expectations, a somewhat noisy top line due to comparables and a very strong bottom line improvement, driven by productivity gains in our North America FSS segment. We did book approximately $44 million of transformation and restructuring charges in the quarter, a portion of which relates to severance as we continue to look for ways to become more efficient with overhead spending. This number also includes a charge of $6 million for oil and gas asset impairment in Canada related to the macros in the energy sector and $14 million for exiting certain emerging market operations that were not meeting and are not likely to meet our return expectations. 
In the interest of time, the remainder of my comments will focus on full year fiscal 2015, and I will start on Slide 5 with a year-over-year sales reconciliation. We achieved $14.3 billion in sales on a GAAP basis during 2015 compared to $14.8 billion last year. This is a decline of 3%. As you can see from the slide, adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar provided the largest single reconciling item compared to the prior year. We were most impacted by the Canadian dollar and the euro, which weakened by 12% and 15%, respectively, on average over our fiscal year. The impact of M&A on a year-over-year basis was not material. 
Recall that we reported a 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2014, which accounts for about $260 million of the year-over-year change. While the calendar shift in 2015 related to the extra week was meaningful on a quarterly basis, it is fairly negligible for the year, only about $31 million. The previously disclosed nonrecurring revenue from prior periods, which is the combination of a large account nonrenewal and a nonrecurring facilities work in the fourth quarter of last year, totaled about $200 million or roughly 1% of the change. Adjusting for these items, organic sales growth for the company was a positive 2%. Absent the previously disclosed revenue items, the remainder of our business grew at over 3% or more than $450 million versus the prior year. I think I can speak for all of us that we look forward to a simpler roll-forward in 2016. 
Let's now move to Slide 6 for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. Please note that we currently adjust our prior year adjusted operating income figure for currency changes. Therefore, the 2014 adjusted operating income figure of $852 million has already been reduced by approximately $28 million versus the $878 million that we reported a year ago for the impact of currency translation or approximately 3%. Unlike the organic sales calculation, which adjusted the 53rd week out, the $852 million in AOI that we generated in 2014 contained a $14 million estimated benefit from the 53rd week. We did not break this number out separately in the prior year, hence, we're trying to be clear regarding its magnitude in our annual figures.  As with sales, the calendar shift is not significant on a full year basis and represented only about a $7 million headwind.  Taking all of these factors into account, we generated about $50 million or a 5% improvement in AOI year-over-year on a comparable apples-to-apples basis. Margins improved 30 basis points. 
Slide 7 provides the roll-forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year. As with AOI, the 53rd week was included in the $1.51 per share we reported last year. As indicated, the extra week impact was approximately $0.02 per share and currency was an approximately $0.06 a share headwind. Share dilution is a notable factor in the bridge, but this relates primarily to legacy pre-IPO grants, which will not be as relevant in the future. It was also impacted favorably by a 1.5 million share repurchase in the quarter executed in conjunction with our former private equity sponsors completing their exit from their ownership positions. Taking all of these factors into account, adjusted EPS was therefore up 10% for the year. 
On Slide 8, I will touch on our balance sheet and cash flow. The strong results that we have been discussing throughout this call facilitated meaningful balance sheet improvement. Our year-end liquidity remained strong and our cash and revolver availability was just over $765 million when we closed out the year. Free cash flow improved by $297 million year-over-year, partially due to improved working capital management, higher earnings and the lack of a 53rd week. This measurement includes an approximate $45 million voluntary contributions we made to fully fund our largest defined benefit pension obligations in Canada and the United Kingdom.  
Excess free cash flow was used to prepay almost $160 million in debt obligations and to repurchase the aforementioned 1.5 million shares.  Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was reduced by approximately 25 basis points to 4.15x and net capital expenditures for the year were $505 million, in line with our prior guidance of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales.  You should expect more of the same from us regarding capital allocation in 2016. We will continue to allocate the majority of our free cash flow to deleveraging as we continue to enhance our financial flexibility. I would expect total debt-to-EBITDA to end 2016 under 4x. 
Slide 9 details our current expectations for 2016. A few full year comments first. Adjusted EPS should be between $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Based on current exchange rates, which we have listed in the appendix for your benefit, we would have around $0.03 of currency headwind year-over-year, primarily in the first quarter, as we lap the mid-teens decline of the Canadian dollar and the euro that occurred since the first quarter of 2015. CapEx is expected to be consistent with the last few years within a range of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales, and free cash flow should increase with earnings and therefore should exceed $200 million for the year. I will spend more time on the 2016 specifics at the Investor Day in a few weeks. 
Regarding segment expectations in the first half of 2016. For the company as a whole, we expect higher year-over-year revenues and earnings. The major pieces within our segments are as follows: In FSS North America, both revenues and earnings will be up versus the prior year, but not by as much as they will be in the second half. This is partially due to our first half investments, specifically in the Yosemite account, which does not substantially come online until the second half of the year.  In FSS International, we expect some incremental pressure in revenues from the offshore North Sea business in the United Kingdom due to oil prices as well as from the aforementioned decision to wind down several small businesses that are not meeting our return expectations. Uniforms is adding a new laundry facility in the first half, and as a result, we'll have some duplicative costs as we start up the new location, but continue to operate at the current site. 
In summary, we expect to be up on prior year for the company on both revenue and earnings in both the first half and the second half. However, the stronger year-over-year performance will be in the second half due to timing of both comparables in energy and currency and our investment schedule. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Eric."

And specifically on the minimum-wage, with everything that has been enacted thus far, the net impact to us in 2016 is a couple million dollars. That's reflected in our overall algorithm, so I would not expect with what is currently on the table today further to be a material impact from what we know about."

We'll make sure we evaluate each of those opportunities in terms of strategic fit and the value that they offer. Obviously, as we look at opportunities to add scale or competencies or improve our ability to compete, we will do it. Specifically to the Avoca acquisition in Ireland, this is a leading brand in Ireland. It's a leading consumer retail brand, one of the most successful retailers in Ireland. And so as we look at this, we think it's a small tuck-in acquisition. They operate cafés and food halls and some destination stores and they have a very successful catering company as well.

So I know that some of this is because you like to be conservative and that's definitely nice. And it sounds like you expect the back half to be a little bit better than the first half. But maybe you could delve into a little bit where you see some of the costs that are making you a little bit more conservative there given the strong Q4 performance and even a strong 2015 performance. Is it start-up cost? Is it maybe more spending on innovation? Have you maybe used up a little bit of the low-hanging fruit on margin expansion? Maybe you could elaborate there."

I think at the end of the day, what we feel great about right now, Denny, is we're coming off a year where we've had very strong results. We continue to execute well behind a clear and focused strategy where we're making good progress. You saw us this year and will continue to see us going forward on the productivity and margin march front be very focused on enhancing our margins, and in addition to all that, made meaningful improvements on the balance sheet. So I would say as we look to the future, we are very positive and again continue to see the same outsourcing potential that the sector has seen. The pipeline of new business is encouraging. We're very confident in our ability to go activate these productivity initiatives to capture margin. And so, I don't think there's anything as we look at 2016 that doesn't give us confidence that the guidance we've put out there is well within reach."

So I think if you look at the range that we've put out for 2016, that works pretty well associated with the -- with those set of numbers, especially once you make the adjustment for currency, which we've tried to highlight to folks. I think the one word of caution I would give, in general, is the exit rate for the fourth quarter, if you look at it in isolation, should not necessarily be construed to be the same as the entry rate for the first quarter next year, right? We had several one-off events in '14 above and beyond all of the noise we've talked about that helped our percentage improvements year-over-year in the fourth quarter, those will not replicate in the first quarter. And then as we had discussed before, we've got some investments on some pretty big accounts that we're going to be making in the front part of the year as we build up teams, et cetera, that won't have any corresponding revenue associated with them. So I certainly do expect the first half of the year, as we had tried to indicate before, to be better than prior year, but not as strong on a year-over-year basis as the second half will be and that's largely a function of what we need to do to get ourselves ready to onboard some accounts."

So I think our confidence level is this a 3% to 5% growth business, that's what's in the long-term algorithm. And if you look at 2016, I think the combination of our ability to grow our base business and bring on new business both equally weighted at about 50% of the contribution to the top line growth.

A place like Yosemite where we will actually take 99% of the employees over is a much easier type of start-up. My only point is Yosemite, I hope, is not our only large start-up in 2016.

I think it's consistent, certainly consistent with the experience from the last year or 2, and it's consistent with my expectation over the next couple of years. A large portion of what we're doing currently outside of investment required simply to support the onboarding of new client accounts, we're making significant investments in technology. Eric referenced that a couple times. We'll give a deeper dive on that at the Investor Day discussion. But when we talk about activating productivity along the lines of improving outcomes in food, specifically on improving labor, a lot of that is technology either led or dependent. And so we have spent significant amounts of capital and time in the last couple of years both procuring and implementing technological system enhancements and we will expect to continue to do that into fiscal '16. And as we will talk about Investor Day, certainly for the next year or 2, as we continue to drive the margin march on the framework, I think it's realistic to expect the overall intensity of capital to be somewhat consistent with what we've had. The individual pieces, right, the types of things we investment will move -- we invest in will move around a little bit as we complete investments in the labor space. We will move to things like investments in point-of-sale, but it still will be technology-driven investment."

Well, there are several questions in there, so let me try to approach it the way we think about food costs strategically. And I think within food costs, the way I at least kind of bucket our cost opportunities, one is in the area of strategic sourcing and I'll come back to that because that's where the core of your question is, but let me take you through the whole pipeline before I come back. The second is in the area of menu optimization and our ability to really simplify our menu, which simplifies SKUs, which simplifies the number of suppliers we have, which consolidates our purchasing strength, which adds to our scale and leverage. The third bucket is the whole food production process, kind of the manufacturing process. And then the fourth bucket is waste. We have opportunities across all of those. Most of our historical focus has been focused on waste bucket. And so when you talk about strategic sourcing, menu optimization or the food production process, we have opportunities across each and every one of those. On the strategic sourcing side, we do have a GPO in Canada. It is growing. It is something we're investing in. It is something that's a priority for us. But as you think about that margin march, I think you should think about it that we can certainly strengthen our position relative to the GPO. But understand, we have a lot of strength and leverage with suppliers today given our size and scale. So it's something we'll continue to look at. But at this moment in time, I think it's fair for you to walk away with our margin march rests largely on our ability to get at those 4 buckets of food plus what we need to do on the labor and SG&A to deliver against that margin."

But on the labor side, we've invested in Kronos, that's broadly been deployed. On the selling side, we've deployed Salesforce.com. We've worked on our global field financials. So I think it's probably not a fair takeaway to conclude that we don't have information to manage the business or the communication to understand what's happening in the businesses. Where we're earlier in the deployment would be things like procure-to-pay, PRIMA Web, Ariba, particularly those technology investments on the food side. So again, we are beginning to put some of those into pilot and would expect to see some level of rollout as we come out of pilot."

I think in the medium term, we have modest opportunity to improve the tax rate as it relates to both cash taxes and book taxes. I don't think we -- the nature of our business is not such where we have maybe the scale of opportunities as some companies with a different profile around intellectual property and transfer pricing and stuff moving across borders. We tend to be very local as a matter of course. But I think there is some opportunity there. It will take realistically a little bit of time for us. We will need to do some structural things in terms of how we finance ourselves internally and how ultimately we approach some aspects of the limited transfer pricing that we have. So in the medium term, there is some modest improvement potential there for us. I do not believe, again based on the fact of us being U.S.-domiciled and the nature of our business, there's probably not something that will significantly change that number in the next couple of years, at least under the current legislative environment we have around taxes."

I think if you look at the performance of our uniform business, you should walk away with the following conclusions, whether it's 2015 or whether it's the last several years. One is that the broad-based momentum continues in terms of our ability to grow the top line mid-single-digit, our ability to capture margin. I think the 50 basis points of margin expansion you saw in the year was built off a couple of years of 70 basis point margin improvement. So we feel very good about our continued ability to grow the top line as well as expand margins. What you did see and will continue to see as we invest in capacity is a shorter-term impact on that margin expansion. And so I just want to make sure that as you think about the performance of the business, it has been very good relative to the momentum it has and I think that will continue. But you do have this investment in capacity that we much need to do, particularly on the West Coast, for top line purposes."

We will incur some duplicative costs in the first half because we're essentially -- we're starting up something new, so we've got -- with a single stream of revenue. And so we've got to pay twofold to get the new one up before we can make changes to the old one. And so the lion's share of the improvement in the fiscal year will be in the second half just based on the nature of that investment. And I think if you went back and looked at the cadence of our uniform business over the last 5 or 10 years, you would see something actually quite similar. As we make money available from an investment standpoint, we tend to tread water for a period or 2 to get that bedded down. But it's that incremental capacity that then facilitates our ability to drive the incremental growth. And to Eric's point, we have great investment opportunities in uniforms business that generates very good returns. Obviously, as you can see for us and as -- it's a good problem for us to have for sure in terms of where our capacity currently is and we'll make sure we're doing the right thing for them to drive the financial returns that we know they're capable of."

So I would tell you we probably incurred about $40 million of negative revenue headwinds over the course of the year, almost all in Canada in the remote oil or tar sands, oil sands business and revenue -- or EBIT was probably high single digits, close to $10 million of year-over-year reduction. We really did not see a lot of direct oil and gas headwind outside of Canada in fiscal '15 and part of the reason we're trying to set expectations for the first half of this year. I do think the headwinds that we currently see are growing specifically in Europe, specifically in the North Sea offshore platform business. It seems to be lagging in terms of the reactivity relative to what North America did. So I think we will probably have 1 more quarter based on the cadence. If energy stays where it is, we probably have 1 more quarter of down in North America as we cycle through where things seem to have landed and I do think we have some incremental -- modest incremental headwind in the U.K., which is what's partially driving our expectations for their revenue performance in the first half of the year. As it relates to uniform specifically, yes, we clearly benefited somewhat from diesel as a general rule. Now we do tend to hedge our prospective diesel and fuel requirements out over a longer period of time in the next year, so we kind of layer in. So there was some modest improvement in general. And then I guess, the last thing, back to Europe real quickly, I would point out that our offshore business in general, oil and gas, I think we said is about 3% of the total company. So the European portion of that is obviously that much smaller, so I don't believe it's material. But it will be under a little bit of pressure."

So we're certainly making some assumptions that our overall experience around the intensity required for both start-ups as well as the cadence of technology will be comparable proportionally to what we experienced in '15.

Here with me today are Eric Foss, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Bramlage, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I would like to remind you of our notice regarding forward-looking statements, which is included in our press release, can be found on our website and is detailed on Page 2 of the earnings slide deck. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our SEC filings. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in this morning's press release and on our website as well. 
Before I turn the call over to Eric, I did want to provide a brief and thankfully final reminder regarding the 53rd-week calendar shift. Recall that this calendar shift has only a small negative impact for full year fiscal '15, but it has had a fairly significant impact on the cadence of 2015 quarterly results. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the calendar shift is estimated to have increased sales via approximately 2%, adjusted operating income by approximately 3% and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.02. As we look to our 2016 disclosures, we will have fully lapped the 53rd-week calendar shift impact and 2016's quarters will be comparable to 2015's without these calendar adjustments. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric."
1004106,316157718,906125,"Aramark, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Aramark","Executives","Thanks, Ian, and good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us. As you saw in this morning's release, we reported a strong quarter and a record-setting year with record-setting revenue and the highest adjusted operating income and margins in the comp",1470,"Thanks, Ian, and good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us. As you saw in this morning's release, we reported a strong quarter and a record-setting year with record-setting revenue and the highest adjusted operating income and margins in the company's history. It's gratifying to see the crisp execution of our clear and focused strategy translate into double-digit comparable adjusted EPS growth while also driving significant improvement in cash flow and meaningful strengthening of the balance sheet. I'm very proud of what the company and our 270,000 team members accomplished this year and feel that the board's recent decision to increase our quarterly common dividend by 10% validates both our progress as well as the confidence and the opportunity that lies before us. 
Turning to the numbers. I'm going to review our full year results. Steve will then go deeper into a detailed reconciliation for last year's 53rd week in the calendar shift. But to keep it simple, my comments are based on our estimate of the comparable 52-week periods. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $1.57, a 10% increase from last year on a comparable basis. Total company organic sales were up 2%, which meant our underlying sales growth remained consistent with our multiyear framework. Meaningful food, labor and SG&A productivity gains were achieved during the year, which supported those reinvestments and concurrent expansion in total company AOI margins to 6.2%, which was a 30 basis point improvement. It also drove an increase in adjusted operating income to $881 million. Solid balance sheet improvement was seen through an almost $300 million improvement in year-over-year cash flow, which facilitated approximately $150 million in net debt repayments and approximately a 25 basis point reduction in our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 4.2x. 
Broadly speaking, our performance for the year was strong any way you slice it. Looking at the year versus our strategic priorities, which were accelerating growth, activating productivity and attracting the best talent, we demonstrated progress across every category. You can see on Slide 4 our progress was broad-based and consistent across our businesses. Our ability to accelerate growth was driven by strong retention rates at 94% for the year. Our principle to ensure we cover inflationary increases through pricing was effective. In our base business, we not only captured price, but also saw a slight volume improvement. We also achieved new business sales of $1.2 billion in the year, a level consistent with our multiyear framework. 2015 also saw us win our largest client ever in the company's history, Yosemite National Park, which will come online in March of 2016. 
North America organic sales were flattish for the year. Recall that our biggest impact was from the nonrecurring events in the Canadian remote services that occurred in this segment. We did see strong growth performance in our Education, Healthcare and parks and destinations business. And our international businesses saw organic sales growth of 5%, driven by continued expansion in Europe, up 2%; mid-single-digit growth in South America; and strong double-digit growth of 18% in China. Uniforms continued to benefit from our investments in capacity expansion, which resulted in organic sales growth of 5% in the fourth quarter and 4% on a full year basis. 
Our selling efforts continued to yield results where we signed a number of new accounts including the University of Akron, a self-op higher ed conversion, several new business and industry clients and a number of new health care clients including Kennedy Health systems. As we look forward, the pipeline of new business remains healthy, which bodes well for continued execution along our framework. 
As I mentioned earlier, innovation is a critical component of Aramark's right to win new clients and our ability to maintain healthy retention rates. Recent successes on the innovation front include the area of mobile technology, which is really fundamental to our growth, which builds consumer engagement and streamlines our operations and we're currently testing a first-in-class tool at stadiums that allow fans to place and pay for their orders using an iPad at the concession stand. They receive a text as soon as their order is ready and are back in their seats without missing any game time. In higher ed, we've partnered with the app, Tap & Go, to offer students mobile food ordering and have plans to roll that out at more universities in the coming months. 
In the area of product innovation, we've launched a micromarket concept called vibe that brings fresh, health-and-go foods to businesses, hospitals and schools that don't have cafeterias or have variable hours outside the normal operations. And we're also piloting a pop-up kitchen in Sports & Entertainment, which will feature rotating menus centered on the latest food trends and the hottest chefs. The kitchen is outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment, which enables us to rotate the food and beverage concept throughout the season at the flip of a switch. 
Progress is also being made on our health and wellness initiative, which we announced with the American Heart Association. Our culinary teams are taking a 3-pronged approach to impact the 2 billion meals that we serve annually by changing our menus towards healthier offerings, reengineering recipes to reduce calories, fat and sodium and working with suppliers to source healthier ingredients. And starting next year, you're going to see these improvements along with our health education programs that we're launching with American Heart Association in underserved communities and we look forward to keeping you posted on this important initiative. 
Another area of substantial progress for the company is our second strategic initiative, activating productivity. We saw increased productivity in savings across food, labor and SG&A, which facilitated a 30 basis point margin expansion. Our base productivity was very strong, which allowed us to reinvest into growth and capability. Importantly, these margin gains were broad based across our segments with margins improving 50 basis points in uniforms, 40 basis points in our international food and facilities business and a 20 basis point improvement in North America. I would point out that North America's strong performance in the fourth quarter as we saw the timing of our reinvestments and the lapping of start-ups came in exactly as we expected and had communicated earlier. 
Our focus on driving a cultural mindset around efficiency and cost improvement remains vigilant. In the area of food, we're driving meaningful reductions through our waste initiatives and continue to see good future opportunities in reducing menu complexity and leveraging our scale across the supply chain. Labor costs are being lowered through active management of overtime and agency labor, and our continued rollout of our standard in-unit labor model, which provides a lot of runway for further efficiency capture. And we're also driving further reductions in SG&A by ensuring we simplify and streamline our above-unit structure to ensure we have clear roles and accountabilities. And we'll use our Investor Day on December 1 for a deeper dive on this productivity pillar. 
Now I'd like to move to the third pillar of our focused strategy, attracting the best talent, where we're continuing to invest in the capability of our people because to us an engaged workforce helps us reduce turnover, increase productivity and improve service levels that we provide to our clients, all of which is accretive to shareholder value. Q4 saw a continued action on our part to engage and reward our employees, and we continue to garner external recognition for these efforts. 
Last month, to honor those who deliver outstanding service to our customers, the company recognized 200 front-line employees as part of our inaugural Ring of Stars program. Winners were nominated by coworkers, managers and business leaders and were selected for demonstrating excellence in living Aramark's core values, delivering greatness at the moment of truth and innovating the everyday while demonstrating a high degree of involvement in the communities that we serve. As I just mentioned, our engagement efforts are not going unnoticed. Over the past 2 weeks, we remained a top 40 company for diversity by Black Enterprise, and we received a perfect score on the 2016 Corporate Equality Index, a national benchmarking study and report on corporate policies administered by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. 
So overall, we're extremely encouraged with the progress we made in 2015 along our transformation journey. We posted strong, broad-based financial results while balancing the need to reinvest in the business and also expand margins. And with that said, we also see a lot of runway to look forward to. This feels like a good setup for 2016 and our productivity and momentum should allow us to be on our multiyear framework for the year. I look forward to digging deeper into our future prospects on our December 1 I Day webcast. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve."

Quickly commenting on the fourth quarter. Our results were completely consistent with our prior expectations, a somewhat noisy top line due to comparables and a very strong bottom line improvement, driven by productivity gains in our North America FSS segment. We did book approximately $44 million of transformation and restructuring charges in the quarter, a portion of which relates to severance as we continue to look for ways to become more efficient with overhead spending. This number also includes a charge of $6 million for oil and gas asset impairment in Canada related to the macros in the energy sector and $14 million for exiting certain emerging market operations that were not meeting and are not likely to meet our return expectations. 
In the interest of time, the remainder of my comments will focus on full year fiscal 2015, and I will start on Slide 5 with a year-over-year sales reconciliation. We achieved $14.3 billion in sales on a GAAP basis during 2015 compared to $14.8 billion last year. This is a decline of 3%. As you can see from the slide, adverse currency trends in the form of a stronger U.S. dollar provided the largest single reconciling item compared to the prior year. We were most impacted by the Canadian dollar and the euro, which weakened by 12% and 15%, respectively, on average over our fiscal year. The impact of M&A on a year-over-year basis was not material. 
Recall that we reported a 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2014, which accounts for about $260 million of the year-over-year change. While the calendar shift in 2015 related to the extra week was meaningful on a quarterly basis, it is fairly negligible for the year, only about $31 million. The previously disclosed nonrecurring revenue from prior periods, which is the combination of a large account nonrenewal and a nonrecurring facilities work in the fourth quarter of last year, totaled about $200 million or roughly 1% of the change. Adjusting for these items, organic sales growth for the company was a positive 2%. Absent the previously disclosed revenue items, the remainder of our business grew at over 3% or more than $450 million versus the prior year. I think I can speak for all of us that we look forward to a simpler roll-forward in 2016. 
Let's now move to Slide 6 for a discussion of our adjusted operating income year-over-year performance. Please note that we currently adjust our prior year adjusted operating income figure for currency changes. Therefore, the 2014 adjusted operating income figure of $852 million has already been reduced by approximately $28 million versus the $878 million that we reported a year ago for the impact of currency translation or approximately 3%. Unlike the organic sales calculation, which adjusted the 53rd week out, the $852 million in AOI that we generated in 2014 contained a $14 million estimated benefit from the 53rd week. We did not break this number out separately in the prior year, hence, we're trying to be clear regarding its magnitude in our annual figures. As with sales, the calendar shift is not significant on a full year basis and represented only about a $7 million headwind. Taking all of these factors into account, we generated about $50 million or a 5% improvement in AOI year-over-year on a comparable apples-to-apples basis. Margins improved 30 basis points. 
Slide 7 provides the roll-forward to help bridge our adjusted EPS year-over-year. As with AOI, the 53rd week was included in the $1.51 per share we reported last year. As indicated, the extra week impact was approximately $0.02 per share and currency was an approximately $0.06 a share headwind. Share dilution is a notable factor in the bridge, but this relates primarily to legacy pre-IPO grants, which will not be as relevant in the future. It was also impacted favorably by a 1.5 million share repurchase in the quarter executed in conjunction with our former private equity sponsors completing their exit from their ownership positions. Taking all of these factors into account, adjusted EPS was therefore up 10% for the year. 
On Slide 8, I will touch on our balance sheet and cash flow. The strong results that we have been discussing throughout this call facilitated meaningful balance sheet improvement. Our year-end liquidity remained strong and our cash and revolver availability was just over $765 million when we closed out the year. Free cash flow improved by $297 million year-over-year, partially due to improved working capital management, higher earnings and the lack of a 53rd week. This measurement includes an approximate $45 million voluntary contributions we made to fully fund our largest defined benefit pension obligations in Canada and the United Kingdom. 
Excess free cash flow was used to prepay almost $160 million in debt obligations and to repurchase the aforementioned 1.5 million shares. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was reduced by approximately 25 basis points to 4.15x and net capital expenditures for the year were $505 million, in line with our prior guidance of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales. You should expect more of the same from us regarding capital allocation in 2016. We will continue to allocate the majority of our free cash flow to deleveraging as we continue to enhance our financial flexibility. I would expect total debt-to-EBITDA to end 2016 under 4x. 
Slide 9 details our current expectations for 2016. A few full year comments first. Adjusted EPS should be between $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Based on current exchange rates, which we have listed in the appendix for your benefit, we would have around $0.03 of currency headwind year-over-year, primarily in the first quarter, as we lap the mid-teens decline of the Canadian dollar and the euro that occurred since the first quarter of 2015. CapEx is expected to be consistent with the last few years within a range of 3.25% to 3.5% of sales, and free cash flow should increase with earnings and therefore should exceed $200 million for the year. I will spend more time on the 2016 specifics at the Investor Day in a few weeks. 
Regarding segment expectations in the first half of 2016. For the company as a whole, we expect higher year-over-year revenues and earnings. The major pieces within our segments are as follows: In FSS North America, both revenues and earnings will be up versus the prior year, but not by as much as they will be in the second half. This is partially due to our first half investments, specifically in the Yosemite account, which does not substantially come online until the second half of the year. In FSS International, we expect some incremental pressure in revenues from the offshore North Sea business in the United Kingdom due to oil prices as well as from the aforementioned decision to wind down several small businesses that are not meeting our return expectations. Uniforms is adding a new laundry facility in the first half, and as a result, we'll have some duplicative costs as we start up the new location, but continue to operate at the current site. 
In summary, we expect to be up on prior year for the company on both revenue and earnings in both the first half and the second half. However, the stronger year-over-year performance will be in the second half due to timing of both comparables in energy and currency and our investment schedule. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Eric."

I would just add from a modeling standpoint, right, we will -- if you think about our experience in 2015, broadly, it should be comparable in '16 and would expect generally pricing initiatives will offset -- more than offset whatever inflationary pressures we have from all sources. We generally would expect modest commodity food-type of inflation given the macro environment, a little bit more wage inflation, but certainly something in the 2% or lower number from an aggregate perspective. And specifically on the minimum-wage, with everything that has been enacted thus far, the net impact to us in 2016 is a couple million dollars. That's reflected in our overall algorithm, so I would not expect with what is currently on the table today further to be a material impact from what we know about."

I think now that we've done that, we feel comfortable relative to how we begin to look at what I would call bolt-on M&A activities. So again, we'll be very thoughtful. We'll make sure we evaluate each of those opportunities in terms of strategic fit and the value that they offer. Obviously, as we look at opportunities to add scale or competencies or improve our ability to compete, we will do it. Specifically to the Avoca acquisition in Ireland, this is a leading brand in Ireland. It's a leading consumer retail brand, one of the most successful retailers in Ireland. And so as we look at this, we think it's a small tuck-in acquisition. They operate cafés and food halls and some destination stores and they have a very successful catering company as well. And so our ability to take a small tuck-in acquisition and enhance our industry-leading position in this country, we felt it was a good strategic fit. And we're also very happy that the Pratt family will remain involved in the company."

So I know that some of this is because you like to be conservative and that's definitely nice. And it sounds like you expect the back half to be a little bit better than the first half.

Is it start-up cost? Is it maybe more spending on innovation? Have you maybe used up a little bit of the low-hanging fruit on margin expansion? Maybe you could elaborate there."

I think at the end of the day, what we feel great about right now, Denny, is we're coming off a year where we've had very strong results. We continue to execute well behind a clear and focused strategy where we're making good progress. You saw us this year and will continue to see us going forward on the productivity and margin march front be very focused on enhancing our margins, and in addition to all that, made meaningful improvements on the balance sheet. So I would say as we look to the future, we are very positive and again continue to see the same outsourcing potential that the sector has seen. The pipeline of new business is encouraging. We're very confident in our ability to go activate these productivity initiatives to capture margin. And so, I don't think there's anything as we look at 2016 that doesn't give us confidence that the guidance we've put out there is well within reach."

So I think if you look at the range that we've put out for 2016, that works pretty well associated with the -- with those set of numbers, especially once you make the adjustment for currency, which we've tried to highlight to folks. I think the one word of caution I would give, in general, is the exit rate for the fourth quarter, if you look at it in isolation, should not necessarily be construed to be the same as the entry rate for the first quarter next year, right? We had several one-off events in '14 above and beyond all of the noise we've talked about that helped our percentage improvements year-over-year in the fourth quarter, those will not replicate in the first quarter. And then as we had discussed before, we've got some investments on some pretty big accounts that we're going to be making in the front part of the year as we build up teams, et cetera, that won't have any corresponding revenue associated with them. So I certainly do expect the first half of the year, as we had tried to indicate before, to be better than prior year, but not as strong on a year-over-year basis as the second half will be and that's largely a function of what we need to do to get ourselves ready to onboard some accounts."

We've continued to emphasize that this can be a lumpy business because of the way new business is onboarded and the revenue tailwind that can create, and in some instances, the start-up costs that Steve referenced earlier. So I think our confidence level is this a 3% to 5% growth business, that's what's in the long-term algorithm. And if you look at 2016, I think the combination of our ability to grow our base business and bring on new business both equally weighted at about 50% of the contribution to the top line growth.

A place like Yosemite where we will actually take 99% of the employees over is a much easier type of start-up. My only point is Yosemite, I hope, is not our only large start-up in 2016.

I would not characterize it as elevated from what we would have expected to be the case for 2016. I think it's consistent, certainly consistent with the experience from the last year or 2, and it's consistent with my expectation over the next couple of years. A large portion of what we're doing currently outside of investment required simply to support the onboarding of new client accounts, we're making significant investments in technology. Eric referenced that a couple times. We'll give a deeper dive on that at the Investor Day discussion. But when we talk about activating productivity along the lines of improving outcomes in food, specifically on improving labor, a lot of that is technology either led or dependent. And so we have spent significant amounts of capital and time in the last couple of years both procuring and implementing technological system enhancements and we will expect to continue to do that into fiscal '16. And as we will talk about Investor Day, certainly for the next year or 2, as we continue to drive the margin march on the framework, I think it's realistic to expect the overall intensity of capital to be somewhat consistent with what we've had. The individual pieces, right, the types of things we investment will move -- we invest in will move around a little bit as we complete investments in the labor space. We will move to things like investments in point-of-sale, but it still will be technology-driven investment."

Well, there are several questions in there, so let me try to approach it the way we think about food costs strategically. And I think within food costs, the way I at least kind of bucket our cost opportunities, one is in the area of strategic sourcing and I'll come back to that because that's where the core of your question is, but let me take you through the whole pipeline before I come back. The second is in the area of menu optimization and our ability to really simplify our menu, which simplifies SKUs, which simplifies the number of suppliers we have, which consolidates our purchasing strength, which adds to our scale and leverage. The third bucket is the whole food production process, kind of the manufacturing process. And then the fourth bucket is waste. We have opportunities across all of those. Most of our historical focus has been focused on waste bucket. And so when you talk about strategic sourcing, menu optimization or the food production process, we have opportunities across each and every one of those. On the strategic sourcing side, we do have a GPO in Canada. It is growing. It is something we're investing in. It is something that's a priority for us. But as you think about that margin march, I think you should think about it that we can certainly strengthen our position relative to the GPO. But understand, we have a lot of strength and leverage with suppliers today given our size and scale. So it's something we'll continue to look at. But at this moment in time, I think it's fair for you to walk away with our margin march rests largely on our ability to get at those 4 buckets of food plus what we need to do on the labor and SG&A to deliver against that margin."

I don't think we -- the nature of our business is not such where we have maybe the scale of opportunities as some companies with a different profile around intellectual property and transfer pricing and stuff moving across borders. We tend to be very local as a matter of course. But I think there is some opportunity there. It will take realistically a little bit of time for us. We will need to do some structural things in terms of how we finance ourselves internally and how ultimately we approach some aspects of the limited transfer pricing that we have. So in the medium term, there is some modest improvement potential there for us.

I think if you look at the performance of our uniform business, you should walk away with the following conclusions, whether it's 2015 or whether it's the last several years. One is that the broad-based momentum continues in terms of our ability to grow the top line mid-single-digit, our ability to capture margin. I think the 50 basis points of margin expansion you saw in the year was built off a couple of years of 70 basis point margin improvement. So we feel very good about our continued ability to grow the top line as well as expand margins. What you did see and will continue to see as we invest in capacity is a shorter-term impact on that margin expansion. And so I just want to make sure that as you think about the performance of the business, it has been very good relative to the momentum it has and I think that will continue. But you do have this investment in capacity that we much need to do, particularly on the West Coast, for top line purposes."

We will incur some duplicative costs in the first half because we're essentially -- we're starting up something new, so we've got -- with a single stream of revenue. And so we've got to pay twofold to get the new one up before we can make changes to the old one. And so the lion's share of the improvement in the fiscal year will be in the second half just based on the nature of that investment. And I think if you went back and looked at the cadence of our uniform business over the last 5 or 10 years, you would see something actually quite similar. As we make money available from an investment standpoint, we tend to tread water for a period or 2 to get that bedded down. But it's that incremental capacity that then facilitates our ability to drive the incremental growth. And to Eric's point, we have great investment opportunities in uniforms business that generates very good returns. Obviously, as you can see for us and as -- it's a good problem for us to have for sure in terms of where our capacity currently is and we'll make sure we're doing the right thing for them to drive the financial returns that we know they're capable of."

So I would tell you we probably incurred about $40 million of negative revenue headwinds over the course of the year, almost all in Canada in the remote oil or tar sands, oil sands business and revenue -- or EBIT was probably high single digits, close to $10 million of year-over-year reduction. We really did not see a lot of direct oil and gas headwind outside of Canada in fiscal '15 and part of the reason we're trying to set expectations for the first half of this year. I do think the headwinds that we currently see are growing specifically in Europe, specifically in the North Sea offshore platform business. It seems to be lagging in terms of the reactivity relative to what North America did. So I think we will probably have 1 more quarter based on the cadence. If energy stays where it is, we probably have 1 more quarter of down in North America as we cycle through where things seem to have landed and I do think we have some incremental -- modest incremental headwind in the U.K., which is what's partially driving our expectations for their revenue performance in the first half of the year. As it relates to uniform specifically, yes, we clearly benefited somewhat from diesel as a general rule. Now we do tend to hedge our prospective diesel and fuel requirements out over a longer period of time in the next year, so we kind of layer in. So there was some modest improvement in general. And then I guess, the last thing, back to Europe real quickly, I would point out that our offshore business in general, oil and gas, I think we said is about 3% of the total company. So the European portion of that is obviously that much smaller, so I don't believe it's material. But it will be under a little bit of pressure."

Number one, if that spend in dollar terms is similar that should -- and revenue's higher, that should help margins. And secondly, and you have start-up losses, I realize quarter-to-quarter the timing can change. But you have them every year because you're selling $1 billion plus of new business every year and so I sort of don't understand why that would be something that depresses margin."

I think I'd actually go back to a comment that Eric made around our total cost of investment that we anticipate over the course of the year whether it's start-up-related or whether it's technology-related. To some extent, we do not know yet the specifics of some of the start-ups associated costs because of some of those accounts. So we're certainly making some assumptions that our overall experience around the intensity required for both start-ups as well as the cadence of technology will be comparable proportionally to what we experienced in '15. And so to the extent it's better than that, obviously we'll benefit but it's a little too early in the year for us to make an assumption different than it should be comparable on a year-over-year basis."
