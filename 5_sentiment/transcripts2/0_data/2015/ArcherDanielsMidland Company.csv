This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1 and adjusted segment operating profit of $1.1 billion. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were $701 million or $1.08 per share. Segment operating profit was $1.3 billion. 
For the calendar year, we achieved adjusted earnings of $3.20 per share, up 37% from last year's $2.33. And importantly, adjusted ROIC of 9% was 260 basis points above our cost of capital. 
In the fourth quarter, the Agricultural Services team executed well to capitalize on the strong conditions while international merchandising continued to show year-over-year recovery. In North America and Europe, Oilseeds showed strong year-over-year growth, offset by weaker results in South America. Looking ahead in North America and Europe, solid crush margins and export opportunities have been carried into the first quarter. Market conditions in South America Oilseeds should improve with the large harvest and we're working towards higher returns throughout 2015 in this key geography. 
While U.S. ethanol demand was seasonally strong, boosted by the domestic response to lower gasoline prices, high industry productions has built excess inventories. Margins in this industry should remain challenged until supplies are better aligned with demand. We will continue our work to optimize cost and product mix in the Corn business to maximize profitability. 
Also during the fourth quarter, we were busy preparing for the January 1 launch of the WILD Flavors and the Specialty Ingredients business unit, working on synergies, preparing to move new businesses and align teams. In view of our continued strong performance and our positive outlook, our Board of Directors has voted to increase our quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1 a share, up 5% from the $0.95 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $1.1 billion, up $88 million or more [indiscernible] 8% from last year. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the calendar year, our effective tax rate was 28%, lower than last year's 33% tax rate, which was negatively impacted by valuation allowances taken on certain significant deferred tax assets. 
Looking into calendar year 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range. Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC of 9% improved from the 8.5% at the end of the third quarter and also significantly improved by 240 basis points from the 6.6% at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 9% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.4% annual WACC for 2014 as well as our long-term WACC of 8.0% as reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC. 
In the fourth quarter, our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EVA was $670 million based upon adjusted earnings and annual WACC, up $315 million from 2013. On Chart 17 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of the reported quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share to the adjusted earnings to $1 a share. For this quarter, LIFO represented $16 million pretax credit or $0.01 per share after-tax. We also recorded net gains on sales of assets of about $135 million pretax or $0.14 per share after-tax, primarily related to the sales of our South American fertilizer business. 
We incurred about $33 million of WILD related charges, where about $0.03 per share relate to transactions closing cost as well as restructuring cost during the quarter. We incurred a $98 million noncash pretax U.S. pension settlement charge related to selling some of our retired reliabilities with lump sums. In our GAAP statements, this chart is included in our SG&A expense line. There were approximately $41 million of pretax impairment charges or $0.04 per share from various assets. 
And finally, we adjusted our fourth quarter results down by $52 million or $0.09 per share for U.S. biodiesel tax benefits attributable to the earlier 3 quarters. This breakdown is roughly $0.01 a share in Q1, $0.03 a share in Q2 and $0.05 a share in Q3. 
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan goes into the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. In Oilseeds, I just talked about the South American fertilizer gain and the other pure benefits of the biodiesel tax credits. We will also continue to have our cocoa and chocolate business as part of our segment reporting results in Oilseeds until which time we have closed on the sales, sometime in the first half of 2015. They are not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements. There are also various asset impairment charges in all 3 segments incorporate the sum up to about $41 million pretax. 
In the other processing line, we've included the initial results of both WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. There were about $33 million of transaction closing and restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. In addition, included in the negative $13 million number in Other Processing is about $23 million of purchase price amortization charges relate to inventories and $3 million of additional depreciation expenses. Excluding these amounts, WILD and SCI earned about $13 million in the fourth quarter. 
Effective January 1, the results of WILD and SCI will be included in our new fourth business segment, called WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, which also includes certain specialty ingredients business from our other 3 segments. To assist you with your analysis for 2015, we have included in the appendix a pro forma of our 2014 quarterly results adjusted for the ADM business lines that would be part of the fourth business unit. 
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to significantly lower debt levels. Unallocated corporate cost were higher due to various special project costs, including our ERP project that was initiated earlier in 2014. Other charges for the fourth quarter are primarily related to our $98 million noncash U.S. pension settlement charge. In addition, I want to point out that currency translation effects on our earnings, while negative, we're not material for the fourth quarter nor for the calendar year as much of our global merchandising and processing trade flows are either U.S. dollar functional or U.S. dollar linked, providing some insulation to our financial results against fluctuations of the U.S. dollar or the euro. 
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $20.9 billion, down from last year's $24 billion. The significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues. But this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower. So the key for us is managing the spread between revenues and cost of goods sold, which is core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing ADM. 
Turning to cash flow statement on Slide 6. We present here the cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. We generate just over $2.7 billion from operations before working capital changes in the year ended 2014, slightly higher than last year. Working capital changes were a source of $2.3 billion this year compared to a source of $2.9 billion last year. 
Total capital spending for the year was about $0.9 billion, compared to the prior year -- comparable to the prior year and in line with our reduced CapEx target. We completed acquisitions of $3 billion in equity, which include WILD and SCI, but net of cash assumed amounted to $2.7 billion. We also received proceeds of divestures from the South American fertilizer business of $350 million. 
For 2015, we are estimating capital spending in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. This range is higher than our our $0.9 billion spending in 2014, which you may recall, we reduced after the WILD acquisition to assess capital spend avoidance opportunities. As a result, some 2014 spending shifted into 2015. We also have some additional spending for our ERP program and cost reduction projects as well as the ramp up of our specialty protein project spending in Brazil, our Fibersol projects in China and U.S., our lecithin projects in Germany and India. 
In February 2014, our $1.15 billion convertible debt matured, we paid down this debt, contributing to our overall debt reduction. For the year, we spent about $1.2 billion to repurchase about 25 million shares, and we paid out $0.6 billion in common dividends. So for the year, we returned about $1.8 billion to shareholders. We ended the year with about 643 million shares on a fully diluted basis. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of the end of '14 and '13. Cash on hand was approximately $1.6 billion, down $1.9 billion from last year. Our operating working capital of $7.8 billion was down $3.1 billion from the year-ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $1.3 billion related to lower inventory prices and about $0.7 billion related to lower inventory quantities and a decrease of about $1.1 billion in other working capital, primarily related to reclassification of working capital of our global cocoa and chocolate businesses, which are treated under a held for sale accounting as well as additional trade receivables sold during the calendar year. 
Total debt was about $5.7 billion resulting in net debt balance that is debt less cash of $4.1 billion, up slightly from the 2013 net debt level, in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash outflows related to the acquisitions of WILD and SCI. Our shareholders' equity of $19.6 billion is $0.6 billion lower than the lever last year with the cumulative translation account down about $0.9 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $6.6 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. We had the available cash, we have access to almost $8 billion of short-term liquidity. 
In view of our strong liquidity position and forward outlook, the Board of Directors approved increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.28 per share, a 17% increase. This would translate to an annualized cash outflow of about $0.7 billion. In addition, with a strong balance sheet and forecast generation of cash, we expect to repurchase anywhere between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of ADM shares, subject to any strategic requirements that may occur over the course of this calendar year. So we expect to return anywhere from $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion of cash to shareholders this year, again subject to any strategic requirements. 
With the forecast CapEx spend of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2015, we believe we are again providing a balanced approach towards capital allocation, consistent with the intentions we outlined on Investor Day in December. 
Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter. Juan?"

Let's turn to Slide 8. I'll start with segment operating profits and then move on to discuss the 3 major segments. Our underlying segment operating profit improved sequentially every quarter this year. In the fourth quarter, it increased 20",1612,"Thanks, Ray. Let's turn to Slide 8. I'll start with segment operating profits and then move on to discuss the 3 major segments. 
Our underlying segment operating profit improved sequentially every quarter this year. In the fourth quarter, it increased 20% from the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the significant improvement in Ag Services drove an overall increase of 8%. In all 4 quarters of this year, the team delivered year-over-year improvements in segment operating profit. For the calendar year, we earned $3.7 billion of operating profits excluding specified items, up 25% from the year before. 
2014 was another solid year from our Oilseeds business, demonstrating the strength and diversity of the portfolio in delivering consistent results. The Corn business showed the value of managing the business for overall results. In 2014, they delivered their best operating profit ever. And Ag Services demonstrated a strong recovery from the prior year, aided by a turnaround of international merchandising results and good execution by the team to fully capitalize on a more favorable environment. I am very proud of all the team was able to accomplish this year. 
Now I'll walk you through our fourth quarter results. Starting on Slide 9, the Oilseeds team delivered a strong quarter. It is worth noting that last year's fourth quarter was exceptionally strong, driven by strong performances across all regions. In the fourth quarter, good capacity utilizations and margins drove soybean crushing results in Europe and North America, with the North American team delivering an all-time record quarter amid a strong global demand and low input costs. Both North American and European crushing results were better than the same period last year. 
South American results were down significantly compared to a very strong fourth quarter last year. Origination and transportation were impacted by lower Brazilian corn production, reduced exports and a slow farmer selling relative to last year and losses on basis in both crash positions. 
In Paraguay, a lower quality crop hurt export opportunities. In addition, South American results were negatively impacted by fertilizer as we transition this business for the close of the sale in mid-December. 
In Europe, overcapacity pressured biodiesel margins. And in North America, the attractive U.S. biodiesel tax credit improved margins on [indiscernible] spending in the quarter though demand was down seasonally. Also our results in Asia were consistent with last year were much improved compared to the earlier quarters in 2014, driven by Wilmar results. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results declined in the quarter. In the year-ago period, sweeteners and starches benefited from a steep decline in net corn costs. This fourth quarter, conditions were more challenging as net corn costs rose during the quarter. In addition, our results in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by hedge losses on coproduct sales and increasing bad debt reserves and the start-up costs related to our new sweetener facility in Tianjin, China. For the fourth quarter, absent these unique factors, sweeteners and starches results would've been about $100 million. 
Group execution, the combined management of production and merchandising drove a significant improvement in bioproducts results. And animal nutrition results improved on better margins and solid demand. 
Slide 11, please. In the fourth quarter, Ag Services results improved significantly from last year when market conditions were challenged following the droughts of 2011 and '12. In the U.S., the team put in a strong soybean export program during harvest, moving beans at a record pace. This allowed great throughput of our origination and transportation networks, as you can see reflected in those results. The international merchandising team continued their turnaround. The fourth quarter was the first ordering in which we coordinated our worldwide trade flows through our new global merchandising desk. I'm particularly part of our international merchandising teams work in 2014 as they integrated the top trading operation and levering operational and financial turnaround. 
In transportation, the strong U.S. bean export program, replenishment of fertilizer and salt inventories and great river conditions allowing large [indiscernible], deep thrust, combined with great execution to deliver an outstanding performance. And our [indiscernible] results were strong as the business of solid merchandising and branding opportunities in the quarter. 
Now on Slide 12, we wanted to briefly update you on our actions that are driving improved returns. We focused, as you know, those efforts in a few areas: Strengthening the business; managing our portfolio; and growing the business. 
In the area of strengthening the business. We exceeded our target of $400 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2014. During our December Investor Day, we outlined our target for $350 million in further cost savings related to operational excellence and process improvements. We also highlighted $200 million in incremental purchasing savings. So we are targeting a total of $550 million in additional run rate cost savings over the next 5 years. 
In the area of managing our portfolio. Following the WILD acquisition, we are well on our way to achieving our targeted EUR 100 million in synergies over the next 3 years. The commercial and technical teams are focused on realizing the benefit of the combined businesses and have had over 100 customer engagements so far. We have already recognized synergy wins within our first 3 months and are actively building a pipeline of opportunities for new business. 
Cost synergy activities are also underway. We are addressing redundancies and eliminating overlapping corporate SG&A. In December, we announced our additional IT center will be located in existing space at WILD's facility in [indiscernible], Kentucky. 
We reached an agreement in December to sell our global cocoa business to [indiscernible] for $1.3 billion. We expect to close that sale in mid-2015. We remain on track to close the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill for $440 million in the first half of 2015. We closed the $350 million sale of our South American fertilizer business in December. And in an example of the asset-like approach that we had mentioned before, I'm pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement to sell a 50% stake in our export terminal in Northern Brazil to GrainCorp. Combined with the plan to quadruple that facility's capacity, we are strengthening a strategically located asset in a cost and capital efficient way. 
Our efforts to improve returns also involve investing in to grow the business. In November, we begun production of our sweetener plant in Tianjin, China. Construction continues in our fiber plant in Tianjin, China, our feed pre-mix plant in Nanjing, China and our specialty protein complex in Campo Grande, Brazil. The expansion of our Fibersol production capacity in Clinton, Iowa is on schedule to be operational midyear. And our non-GMO lecithin projects in Hamburg, Germany and [indiscernible], India should be operational in March and July, respectively. 
We continue to take actions to further improve the business. And as you can see, that's reflected in our returns. Before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspectives as we look forward. Our Ag Services results showed how a larger and more efficient U.S. network can perform with a big crop. As the South American harvest continues, we'll see the seasonal decline in North American soybean exports. We also expect to see corn exports pickup starting with the Pacific Northwest and then moving to the Gulf. 
Continued North American mill exports should support crush margins well into Q1. And the large South American harvest should drive exports and improve crush margins. 
In sweeteners and starches, we expect 2015 volumes and margins to be similar to the 2014. Ethanol demand should improve in the coming quarter as low gasoline prices and the change in weather should increase driving miles. And in this margin environment, we would expect many producers to run for yield rather than volume, which should improve alignment of supply and demand. Across the Corn business, we continue our work to optimize our product and customer mix. 
In our new WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit, we expect the benefit from new wins and increased customer engagements. We are working to deliver a compelling portfolio of ingredients and services that will allow us to better serve our customers. We are adding geographic scale to our business with capital projects ongoing in China, Brazil, India, Germany and the U.S. and we are expanding the scope of our portfolio by adding the basic healthy ingredients of Specialty Commodities as well as pursuing new products, such as texturized protein, non-GMO lecithin and Omega-3s. 
We expect that many of our businesses that did not perform that well in 2014 will have more favorable results in 2015. South American results should improve. We expect our international merchandising business to continue its improvement. We have disposed of or are disposing of our poor performing business, such as South American fertilizer, chocolate and cocoa. And we have a list of other businesses for which we are targeting improved profitability of returns in 2015. So a strong finish to 2014, good conditions for the year ahead and continued improvements in our portfolio of businesses. Overall, we feel very good about our position for 2015. 
To recap the few news items we announced on today's call. We are targeting an additional $550 million in run rate cost savings within the next 5 years. We have agreed to sell 50% of our core facility in Northern Brazil to GrainCorp. And together, we will be quadrupling capacity of the board. We are targeting up to $2 billion of stock buybacks for the calendar year and the board has increased our quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28.

Actually, if anything, has been an improvement because of reduced gasoline prices that have decreased our consumption in the United States. We have seen an excess in production that is driven mostly by the very good margins we enjoyed in the November time frame. So how long will it take for that to correct? Difficult to say. We're going to see a combination as we go into the first quarter of progressively higher driving miles and then some of the refineries get into maintenance as they go into March, stay prepared for the high driving season. So we managed, as I said in my prepared remarks, the business for the overall. So we tried to manage the overall product mix, and we look for when margins are very good, we run for volume. When margins are declining, we run a little bit more prudently for yield. So that's the way. We see this is a relatively immature industry, but these low margins will correct itself, the supply issue, and we expect increasing margins as we go into the later part of Q1."

So certainly, North America is much bigger than South America proportionately. I would say -- but you're probably wondering because of the offsetting affect this quarter of the South American result. We have a combination of issues there. First of all, as you recall, in South America, we report flows or origination efforts. So farmer selling has been very poor in South America, and we are comparing again a very strong quarter in 2013. So it's a very tough comp, but origination results were down because of farmer selling. Crushing margins were normally -- we would expect it to be relatively low in Q4 because of lack of beans and that's the end of the season. But we have, to be honest, I mean, in a tough environment like that, with poor farmer selling and low crushing margins, we also didn't help ourselves much. And on top of that we have the transition of the fertilizer business. But that business was discontinued we transferred some of our operations to Mosaic. We have bad results coming out of that, as you can understand it's a very volatile business, low margins and it's a difficult to manage in normal operations, much more in a transition. So I would say those are the impacts that we have in South America in Q4. That makes us optimistic for Q1 because we think that farmer selling will come back, crush margins have already expanded, both in Brazil and in Paraguay. And certainly, we would not have the issue of fertilizers, and we have the new Port of Macarena fully operational. So all in all, we think that South America results was an issue that will stay in that Q4, and we don't expect it to repeat."

So I think for a while, it will be a combination of a strong revenue growth, a strong gains in some customers there may be volumes. And also returns, obviously. Margins are relatively healthy in that industry. So just percentage margins are not important at that point, it's more about winning businesses."

This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1 and adjusted segment operating profit of $1.1 billion. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were $701 million or $1.08 per share. Segment operating profit was $1.3 billion. 
For the calendar year, we achieved adjusted earnings of $3.20 per share, up 37% from last year's $2.33. And importantly, adjusted ROIC of 9% was 260 basis points above our cost of capital. 
In the fourth quarter, the Agricultural Services team executed well to capitalize on the strong conditions, while international merchandising continued to show year-over-year recovery. In North America and Europe, Oilseeds showed strong year-over-year growth, offset by weaker results in South America. Looking ahead in North America and Europe, solid crush margins and export opportunities have carried into the first quarter. Market conditions in South America Oilseeds should improve with the large harvest, and we're working towards higher returns throughout 2015 in this key geography. 
While U.S. ethanol demand was seasonally strong, boosted by the domestic response to lower gasoline prices, high industry production has built excess inventories. Margins in this industry should remain challenged until supplies are better aligned with demand. We will continue our work to optimize cost and product mix in the Corn business to maximize profitability. 
Also, during the fourth quarter, we were busy preparing for the January 1 launch of the WILD Flavors and the Specialty Ingredients business unit, working on synergies, preparing to move new businesses and align teams. In view of our continued strong performance and our positive outlook, our Board of Directors has voted to increase our quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1 a share, up 5% from the $0.95 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $1.1 billion, up $88 million or more than 8% from last year. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the calendar year, our effective tax rate was 28%, lower than last year's 33% tax rate, which was negatively impacted by valuation allowances taken on certain significant deferred tax assets. 
Looking into calendar year 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range. Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC of 9% improved from the 8.5% at the end of the third quarter and also significantly improved by 240 basis points from the 6.6% at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 9% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.4% annual WACC for 2014 as well as our long-term WACC of 8.0%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC. 
In the fourth quarter, our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EVA was $670 million based upon adjusted earnings and annual WACC, up $315 million from 2013. On Chart 17 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share to the adjusted earnings to $1 a share. For this quarter, LIFO represented $16 million pretax credit or $0.01 per share after-tax. We also recorded net gains on sales of assets of about $135 million pretax or $0.14 per share after-tax, primarily related to the sales of our South American fertilizer business. 
We incurred about $33 million of WILD related charges, we're about $0.03 per share related to transactions closing cost as well as restructuring cost during the quarter. We incurred a $98 million noncash pretax U.S. pension settlement charge related to selling some of our retired reliabilities with lump sums. In our GAAP statements, this charge is included in our SG&A expense line. There were approximately $41 million of pretax impairment charges or $0.04 per share from various assets. 
And finally, we adjusted our fourth quarter results down by $52 million or $0.09 per share for U.S. biodiesel tax benefits attributable to the earlier 3 quarters. This breakdown is roughly $0.01 a share in Q1, $0.03 a share in Q2 and $0.05 a share in Q3. 
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan goes into the operating results, I like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. In Oilseeds, I just talked about the South American fertilizer gain and the other pure benefits of the biodiesel tax credits. We will also continue to have our cocoa and chocolate business as part of our segment reporting results in Oilseeds, until which time we have closed on the sales, some time in the first half of 2015. They are not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements. There are also various asset impairment charges in all 3 segments in corporate to sum up to about $41 million pretax. 
In the other processing line, we've included the initial results of both WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. There were about $33 million of transaction closing and restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. In addition, included in the negative $13 million number in other processing is about $23 million of purchase price amortization charges relate to inventories and $3 million of additional depreciation expenses. Excluding these amounts, WILD and SCI earned about $13 million in the fourth quarter. 
Effective January 1, the results of WILD and SCI will be included in our new fourth business segment called WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, which also includes certain specialty ingredients businesses from our other 3 segments. To assist you with your analysis for 2015, we have included in the appendix a pro forma of our 2014 quarterly results adjusted for the ADM business lines that would be part of the fourth business unit. 
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to significantly lower debt levels. Unallocated corporate cost were higher due to various special project costs, including our ERP project that was initiated earlier in 2014. Other charges for the fourth quarter are primarily related to our $98 million noncash U.S. pension settlement charge. 
In addition, I want to point out that currency translation effects on our earnings, while negative, we're not material for the fourth quarter nor for the calendar year as much of our global merchandising and processing trade flows are either U.S. dollar functional or U.S. dollar linked, providing some insulation to our financial results against fluctuations of the U.S. dollar or the euro. 
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $20.9 billion, down from last year's $24 billion. The significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues. But this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower. So the key for us is managing the spread between revenues and cost of goods sold, which is core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing ADM. 
Turning to cash flow statement on Slide 6. We present here the cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year. We generate just over $2.7 billion from operations before working capital changes in the year ended 2014, slightly higher than last year. Working capital changes were a source of $2.3 billion this year compared to a source of $2.9 billion last year. 
Total capital spending for the year was about $0.9 billion, compared to the prior year -- comparable to the prior year and in line with our reduced CapEx target. We completed acquisitions of $3 billion in equity, which included WILD and SCI, but net of cash assumed amounted to $2.7 billion. We also received proceeds of divestures from the South American fertilizer business of $350 million. 
For 2015, we are estimating capital spending in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. This range is higher than our our $0.9 billion spending in 2014, which you may recall, we reduced after the WILD acquisition to assess capital spend avoidance opportunities. As a result, some 2014 spending shifted into 2015. We also have some additional spending for our ERP program and cost reduction projects as well as the ramp-up of our specialty protein project spending in Brazil, our Fibersol projects in China and U.S., our lecithin projects in Germany and India. 
In February 2014, our $1.15 billion convertible debt matured. We paid down this debt contributing to our overall debt reduction. For the year, we spent about $1.2 billion to repurchase about 25 million shares and we paid out $0.6 billion in common dividends. So for the year, we returned about $1.8 billion to shareholders. We ended the year with about 643 million shares on a fully diluted basis. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of the end of both '14 and '13. Cash on hand was approximately $1.6 billion, down $1.9 billion from last year. Our operating working capital of $7.8 billion was down $3.1 billion from the year-ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $1.3 billion related to lower inventory prices and about $0.7 billion related to lower inventory quantities and a decrease of about $1.1 billion in other working capital, primarily related to reclassification of working capital of our global cocoa and chocolate businesses, which are treated under a held for sale accounting as well as additional trade receivables sold during the calendar year. 
Total debt was about $5.7 billion resulting in net debt balance that is debt less cash of $4.1 billion, up slightly from the 2013 net debt level, in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash outflows related to the acquisitions of WILD and SCI. Our shareholders' equity of $19.6 billion is $0.6 billion lower than the level last year, with a cumulative translation account down about $0.9 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $6.6 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. If you add the available cash, we have access to almost $8 billion of short-term liquidity. 
In view of our strong liquidity position and forward outlook, the Board of Directors approved increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.28 per share, a 17% increase. This would translate to an annualized cash outflow of about $0.7 billion. In addition, with a strong balance sheet and forecast generation of cash, we expect to repurchase anywhere between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of ADM shares, subject to any strategic requirements that may occur over the course of this calendar year. So we expect to return anywhere from $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion of cash to shareholders this year, again, subject to any strategic requirements. 
With the forecast CapEx spend of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2015, we believe we are again providing a balanced approach towards capital allocation, consistent with the intentions we outlined on the Investor Day in December. 
Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter. Juan?"

Let's turn to Slide 8. I'll start with segment operating profit and then move on to discuss the 3 major segments.

I'll start with segment operating profit and then move on to discuss the 3 major segments. Our underlying segment operating profit improved sequentially every quarter this year. In the fourth quarter, it increased 20% from the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the significant improvement in Ag Services drove an overall increase of 8%. In all 4 quarters of this year, the team delivered year-over-year improvements in segment operating profit. For the calendar year, we earned $3.7 billion of operating profits excluding specified items, up 25% from the year before. 
2014 was another solid year from our Oilseeds business, demonstrating the strength and diversity of the portfolio in delivering consistent results. The Corn business showed the value of managing the business for overall results. In 2014, they delivered their best operating profit ever. And Ag Services demonstrated a strong recovery from the prior year, aided by a turnaround of international merchandising results and good execution by the team to fully capitalize on a more favorable environment. I am very proud of all the team was able to accomplish this year. 
Now I'll walk you through our fourth quarter results. Starting on Slide 9, the Oilseeds team delivered a strong quarter. It is worth noting that last year's fourth quarter was exceptionally strong, driven by strong performances across all regions. In the fourth quarter, good capacity utilization and margins drove strong soybean crushing results in Europe and North America, with the North American team delivering an all-time record quarter amid a strong global demand and low input costs. Both North American and European crushing results were better than the same period last year. 
South American results were down significantly compared to a very strong fourth quarter last year. Origination and transportation were impacted by lower Brazilian corn production, reduced exports and a slow farmer selling relative to last year and losses on basis on board crush positions. In Paraguay, a lower quality crop hurt export opportunities. In addition, South American results were negatively impacted by fertilizer as we transition this business for the close of the sale in mid-December. 
In Europe, overcapacity pressured biodiesel margins. And in North America, the retroactive U.S. biodiesel tax credit improved margins on gallons blended in the quarter, though demand was down seasonally. Also, our results in Asia were consistent with last year were much improved compared to the earlier quarters in 2014, driven by Wilmar results. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results declined in the quarter. In the year-ago period, sweeteners and starches benefited from a steep decline in net corn costs. This fourth quarter, conditions were more challenging as net corn costs rose during the quarter. In addition, our results in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by hedge losses on coproduct sales, an increase in bad debt reserves and the start-up costs related to our new sweetener facility in Tianjin, China. For the fourth quarter, absent these unique factors, sweeteners and starches results would have been about $100 million. 
Good execution, the combined management of production and merchandising drove a significant improvement in bioproducts results. And animal nutrition results improved on better margins and solid demand. 
Slide 11, please. In the fourth quarter, Ag Services results improved significantly from last year when market conditions were challenged following the droughts of 2011 and '12. In the U.S., the team put on a strong soybean export program during harvest, moving beans at a record pace. This allowed great throughput of our origination and transportation networks, as you can see reflected in those results. The international merchandising team continued their turnaround. The fourth quarter was the first quarter in which we coordinated our worldwide trade flows through our new global merchandising desk. I'm particularly proud of our international merchandising team's work in 2014, as they integrated the top for trading operation and led an operational and financial turnaround. 
In transportation, the strong U.S. bean export program, replenishment of fertilizer and salt inventories and great river conditions allowing large tows, deep thrust, combined with great execution to deliver an outstanding performance. And our Midland results were strong as the business of solid merchandising and blending opportunities in the quarter. 
Now on Slide 12, we wanted to briefly update you on our actions that are driving improved returns. We focused, as you know, those efforts in a few areas: Strengthening the business, managing our portfolio and growing the business. In the area of strengthening the business. We exceeded our target of $400 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2014. During our December Investor Day, we outlined our target for $350 million in further cost savings related to operational excellence and process improvements. We also highlighted $200 million in incremental purchasing savings. So we are targeting a total of $550 million in additional run rate cost savings over the next 5 years. 
In the area of managing our portfolio following the WILD acquisition, we are well on our way to achieving our targeted EUR 100 million in synergies over the next 3 years. The commercial and technical teams are focused on realizing the benefits of the combined businesses and have had over 100 customer engagements so far. We have already recognized synergy wins within our first 3 months and are actively building a pipeline of opportunities for new business. 
Cost synergy activities are also underway. We are addressing redundancies and eliminating overlapping corporate SG&A. In December, we announced our additional IT center will be located in existing space at WILD's facility in Erlanger, Kentucky. 
We reached an agreement in December to sell our global cocoa business to Olam for $1.3 billion. We expect to close that sale in mid-2015. We remain on track to close the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill for $440 million in the first half of 2015. We closed the $350 million sale of our South American fertilizer business in December. And in an example of the asset-light approach that we have mentioned before, I'm pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement to sell a 50% stake in our export terminal in Northern Brazil to Glencore. Combined with the plan to quadruple that facility's capacity, we are strengthening a strategically located asset in a cost and capital efficient way. 
Our efforts to improve returns also involve investing to grow the business. In November, we begun production of our sweetener plant in Tianjin, China. Construction continues in our fiber plant in Tianjin, China, our feed pre-mix plant in Nanjing, China and our specialty protein complex in Campo Grande, Brazil. The expansion of our Fibersol production capacity at Clinton, Iowa is on schedule to be operational midyear. And our non-GMO lecithin projects in Hamburg, Germany and Latur, India should be operational in March and July, respectively. We continue to take actions to further improve the business. And as you can see, that's reflected in our returns. 
Before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspectives as we look forward. Our Ag Services results showed how our larger and more efficient U.S. network can perform with a big clock. As the South American harvest continues, we'll see the seasonal decline in North American soybean exports. We also expect to see corn exports pickup starting with the Pacific Northwest and then moving to the Gulf. Continued North American mill exports should support crush margins well into Q1. And the large South American harvest should drive exports and improve crush margins. 
In sweeteners and starches, we expect 2015 volumes and margins to be similar to the 2014. Ethanol demand should improve in the coming quarter as low gasoline prices and the change in weather should support increased driving miles. And in this margin environment, we would expect many producers to run for yield rather than volume, which should improve alignment of supply and demand. Across the Corn business, we continue our work to optimize our product and customer mix. 
In our new WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit, we expect the benefit from new wins and increased customer engagements. We are working to deliver a compelling portfolio of ingredients and services that will allow us to better serve our customers. We are adding geographic scale to our business with capital projects ongoing in China, Brazil, India, Germany and the U.S. And we are expanding the scope of our portfolio by adding the basic healthy ingredients of Specialty Commodities as well as pursuing new products such as texturized protein, non-GMO lecithin and Omega-3s. 
We expect that many of our businesses that did not perform that well in 2014 will have more favorable results in 2015. South American results should improve. We expect our international merchandising business to continue its improvement. We have disposed of, or are disposing of, our poorer performing business such as South American fertilizer, chocolate and cocoa. And we have a list of other businesses for which we are targeting improved profitability of returns in 2015. So a strong finish to 2014, good conditions for the year ahead and continued improvements in our portfolio of businesses. Overall, we feel very good about our position for 2015. 
To recap a few new items we announced on today's call. We are targeting an additional $550 million in run rate cost savings within the next 5 years. We have agreed to sell 50% of our core facility in Northern Brazil to Glencore. And together, we will be quadrupling capacity of the port. We are targeting up to $2 billion of stock buybacks for the calendar year and the board has increased our quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28. 
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Actually, if anything, has been an improvement because of reduced gasoline prices that have increased our consumption in the United States. We have seen an excess in production that is driven mostly by the very good margins we enjoyed in the November time frame. So how long will it take for that to correct? Difficult to say. We're going to see a combination as we go into the first quarter of progressively higher driving miles. And then some of the refineries get into maintenance as they go into March, stay prepared for the high driving season. So we managed, as I said in my prepared remarks, the business for the overall. So we tried to manage the overall product mix and we look for when margins are very good, we run for volume. When margins are declining, we run a little bit more prudently for yield. So that's the way -- so we see this is a relatively immature industry, but these low margins will correct itself, the supply issue, and we expect increase in margins as we go into the later part of Q1."

So certainly, North America is much bigger than South America proportionately. I will say -- but you're probably wondering because of the offsetting effect this quarter of the South American result. We have a combination of issues there. First of all, as you recall, in South America, we report also origination efforts. So farmer selling has been very poor in South America, and we are comparing, again, a very strong quarter in 2013 so it's a very tough comp. But origination results were down because of farmer selling. Crushing margins were normally -- we would expect it to be relatively low in Q4 because of lack of beans and -- at the end of the season. But we have to be honest, I mean, in a tough environment like that with poor farmer selling a low crushing margins, we also didn't help ourselves much. And on top of that, we have the transition of the fertilizer business. That business was discontinued, we transferred some of our operations to Mosaic. We have bad results coming out of that. As you can understand, it's a very volatile business, low margins and it's difficult to manage in normal operations much more in a transition. So I would say those are the impacts that we have in South America in Q4. That makes us optimistic for Q1 because we think that farmer selling will come back, crush margins have already expanded, both in Brazil and in Paraguay. And certainly, we will not have the issue of fertilizer and we have the new Port of Barcarena fully operational. So all in all, we think that, that South American results was an issue that will stay in that Q4, and we don't expect it to be repeated."

So -- but the issue is if we produce that 15 billion gallons, I mean, it is -- we're not going to have excellent margins. So at the end of the day, it would require some rationalization of capacity. We expect some of this low margins that we're having right now, giving people some -- giving people in the high part of the cost curve some problems. And that's why we continue to emphasize our cost position, and that's all we can drive. What we can drive is our cost position, our fight for the grind and the way we commercially play between produced gallons and purchased gallons.

And to the second point of your question, is absolutely, we can see times in which both are doing very well. As I said, we've had a lot of issues on our own in South America.

This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1 and adjusted segment operating profit of $1.1 billion. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were $701 million or $1.08 per share. Segment operating profit was $1.3 billion. 
For the calendar year, we achieved adjusted earnings of $3.20 per share, up 37% from last year's $2.33. And importantly, adjusted ROIC of 9% was 260 basis points above our cost of capital. 
In the fourth quarter, the Agricultural Services team executed well to capitalize on the strong conditions, while international merchandising continued to show year-over-year recovery. In North America and Europe, Oilseeds showed strong year-over-year growth, offset by weaker results in South America. Looking ahead in North America and Europe, solid crush margins and export opportunities have carried into the first quarter. Market conditions in South America Oilseeds should improve with the large harvest, and we're working towards higher returns throughout 2015 in this key geography. 
While U.S. ethanol demand was seasonally strong, boosted by the domestic response to lower gasoline prices, high industry production has built excess inventories. Margins in this industry should remain challenged until supplies are better aligned with demand. We will continue our work to optimize cost and product mix in the Corn business to maximize profitability. 
Also, during the fourth quarter, we were busy preparing for the January 1 launch of the WILD Flavors and the Specialty Ingredients business unit, working on synergies, preparing to move businesses and align teams. In view of our continued strong performance and our positive outlook, our Board of Directors has voted to increase our quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28.

Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1 a share, up 5% from the $0.95 last year.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1 a share, up 5% from the $0.95 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $1.1 billion, up $88 million or more than 8% from last year. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the calendar year, our effective tax rate was 28%, lower than last year's 33% tax rate, which was negatively impacted by valuation allowances taken on certain significant deferred tax assets. 
Looking into calendar year 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range. Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 9% improved from the 8.5% at the end of the third quarter and also significantly improved by 240 basis points from the 6.6% at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 9% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.4% annual WACC for 2014 as well as our long-term WACC of 8.0%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC. 
In the fourth quarter, our trailing 4-quarter adjusted EVA was $670 million based upon adjusted earnings and annual WACC, up $315 million from 2013. On Chart 17 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share to the adjusted earnings of $1 a share. For this quarter, LIFO represented $16 million pretax credit or $0.01 per share after-tax. We also recorded net gains on sales of assets of about $135 million pretax or $0.14 per share after-tax, primarily related to the sales of our South American fertilizer business. 
We incurred about $33 million of WILD related charges, or about $0.03 per share related to transactions closing cost as well as restructuring cost during the quarter. We incurred a $98 million noncash pretax U.S. pension settlement charge related to selling some of our retiree reliabilities with lump sums. In our GAAP statements, this charge is included in our SG&A expense line. There were approximately $41 million of pretax impairment charges or $0.04 per share from various assets. 
And finally, we adjusted our fourth quarter results down by $52 million or $0.09 per share for U.S. biodiesel tax benefits attributable to the earlier 3 quarters. This breaks down as roughly $0.01 a share in Q1, $0.03 a share in Q2 and $0.05 a share in Q3. 
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan goes into the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. In Oilseeds, I just talked about the South American fertilizer gain and the other pure benefits of the biodiesel tax credits. We will also continue to have our cocoa and chocolate business as part of our segment reporting results in Oilseeds, until which time we have closed on the sales, sometime in the first half of 2015. They are not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements. There are also various asset impairment charges in all 3 segments in corporate to sum up to about $41 million pretax. 
In the other processing line, we've included the initial results of both WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. There were about $33 million of transaction closing and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. In addition, included in the negative $13 million number in other processing is about $23 million of purchase price amortization charges related to inventories and $3 million of additional depreciation expenses. Excluding these amounts, WILD and SCI earned about $13 million in the fourth quarter. 
Effective January 1, the results of WILD and SCI will be included in our new fourth business segment called WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, which also includes certain specialty ingredients businesses from our other 3 segments. To assist you with your analysis for 2015, we have included in the appendix a pro forma of our 2014 quarterly results adjusted for the ADM business lines that would be part of the fourth business unit. 
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to significantly lower debt levels. Unallocated corporate costs were higher due to various special project costs, including our ERP project that was initiated earlier in 2014. Other charges for the fourth quarter are primarily related to our $98 million noncash U.S. pension settlement charge. 
In addition, I want to point out that currency translation effects on our earnings, while negative, we're not material for the fourth quarter nor for the calendar year, as much of our global merchandising and processing trade flows are either U.S. dollar functional or U.S. dollar linked, providing some insulation to our financial results against fluctuations of the U.S. dollar or the euro. 
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $20.9 billion, down from last year's $24 billion. The significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues. But this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower. So the key for us is managing the spread between revenues and cost of goods sold, which is core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing ADM. 
Turning to cash flow statement on Slide 6. We present here the cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year. We generate just over $2.7 billion from operations before working capital changes in the year ended 2014, slightly higher than last year. Working capital changes were a source of $2.3 billion this year compared to a source of $2.9 billion last year. 
Total capital spending for the year was about $0.9 billion, compared to the prior year -- comparable to the prior year and in line with our reduced CapEx target. We completed acquisitions of $3 billion in equity, which included WILD and SCI, but net of cash assumed amounted to $2.7 billion. We also received proceeds of divestures from the South American fertilizer business of $350 million. 
For 2015, we are estimating capital spending in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. This range is higher than our $0.9 billion spending in 2014, which you may recall, we reduced after the WILD acquisition to assess capital spend avoidance opportunities. As a result, some 2014 spending shifted into 2015. We also have some additional spending for our ERP program and cost reduction projects as well as the ramp-up of our specialty protein project spending in Brazil, our Fibersol projects in China and the U.S., our lecithin projects in Germany and India. 
In February 2014, our $1.15 billion convertible debt matured. We paid down this debt contributing to our overall debt reduction. For the year, we spent about $1.2 billion to repurchase about 25 million shares and we paid out $0.6 billion in common dividends. So for the year, we returned about $1.8 billion to shareholders. We ended the year with about 643 million shares on a fully diluted basis. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of the end of both '14 and '13. Cash on hand was approximately $1.6 billion, down $1.9 billion from last year. Our operating working capital of $7.8 billion was down $3.1 billion from the year-ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $1.3 billion related to lower inventory prices and about $0.7 billion related to lower inventory quantities and a decrease of about $1.1 billion in other working capital, primarily related to reclassification of working capital of our global cocoa and chocolate businesses, which are treated under a held for sale accounting as well as additional trade receivables sold during the calendar year. 
Total debt was about $5.7 billion resulting in net debt balance that is debt less cash of $4.1 billion, up slightly from the 2013 net debt level, in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash outflows related to the acquisitions of WILD and SCI. Our shareholders' equity of $19.6 billion is $0.6 billion lower than the level last year, with a cumulative translation account down about $0.9 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $6.6 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. If you add the available cash, we have access to almost $8 billion of short-term liquidity. 
In view of our strong liquidity position and forward outlook, the Board of Directors approved increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.28 per share, a 17% increase. This would translate to an annualized cash outflow of about $0.7 billion. In addition, with a strong balance sheet and forecast generation of cash, we expect to repurchase anywhere between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of ADM shares, subject to any strategic requirements that may occur over the course of this calendar year. So we expect to return anywhere from $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion of cash to shareholders this year, again, subject to any strategic requirements. 
With the forecast CapEx spend of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2015, we believe we are again providing a balanced approach towards capital allocation, consistent with the intentions we outlined on the Investor Day in December. 
Next, Juan will take us through an operational review of the quarter. Juan?"

I'll start with segment operating profit and then move on to discuss the 3 major segments. Our underlying segment operating profit improved sequentially every quarter this year. In the fourth quarter, it increased 20% from the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the significant improvement in Ag Services drove an overall increase of 8%. In all 4 quarters of this year, the team delivered year-over-year improvements in segment operating profit. For the calendar year, we earned $3.7 billion of operating profits excluding specified items, up 25% from the year before. 
2014 was another solid year from our Oilseeds business, demonstrating the strength and diversity of the portfolio in delivering consistent results. The Corn business showed the value of managing the business for overall results. In 2014, they delivered their best operating profit ever. And Ag Services demonstrated a strong recovery from the prior year, aided by a turnaround of international merchandising results and good execution by the team to fully capitalize on a more favorable environment. I am very proud of all the team was able to accomplish this year. 
Now I'll walk you through our fourth quarter results. Starting on Slide 9, the Oilseeds team delivered a strong quarter. It is worth noting that last year's fourth quarter was exceptionally strong, driven by strong performances across all regions. In the fourth quarter, good capacity utilization and margins drove strong soybean crushing results in Europe and North America, with the North American team delivering an all-time record quarter amid strong global demand and low input costs. Both North American and European crushing results were better than the same period last year. 
South American results were down significantly compared to a very strong fourth quarter last year. Origination and transportation were impacted by lower Brazilian corn production, produced exports and a slow farmer selling relative to last year and losses on basis on board crush positions. In Paraguay, a lower quality crop hurt export opportunities. In addition, South American results were negatively impacted by fertilizer as we transition this business for the close of the sale in mid-December. 
In Europe, overcapacity pressured biodiesel margins. And in North America, the retroactive U.S. biodiesel tax credit improved margins on gallons blended in the quarter, though demand was down seasonally. Also, our results in Asia while consistent with last year were much improved compared to the earlier quarters in 2014, driven by Wilmar results. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results declined in the quarter. In the year-ago period, sweeteners and starches benefited from a steep decline in net corn costs. This fourth quarter, conditions were more challenging as net corn costs rose during the quarter. In addition, our results in the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by hedge losses on coproduct sales, an increase in bad debt reserves and the start-up costs related to our new sweetener facility in Tianjin, China. For the fourth quarter, absent these unique factors, sweeteners and starches results would have been above $100 million. 
Good execution, the combined management of production and merchandising drove a significant improvement in bioproducts results. And animal nutrition results improved on better margins and solid demand. 
Slide 11, please. In the fourth quarter, Ag Services results improved significantly from last year when market conditions were challenged following the droughts of 2011 and '12. In the U.S., the team put on a strong soybean export program during harvest, moving beans at a record pace. This allowed great throughput of our origination and transportation networks, as you can see reflected in those results. The international merchandising team continued their turnaround. The fourth quarter was the first quarter in which we coordinated our worldwide trade flows through our new global merchandising desk. I'm particularly proud of our international merchandising team's work in 2014, as they integrated the top for trading operation and led an operational and financial turnaround. 
In transportation, the strong U.S. bean export program, replenishment of fertilizer and salt inventories and great river conditions allowing large tows, deep thrust, combined with great execution to deliver an outstanding performance. And our Midland results were strong as the business of solid merchandising and blending opportunities in the quarter. 
Now on Slide 12, we wanted to briefly update you on our actions that are driving improved returns. We focused, as you know, those efforts in a few areas: Strengthening the business, managing our portfolio and growing the business. In the area of strengthening the business. We exceeded our target of $400 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2014. During our December Investor Day, we outlined our target for $350 million in further cost savings related to operational excellence and process improvements. We also highlighted $200 million in incremental purchasing savings. So we are targeting a total of $550 million in additional run rate cost savings over the next 5 years. 
In the area of managing our portfolio. Following the WILD acquisition, we are well on our way to achieving our targeted EUR 100 million in synergies over the next 3 years. The commercial and technical teams are focused on realizing the benefits of the combined businesses and have had over 100 customer engagements so far. We have already recognized synergy wins within our first 3 months and are actively building a pipeline of opportunities for new business. 
Cost synergy activities are also underway. We are addressing redundancies and eliminating overlapping corporate SG&A. In December, we announced our additional IT center will be located in existing space at WILD's facility in Erlanger, Kentucky. 
We reached an agreement in December to sell our global cocoa business to Olam for $1.3 billion. We expect to close that sale in mid-2015. We remain on track to close the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill for $440 million in the first half of 2015. We closed the $350 million sale of our South American fertilizer business in December. And in an example of the asset-light approach that we have mentioned before, I'm pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement to sell a 50% stake in our export terminal in Northern Brazil to Glencore. Combined with the plan to quadruple that facility's capacity, we are strengthening a strategically located asset in a cost and capital efficient way. 
Our efforts to improve returns also involve investing to grow the business. In November, we began production of our sweetener plant in Tianjin, China. Construction continues in our fiber plant in Tianjin, China, our feed pre-mix plant in Nanjing, China and our specialty protein complex in Campo Grande, Brazil. The expansion of our Fibersol production capacity at Clinton, Iowa is on schedule to be operational midyear. And our non-GMO lecithin projects in Hamburg, Germany and Latur, India should be operational in March and July, respectively. We continue to take actions to further improve the business. And as you can see, that's reflected in our returns. 
Before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspectives as we look forward. Our Ag Services result show how our larger and more efficient U.S. network can perform with a big clock. As the South American harvest continues, we'll see the seasonal decline in North American soybean exports. We also expect to see corn exports pick up starting with the Pacific Northwest and then moving to the Gulf. Continued North American mill exports should support crush margins well into Q1. And the large South American harvest should drive exports and improve crush margins. 
In sweeteners and starches, we expect 2015 volumes and margins to be similar to 2014. Ethanol demand should improve in the coming quarter as low gasoline prices and the change in weather should support increased driving miles. And in this margin environment, we would expect many producers to run for yield rather than volume, which should improve alignment of supply and demand. Across the Corn business, we continue our work to optimize our product and customer mix. 
In our new WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit, we expect to benefit from new wins and increased customer engagements. We are working to deliver a compelling portfolio of ingredients and services that will allow us to better serve our customers. We are adding geographic scale to our business with capital projects ongoing in China, Brazil, India, Germany and the U.S. And we are expanding the scope of our portfolio by adding the basic healthy ingredients of Specialty Commodities, as well as pursuing new products such as texturized protein, non-GMO lecithin and Omega-3s. 
We expect that many of our businesses that did not perform that well in 2014 will have more favorable results in 2015. South American results should improve. We expect our international merchandising business to continue its improvement. We have disposed of, or are disposing of, our poorer performing business such as South American fertilizer, chocolate and cocoa. And we have a list of other businesses for which we are targeting improved profitability of returns in 2015. So a strong finish to 2014, good conditions for the year ahead and continued improvements in our portfolio of businesses. Overall, we feel very good about our position for 2015. 
To recap a few news items we announced on today's call. We are targeting an additional $550 million in run rate cost savings within the next 5 years. We have agreed to sell 50% of our core facility in Northern Brazil to Glencore. And together, we will be quadrupling capacity of the port. We are targeting up to $2 billion of stock buybacks for the calendar year and the board has increased our quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.28. 
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Actually, if anything, has been an improvement because of reduced gasoline prices that have increased consumption in the United States. We have seen an excess in production that is driven mostly by the very good margins we enjoyed in the November time frame. So how long will it take for that to correct? Difficult to say. We're going to see a combination as we go into the first quarter of progressively higher driving miles. And then some of the refineries get into maintenance as they go into March, stay prepared for the high driving season. So we managed, as I said in my prepared remarks, the business for the overall. So we tried to manage the overall product mix and we look for when margins are very good, we run for volume. When margins are declining, we run a little bit more prudently for yield. So that's the way -- so we see this is a relatively immature industry, but these low margins will correct itself, the supply issue, and we expect increase in margins as we go into the later part of Q1."

The other leg of the stool that we look at is the flexibility and the introduction of new products that allow us to shift production to the products that are growing the most or having less margin pressure. I would say, Evan, overall, we expect probably about -- margins in ethanol to be a little bit lower than 2014, but better than current levels."

So certainly, North America is much bigger than South America proportionately. I would say -- but you're probably wondering because of the offsetting effect this quarter of the South American result. We have a combination of issues there. First of all, as you recall, in South America, we report also origination efforts. So farmer selling has been very poor in South America, and we are comparing, again, a very strong quarter in 2013 so it's a very tough comp. But origination results were down because of farmer selling. Crushing margins were normally -- we would expect it to be relatively low in Q4 because of lack of beans and -- at the end of the season. But we have to be honest, I mean, in a tough environment like that with poor farmer selling a low crushing margins, we also didn't help ourselves much. And on top of that, we have the transition of the fertilizer business. That business was discontinued, and we transferred some of our operations to Mosaic. We have bad results coming out of that. As you can understand, it's a very volatile business, low margins and it's difficult to manage in normal operations much more in a transition. So I would say those are the impacts that we have in South America in Q4. That makes us optimistic for Q1 because we think that farmer selling will come back, crush margins have already expanded, both in Brazil and in Paraguay. And certainly, we will not have the issue of fertilizer and we have the new Port of Barcarena fully operational. So all in all, we think that, that South American results was an issue that will stay in that Q4, and we don't expect it to be repeated."

Obviously -- and we were able to capture good basis, to be honest, during Q4. So we were very happy with that. As we roll into Q1, obviously, the soybean export programs kind of declines as South America becomes -- to pick up the pace there. We expect corn program to pick up during the quarter as the U.S. corn becomes more competitive against European destinations or Argentina. So all-in-all, we've seen steady demand. Not maybe a spectacular demand, but not weak demand, steady demand. So we're looking at the execution of a good book, execution of a good -- good execution margins in the interior, good storage margins, still good transportation P&L as still we see a lot of Northbound freight being used.

And then just one quick follow-up on all of that. Looking forward, talking about overall demand and looking at demand into next year, is there is sufficient demand to, let's say, if you had a normal crop year, to reduce our carryovers in crops next year? Or should we gradually see a little bit of a build here in our corn and soybean carryovers, given the strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly? And I guess, the only offsetting factor particularly, like in corn, there's always talks of China could be a 20 million to 25 million metric tonne buyer, it comes -- crops up all the time. Any comments on the demand side on that function? And it seems to me that the general direction of corn and maybe soybeans over the next 12 months, a year from now, I would expect those complexes to be lower. But I'm interested in your thoughts."

So nothing fundamentally has changed in terms of our long-term assessment of continued demand growth for these agricultural products. As you know, we've actually had a pretty favorable supply conditions over the past couple of years and as you know, weather is a factor. So when you ask a question about what carryovers in the future will be, we feel pretty good about the demand side. In the supply side, there could be weather aberrations somewhere around the world which will impact the supply side and that will have an impact on carryover.

This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.77, that's 40% higher than the year ago period. For adjusted operating segment profit was $883 million. Adjusted ROIC of 9.5% was 290 basis points above our cost of capital. 
In the first quarter, the ADM team demonstrated their ability to leverage the strength of our diversified business model. The oilseed team capitalized on favorable market conditions and delivered outstanding results with strong performances in each region.
In Ag Services, our recently created global trade desk, or GTD platform, drove higher merchandise volumes. Our new WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business went off to a great start towards achieving the cost and revenue synergies we identified last year. Together, these performance has helped deliver a good quarter overall even as slower industry ethanol margins limited earnings in corn and the strong dollar limited U.S. grain exports.
We have continued to advance the strategic plan we shared at our December Investor Day. In the area of optimizing the core, we announced the acquisition of a Belgian oil bottling business, helping us reach out wider customer base and creating a new output for our European crushing assets. 
And the WSs site team has been working with customers as they develop and launch new products using SCI, WILD and ADM ingredients. We have more than 200 joint customer engagements, building a pipeline of more than 400 projects, resulting already in more than 30 revenue synergy wins across a number of regions and businesses unit in Q1 alone.
In the area of driving operational efficiencies, we have already identified more than $200 million in run rate savings opportunities toward our goal of $550 million in 5 years. And in the area of strategic expansion, the corn processing business expanded in high growth geographies with the acquisition of the remaining stake of corn wet mills in Bulgaria and Turkey and an increased stake in our facility in Hungary.

Excluding specified items and also, excluding net timing effects, adjusted",1350,"Okay. Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.77, up 40% from the $0.55 last year. Excluding specified items and also, excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $883 million, up $94 million.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 29% compared to 27% in the first quarter of the prior year. For calendar year 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range. Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 9.5% improved from the 9.0% at the end of the fourth quarter and also significantly improved by 250 basis points from the 7.0% at the end of the first quarter last year.
The 9.5% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015, as well as our long-term WACC of 8.0%, as reflected on the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC. In the first quarter, our trailing 4-quarter average Economic Value Added, or EVA, was $742 million based upon adjusted earnings in the annual WACC, up $581 million from 2014.
On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.77 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share. For this quarter, LIFO represented a $2 million pretax credit or less than $0.01 per share after-tax. There are no other adjustments for the quarter.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items that impacted our quarterly results. 
Corn Processing adjusted operating profit, $127 million, excludes approximately $14 million hedge in the effectiveness charges, split relatively evenly amongst file products and sweeteners and starches. In oilseeds, adjusted operating profit, $483 million, excludes approximately $14 million of Cocoa hedged time effects in this quarter. As a reminder, we will also continue to have our cocoa and chocolate businesses as part of our segment reporting results in oil seeds until we have closed on the sales some time later in 2015. They are not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements due to the lack of materiality of the operations to our overall results. 
Our new forward business segment, WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, is reported to add its own segment for the first time this quarter. The segment includes the 2 businesses we acquired in 2014, WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. or SCI, as well as certain specialty ingredients businesses that were previously recorded in ADM's 3 other segments. For purposes of comparison to prior year results, the year ago quarter segment operating profit for Ag Services, corn and oilseeds removed the earnings of the businesses now reported in the WFSI segment. To assist with your analysis, we concluded a chart in the appendix that we cast 2014 segment quarterly results to the new segments.
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs were due to or higher due to increased GAAP pension expenses related to changes in discount rates and mortality tables and increased investments in our ERP program, as well as very strategic projects and M&A and divestment activities.
In addition, I want to point out that the strong U.S. dollar and weakness in other currencies, such as the euro and the Brazilian real, did not have a material impact on ADM's overall first quarter net earnings.
On one hand, the strong U.S. dollar did have the negative impact on the competitiveness of our U.S. export programs. And our WFSI segment also had a negative impact in terms of export competitiveness and earnings translation from Europe. On the other hand, the weaker euro, NKR, have a positive impact on our fixed costs around the world relative to revenue streams we're receiving. Also, the weaker motivated Brazilian farmers to sell, thereby, benefiting our origination business in Brazil. So on balance, with the puts and the takes, the net impact was not material. Going forward, we do not expect the currency impact to have a material impact on our overall results for the rest of the year.
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $17.5 billion, down from last year's $20.7 billion. The significant reduction is driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues. But this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower. So the key for us is management spread between the revenues and cost of goods sold, which is a core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing ADM.
I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements in the prior year do not include the revenues and the cost of WILD and SCI, which transaction closed in the fourth quarter of last year.
Turning to cash flow statement on Slide 6, which shows the cash flows for the 3 months ending March 31, 2015, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $577 million from operations before working capital changes in the quarter, significantly higher than Q1 last year. Total capital spending for the quarter was $244 million, up from the prior year.
For 2015, we are estimating capital spending in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. This range is higher than our $0.9 billion spending in 2014, which you may recall we reduced the asset of WILD acquisition to assess capital spend avoidance opportunities. As a result, some 2014 spending shifted into 2015. We also have some additional spending for our ERP program and cost reduction projects, as well as the ramp-up of our specialty protein project spending in Brazil, our Fibersol projects in China and the U.S., our lecithin projects in Germany and India.
During the quarter, we spent $566 million to repurchase about 12 million shares towards our 2015 target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion of share repurchases, subject to strategic capital requirements. Our average share count was 639 million diluted shares outstanding, down approximately 24 million from the 663 million at the same time one year ago. Our total return of capital to shareholders for the quarter, including dividends, was over $700 million.
Our first quarter cash flows are consistent with our 2015 calendar year targets of capital allocations, namely CapEx at $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, approximately $700 million of dividends and $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases. And all this is consistent with the balanced capital allocation framework we set forth at our December Investor Day.
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31 for both 2015 and 2014, which remains very strong. Our operating working capital of a $8.1 billion was down $3.4 billion from the year ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $1.6 billion related to lower inventory prices, including the translation impact; about $1.4 billion related to lower inventory quantities and a decrease of about $0.4 billion in other working capital, primarily related to the reclassification of working capital for global cocoa and chocolate businesses under the held-for-sale accounting.
Total debt was about $6.4 billion, resulting in net debt balance that is debt less cash of $5.1 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $4.1 billion, in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash flows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI.
Our shareholders equity of $18.8 billion is $1.3 billion lower than the level last year with a cumulative translation account impact about $1.6 billion lower due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.7 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December, if you had available cash with access some billion dollars of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance. Juan?"

In the first quarter, we earned $883 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. This 12% year-over-year increase in underlying in segment operating profit demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model and the team's ability to leverage that model.
In the first quarter, the team capitalized on great opportunities while they continue to advance our strategic plan. Sequentially, of course, the quarter follows a very strong fourth quarter. And with normal seasonality, underlying segment operating profits decreased.
Now I will review the performance of each segment. Starting on Slide 9. In the first quarter, Ag Services results improved 37% over last year. Merchandising and handling saw limited U.S. export competitiveness more than offset by continued improvement in international merchandising, where we saw the benefit of our GTD with merchandise volumes increasing. 
In Transportation, we saw an increasing demand for northbound U.S. bar freight, which mostly offset the decrease in Southbourne demand. Million and others results improved due to a strong margins for flour, grain and feed.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results declined in the quarter. In sweeteners and starches, our underlying North American business is doing well with higher margins and volumes in Q1. This was offset by lower contribution from core products, reduced equity earnings from joint ventures and start-up costs related to the Tianjin sweetener facility. And in bioproducts, earnings were lower due to lower ethanol production volumes and a weaker industry margins.
Supply and demand imbalances challenged industry ethanol margins most of the quarter, though conditions in margins have been improving since late March. Let me explain our corn results a bit further.
We said before that we make decisions that will achieve the best overall results for ADM. This quarter, with low industry margins, we made the decision to run our ethanol operations for margins rather than volumes. That helped our earnings in bioproducts. It also had the effect of reducing our production of core products, which limited our earnings in sweeteners and starches. Bottom line, the impact for our overall Corn business was positive.
Slide 11, please. The oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter. Crushing and origination had great performances in each region. In North America, the team demonstrated the value of our strong footprint and our effective destination supply chain. 8 to 10 months ago, they determined Q1 will see an extended North American export window. They got maintenance out of the way and positioned soybean supplies so when the margins arrive, they will able to run hard until the seasonal shift to South America came.
In Europe, the team demonstrated the value of the swing capacity of our crush plants when soybean crush margins were more than double canola crush margins will one [ph] the plant's hard and crush a lot of beans. And in South America, the team prepared our network for the large fast harvest. And with a strong dollar Joe Brazilian farmers to sell their beans, we were ready to handle the crop as strong margins.
In refining, packaging, biodiesel and other, lower biodiesel margins in the North America and weaker European demand limited results. South American biodiesel results improved with B 7 implementation.
And in North America, our Strattera's bottle oil joint venture generated strong results with good volumes. Results from Asia rose primarily on Wilmar's improved performance.
Slide 12, please. In their first reporting quarter, the WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit delivered a great start. As I mentioned earlier, the team has been working with a wide range of customers as they develop products using ingredients from all of ADM's business units. Globally, the flavors business is off to a strong start for the year. 
On a constant currency basis, WILD EMEA business performed particularly well. This is a quarter in which demand is seasonally slower and results were limited by ForEx headwinds. We also had mark-to-market losses on currency hedges for future capital purchases for the specialty protein plant in Brazil. The process itself is benefiting from the weakened real versus the dollar. This is an exciting business with an energetic team and they are off to an absolutely great start.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at the Investor Day in December. It lists the actions we are taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress in the quarter. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, we launched our Arco, having a wide range of services to our Arco barge operations. With ADM's logistical expertise and global reach, we provide the customers along the lower Mississippi range of services that nobody else offers. As I mentioned, we saw the benefit of our GTD platform that we developed following the Toepfer acquisition. 
And today, we are announcing that we have agreed to acquire full ownership of our joint venture complexes at Constanza, Romania, a black seed [indiscernible] of the Danube. This acquisition builds on the investments we have made in our Danube briefer network since 2011 and further strengthens our origination and transportation capabilities in Eastern Europe.
In corn, we sold our lactic acid business, exiting the business for which we didn't see a fast to acceptable resumes in a reasonable timeframe. And we acquired the remainder of the Bulgarian and Turkish wet mills and expanded our stake in the Hungary plant, positioning our selves well for when EU sugar production folded are lifted.
We continue the structure of our feed premix plant in Nanjing. And this morning, we are announcing plans to build the fourth seed plant in China in Sanso, as well as one in Minnesota. 
In oilseeds, we're working with Cardinal Nola on the divestures series of our chocolate and cocoa businesses. We are targeting closing both in Q3 subject to final approvals and completion of transitional activities. We agreed to acquire an oil bottling business in Belgium. This acquisition will provide another demand stream for our oilseed processing operations, reducing our reliance on biodiesel and growing our package oil business. And as we mentioned on the last call, we are creating a joint venture to quadruple the size of our corn in Northern Brazil, improving our ability to export from this increasingly productive region.
In WSSI, related to the WILD acquisition, we remain on track to deliver $100 million in synergies over the next 3 years, and we are on track for $0.10 to $0.15 accretion in 2015, although this will likely be in the lower end of the range due to the strong dollar.
And we continue to advance our construction project in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U.S. And in the area of driving operational efficiencies, as I mentioned, we have identified more than $200 million in run rate savings towards our goal of $550 million in 5 years. As part of this effort, we launched a global improvement initiative involving colleagues across all regions and businesses in evaluating every aspects of our business for improvement opportunities.
In the first quarter, we implemented project that will achieve about $60 million in annual run rate savings. We'll update you on our scorecard each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of these actions improve earnings and returns.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We continue to be excited about 2015. We came into the year with a lot of positive momentum, which we expect to continue through the year. Good early planting progress and long-term weather forecast suggests a good likelihood for excellent U.S. crops. A large harvest combined with big carryouts of corn, soybean and wheat could give us opportunities for very good carriers at the end of the year. Those, combined with expected solid global demand point to very high utilization of our storage, transportation and processing assets in North America and Europe later this year.
U.S. gasoline consumption continues to improve. That will translate into stronger domestic demand for ethanol. These, combined with a strong exports, will keep our assets running hard, especially as we move through the summer driving season.
Demand for sweeteners and flavors will benefit from the seasonal decap in Northern Hemisphere beverage consumption. The WSCI team is off to a great start. They will continue to deliver synergies, and we are confident they will meet the 2015 accretion goals.
We are also excited by our customer engagements. Every business unit has been working with existing customers, as well as new customers. We are collaborating across the organization more than ever before, working on new types of projects, delivering wins, improving margins. And the team will continue to deliver our clear and aggressive strategic plan, the pla that is already contravening to our bottom line, a plan that returned 9.5% this quarter, the plan that will continue to grow our EVA. 
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

If you look at January and February export estimates, they are annualized at around 1 billion gallon because we spotted in those 2 months 152 million gallons. But if you take the last week of April, that export annualized was around also in the 1 billion range. So we see export for the year between 800 and maybe a little bit north of that for the year, plus maybe 13.8 billion to 14 billion gallons of domestic gasoline demand. We see very high capacity utilization. So we face this season with a lot of optimism in regards to ethanol."

So the revenue synergies are more back-end loaded and the cost synergies are more front end loaded in these projects.

And we needed to fix that. That was, not only providing recurrence, but a lot of volatility the with our nice with where running it. Part of that was created by inefficiencies between the interface between Toepfer and ADM, part of that it was because of a blow to the structure, if you will, that was increasing our fixed cost. So what we brought -- when we bought the 20% of Toepfer, we bought -- we brought both companies together, and we move some of the people to role to Geneva that allowed us to, first of all, have a more conservative view of the market, more coordinated view of the market between the origination and the destination that Toepfer provided. We had better utilization of our infrastructure, our logistics. And certainly, reviews the cost of the whole operation. So it's a more profitable operation that they have as many fixed cost. So I think that overall, we improve the volumes because we have better coverage, but we also increase the margins out of that since we have lower cost. So I think the overall end-to-end supply chain that you hear me talking from origination to the destination market, that's what the GTD has brought to us. And we should continue to see improvements into these. And you see this is a very true reflection. Our services with North America not being able to export that much because of the strong dollar still grew earnings 37% year-over-year, which is a significant improvement.

We posted an increase in profitability in their underlying business in sweeteners and starches, driven by good volumes and product margins. It was offset by part of this lack of core product because of the decision we made to run ethanol for margins and also decreased earnings from a joint ventures and the one-times from the Tianjin the start-up cost. Think about the Tianjin plant. We have a full plant, a 4 walls scale plant waiting to get approval. So you have all the fixed costs and some of the variable costs that we are making product with no revenue, no cash flow from that plant. So that's impacting the business. But I would say from -- I agree with you, margins for sport business are a little bit tighter and a little bit higher. And we have a combination of contracts, contract that were done before the announcement of some of the shutdowns that were down at previous years margin and some businesses that will perform after that, which are a better numbers. But we expect the profitability of sweeteners and the starches from now on to improve as some of these one-off will be eliminated."

Adjusted ROIC of 9.5% was 290 basis points above our cost of capital. 
In the first quarter, the ADM team demonstrated their ability to leverage the strength of our diversified business model. The oilseeds team capitalized on favorable market conditions and delivered outstanding results with strong performances in each region.
In Ag Services, our recently created global trade desk or GTD platform drove higher merchandise volumes. Our new WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business was off to a great start towards achieving the cost and revenue synergies we identified last year. Together, these performances helped deliver a good quarter overall, even as lower industry ethanol margins limited earnings in corn and the strong dollar limited U.S. grain exports.
We have continued to advance the strategic plan we shared at our December Investor Day. In the area of optimizing the core, we announced the acquisition of a Belgian oil bottling business, helping us reach a wider customer base and creating a new output for our European crushing assets. And the WFSI team has been working with customers as they develop and launch new products using SCI, WILD and ADM ingredients. We had more than 200 joint customer engagements, building a pipeline of more than 400 projects, resulting already in more than 30 revenue synergy wins across a number of regions and business units in Q1 alone.
In the area of driving operational efficiencies, we have already identified more than $200 million in run rate savings opportunities toward our goal of $550 million in 5 years. And in the area of strategic expansion, the Corn Processing business expanded in high-growth geographies with the acquisition of the remaining stake of corn wet mills in Bulgaria and Turkey and an increased stake in a facility in Hungary.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.77, up 40% from the $0.55 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $883 million, up $94 million.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 29% compared to 27% in the first quarter of the prior year. For calendar year 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range. Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 9.5% improved from the 9.0% at the end of the fourth quarter and also significantly improved by 250 basis points from the 7.0% at the end of the first quarter last year. The 9.5% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 as well as our long-term WACC of 8.0%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC. 
In the first quarter, our trailing 4-quarter average economic value added or EVA was $742 million based upon adjusted earnings and the annual WACC, up $581 million from 2014. On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.77 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share. For this quarter, LIFO represented a $2 million pretax credit or less than $0.01 per share after tax. There are no other adjustments for the quarter.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items that impacted our quarterly results. 
Corn Processing adjusted operating profit of $127 million excludes approximately $14 million hedge ineffectiveness charges, split relatively evenly amongst bioproducts and sweeteners and starches. In oilseeds, adjusted operating profit of $483 million excludes approximately $14 million of cocoa hedge timing effects in this quarter. As a reminder, we'll also continue to have our cocoa and chocolate businesses as part of our segment reporting results in oilseeds until we have closed on the sales some time later in 2015. They are not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements due to the lack of materiality of the operations to our overall results. 
Our new fourth business segment, WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients or WFSI for short is reported at its own segment for the first time this quarter. The segment includes the 2 businesses we acquired in 2014, WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. or SCI as well as certain specialty ingredients businesses that were previously reported in ADM's 3 other segments. For purposes of comparison to prior results, the year-ago quarter segment operating profit for Ag Services, corn and oilseeds removed the earnings of the businesses now reported in the WFSI segment. To assist with your analysis, we've included a chart in the appendix that recasts 2014 segment quarterly results to the new segments.
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs were due to -- or higher due to increased GAAP pension expenses relating to changes in discount rates and mortality tables and increased investments in our ERP program as well as very strategic projects and M&A and divestment activities.
In addition, I want to point out that the strong U.S. dollar and weakness in other currencies such as the euro and the Brazilian real did not have a material impact on ADM's overall first quarter net earnings. On one hand, the strong U.S. dollar did have a negative impact on the competitiveness of our U.S. export programs. And our WFSI segment also had some negative impacts in terms of export competitiveness and earnings translation from euro. On the other hand, the weaker euro and real had a positive impact on our fixed costs around the world relative to the revenue streams we're receiving. Also, the weaker real motivated Brazilian farmers to sell, thereby, benefiting our origination business in Brazil. So on balance, with the puts and the takes, the net impact was not material. Going forward, we do not expect the currency impact to have a material impact on our overall results for the rest of the year.
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $17.5 billion, down from last year's $20.7 billion. The significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues. But this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower. So the key for us is management spread between the revenues and cost of goods sold, which is a core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing ADM. I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements in the prior year do not include the revenues and the costs of WILD and SCI, which transaction closed in the fourth quarter of last year.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6, which shows the cash flows for the 3 months ending March 31, 2015 compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $577 million from operations before working capital changes in the quarter, significantly higher than Q1 last year. Total capital spending for the quarter was $244 million, up from the prior year. For 2015, we are estimating capital spending in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. This range is higher than our $0.9 billion spending in 2014, which you may recall, we reduced after the WILD acquisition to assess capital spend avoidance opportunities. As a result, some 2014 spending shifted into 2015. We also have some additional spending for our ERP program and cost reduction projects as well as the ramp-up of our specialty protein project spending in Brazil, our Fibersol projects in China and the U.S., our lecithin projects in Germany and India.
During the quarter, we spent $566 million to repurchase about 12 million shares towards our 2015 target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion of share repurchases, subject to strategic capital requirements. Our average share count was 639 million diluted shares outstanding, down approximately 24 million from the 663 million at the same time one year ago. Our total return of capital to shareholders for the quarter, including dividends, was over $700 million.
Our first quarter cash flows are consistent with our 2015 calendar year targets of capital allocations, namely CapEx at $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, approximately $700 million of dividends and $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases. And all this is consistent with the balanced capital allocation framework we set forth at our December Investor Day.
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31 for both 2015 and 2014, which remains very strong. Our operating working capital of $8.1 billion was down $3.4 billion from the year-ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $1.6 billion related to lower inventory prices, including the translation impact; about $1.4 billion related to lower inventory quantities; and a decrease of about $0.4 billion in other working capital primarily related to the reclassification of working capital for global cocoa and chocolate businesses under the held-for-sale accounting.
Total debt was about $6.4 billion, resulting in net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $5.1 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $4.1 billion, in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash flows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI.
Our shareholders' equity of $18.8 billion is $1.3 billion lower than the level last year, with a cumulative translation account impact of $1.6 billion lower due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.7 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. If you add available cash, we have access to some billion dollars of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance. Juan?"

Let's turn to Slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $883 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. This 12% year-over-year increase in underlying segment operating profit demonstrates the strength of our diversified business",1516,"Thanks, Ray. Let's turn to Slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $883 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. This 12% year-over-year increase in underlying segment operating profit demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model and the team's ability to leverage that model.
In the first quarter, the team capitalized on great opportunities while they continued to advance our strategic plan. Sequentially, of course, the quarter follows a very strong fourth quarter, and with normal seasonality, underlying segment operating profits decreased.
Now I will review the performance of each segment. Starting on Slide 9. In the first quarter, Ag Services results improved 37% over last year. Merchandising and handling saw limited U.S. export competitiveness, more than offset by continued improvement in international merchandising, where we saw the benefit of our GTD, with merchandise volumes increasing. 
In transportation, we saw an increase in demand for northbound U.S. barge freight, which mostly offset the decrease in southbound demand. Milling and others results improved due to a strong margins for flour, grain and feed.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results declined in the quarter. In sweeteners and starches, our underlying North American business is doing well with higher margins and volumes in Q1. This was offset by lower contribution from core products, reduced equity earnings from joint ventures and startup costs related to the Tianjin sweetener facility. And in bioproducts, earnings were lower due to lower ethanol production volumes and weaker industry margins. Supply and demand imbalances challenged industry ethanol margins most of the quarter, though conditions and margins have been improving since late March. Let me explain our corn results a bit further.
We said before that we make decisions that will achieve the best overall results for ADM. This quarter, with low industry margins, we made the decision to run our ethanol operations for margins rather than volumes. That helped our earnings in bioproducts. It also had the effect of reducing our production of core products, which limited our earnings in sweeteners and starches. Bottom line, the impact for our overall corn business was positive.
Slide 11, please. The oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter. Crushing and origination had great performances in each region. In North America, the team demonstrated the value of our strong footprint and our effective destination supply chain. 8 to 10 months ago, they determined Q1 will see an extended North American export window. They got maintenance out of the way and positioned soybean supplies, so when the margins arrived, they were able to run hard until the seasonal shift to South America came.
In Europe, the team demonstrated the value of the swing capacity at our crush plants when soybean crush margins were more than double canola crush margins. We ran the plants hard and crushed a lot of beans. And in South America, the team prepared our network for a large, fast harvest. And when the strong dollar drove Brazilian farmers to sell their beans, we were ready to handle the growth and strong margins.
In refining, packaging, biodiesel and other, lower biodiesel margins in North America and weaker European demand limited results. South American biodiesel results improved with B7 implementation.
And in North America, our Stratas bottle oil joint venture generated strong results with good volumes. Results from Asia rose primarily on Wilmar's improved performance.
Slide 12, please. In their first reporting quarter, the WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit delivered a great start. As I mentioned earlier, the team has been working with a wide range of customers as they develop products using ingredients from all of ADM's business units. Globally, the Flavors business is off to a strong start for the year. 
On a constant currency basis, WILD EMEA business performed particularly well. This is a quarter in which demand is seasonally slower and results were limited by ForEx headwinds. We also had mark-to-market losses on currency hedges for future capital purchases for the specialty protein plant in Brazil. The project itself is benefiting from the weaker real versus the dollar. This is an exciting business with an energetic team, and they are off to an absolutely great start.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at the Investor Day in December. It lists the actions we are taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress in the quarter. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, we launched ARTCO Stevedoring, having a wide range of services to our ARTCO barge operation. With ADM's logistical expertise and global reach, we provide customers along the lower Mississippi a range of services that nobody else offers. As I mentioned, we saw the benefit of our GTD platform that we developed following the Toepfer acquisition. 
And today, we are announcing that we have agreed to acquire full ownership of our joint venture export complexes at Constanta, Romania, a Black Sea port at the mouth of the Danube. This acquisition builds on the investments we have made in our Danube River network since 2011 and further strengthens our origination and transportation capabilities in Eastern Europe. In corn, we sold our lactic acid business, exiting a business for which we didn't see a path to acceptable returns in a reasonable time frame. And we acquired the remainder of the Bulgarian and Turkish wet mills and expanded our stake in the Hungary plant, positioning ourselves well for when EU sugar production quotas are lifted.
We continue construction of our feed premix plant in Nanjing. And this morning, we are announcing plans to build the fourth seed plant in China in Zhangzhou as well as one in Minnesota. 
In oilseeds, we're working with Cargill and Olam on the divestures of our chocolate and cocoa businesses. We are targeting closing both in Q3, subject to final approvals and completion of transitional activities. We agreed to acquire an oil bottling business in Belgium. This acquisition will provide another demand stream for our oilseed processing operations, reducing our reliance on biodiesel and growing our packaged oil business. And as we mentioned on the last call, we're creating a joint venture to quadruple the size of our port in Northern Brazil, improving our ability to export from this increasingly productive region.
In WFSI, relating to the WILD acquisition, we remain on track to deliver EUR 100 million in synergies over the next 3 years, and we are on track for EUR 0.10 to EUR 0.15 accretion in 2015, although this will likely be in the lower end of the range due to the strong dollar. And we continue to advance our construction project in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U.S. And in the area of driving operational efficiencies, as I mentioned, we have identified more than $200 million in run rate savings towards our goal of $550 million in 5 years. As part of this effort, we launched a global improvement initiative involving colleagues across all regions and businesses in evaluating every aspects of our business for improvement opportunities. In the first quarter, we implemented project that will achieve about $60 million in annual run rate savings. We'll update you on our scorecard each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We continue to be excited about 2015. We came into the year with a lot of positive momentum, which we expect to continue through the year. Good early planting progress and long-term weather forecast suggest a good likelihood for excellent U.S. crops. A large harvest combined with big carryouts of corn, soybeans and wheat could give us opportunities for very good carries at the end of the year. Those, combined with expected solid global demand, point to very high utilization of our storage, transportation and processing assets in North America and Europe later this year.
U.S. gasoline consumption continues to improve. That will translate into stronger domestic demand for ethanol. These, combined with the strong exports, will keep our assets running hard, especially as we move through the summer driving season. Demand for sweeteners and flavors will benefit from the seasonal pickup in Northern Hemisphere beverage consumption. The WFSI team is off to a great start. They will continue to deliver synergies, and we are confident they will meet the 2015 accretion goals.
We're also excited by our customer engagements. Every business unit has been working with existing customers as well as new customers. We are collaborating across the organization more than ever before, working on new types of projects, delivering wins, improving margins. And the team will continue to deliver our clear and aggressive strategic plan, the plan that is already contributing to our bottom line, a plan that returned 9.5% this quarter, a plan that will continue to grow our EVA. 
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

And just sort of your -- based on the information that you have and your outlook, where do you see margins tracking and sort of maybe for the full year on average or exiting the year? Just a little bit more context about where you are now and where you see it going over the next quarter or 2."

If you think about it, April has been a relatively big month for shutdowns. As people saw some of the margins were relatively low in March, some people anticipated some of the seasonal shutdowns. So we've seen margins improving since the late part of March. We see this with optimism. We see demand in the U.S. growing due to low gasoline prices about 2% to 3% per year. That will put the industry around 138 billion, 140 billion gallons of gasoline, that and the increased export. We exported very well in Q1. If you look at January and February export estimates, they are annualized at around 1 billion gallon because we exported in those 2 months 152 million gallons. If you take the last week of April, that export annualized was around also in the 1 billion range. So we see export for the year between 800 million and maybe a little bit north of that for the year, plus maybe 13.8 billion to 14 billion gallons of domestic gasoline demand. We see very high capacity utilization, so we face this season with a lot of optimism in regards to ethanol."

That was not only providing low returns but a lot of volatility to our earnings, the way we were running it. Part of that was created by inefficiencies between the interface between Toepfer and ADM. Part of that, it was because of a blow to the structure, if you will, that was increasing our fixed cost. So what we brought -- when we bought the 20% of Toepfer, we brought -- we bought -- we brought both companies together, and we moved some of the people to a role to Geneva, and that allow us to, first of all, have a more concerted view of the market, more coordinated view of the market between the origination and the destination that Toepfer provided. We have better utilization of our infrastructure, our logistics and certainly, reduced the cost of the whole operation. So it's a more profitable operation, doesn't have that many fixed costs. So I think that overall, we improve the volumes because we have better coverage, but we also increase the margins out of that since we have lower costs. So I think the overall end-to-end supply chain that you hear me talking from origination to the destination market, that's what the GTD has brought to us, and we should continue to see improvements into this. And you see this is a very true reflection. Ag Services with North America not being able to export that much because of the strong dollar still grew earnings 37% year-over-year, which is a significant improvement.

We posted an increase in profitability in the underlying business in sweeteners and starches, driven by good volumes and product margins. It was offset by part of this lack of co-product credits because of the decisions we made to run ethanol for margins and also decreased earnings from the joint ventures and the onetimes from the Tianjin and startup costs. Think about the Tianjin plant. We have a full plant, a full world-scale plant waiting to get approval. So you have all the fixed costs and some of the variable costs, and we're making products with no revenue, no cash flow from that plant. So that's impacting the business. But I would say from -- I agree with you. Margins for spot business are a little bit tighter and a little bit higher. And we have a combination of contracts, contracts that were done before the announcement of some of the shutdowns that were done at previous years' margin on some businesses that were performed after that, which are at better numbers. But we expect the profitability of sweeteners and starches from now on to improve as some of these one-off will be eliminated."

Adjusted ROIC of 9.5% was 290 basis points above our cost of capital. 
In the first quarter, the ADM team demonstrated their ability to leverage the strength of our diversified business model. The oilseeds team capitalized on favorable market conditions and delivered outstanding results with strong performances in each region.
In Ag Services, our recently created global trade desk or GTD platform drove higher merchandise volumes. Our new WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business was off to a great start towards achieving the cost and revenue synergies we identified last year. Together, these performances helped deliver a good quarter overall, even as lower industry ethanol margins limited earnings in corn and the strong dollar limited U.S. grain exports.
We have continued to advance the strategic plan we shared at our December Investor Day. In the area of optimizing the core, we announced the acquisition of a Belgian oil bottling business, helping us reach a wider customer base and creating a new output for our European crushing assets. And the WFSI team has been working with customers as they develop and launch new products using SCI, WILD and ADM ingredients. We had more than 200 joint customer engagements, building a pipeline of more than 400 projects, resulting already in more than 30 revenue synergy wins across a number of regions and business units in Q1 alone.
In the area of driving operational efficiencies, we have already identified more than $200 million in run rate savings opportunities toward our goal of $550 million in 5 years. And in the area of strategic expansion, the Corn Processing business expanded in high-growth geographies with the acquisition of the remaining stake of corn wet mills in Bulgaria and Turkey and an increased stake in a facility in Hungary.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.77, up 40% from the $0.55 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $883 million, up $94 million.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 29% compared to 27% in the first quarter of the prior year. For calendar year 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range. Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 9.5% improved from the 9.0% at the end of the fourth quarter and also significantly improved by 250 basis points from the 7.0% at the end of the first quarter last year. The 9.5% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 as well as our long-term WACC of 8.0%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC. 
In the first quarter, our trailing 4-quarter average economic value added or EVA was $742 million based upon adjusted earnings and the annual WACC, up $581 million from 2014. On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.77 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share. For this quarter, LIFO represented a $2 million pretax credit or less than $0.01 per share after tax. There are no other adjustments for the quarter.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items that impacted our quarterly results. 
Corn Processing adjusted operating profit of $127 million excludes approximately $14 million hedge ineffectiveness charges, split relatively evenly amongst bioproducts and sweeteners and starches. In oilseeds, adjusted operating profit of $483 million excludes approximately $14 million of cocoa hedge timing effects in this quarter. As a reminder, we'll also continue to have our cocoa and chocolate businesses as part of our segment reporting results in oilseeds until we have closed on the sales some time later in 2015. They are not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements due to the lack of materiality of the operations to our overall results. 
Our new fourth business segment, WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients or WFSI for short is reported at its own segment for the first time this quarter. The segment includes the 2 businesses we acquired in 2014, WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. or SCI as well as certain specialty ingredients businesses that were previously reported in ADM's 3 other segments. For purposes of comparison to prior results, the year-ago quarter segment operating profit for Ag Services, corn and oilseeds removed the earnings of the businesses now reported in the WFSI segment. To assist with your analysis, we've included a chart in the appendix that recasts 2014 segment quarterly results to the new segments.
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs were due to -- or higher due to increased GAAP pension expenses relating to changes in discount rates and mortality tables and increased investments in our ERP program as well as very strategic projects and M&A and divestment activities.
In addition, I want to point out that the strong U.S. dollar and weakness in other currencies such as the euro and the Brazilian real did not have a material impact on ADM's overall first quarter net earnings. On one hand, the strong U.S. dollar did have a negative impact on the competitiveness of our U.S. export programs. And our WFSI segment also had some negative impacts in terms of export competitiveness and earnings translation from euro. On the other hand, the weaker euro and real had a positive impact on our fixed costs around the world relative to the revenue streams we're receiving. Also, the weaker real motivated Brazilian farmers to sell, thereby, benefiting our origination business in Brazil. So on balance, with the puts and the takes, the net impact was not material. Going forward, we do not expect the currency impact to have a material impact on our overall results for the rest of the year.
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $17.5 billion, down from last year's $20.7 billion. The significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues. But this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower. So the key for us is management spread between the revenues and cost of goods sold, which is a core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing ADM. I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements in the prior year do not include the revenues and the costs of WILD and SCI, which transaction closed in the fourth quarter of last year.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6, which shows the cash flows for the 3 months ending March 31, 2015 compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $577 million from operations before working capital changes in the quarter, significantly higher than Q1 last year. Total capital spending for the quarter was $244 million, up from the prior year. For 2015, we are estimating capital spending in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. This range is higher than our $0.9 billion spending in 2014, which you may recall, we reduced after the WILD acquisition to assess capital spend avoidance opportunities. As a result, some 2014 spending shifted into 2015. We also have some additional spending for our ERP program and cost reduction projects as well as the ramp-up of our specialty protein project spending in Brazil, our Fibersol projects in China and the U.S., our lecithin projects in Germany and India.
During the quarter, we spent $566 million to repurchase about 12 million shares towards our 2015 target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion of share repurchases, subject to strategic capital requirements. Our average share count was 639 million diluted shares outstanding, down approximately 24 million from the 663 million at the same time one year ago. Our total return of capital to shareholders for the quarter, including dividends, was over $700 million.
Our first quarter cash flows are consistent with our 2015 calendar year targets of capital allocations, namely CapEx of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, approximately $700 million of dividends and $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases. And all this is consistent with the balanced capital allocation framework we set forth at our December Investor Day.
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31 for both 2015 and 2014, which remains very strong. Our operating working capital of $8.1 billion was down $3.4 billion from the year-ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $1.6 billion related to lower inventory prices, including the translation impact; about $1.4 billion related to lower inventory quantities; and a decrease of about $0.4 billion in other working capital primarily related to the reclassification of working capital for global cocoa and chocolate businesses under the held-for-sale accounting.
Total debt was about $6.4 billion, resulting in net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $5.1 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $4.1 billion, in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash flows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI.
Our shareholders' equity of $18.8 billion is $1.3 billion lower than the level last year, with a cumulative translation account impact about $1.6 billion lower due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.7 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. If you add available cash, we have access to some billion dollars of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance. Juan?"

Let's turn to Slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $883 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. This 12% year-over-year increase in underlying segment operating profit demonstrates the strength of our diversified business",1517,"Thanks, Ray. Let's turn to Slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $883 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. This 12% year-over-year increase in underlying segment operating profit demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model and the team's ability to leverage that model.
In the first quarter, the team capitalized on great opportunities while they continued to advance our strategic plan. Sequentially, of course, the quarter follows a very strong fourth quarter, and with normal seasonality, underlying segment operating profits decreased.
Now I will review the performance of each segment. Starting on Slide 9. In the first quarter, Ag Services results improved 37% over last year. Merchandising and handling saw limited U.S. export competitiveness, more than offset by continued improvement in international merchandising, where we saw the benefit of our GTD, with merchandise volumes increasing. 
In transportation, we saw an increase in demand for northbound U.S. barge freight, which mostly offset the decrease in southbound demand. Milling and others results improved due to a strong margins for flour, grain and feed.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results declined in the quarter. In sweeteners and starches, our underlying North American business is doing well with higher margins and volumes in Q1. This was offset by lower contribution from core products, reduced equity earnings from joint ventures and startup costs related to the Tianjin sweetener facility. And in bioproducts, earnings were lower due to lower ethanol production volumes and weaker industry margins. Supply and demand imbalances challenged industry ethanol margins most of the quarter, though conditions and margins have been improving since late March. Let me explain our corn results a bit further.
We said before that we make decisions that will achieve the best overall results for ADM. This quarter, with low industry margins, we made the decision to run our ethanol operations for margins rather than volumes. That helped our earnings in bioproducts. It also had the effect of reducing our production of core products, which limited our earnings in sweeteners and starches. Bottom line, the impact to our overall corn business was positive.
Slide 11, please. The oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter. Crushing and origination had great performances in each region. In North America, the team demonstrated the value of our strong footprint and our effective destination supply chain. 8 to 10 months ago, they determined Q1 will see an extended North American export window. They got maintenance out of the way and positioned soybean supplies, so when the margins arrived, they were able to run hard until the seasonal shift to South America came.
In Europe, the team demonstrated the value of the swing capacity at our crush plants when soybean crush margins were more than double canola crush margins. We ran the plants hard and crushed a lot of beans. And in South America, the team prepared our network for a large, fat harvest. And when the strong dollar drove Brazilian farmers to sell their beans, we were ready to handle the growth and strong margins.
In refining, packaging, biodiesel and other, lower biodiesel margins in North America and weaker European demand limited results. South American biodiesel results improved with B7 implementation.
And in North America, our Stratas bottle oil joint venture generated strong results with good volumes. Results from Asia rose primarily on Wilmar's improved performance.
Slide 12, please. In their first reporting quarter, the WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit delivered a great start. As I mentioned earlier, the team has been working with a wide range of customers as they develop products using ingredients from all of ADM's business units. Globally, the Flavors business is off to a strong start for the year. 
On a constant currency basis, WILD EMEA business performed particularly well. This is a quarter in which demand is seasonally slower and results were limited by ForEx headwinds. We also had mark-to-market losses on currency hedges for future capital purchases for the specialty protein plant in Brazil. The project itself is benefiting from the weaker real versus the dollar. This is an exciting business with an energetic team, and they are off to an absolutely great start.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at the Investor Day in December. It lists the actions we are taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress in the quarter. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, we launched ARTCO Stevedoring, having a wide range of services to our ARTCO barge operation. With ADM's logistical expertise and global reach, we provide customers along the lower Mississippi a range of services that nobody else offers. As I mentioned, we saw the benefit of our GTD platform that we developed following the Toepfer acquisition. 
And today, we are announcing that we have agreed to acquire full ownership of our joint venture port [pg] complexes at Constanta, Romania, a Black Sea port at the mouth of the Danube. This acquisition builds on the investments we have made in our Danube River network since 2011 and further strengthens our origination and transportation capabilities in Eastern Europe. In corn, we sold our lactic acid business, exiting a business for which we didn't see a path to acceptable returns in a reasonable time frame. And we acquired the remainder of the Bulgarian and Turkish wet mills and expanded our stake in the Hungary plant, positioning ourselves well for when EU sugar production quotas are lifted.
We continue construction of our feed premix plant in Nanjing. And this morning, we are announcing plans to build the fourth seed plant in China in Zhangzhou as well as one in Minnesota. 
In oilseeds, we're working with Cargill and Olam on the divestures of our chocolate and cocoa businesses. We are targeting closing both in Q3, subject to final approvals and completion of transitional activities. We agreed to acquire an oil bottling business in Belgium. This acquisition will provide another demand stream for our oilseed processing operations, reducing our reliance on biodiesel and growing our packaged oil business. And as we mentioned on the last call, we're creating a joint venture to quadruple the size of our port in Northern Brazil, improving our ability to export from this increasingly productive region.
In WFSI, relating to the WILD acquisition, we remain on track to deliver EUR 100 million in synergies over the next 3 years, and we are on track for EUR 0.10 to EUR 0.15 accretion in 2015, although this will likely be in the lower end of the range due to the strong dollar. And we continue to advance our construction project in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U.S. And in the area of driving operational efficiencies, as I mentioned, we have identified more than $200 million in run rate savings towards our goal of $550 million in 5 years. As part of this effort, we launched a global improvement initiative involving colleagues across all regions and businesses in evaluating every aspects of our business for improvement opportunities. In the first quarter, we implemented project that will achieve about $60 million in annual run rate savings. We'll update you on our scorecard each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We continue to be excited about 2015. We came into the year with a lot of positive momentum, which we expect to continue through the year. Good early planting progress and long-term weather forecast suggest a good likelihood for excellent U.S. crops. A large harvest combined with big carryouts of corn, soybeans and wheat could give us opportunities for very good carries at the end of the year. Those, combined with expected solid global demand, point to very high utilization of our storage, transportation and processing assets in North America and Europe later this year.
U.S. gasoline consumption continues to improve. That will translate into stronger domestic demand for ethanol. These, combined with the strong exports, will keep our assets running hard, especially as we move through the summer driving season. Demand for sweeteners and flavors will benefit from the seasonal pickup in Northern Hemisphere beverage consumption. The WFSI team is off to a great start. They will continue to deliver synergies, and we are confident they will meet the 2015 accretion goals.
We're also excited by our customer engagements. Every business unit has been working with existing customers as well as new customers. We are collaborating across the organization more than ever before, working on new types of projects, delivering wins, improving margins. And the team will continue to deliver our clear and aggressive strategic plan, the plan that is already contributing to our bottom line, a plan that returned 9.5% this quarter, a plan that will continue to grow our EVA. 
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

If you think about it, April has been a relatively big month for shutdowns. As people saw some of the margins were relatively low in March, some people anticipated some of the seasonal shutdowns. So we've seen margins improving since the late part of March. We see this with optimism. We see demand in the U.S. growing due to low gasoline prices about 2% to 3% per year. That will put the industry around 138 billion, 140 billion gallons of gasoline, that and the increased export. We exported very well in Q1. If you look at January and February export estimates, they are annualized at around 1 billion gallon because we exported in those 2 months 152 million gallons. If you take the last week of April, that export annualized was around also in the 1 billion range. So we see export for the year between 800 million and maybe a little bit north of that for the year, plus maybe 13.8 billion to 14 billion gallons of domestic gasoline demand. We see very high capacity utilization, so we face this season with a lot of optimism in regards to ethanol."

I mean, at some point, do you start to see strong U.S. dollar, weak oil pricing having any kind of an impact on U.S. exports of ethanol?"

So we haven't seen, even with all the strength of the dollar, any reduction in our exports of ethanol. So at this point in time, we continue to look at 800 million gallons this year. I just was reflecting on the numbers that were posted on the January and February exports, and that happens to be annualized to 1 billion. We continue to be somewhere in that range. Obviously, we look at -- we continue to look at new markets. And there are several mandates around the world that are being implemented, and there is like more than 3 billion gallons of MTBE that needs to be replaced. So we are optimistic about that.

That was not only providing low returns but a lot of volatility to our earnings, the way we were running it. Part of that was created by inefficiencies between the interface between Toepfer and ADM. Part of that, it was because of a blow to the structure, if you will, that was increasing our fixed cost. So what we brought -- when we bought the 20% of Toepfer, we brought -- we bought -- we brought both companies together, and we moved some of the people to a role to Geneva, and that allows us to, first of all, have a more concerted view of the market, more coordinated view of the market between the origination and the destination that Toepfer provided. We have better utilization of our infrastructure, our logistics and certainly, reduced the cost of the whole operation. So it's a more profitable operation, doesn't have that many fixed costs. So I think that overall, we improve the volumes because we have better coverage, but we also increase the margins out of that since we have lower costs. So I think the overall end-to-end supply chain that you hear me talking from origination to the destination market, that's what the GTD has brought to us, and we should continue to see improvements into this. And you see this is a very true reflection. Ag Services with North America not being able to export that much because of the strong dollar still grew earnings 37% year-over-year, which is a significant improvement.

We couldn't export a lot from North America from a grain perspective, so our earnings from grain was subdued. Certainly, we didn't have any margins in ethanol. So I don't think that this was a spectacular quarter from what the market could give us. I think that given what the market could give us, the team executed very, very well. And we continue to be excited about the implementation of our strategic blueprint, our strategic plan. That continues to bring strength because it comes from improving our operations, from having better facilities, from divesting things that we don't like. I announced today we divested the lactic acid business. I mean, it's not a significant thing, but it continues to show the commitment of management that they are no sacred cows here. Everybody needs to forecast -- needs to present a credible forecast for returns to be part of the integrated business. And I think we continue to be excited about the strength of our plan and the way our company is executing with very good consistency, I would say. So I think there is upside from here, Ken. That will be my summary."

We posted an increase in profitability in the underlying business in sweeteners and starches, driven by good volumes and product margins. It was offset by part of this lack of co-product credits because of the decisions we made to run ethanol for margins and also decrease earnings from the joint ventures and the onetimes from the Tianjin and startup costs. Think about the Tianjin plant. We have a full plant, a full world-scale plant waiting to get approval. So you have all the fixed costs and some of the variable costs, and we're making products with no revenue, no cash flow from that plant. So that's impacting the business. But I would say from -- I agree with you. Margins for spot business are a little bit tighter and a little bit higher. And we have a combination of contracts, contracts that were done before the announcement of some of the shutdowns that were done at previous years' margin on some businesses that were performed after that, which are at better numbers.

This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.60. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $724 million. Adjusted ROIC of 9% was 240 basis points above our cost of capital.
Our second quarter results demonstrate the strength and value of our geographic and business portfolio diversity. In corn, domestic and export demand for ethanol was robust, but record industry production limited margins. This was partially offset by strong results from our corn sweeteners and starches business.
In Oilseeds, good meal demand supported strong North America soybean crushing results. And South American origination and export volumes were up, leading to good throughput at our expanded origination and port network. These, combined with the flexibility of our global crush plants, helped the Oilseeds team deliver another strong performance.
The WILD Flavors and specialty ingredients team had an excellent quarter and continues to make great progress toward achieving the targeted costs and revenue synergies.
Our services earnings were impacted by lower margins and volumes of North American exports, as they were less competitive globally and by a sharp upward movement in commodity prices at the end of the quarter. But within our Ag Services segment, the milling business had record second quarter results.
We continue to advance our strategic plan as improving our ROIC and growing our EVA. Among numerous other actions, we closed the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill, we closed the Barcarena port transaction with Glencore in June and we remain on track to close both our E starch transaction and the sale of our global Cocoa business later this year.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, down from the strong $0.79 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $724 million. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27% compared to 28% in the second quarter of the prior year. Our trailing 4-quarter average ROIC of 9% significantly improved by 120 basis points from the 7.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. The 9% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 as well as our long-term WACC of 8%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 9 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.
In the second quarter, our trailing 4-quarter average EVA was $610 million based upon adjusted earnings and the annual WACC up $238 million from the second quarter of 2014. 
On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.60 per share. For this quarter, LIFO represented a $0.06 per share after-tax charge. We had some gains on sales or revaluations of assets, primarily related to our Northeast Brazil court and the Romanian court totaling $0.11 per share. We also had some impairment charges totaling $0.04 per share. 
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results.
We had some gains and some charges in ag services corn and Oilseeds segments I mentioned in the last chart and are highlighted in our press release. As a reminder, our Cocoa and chocolate business remain part of our segment reporting results in oilseeds until we have closed on the sales, and they're not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements.
Our new fourth business segment, WILD Flavors and specialty ingredients, or WFSI for short, is reported as own segment for the second time this quarter. This segment includes the 2 businesses we acquired in 2014, WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. as well as certain specialty ingredients businesses that was previously reported in ADM's 3 other segments.
For purposes of comparison to prior results, the year-ago quarter's segment operating profit for Ag Services, corn and oilseeds removed the earnings of the businesses that are now reported in the WFSI segment. To assist you with your analysis, we've included a chart in the appendix that recasts 2014 segment quarter results to the new segments.
In the corporate line, net interest expense was about flat, unallocated corporate expenses were $19 million higher due to: one, increased GAAP pension expenses relating to the changes in discount rates and mortality tables; second, increased spending in IT and in our ERP project; third, investments related to strategic business improving projects; and lastly, unique costs related to specific divestiture activities, including the [indiscernible] in Cocoa. We're starting to see some of the benefits of some of the strategic business improvement projects in our results.
Excluding these factors, our run rate in underlying corporate costs are consistent with the prior year, and you should expect our run rate the next few quarters to be between $110 million to $120 million per quarter.
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $17.2 billion, down from last year's $21.5 billion. The significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues, but this decline also impacts our consequence sold as our input costs are lower. So the key is managing the spread between the revenues and cost of goods sold, which is core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing us. 
I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements in the prior year do not include the revenues and the costs of WILD and SCI, whose transactions closed in the fourth quarter of last year.
Now turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for the 6 months ending June 30, 2015, compared to the same period the prior year. We generate $1.2 billion from operations before working capital changes in the 6 months, slightly higher than the prior year. Total capital spending for the 6 months was $540 million, up from the prior year but consistent with our guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the calendar year. During the 6 months, we spent $1.2 billion to repurchase about 24 million shares towards our 2015 target of repurchasing $1.5 billion to $2 billion of shares, subject to strategic capital requirements. Our average share count for the first 6 months was 633 million diluted shares outstanding, down 28 million from the 661 million at this time 1 year ago. At the end of the second quarter, we had 621 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. For the first half, our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was over $1.5 billion.
Our 6 months cash flows are consistent with our 2015 calendar year targets of capital allocations, namely CapEx of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, approximately $700 million of dividends and $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases. We have been more aggressive in the pace of stock buybacks, taking advantage of the recent weakness in our stock price, and all this is consistent with the balanced capital allocation framework we set forth at our December Investor Day.
Slide 7 highlights our balance sheet as of June 30 for 2015 and 2014. Our balance sheet remains strong. Operating working capital of $8.3 billion was down $2.7 billion from the year-ago period. This decrease was comprised about $2.1 billion related to lower inventory prices, including the translation impact, partially offset about [ph] $0.9 billion related to higher inventory quantities and a decrease of about $1.5 billion in other working capital, primarily related to reclassification of working capital for our global [indiscernible] businesses under a held-for-sale accounting.
Total debt was about $6.9 billion resulting in net debt balance that is debt less cash of $5.7 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $3.6 billion, in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash outflows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI.
In addition, we raised EUR 1.1 billion in June in the euro debt markets to take advantage of low interest rates and to serve as the net investment hedge for are grown euro asset base following the WILD acquisition. We had paid down $0.8 billion of notional debt in July in a U.S. debt tender settlement, and we may pay out an additional $0.2 billion before the end of the third quarter.
While we will take a pretax charge slightly about $0.2 billion in the third quarter related to debt tender premium, we expect going forward our ongoing annual interest expense to be lower by about $40 million pretax or $0.04 per share after tax through the combination of the U S debt reductions and the euro debt issuances. This U.S. debt tender, euro debt issuance transaction had a very positive NPV benefit for ADM.
Our shareholders' equity of $18.6 billion is $1.7 billion lower than the level last year, with a cumulative translation account down about $0.5 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.9 billion available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance. Juan?"

In the second quarter, we earned $724 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. Our ROIC of 9% was up 120 basis points over last year's second quarter; and EVA was up $238 million, an increase of more than 60% from last year.
First of operating profits were similar to the same period last year despite the decline of more than $200 million in operating profits from the ethanol business. This results demonstrate the power of our business.
Now I will review the performance with each segment. Starting on Slide 9. In the second quarter, our services results declined from last year. Merchandising and handling results reflected a more significant seasonal decline in North American export volumes and margins, while global demand was met by increased South American exports that improved our overall 6 months results. We also saw lower global trade desk margins, as the June 30th USDA report drove an increase in prices of some commodities, which negatively impacted some merchandising positions. While we had this impact at the end of Q2, markets came back a few days after the report.
In transportation, we saw lower total U.S. freight volumes and high water increased our costs. Milling and other results increased due to improvements in product margins, mix and a strong merchandising results. A great quarter for our global milling operations, record second quarter results there.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results improved sequentially and declined year-over-year. In sweeteners and starches, overall volumes were up about 3% year-over-year. The tight supply chain from North American sweeteners supported very good margins and volumes. We also saw good demand for livestock feed, and our Mexican joint venture in Mexico and our Eaststarch joint venture in Europe both delivered solid results.
And in bioproducts, ethanol earnings were lower. As I mentioned earlier, demand was robust, with increased exports and record U.S. driving miles, but margins were limited as the industry ran at record volumes. Our ethanol profitability improved from the first quarter, with second quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon.
Now looking forward, on the demand side, we see continued strong domestic and export demand for ethanol. Driving miles are up more than 3%, which will help domestic ethanol consumption approach 14 billion gallons in 2015. We see annualized net exports running at about 800 million gallons. We expect continued growth of exports to markets that currently use MTVE, and E15 adoption continues to grow, which will also bolster demand long term.
On the supply side  industry production levels will be a function of many factors, including maintenance timing, yields, hot weather, planned and unplanned downtime and the face of industry capacity creep. 
In terms of what we are doing, we're strengthening our efforts to expand E15 adoption in the U.S. and ethanol adoption in markets abroad. We are also investing to further improve ADM's cost position in this business. ADM has invested a lot of effort to drive operational excellence and cost reductions in our mills, which represent about 1.1 billion gallons of nameplate capacity, and that has translated into strong financial results from these facilities, even in challenging environments.
We believe there are still opportunities to improve the cost positions of our large dry mills, which represent about 600 million gallons of nameplate capacity. We're intensifying efforts across a range of areas to drive these cost improvements. 
In summary, we continue to believe there is an important place for ethanol in the global fuel supply, and we expect that our actions will help drive improved results from this business in the near term.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds have another consistent solid quarter similar to last year. In crushing and origination, large global bean supplies and a strong U.S. mill demand drove great global soy crush results.
In the first half of 2015, we crushed record volumes of soybeans globally. As part of our strategic plan for oilseeds, we've added switch capacity to more of our North American crush plants, and we've profited from our global switch capacity in a weak exhausted margin environment this quarter. 
As I mentioned earlier, our South American origination and port operations, including our Barcarena port, had good throughput at the region's large corn and soy harvest proved the world's most competitive supply. In fact, ADM South American export volumes were up 38% compared to last year's second quarter.
On the soft seed side, concerns about seed supply significantly reduced margin volumes and -- margins and volumes. We're finding packaging by another results declined, mainly on the absence of biodiesel blenders credits we recorded last year. 
In Europe and South America, margins were challenged by regional market conditions. In North America, we saw strong refining margins, and our Stratus joint venture delivered its best quarter yet. Stratus continues to be an industry leader in working with customers to manage the transition away from trans fat.
Results from Asia rose primarily and will help improve performance.
Slide 12, please. In their second reporting quarter, the WILD Flavors and specialty ingredient business unit delivered more than $100 million in earnings, an excellent performance. WILD Flavors had strong results in North America. To provide some context, it's worth noting that in 2014, North America represented slightly more than half of the profits for WILD Flavors globally. And despite microeconomic headwinds, flavor profit in Europe were in line with our plan. And this quarter was one of the best ever for our specialty proteins business. Among other highlights, the customer launched the first refill product with our customized inclusions.
The WFSI business, with products ranging from proteins, specialties to ancient grains to natural flavors, is a key component in ADM's efforts to serve customers with on products to grow their business.
As I mentioned earlier, WFSI team continued working across all ADM businesses to fuel synergy efforts. In terms of revenue synergies, they continue to grow the pipeline and customer base. In the quarter, they added 175 prospects to the pipeline, bringing the total to nearly 600. In the quarter, they worked across all ADM's business units to deliver more than 50 more revenue synergy wins. 
One interesting note here, the SCI team and their customer relationships can prove to be a valuable engine for driving cross-business collaboration nd delivering this wins. So, so far this year, the WFSI team has implemented $24 million in annualized run rate cost synergies. That's more than halfway toward the 3-year target.
We remain confident that the team will deliver EUR 100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of year 3, which is 2017. I will still expect the WILD business to deliver $0.10 to $0.15 earning accretion in the first full year of operations, despite some ForEx headwinds.
Now on Slide 13, I would like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at Investor Day in December. It lists the actions we are taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few. 
In Ag Services, we expanded our farmer services offering with an investment in Agregol, a leader in on-farm analytical and forecasting tools. We announced the expansion of our port at Port Martini in Argentina, enhancing our export capability from the region. And our port services JV acquired a Brazilian port and shipping agency.
In corn, we are on track to close the EasStar acquisition in the second half of the year. We contributed our liquid feed business into a joint venture to achieve greater scale without additional capital intensity. And in May, we announced an agreement to acquire the small sweetener manufacture in Central China, but unfortunately, that transaction fell through.
In oilseeds, we closed the sale of a 50% stake in our Barcarena port to Glencore. We closed the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill, and we remain on track to close the global sale to [indiscernible] by the end of the year.
And in WFSI, we acquired a 3-knot [ph] then seed processing facility in California, adding processing to support strong sales growth. We remain on track to deliver synergy and accretion targets, and we continue to advance our construction projects in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U S. 
And with respect to our operational excellence initiatives, I talked about our objective of delivering $550 million of run rate savings by the end of year 5. By the end of the second quarter, we have realized already about $125 million of this run rate savings. We'll update you on our scorecard each quarter, and overtime, you should expect to see the results of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We continue to feel good about 2015. The large U.S. harvest should help drive utilization of our storage and transportation assets in the U.S. The large global corn crops, the tight North America and sweeteners balance sheet and continued global sweetener demand should support margins and volumes in our sweeteners and starches business.
As I mentioned earlier, in ethanol, in the near and medium term, we expect demand, both domestic and export, to remain very strong. Production levels should also be robust and industry margins should evolve based on the supply/demand balance as we move through the year. We're intensifying our work on the cost position of our dry mills. Over the medium term, ethanol remains the cheapest octane enhancer in the world, and we're going to work domestic and international demand.
Good global demand for mills should continue to support capacity utilization of our global soybean processing assets. And the WFSI team is well on track to work their cost and revenue synergy targets for 2015. We continue to see great collaboration across all of ADM's business units as we partner to serve a growing customer base.
Overall, we continue to advance our clear and aggressive strategic plan. We'll continue to see contributions from that effort throughout the year and would remain focused on growing EVA.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

South American margins continued to be solid. European margins are -- were very solid in soybeans in second quarter. We took advantage again of our swing capacity, and we matched that -- the soybean capacity in Europe. We're seeing now a little bit more softness at more North American -- South Americans soybean meal is arriving. And in China, we saw some recovery of that. It's not where it used to be at the beginning of the year, but it's much better than last year. So overall, we see a strong continued demand, and we foresee good crushing margins for the rest of the year."

So we expect a very strong second half. We expect the U.S. to become more competitive in export. We haven't been so far, but we expect that demand to come to our elevator very fast and be able to increase elevation margins towards the end of the year.

From a demand perspective, we continue to feel very good about ethanol. As I said before, domestic demand with low gasoline prices has increased 3%, and that pattern should continue with a normal seasonality we're doing summer and winter in the U S. Export demand continues to be very solid in those countries that are already customers. And we have many, many new countries trying to become new customers, and our team are out there trying to develop those markets. So the issue will become in this relatively new industry, what happened with the supply. And the supply has been strong during -- so far during this year, because we have a very mild start of the summer from a temperature perspective. We expect that right now, we've seen that even in June, in July. Over the last 3 weeks, inventory had been flat or slightly declining for the last 2 or 3 weeks, so the industry can produce that 15 million gallon, but not more [indiscernible] for a very few weeks. And then I would say, it's relatively balanced what do we see right now in ethanol. And even at this oil prices, we are making money in our -- in all our mills. And if you think about the [indiscernible] values, NPV continues to be at about $2.85 versus in ethanol of $1.50, $1.60. And the other [indiscernible] at about $2.50. So we continue to be the most competitive octane enhancer out there. So without even thinking about E15 growing in the background. So I think overall, I cannot call it through the month or through the quarter, because as I said, this is a relatively volatile industry as we grow into our capacity. But I think medium term, we're very optimistic about the balance to turn it to the favor of ethanol."

And the price corrected like by July 2nd or 3rd, they [indiscernible] to, so part of that has already come back in those positions. Regarding second half, I think maybe the export season will start a little bit later this year for the U.S. as North America -- South America continue to extend their window a little bit. But we believe that, that demand outcome to the U.S. and will come all of a sudden, altogether, so that will bode well for elevation margins. We think that are transportation business also will be very strong, and we need to move a very large crop. I think that we're going to see the comeback of the normal carries that we see in the U.S. So we believe that a very strong growth and very big area routes pose very well for our footprint in North America. So I think it's going to be heavy fourth quarter loaded, and I cannot call it whether it all start in fourth quarter or slip a little bit into Q1, but we are prepared to manage a very large crop."

Consider this, and I think we said it before, Kordell, that out there, at least 6 billion gallons of MTBE capacity that we're working very hard to replace, and these products again ethanol is the most sustainable and the lowest-cost octane enhancer. So I like to be positioned in a product that is there sustainable and lower costs than their alternatives. So there is a big market out there, and we were going through ups and downs through all these regulations. Again, I said it before, its relatively new industry, an industry that started in 2007 and is to go through phases of consolidation. We're going to have great capacity. Some producers will become better producers, more cost efficient, then will push some of the marginal producers into more trouble worker. That will, to a certain degree, modify the industry.

And with these kind of crops, we had the potential to do so. So I would say this businesses are on par or ahead of last year. WFSI is having very good performance. We'll keep within the range, so that's an addition of last year and then we're having sweeteners and starches that are going very, very strongly, and it need to offset the weakness in it ethanol.

So the second quarter is slightly higher from a seasonal perspective than Q3, if you will. Margins continued to be very strong in the high teens EBITDA margins for this business. The ingredients growth that we continue to see are in the range of 3% to 5%. And when you take natural products, natural flavors products are more in the 5% to 6% range. We feel very excited about the reaction of our customers have had to our product mix into the segments, and we've been expanding the customer base to make our business even much robust. Just to give you some example, the number of customers driving 80% of sales have increased by 47%, which showed the robustness of our pipeline going foreword and as I so in my prepared remarks, the pipeline of new wins or projects that the customer -- that composer revenue synergy portfolio have had a quantum leap of 75% from Q1 to Q2. So all the prospects, all the products are on trends. Those trends are strong, and customers are reacting very well to innovating with us, so we feel very good about."

This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.60. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $724 million. Adjusted ROIC of 9% was 240 basis points above our cost of capital.
Our second quarter results demonstrate the strength and value of our geographic and business portfolio diversity. In Corn, domestic and export demand for ethanol was robust, but record industry production limited margins. This was partially offset by strong results from our corn sweeteners and starches business.
In Oilseeds, good meal demand supported strong North American soybean crushing results. And South American origination and export volumes were up, leading to good throughput at our expanded origination and port network. These, combined with the flexibility of our global crush plants, helped the Oilseeds team deliver another strong performance.
The WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients team had an excellent quarter and continues to make great progress toward achieving their targeted costs and revenue synergies.
Ag Services earnings were impacted by lower margins and volumes of North American exports as they were less competitive globally and by a sharp upward move in commodity prices at the end of the quarter. But within our Ag Services segment, the milling business had record second quarter results.
We've continued to advance our strategic plan that's improving our ROIC and growing our EVA. Among numerous other actions, we closed the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill, we closed the Barcarena port transaction with Glencore in June and we remain on track to close both our Eaststarch transaction and the sale of our global cocoa business later this year. And we're making great progress on our operational excellence initiatives. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard activities later in the call.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, down from the strong $0.79 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $724 million. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27% compared to 28% in the second quarter of the prior year. Our trailing 4-quarter average ROIC of 9% significantly improved by 120 basis points from the 7.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. The 9% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 as well as our long-term WACC of 8%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 9 in the appendix. 
Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.
In the second quarter, our trailing 4-quarter average EVA was $610 million based upon adjusted earnings and annual WACC up $238 million from the second quarter of 2014. 
On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.60 per share. For this quarter, LIFO represented a $0.06 per share after-tax charge. We had some gains on sales or revaluations of assets, primarily related to our Northeast Brazil port and the Romanian port totaling $0.11 per share. We also had some impairment charges totaling $0.04 per share. 
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results.
We had some gains and some charges in Ag Services, Corn and Oilseeds segments that I mentioned in the last chart and are highlighted in our press release. 
As a reminder, our cocoa and chocolate business remain part of our segment reporting results in Oilseeds until we have closed on the sales and they are not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements.
Our new fourth business segment, WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, is reported as its own segment for the second time this quarter. This segment includes the 2 businesses we acquired in 2014, WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. as well as certain Specialty Ingredients businesses that were previously reported in ADM's 3 other segments.
For purposes of comparison to prior results, the year ago quarter's segment operating profit for Ag Services, Corn and Oilseeds removed the earnings of the businesses that are now reported in the WFSI segment. To assist you with your analysis, we've included a chart in the appendix that recasts 2014 segment quarter results to the new segments.
In the corporate line, net interest expense was about flat. Unallocated corporate expenses were $19 million higher due to: one, increased GAAP pension expenses relating to the changes in discount rates and mortality tables; second, increased spending in IT and in our ERP project; third, investments related to strategic business improving projects; and lastly, unique costs related to specific divestiture activities including the chocolate and cocoa. We're starting to see some of the benefits of some of the strategic business improvement projects in our results.
Excluding these factors, our run rate in underlying corporate costs are consistent with the prior year and you should expect our run rate for the next few quarters to be between $110 million to $120 million per quarter.
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $17.2 billion, down from last year's $21.5 billion. The significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues, but this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower. So the key is managing the spread between the revenues and the cost of goods sold, which is core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing us. 
I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements in the prior year do not include the revenues and the costs of WILD and SCI whose transactions closed in the fourth quarter of last year.
Now turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for the 6 months ending June 30, 2015, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $1.2 billion from operations before working capital changes in the 6 months, slightly higher than the prior year. Total capital spending for the 6 months was $540 million, up from the prior year but consistent with our guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the calendar year. During the 6 months, we spent $1.2 billion to repurchase about 24 million shares towards our 2015 target of repurchasing $1.5 billion to $2 billion of shares, subject to strategic capital requirements. Our average share count for the first 6 months was 633 million diluted shares outstanding, down 28 million from the 661 million at this time 1 year ago. At the end of the second quarter, we had 621 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. For the first half, our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was over $1.5 billion.
Our 6-month cash flows are consistent with our 2015 calendar year targets of capital allocations, namely, CapEx of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, approximately $700 million of dividends and $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases. We have been more aggressive in the pace of stock buybacks, taking advantage of the recent weakness in our stock price and all this is consistent with the balanced capital allocation framework we set forth at our December Investor Day.
Slide 7 highlights our balance sheet as of June 30 for 2015 and 2014. Our balance sheet remained strong. Operating working capital of $8.3 billion was down $2.7 billion from the year ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $2.1 billion related to lower inventory prices including the translation impact, partially offset by about $0.9 billion related to higher inventory quantities and a decrease of about $1.5 billion in other working capital, primarily related to reclassification of working capital for our global cocoa and chocolate businesses under held-for-sale accounting.
Total debt was about $6.9 billion resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $5.7 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $3.6 billion, in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash flows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI.
In addition, we raised EUR 1.1 billion in June in the euro debt markets to take advantage of low interest rates and to serve as a net investment hedge for our grown euro asset base following the WILD acquisition. We have paid down $0.8 billion of notional debt in July in a U.S. debt tender settlement and we may pay down an additional $0.2 billion before the end of the third quarter.
While we will take a pretax charge slightly above $0.2 billion in the third quarter related to debt tender premium, we expect going forward our ongoing annual interest expense to be lower by about $40 million pretax or $0.04 per share after-tax through the combination of the U S debt reductions and the euro debt issuances. This U.S. debt tender, euro debt issuance transaction had a very positive NPV benefit for ADM.
Our shareholders' equity of $18.6 billion is $1.7 billion lower than the level last year with a cumulative translation account down about $0.5 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.9 billion available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance. Juan?"

First half operating profits were similar to the same period last year despite a decline of more than $200 million in operating profits from the ethanol business. These results demonstrate the power of our business model.
Now I will review the performance of each segment. Starting on Slide 9. In the second quarter, Ag Services results declined from last year. Merchandising and handling results reflected a more significant seasonal decline in North American export volumes and margins while some global demand was met by increased South American exports that improved our Oilseeds segment results. We also saw lower global trade desk margins as the June 30th USDA report drove an increase in prices of some commodities, which negatively impacted some merchandising positions. While we had this impact at the end of Q2, markets came back a few days after the report.
In transportation, we saw lower total U.S. barge freight volumes and high water increased our costs. 
Milling and other results increased due to improvements in product margins, mix and strong merchandising results. A great quarter for our global milling operations, record second quarter results there.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results improved sequentially and declined year-over-year. In sweeteners and starches, overall volumes were up about 3% year-over-year. The tight supply chain from North American sweeteners supported very good margins and volumes. We also saw good demand for livestock feed. And our own Mexican -- joint venture in Mexico and our Eaststarch joint venture in Europe both delivered solid results.
And in bioproducts, ethanol earnings were lower. As I mentioned earlier, demand was robust with increased exports and record U.S. driving miles, but margins were limited as the industry ran at record volumes. Our ethanol profitability improved from the first quarter with second quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon.
Now looking forward, on the demand side, we see continued strong domestic and export demand for ethanol. Driving miles are up more than 3%, which will help domestic ethanol consumption approach 14 billion gallons in 2015. We see annualized net exports running at about 800 million gallons. We expect continued growth of exports to markets that currently use MTBE. And E15 adoption continues to grow, which will also bolster demand long term.
On the supply side, industry production levels will be a function of many factors including maintenance timing, yields, hot weather, planned and unplanned downtime and the face of industry capacity creep. 
In terms of what we are doing, we're strengthening our efforts to expand E15 adoption in the U.S. and ethanol adoption in markets abroad. We're also investing to further improve ADM's cost position in this business. ADM has invested a lot of effort to drive operational excellence and cost reductions in our wet mills, which represent about 1.1 billion gallons of nameplate capacity and that has translated into strong financial results from these facilities even in challenging environments.
We believe there are still opportunities to improve the cost positions of our large dry mills, which represent about 600 million gallons of nameplate capacity. We're intensifying efforts across a range of areas to drive these cost improvements. 
In summary. We continue to believe there is an important place for ethanol in the global fuel supply and we expect that our actions will help drive improved results from this business in the near term.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds had another consistent, solid quarter similar to last year. In crushing and origination, large global bean supplies and a strong U.S. mill demand drove great global soy crush results. In the first half of 2015, we crushed record volumes of soybeans globally. As part of our strategic plan for Oilseeds, we've added switch capacity to more of our North American crush plants and we've profited from our global switch capacity in a weak, exhausted margin environment this quarter. 
As I mentioned earlier, our South American origination and port operations including our Barcarena port had good throughput at the region's large corn and soy harvest proved the world's most competitive supply. In fact, ADM South American export volumes were up 38% compared to last year's second quarter.
On the softseed side, concerns about seed supply significantly reduced margin volumes and -- margins and volumes. 
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results declined mainly on the absence of biodiesel blender's credits we recorded last year. 
In Europe and South America, margins were challenged by regional market conditions. In North America, we saw strong refining margins and our Stratas Foods bottle oil joint venture delivered its best quarter yet. Stratas continues to be an industry leader in working with customers to manage the transition away from trans fat. Results from Asia rose primarily on Wilmar's improved performance.
Slide 12, please. In their second reporting quarter, the WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit delivered more than $100 million in earnings, an excellent performance. WILD Flavors had strong results in North America. To provide some context, it's worth noting that, in 2014, North America represented slightly more than half of the profits for WILD Flavors globally. And despite macroeconomic headwinds, Flavors' profits in Europe were in line with our plan, and this quarter was one of the best ever for our specialty proteins business. Among other highlights, the customer launched the first retail product with our Textura customized inclusions.
The WFSI business, with products ranging from protein specialties to ancient grains to natural flavors, is a key component in ADM's efforts to serve customers with on-trend products to grow their business.
As I mentioned earlier, the WFSI team continued working across all ADM businesses to fuel synergy efforts. In terms of revenue synergies, they continued to grow the pipeline and customer base. In the quarter, they added 175 projects to the pipeline, bringing the total to nearly 600. In the quarter, they worked across all ADM's business units to deliver more than 50 more revenue synergy wins. 
One interesting note here. The SCI team and their customer relationships have proved to be a valuable engine for driving cross-business collaboration and delivering these wins. 
So, so far this year, the WFSI team has implemented $24 million in annualized run rate cost synergies. That's more than halfway toward their 3-year target.
We remain confident that the team will deliver EUR 100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of year 3, which is 2017. I will still expect the WILD business to deliver $0.10 to $0.15 earning accretion in the first full year of operations despite some ForEx headwinds.
Now on Slide 13, I would like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at Investor Day in December. It lists the actions we are taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few. 
In Ag Services, we expanded our farmer services offering with an investment in Agrible, a leader in on-farm analytical and forecasting tools. We announced the expansion of our port at Puerto General San Martin in Argentina, enhancing our export capability from the region. And our port services JV acquired a Brazilian port and shipping agency.
In Corn, we are on track to close the Eaststarch acquisition in the second half of the year. We've contributed our liquid feed business into a joint venture to achieve greater scale without additional capital intensity. And in May, we announced an agreement to acquire a small sweetener manufacturer in Central China, but unfortunately, that transaction fell through.
In Oilseeds, we closed the sale of a 50% stake in our Barcarena port to Glencore, we closed the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill and we remain on track to close the global cocoa sale to Olam by the end of the year.
And in WFSI, we acquired a tree nut and seed processing facility in California, adding processing to support strong sales growth. We remain on track to deliver synergy and accretion targets. And we continue to advance our construction projects in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U S. 
And with respect to our operational excellence initiatives, I've talked about our objective of delivering $550 million of run rate savings by the end of year 5. By the end of the second quarter, we have realized already about $125 million of this run rate savings. We'll update you on our scorecard each quarter, and over time, you should expect to see the results of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We continue to feel good about 2015. The large U.S. harvest should help drive utilization of our storage and transportation assets in the U.S. The large global corn crops, the tight North America sweetener balance sheet and continued global sweetener demand should support margins and volumes in our sweeteners and starches business.
As I mentioned earlier, in ethanol, in the near and medium term, we expect demand, both domestic and export, to remain very strong. Production levels should also be robust and industry margins should evolve based on the supply/demand balance as we move through the year. We're intensifying our work on the cost position of our dry mills. Over the medium term, ethanol remains the cheapest octane enhancer in the world and we're growing toward domestic and international demand. 
Good global demand for mills should continue to support capacity utilization at our global soybean processing assets. And the WFSI team is well on track toward their cost and revenue synergy targets for 2015. 
We continue to see great collaboration across all of ADM's business units as we partner to serve a growing customer base.
Overall, we continue to advance our clear and aggressive strategic plan. We'll continue to see contributions from that effort throughout the year and will remain focused on growing EVA.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

We took advantage again of our swing capacity and we matched that -- the soybean crushing capacity in Europe. We are seeing now a little bit more softness at more North American -- South American soybean meal is arriving. And in China, we saw some recovery of that. It's not where it used to be at the beginning of the year, but it's much better than last year. So overall, we see a strong continued demand and we foresee good crushing margins for the rest of the year."

So we expect a very strong second half. We expect the U.S. to become more competitive in export.

And I guess I'm trying to reconcile supply demand with exports where they are seems reasonably balanced, although it's not clear stocks are actually going to draw as you move into the second half. But with the sharp decline in oil prices, how do you see -- do you become incrementally concerned about the pricing of ethanol relative to gasoline both domestically and overseas, just keeping that margin kind of contained over the near to medium term?"

From a demand perspective, we continue to feel very good about ethanol. As I said before, domestic demand with low gasoline prices has increased 3%, and that pattern should continue with a normal seasonality between summer and winter in the U S. Export demand continues to be very solid in those countries that are already customers and we have many, many new countries trying to become new customers and our team are out there trying to develop those markets. So the issue always will become in this relatively new industry, what happened with the supply. And the supply has been strong during -- so far during this year because we have a very mild start of the summer from a temperature perspective. We expect that right now, we've seen that even in June, in July. Over the last 3 weeks, inventory has been flat or slightly declining for the last 2 or 3 weeks, so the industry can produce at that 15 billion gallon, but not more for a very few weeks. And then I would say it's relatively balanced what we see right now in ethanol. And even at these oil prices, we are making money in our -- in all our mills. And if you think about the oxygenated values, MTBE continues to be at about $2.85 versus an ethanol of about $1.50, $1.60 and the other alkylates at about $2.50. So we continue to be the most competitive octane enhancer out there, so without even thinking about E15 growing in the background. So I think, overall, I cannot call it through the month or through the quarter because, as I said, this is a relatively volatile industry as we grow into our capacity. But I think medium term, we're very optimistic about the balance turning to the favor of ethanol."

So when we mark-to-market that, I think the loss was around $25 million, a lump sum, maybe not that significant. And the price corrected like by July 2nd or 3rd they were back to, so part of that has already come back in those positions. Regarding second half, I think maybe the export season will start a little bit later this year for the U.S. as North America -- as South America continue to extend their window a little bit. But we believe that demand outcome to the U.S. and will come all of a sudden altogether, so that will bode well for elevation margins. We think that our transportation business also will be very strong. We need to move a very large crop. I think that we're going to see the comeback of the normal carries that we see in the U.S. So we believe that a very strong crop and a very big area carryout bode very well for our footprint in North America. So I think it's going to be heavy fourth quarter-loaded and I cannot call it, Adam whether it's all exactly fourth quarter or slip a little bit into Q1, but we are prepared to manage a very large crop."

And with this kind of crops, we have the potential to do so. So I would say those businesses are on par or ahead of last year. WFSI is having very good performance. We'll hit within the range and so that's an addition of last year. And then we're having sweeteners and starches that are going very, very strongly and it need to offset the weakness in ethanol. I think ethanol was -- obviously started the year very bad, very soft in Q1. It improved in Q2. It has improved a little bit over the last 3 weeks.

This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.60. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $724 million. Adjusted ROIC of 9% was 240 basis points above our cost of capital.
Our second quarter results demonstrate the strength and value of our geographic and business portfolio diversity. In Corn, domestic and export demand for ethanol was robust, but record industry production limited margins. This was partially offset by strong results from our corn sweeteners and starches business.
In Oilseeds, good meal demand supported strong North American soybean crushing results. And South American origination and export volumes were up, leading to good throughput at our expanded origination and port network. These, combined with the flexibility of our global crush plants, helped the Oilseeds team deliver another strong performance.
The WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients team had an excellent quarter and continues to make great progress toward achieving their targeted costs and revenue synergies.
Ag Services earnings were impacted by lower margins and volumes of North American exports as they were less competitive globally and by a sharp upward move in commodity prices at the end of the quarter. But within our Ag Services segment, the milling business had record second quarter results.
We've continued to advance our strategic plan that's improving our ROIC and growing our EVA. Among numerous other actions, we closed the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill, we closed the Barcarena port transaction with Glencore in June and we remain on track to close both our Eaststarch transaction and the sale of our global cocoa business later this year. And we're making great progress on our operational excellence initiatives. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard activities later in the call.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, down from the strong $0.79 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $724 million. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 27% compared to 28% in the second quarter of the prior year. Our trailing 4-quarter average ROIC of 9% significantly improved by 120 basis points from the 7.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. The 9% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 as well as our long-term WACC of 8%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 9 in the appendix. 
Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.
In the second quarter, our trailing 4-quarter average EVA was $610 million based upon adjusted earnings and annual WACC up $238 million from the second quarter of 2014. 
On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.60 per share. For this quarter, LIFO represented a $0.06 per share after-tax charge. We had some gains on sales or revaluations of assets, primarily related to our Northeast Brazil port and the Romanian port totaling $0.11 per share. We also had some impairment charges totaling $0.04 per share. 
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results.
We had some gains and some charges in Ag Services, Corn and Oilseeds segments that I mentioned in the last chart and are highlighted in our press release. 
As a reminder, our cocoa and chocolate business remain part of our segment reporting results in Oilseeds until we have closed on the sales and they are not treated as discontinued operations in our financial statements.
Our new fourth business segment, WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, is reported as its own segment for the second time this quarter. This segment includes the 2 businesses we acquired in 2014, WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities Inc. as well as certain Specialty Ingredients businesses that were previously reported in ADM's 3 other segments.
For purposes of comparison to prior results, the year ago quarter's segment operating profit for Ag Services, Corn and Oilseeds removed the earnings of the businesses that are now reported in the WFSI segment. To assist you with your analysis, we've included a chart in the appendix that recasts 2014 segment quarter results to the new segments.
In the corporate line, net interest expense was about flat. Unallocated corporate expenses were $19 million higher due to: one, increased GAAP pension expenses relating to the changes in discount rates and mortality tables; second, increased spending in IT in our ERP project; third, investments related to strategic business improvement projects; and lastly, unique costs related to specific divestiture activities including chocolate and cocoa. We're starting to see some of the benefits of some of the strategic business improvement projects in our results.
Excluding these factors, our run rate in underlying corporate costs are consistent with the prior year and you should expect our run rate for the next few quarters to be between $110 million to $120 million per quarter.
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $17.2 billion, down from last year's $21.5 billion. The significant reduction was driven by large declines in commodity prices that impact our revenues, but this decline also impacts our cost of goods sold as our input costs are lower. So the key is managing the spread between the revenues and the cost of goods sold, which is core competency of our teams. This dynamic makes operating profit much more relevant when analyzing us. 
I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements in the prior year do not include the revenues and the costs of WILD and SCI whose transactions closed in the fourth quarter of last year.
Now turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for the 6 months ending June 30, 2015, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $1.2 billion from operations before working capital changes in the 6 months, slightly higher than the prior year. Total capital spending for the 6 months was $540 million, up from the prior year but consistent with our guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the calendar year. During the 6 months, we spent $1.2 billion to repurchase about 24 million shares towards our 2015 target of repurchasing $1.5 billion to $2 billion of shares, subject to strategic capital requirements. Our average share count for the first 6 months was 633 million diluted shares outstanding, down 28 million from the 661 million at this time 1 year ago. At the end of the second quarter, we had 621 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. For the first half, our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was over $1.5 billion.
Our 6-month cash flows are consistent with our 2015 calendar year targets of capital allocations, namely, CapEx of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, approximately $700 million of dividends and $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases. We have been more aggressive in the pace of stock buybacks, taking advantage of the recent weakness in our stock price and all this is consistent with the balanced capital allocation framework we set forth at our December Investor Day.
Slide 7 highlights our balance sheet as of June 30 for 2015 and 2014. Our balance sheet remained strong. Operating working capital of $8.3 billion was down $2.7 billion from the year ago period. This decrease was comprised of about $2.1 billion related to lower inventory prices including the translation impact, partially offset by about $0.9 billion related to higher inventory quantities and a decrease of about $1.5 billion in other working capital, primarily related to reclassification of working capital for our global cocoa and chocolate businesses under held-for-sale accounting.
Total debt was about $6.9 billion resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $5.7 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $3.6 billion, in part reflecting the fourth quarter cash out flows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI.
In addition, we raised EUR 1.1 billion in June in the euro debt markets to take advantage of low interest rates and to serve as a net investment hedge for our grown euro asset base following the WILD acquisition. We have paid down $0.8 billion of notional debt in July in a U.S. debt tender settlement and we may pay down an additional $0.2 billion before the end of the third quarter.
While we will take a pretax charge slightly above $0.2 billion in the third quarter related to debt tender premium, we expect going forward our ongoing annual interest expense to be lower by about $40 million pretax or $0.04 per share after-tax through the combination of the U S debt reductions and the euro debt issuances. This U.S. debt tender, euro debt issuance transaction had a very positive NPV benefit for ADM.
Our shareholders' equity of $18.6 billion is $1.7 billion lower than the level last year with a cumulative translation account down about $0.5 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
We had $5.9 billion available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance. Juan?"

In the second quarter, we earned $724 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. Our ROIC of 9% was up 120 basis points over last year's second quarter and EVA was up $238 million, an increase of more than 60% from last year.
First half operating profits were similar to the same period last year despite a decline of more than $200 million in operating profits from the ethanol business. These results demonstrate the power of our business model.
Now I will review the performance of each segment. Starting on Slide 9. In the second quarter, Ag Services results declined from last year. Merchandising and handling results reflected a more significant seasonal decline in North American export volumes and margins while some global demand was met by increased South American exports that improved our Oilseeds segment results. We also saw lower global trade desk margins as the June 30th USDA report drove an increase in prices of some commodities, which negatively impacted some merchandising positions. While we had this impact at the end of Q2, markets came back a few days after the report.
In transportation, we saw lower total U.S. barge freight volumes and high water increased our costs. 
Milling and other results increased due to improvements in product margins, mix and strong merchandising results. A great quarter for our global milling operations, record second quarter results there.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results improved sequentially and declined year-over-year. In sweeteners and starches, overall volumes were up about 3% year-over-year. The tight supply chain for North American sweeteners supported very good margins and volumes. We also saw good demand for livestock feed. And our own Mexican -- joint venture in Mexico and our Eaststarch joint venture in Europe both delivered solid results.
And in Bioproducts, ethanol earnings were lower. As I mentioned earlier, demand was robust with increased exports and record U.S. driving miles, but margins were limited as the industry ran at record volumes. Our ethanol profitability improved from the first quarter with second quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon.
Now looking forward, on the demand side, we see continued strong domestic and export demand for ethanol. Driving miles are up more than 3%, which will help domestic ethanol consumption approach 14 billion gallons in 2015. We see annualized net exports running at about 800 million gallons. We expect continued growth of exports to markets that currently use MTBE. And E15 adoption continues to grow, which will also bolster demand long term.
On the supply side, industry production levels will be a function of many factors including maintenance timing, yields, hot weather, planned and unplanned downtime and the face of industry capacity creep. 
In terms of what we are doing, we're strengthening our efforts to expand E15 adoption in the U.S. and ethanol adoption in markets abroad. We're also investing to further improve ADM's cost position in this business. ADM has invested a lot of effort to drive operational excellence and cost reductions in our wet mills, which represent about 1.1 billion gallons of nameplate capacity and that has translated into strong financial results from these facilities even in challenging environments.
We believe there are still opportunities to improve the cost positions of our large dry mills, which represent about 600 million gallons of nameplate capacity. We're intensifying efforts across a range of areas to drive these cost improvements. 
In summary. We continue to believe there is an important place for ethanol in the global fuel supply and we expect that our actions will help drive improved results from this business in the near term.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds had another consistent, solid quarter similar to last year. In crushing and origination, large global bean supplies and a strong U.S. mill demand drove great global soy crush results. In the first half of 2015, we crushed record volumes of soybeans globally. As part of our strategic plan for Oilseeds, we've added switch capacity to more of our North American crush plants and we've profited from our global switch capacity in a weak, exhausted margin environment this quarter. 
As I mentioned earlier, our South American origination and port operations including our Barcarena port had good throughput as the region's large corn and soy harvest proved the world's most competitive supply. In fact, ADM South American export volumes were up 38% compared to last year's second quarter.
On the softseed side, concerns about seed supply significantly reduced margin volumes and -- margins and volumes. 
Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and other results declined mainly on the absence of biodiesel blender's credits we recorded last year. 
In Europe and South America, margins were challenged by regional market conditions. In North America, we saw strong refining margins and our Stratas Foods bottle oil joint venture delivered its best quarter yet. Stratas continues to be an industry leader in working with customers to manage the transition away from trans fats. Results from Asia rose primarily on Wilmar's improved performance.
Slide 12, please. In their second reporting quarter, the WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit delivered more than $100 million in earnings, an excellent performance. WILD Flavors had strong results in North America. To provide some context, it's worth noting that, in 2014, North America represented slightly more than half of the profits for WILD Flavors globally. And despite macroeconomic headwinds, Flavors' profits in Europe were in line with our plan, and this quarter was one of the best ever for our specialty proteins business. Among other highlights, the customer launched the first retail product with our Textura customized inclusions.
The WFSI business, with products ranging from protein specialties to ancient grains to natural flavors, is a key component in ADM's efforts to serve customers with on-trend products to grow their business.
As I mentioned earlier, the WFSI team continued working across all ADM businesses to fuel synergy efforts. In terms of revenue synergies, they continued to grow the pipeline and customer base. In the quarter, they added 175 projects to the pipeline, bringing the total to nearly 600. In the quarter, they worked across all ADM's business units to deliver more than 50 more revenue synergy wins. 
One interesting note here. The SCI team and their customer relationships have proved to be a valuable engine for driving cross-business collaboration and delivering these wins. 
So, so far this year, the WFSI team has implemented $24 million in annualized run rate cost synergies. That's more than halfway toward their 3-year target.
We remain confident that the team will deliver EUR 100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of year 3, which is 2017. I will still expect the WILD business to deliver $0.10 to $0.15 earning accretion in the first full year of operations despite some ForEx headwinds.
Now on Slide 13, I would like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at Investor Day in December. It lists the actions we are taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few. 
In Ag Services, we expanded our farmer services offering with an investment in Agrible, a leader in on-farm analytical and forecasting tools. We announced the expansion of our port at Puerto General San Martin in Argentina, enhancing our export capability from the region. And our port services JV acquired a Brazilian port and shipping agency.
In Corn, we are on track to close the Eaststarch acquisition in the second half of the year. We've contributed our liquid feed business into a joint venture to achieve greater scale without additional capital intensity. And in May, we announced an agreement to acquire a small sweetener manufacturer in Central China, but unfortunately, that transaction fell through.
In Oilseeds, we closed the sale of a 50% stake in our Barcarena port to Glencore, we closed the sale of our global chocolate business to Cargill and we remain on track to close the global cocoa sale to Olam by the end of the year.
And in WFSI, we acquired a tree nut and seed processing facility in California, adding processing to support strong sales growth. We remain on track to deliver synergy and accretion targets. And we continue to advance our construction projects in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U S. 
And with respect to our operational excellence initiatives, I've talked about our objective of delivering $550 million of run rate savings by the end of year 5. By the end of the second quarter, we have realized already about $125 million of this run rate savings. We'll update you on our scorecard each quarter, and over time, you should expect to see the results of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We continue to feel good about 2015. The large U.S. harvest should help drive utilization of our storage and transportation assets in the U.S. The large global corn crops, the tight North America sweetener balance sheet and continued global sweetener demand should support margins and volumes in our sweeteners and starches business.
As I mentioned earlier, in ethanol, in the near and medium term, we expect demand, both domestic and export, to remain very strong. Production levels should also be robust and industry margins should evolve based on the supply/demand balance as we move through the year. We're intensifying our work on the cost position of our dry mills. Over the medium term, ethanol remains the cheapest octane enhancer in the world and we're growing toward domestic and international demand. 
Good global demand for mills should continue to support capacity utilization at our global soybean processing assets. And the WFSI team is well on track toward their cost and revenue synergy targets for 2015. 
We continue to see great collaboration across all of ADM's business units as we partner to serve a growing customer base.
Overall, we continue to advance our clear and aggressive strategic plan. We'll continue to see contributions from that effort throughout the year and will remain focused on growing EVA.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

South American margins continue to be solid. European margins are -- were very solid in soybeans in second quarter. We took advantage again of our swing capacity and we matched that -- the soybean crushing capacity in Europe. We are seeing now a little bit more softness as more South American soybean meal is arriving. And in China, we saw some recovery of that. It's not where it used to be at the beginning of the year, but it's much better than last year. So overall, we see a strong continued demand and we foresee good crushing margins for the rest of the year."

We expect the U.S. to become more competitive in export. We haven't been so far, but we expect that demand to come to our elevators very fast and being able to increase elevation margins toward the end of the year. So at this point, we are very bullish second half for Ag Services earnings."

And I guess I'm trying to reconcile supply demand with exports where they are seems reasonably balanced, although it's not clear stocks are actually going to draw as you move into the second half. But with the sharp decline in oil prices, how do you see -- do you become incrementally concerned about the pricing of ethanol relative to gasoline both domestically and overseas, just keeping that margin kind of contained over the near to medium term?"

From a demand perspective, we continue to feel very good about ethanol. As I said before, domestic demand with low gasoline prices has increased 3%, and that pattern should continue with a normal seasonality between summer and winter in the U.S. Export demand continues to be very solid in those countries that are already customers and we have many, many new countries trying to become new customers and our teams are out there trying to develop those markets. So the issue always will become in this relatively new industry, what happened with the supply. And the supply has been strong during -- so far during this year because we have a very mild start of the summer from a temperature perspective. We expect that right now -- we've seen that even in June, in July. Over the last 3 weeks, inventory has been flat or slightly declining for the last 2 or 3 weeks -- so the industry can produce at that 15 billion gallon, but not more, for a very, very few weeks. And then I would say it's relatively balanced what we see right now in ethanol. And even at these oil prices, we are making money in our -- in all our mills. And if you think about the oxygenated values, MTBE continues to be at about $2.85 versus an ethanol of about $1.50, $1.60 and the other alkylates are about $2.50. So we continue to be the most competitive octane enhancer out there, so without even thinking about E15 growing in the background. So I think, overall, I cannot call it through the month or through the quarter because, as I said, this is a relatively volatile industry as we grow into our capacity. But I think medium term, we're very optimistic about the balance turning to the favor of ethanol."

So the first part was global trading desk? Yes, the loss on the global trade desk, yes. As you know, June 30 report created a big volatility and basically brought prices up. So when we mark-to-market that, I think the loss was around $25 million, a lump sum, maybe not that significant. And the price corrected like by July 2nd or 3rd they were back too, so part of that has already come back in those positions. Regarding second half, I think maybe the export season will start a little bit later this year for the U.S. as North -- as South America continue to extend their window a little bit. But we believe that demand outcome to the U.S. and will come all of a sudden altogether. So that will bode well for elevation margins. We think that our transportation business also will be very strong. We need to move a very large crop. I think that we're going to see the comeback of the normal carries that we see in the U.S. So we believe that a very strong crop and a very big area carryout bodes very well for our footprint in North America. So I think it's going to be heavy fourth quarter-loaded and I cannot call it, Adam, whether it's all exactly fourth quarter or slip a little bit into Q1, but we are prepared to manage a very large crop."

Consider this, and I think we said it before, Cornell, there are out there at least 6 billion gallons of MTBE capacity that we're working very hard to replace. And these products, again, ethanol is the most sustainable and the lowest-cost octane enhancer. So I like to be positioned in a product that is very sustainable and lower costs than their alternatives. So there is a big market out there and here we are going to go through ups and downs through all these regulations. Again, I said it before, it's a relatively new industry. It's an industry that started in 2007. It needs to go through phases of consolidation. We're going to have creep capacity. Some producers will become better producers, more cost efficient. That will push some of the marginal producers into more troubled water. That will, to a certain degree, modify the industry. So we are working this industry development. But at this point in time, we continue to be very excited about the potential we find in our own plants to improve our competitive advantage, and the potential for this market to grow in front of us."

Oilseeds is way ahead of last year and we continue to see upside in Oilseeds. Granted, we come in against the strong comps that we have in Q3 and Q4 last year, but Oilseeds is coming very strong on very strong demand. So that's ahead of last year and should continue to be over the year. Ag Services, as I told you, is online for the first half. And last year, we had a second half that allowed us to deliver in the range of $850 million to $900 million. And we see this year again the possibility to be in that range if we can repeat the second quarter -- the second half. And with this kind of crops, we have the potential to do so. So I would say those businesses are on par or ahead of last year. WFSI is having very good performance. We'll hit within the range and so that's an addition of last year. And then we're having Sweeteners & Starches that are going very, very strongly and it needs to offset the weakness in ethanol. I think ethanol was -- obviously started the year very bad, very soft in Q1. It improved in Q2. It has improved a little bit over the last 3 weeks. So I think the issue is we have 1 business that we think it will deliver, which is Ag Services. We have 2 businesses, WFSI and Oilseeds, that will probably outperform and that need to offset a little bit the softness in ethanol. So all in all, at this point, we still believe -- we still feel good about 2015."

This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.60. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $684 million. Adjusted ROIC of 8.3% was 170 basis points above our cost of capital. The ADM team executed well in an environment very similar to the second quarter. Our services were limited by lower margins on volumes of North American exports due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and ample crop supplies, particularly from south America. In corn, we continue to confront very weak industry ethanol margins while sweeteners and starches results remain solid amid tight supplies.
In oilseeds, good global meal demand again supported soy crushing results and solid origination volumes contributed to our South American operations. While continued weak oil demand, particularly outside the U.S., weighted on our softseed business, and in WFSI, the impact of microeconomic headwinds, weaker demand from some emerging companies and the strong U.S. dollar, was greater than we've expected. We continue to execute our strategic plan. Among other actions, we closed the sale of the global copper business, acquired Eatem Foods and closed the Eaststarch transaction. We're also making a strong progress in driving operational efficiencies, which will further enhance our cash position, and we remain committed to our balanced approach to capital allocation for our shareholders.
I'll provide more detail on our scorecard activities later in the call.
Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, down 30% from the $0.86 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $68",1190,"Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, down 30% from the $0.86 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $684 million, down $257 million. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 31% compared to 28% in the third quarter the prior year. Our tax rate was higher this quarter due to some discrete items that impacted us for the quarter, mainly the finalization of some international tax returns. Our calendar year 2015 estimate for the effective tax rate remains at around 28%. Our trailing 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC of 8.3% is down by 40 basis points from the 8.7% at the end of the third quarter last year. The 8.3% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 as well as our long-term WACC of 8%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.
In the third quarter, our trailing 4 quarter average EVA was $428 million based upon the adjusted earnings and the annual WACC, down $178 million from 2014.
On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.41 to the adjusted earnings of $0.60. For this quarter, LIFO represented a $0.07 share after tax credit. We had gain from the sale of the global chocolate operations net of expenses of $0.04 per share with a charge related to buying back U.S. debt of $0.19 per share as part of a series of transactions to issue a lower-cost Euro denominated debt. With asset impairment charges of $0.06 per share and we had some restructuring and pension settlement charges of $0.04 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items that impacted our quarterly results. In the Corn Processing segment, we had $33 million charge related to the partial impairment of our Brazilian sugar processing assets, and oilseeds recorded $32 million gain net of expenses related to the sale of our global chocolate operations in the third quarter. As a reminder, our cocoa business remain part of our segment reporting result in the third quarter. We closed on the sale of the business in October and the sale will be recognized and recorded in our fourth quarter results.
Our new fourth business segment, WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, includes the 2 businesses we acquired in 2014, namely WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities, Inc. as well as certain specialty ingredients business that were previously reported in the ADM's 3 other segments. With purposes of comparison to prior results, the year-ago quarter segment operating profit for ag services, corn and oilseeds removed to earnings of the businesses that are now reported in the WFSI segment. To issue with your analysis, we've included a chart in the appendix that recapped the 2014 segment quarterly results to the new segments.
In the corporate lines. Net interest expense is down due to lower interest rates, an unallocated corporate cost of $113 million were within the $110 million to $120 million guidance that we provided to you last quarter. Our run rate in underlying corporate cost is consistent with the prior year excluding the special product costs, such as the implementation of our ERP program.
Also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter was $16.6 billion, down from last year's $18.1 billion. The significant reduction was mainly driven by large declines in commodity prices and foreign exchange translation by these factors also impacted our cost of goods sold as our input costs were lower. I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements for this year and last are not entirely comparable due to some significant transactions over the past 12 months, including fertilizer, chocolate, WILD and SCI.
Turning to cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for the 9 months period ending September 30, 2015, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $1.5 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first 9 months of this year. Total capital spending for the 9 months was $819 million, up from the prior year. Our CapEx guidance for the calendar year was $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, and based upon our run rate of spending, it's likely will finish up the year at the lower end of the range or below that range. Given the more challenging business conditions we have encountered in 2015, we had been even more cautious in our capital spending.
We acquired several businesses this year including AOR, The European Bottle Oil company and our remaining interest in the Romanian Court totaling $83 million. In the other investing activities line, mainly reflects the proceeds from divestitures, such as our global chocolate business and the sale of our stake in our Port in Northern Brazil less the increased investment in Wilmar in the first quarter.
During the 9 months, we spent about $1.8 billion to repurchase about 37.5 million shares towards our 2015 target of repurchasing $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of shares subject to strategic capital requirements. Our average share count for the first 9 months was 627 million diluted shares outstanding, down 31 million from this time 1 year ago. At the end of the third quarter, we have 607 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.
For the 9-month period, our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was over $2.3 billion. You should expect that we will complete about $2 billion of share repurchase by the end of the calendar year and finish up with about 600 million shares outstanding on a diluted basis.
On Slide 7, shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30 for 2015 and 2014. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Operating working capital of $7.9 billion was down $0.3 billion from the year-ago period. Total debt was about $6.8 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $5.6 billion, up from the 2014 net debt levels of $0.7 billion. In part, reflecting the 4 quarter cash outflows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI as well as the issuance this year of Euro $1.1 billion of debt or roughly 1.2 billions in U.S. dollar terms and the subsequent repurchase of about $0.9 billion of U.S. debt. Our shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion is $2.4 billion lower than the level last year due to its share buybacks and with the cumulative translation and count down about $1.1 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.3 billion available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $6.4 billion of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance."

Please turn to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $684 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. Compared to the second quarter, market conditions in the third quarter were fairly similar with weak industry ethanol margin",1487,"Thanks, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $684 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. Compared to the second quarter, market conditions in the third quarter were fairly similar with weak industry ethanol margins and a competitive U.S. exports. So not surprisingly, our operating profits were in line. On a 4 quarter trailing average basis, our ROIC of 8.3% was above our annual WACC of 6.6% and our EVA was $428 million.
Now I'll review the performance of each segment. Starting on Slide 9. In the third quarter, ag services results were similar to last year's but reflected the starkly different set of market conditions. Overall, despite robust global demand, we saw a general lack of merchandising opportunities as the global markets was well supplied. Last year's third quarter, saw merchandising and handling results, driven by the normal seasonal July, August decline in exports and then normal uptick with the harvest in September, driving near record volumes out of the goal. This year, ample global crop supplies, particularly from South America and the strong dollar kept the North American exports, particularly corn and wheat, largely out of the global markets for the third quarter. However, we did see some soybeans exports pick up later in the quarter because of weaker global demand for U.S. exports due to the strong dollar, elevation margins at our export terminals were significantly lower this third quarter compared to last year.
You'll also recall that, that the second quarter global trade results reflected the late quarter market shift that negatively impacted some merchandising positions, and we were able to recognize the benefits of these positions in Q3. However, our global trade desk results were slightly down from last year due to lower margins from a more competitive global supply environment and global customer delaying some purchases in declining price environments.
In transportation, lower U.S. exports reduced barge freight rates. Milling and Other results again increased due to improvements in product margins, mix and strong merchandising results.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn processing results declined from the year-ago period. In sweeteners and starches, we continue to see strong sweetener demand, supporting both margins and volumes. Across the subsegment, domestic shipments were flat, while exports, particularly corn products, were limited due to the low export demand for CPGs in July and August and the impact of our strongest dollar on the competitiveness of corn products exports. And as our new sweetener plant in Tianjin works to commercialize its capacity, we've had to absorb the fixed costs for that operation, and in valued products, ethanol earnings were lower. Industry ethanol inventories throughout the third quarter were higher than last year and industry production levels were also higher, both in ethanol margins to be considerably weaker than the prior year despite increases in domestic demand. Our ethanol profitability reflects third quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds have yet another solid quarter. In crushing and origination, strong demand for milling in the U.S. and many of our traditional export destinations throughout Latin America, helped support good volumes and margins in our North American soybean crushing operations. Likewise, in Europe, good meal demand drove soy crush utilization. Weak global demand for vegetable oil reduced softseed margins on volumes around the world, particularly in Europe where rapeseeds crushing results were down significantly. This was another reporting, which our switch capacity paid off, and as the large Brazilian corn and soybeans crop combined with the weak real to encourage farmer selling, origination volumes increased significantly and margins rose, contributing to stronger year-over-year South American crushing and origination results.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other's results declined mainly on the absence of biodiesel blender's credit we recorded last year. However, North American refined oils have the best third quarter ever from good domestic demand and the results were offset by weaker demand for refined oils outside of the U.S. and also weaker overall biodiesel margins. Results from Asia rose, primarily on Wilmar's improved performance.
Slide 12, please. In their third reporting quarter, the WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit earned $70 million. It was a tough quarter for the team. As I've mentioned, the strong dollar and weakness in some emerging economies affected results across a number of product lines, and while these factors are largely beyond our control, we're focusing on the levers we can boost to deliver results to strengthen the business. We're seeing improved gross margins on some key product categories, including flavors, polyols and protein. We're seeing U.S. Domestic business generating good results from solid demand.
We're seeing improved volumes in our polyols business. We're addressing some inventory management issues in our Specialty Commodities business and this issue should be behind us by the end of the year, and our synergy work is paying off as a result of benefiting from margin expansion, cost savings and mix.
The team remains laser-focused on our synergy work. That's resulted in steady customer and pipeline growth. We have delivered 81 new wins and have an active pipeline of more than 675 proceeds. As a result of this effort, we are seeing many new RFPs for SCI, for WILD Flavors and for ADM, and as I mentioned, we continue to see strong interest in our offering on lots of product launches.
Since the WILD acquisition, the team has implemented about $30 million in annualized run rate cost synergies, and we are on track to reach about $40 million by the end of this calendar year. We remain confident that the team will deliver EUR 100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of Year 3, which is 2017, and we're still on track toward the lower end of the $0.10 to $0.15 per share first year accretion for WILD Flavors.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at Investor Day in December. It lists the actions we're taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few.
In ag services, we expanded our destination sales operations, opening offices in El Salvador and Guatemala. In corn, in July, we acquired Lyrco Nutrition, an animal feed business that serves, primarily the baby and swine market in Québec, and yesterday, we closed the Eaststarch acquisition, enabling ADM to better serve growing the European demand as the EU lists is artificial cap on serial-based sweeteners. In oilseeds, we closed the sale of our global coco business to Elan, we closed the acquisition of AUR, the oil bottling company based in Belgium. This is allowing us to better reach the Continental European retail and food service markets and enhancing our ability to export value-added products internationally. And we're having soy switch capacity to our rapeseed processing plant at Strobin, Germany, and in WFSI, we acquired Eatem Foods, a leading developer of savory flavors, having deep expertise in savory flavors and ethanol cuisines and broadening our capabilities in the food service and private brand channels.
We announced the construction of the state-of-the-art flavor lab and customer center in Clambory, New Jersey. We located the new Information Technology Support Center and existing building of the WILD campus in Erlanger, Kentucky. We remain on track to deliver synergy targets, and we continue to advance our construction projects in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U.S. And we have made great progress in the area of driving operational efficiencies. We have targeted $550 million of run rate savings by the end of Year 5. In fact, we have already identified a pipeline of more than $700 million. We'll update you on our scorecard each quarter, and overtime, you should expect to see the results of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We have a large U.S. harvest in front of us and crop will eventually move to the world markets, which will benefit our Ag Services business. In corn, the sweetener balance sheet should remain tight, while ethanol industry margins will move based upon supply and demand dynamics. In oilseeds, global demand for processing remain strong and we're working Asia powerment solving oil production and Brazilian biodiesel legislation, which could improve the global vegetable oil balance sheet, and WFSI continues to capture synergies related to the WILD acquisition, and integrated recent acquisitions, such as Eatem Foods.
As you saw moments ago, we continue to make progress advancing our plan, and as I mentioned earlier, we remain committed to our capital allocation framework that was set out at the end of 2014 in terms of a balanced approach for our shareholders.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

If we look at beans, they probably sold about 35% of the new crop and normally, they would have averaged about 60%. We still believe that our Q4 earnings in ag services will grow versus Q3, but we probably see more commercialization of grain either in values that will depend probably on the weather event, whether there is concern about eventually South America maybe later on in December or something like that or with the regular cash flow maybe during 2016."

I will qualify the following way of I think is as Swan of the largest exporter of grain in Argentina, our reduction in restrictions and licenses will be positive for our ag Services business, and if you think that is going to be more soybeans coming to market and more crushed than in Argentina, then maybe potential negative for the competitiveness of U.S. meal exports out of the U.S. and it might impact a little bit there the situation in Europe.

If we look at the last 8 years, ag services has that range at 7 of the last 8 and the only the year in which it didn't because of this 50-year draught that we had.

I will say the dynamics at this point in time, as we see, but with our -- there has been some good news in this quarter about China getting into the export destination roster, if you will. Some of the plants have maybe came back a little bit later from their maintenance, which provides us a little bit of time. But as you said, medium-term, we continue to trade premium to gasoline, which will have some impact in certain export destinations. That's why we continue to call the net exports about the same even in China it is coming into the export destination roster. So it will be -- it will continue to flow depending on how much the industry will produce. We are positive about the demand. Demand is up in gasoline about 3% this year and maybe it's going to be up 1% to 1.5% for next year. Exports continue to be robust. Ethanol is growing very, very fast in Brazil and now with the increasing gasoline prices in Brazil, ethanol has become a little bit more expensive. Petrobras is in strike today, so they are not producing that much oil maybe they need a little bit more ethanol. So I would say at this point, we had to cut that, that is a bit like the margins we have today going forward, and with hopes into the global domestic demand and keeping those export markets."

You heard us before, Wilmar is a strategic partner and one of our largest customers and we continued to be very committed to this relationship, to grow in this relationship. Wilmar gives us a window and an exposure to tropical oils, to China oilseed crush, to consumer packaged products in China. So it's a great way for us to participate in that, and we believe in our relationship, and we will continue to grow it over time."

The segment is composed of many products and some of those products, as we -- you heard that we're building a plant in Brazil of specialty protein. Well, at this point in time, we sourced everything from the plant in the U.S. Certainly, with the strongest dollar, our ability to export to the world has been reduced. There are some countries that have some issues of importing like in Venezuela, for example, even if our customers want to get their product. Some key markets -- key emerging markets have been soft, whether it's called Middle East, whether it's Russia, whether it's China and in some of these products like emulsifiers or hydrocolloids are used in oil field drilling and, obviously, you see that the rig count going down in the U.S. with less drilling going on as oil prices have declined. So several factors, I would say none of the fundamental have changed into this business. We continue to be excited. We continue to be building capabilities. We have bought 3 companies in the last year with WILD, SCI and Eatem Food. They are all on trend. They all on target. So we continue to feel very strong about it. It's a long-term play that we're building a great company for ADM here, and as long as synergies are on track and products are getting the pull from customers, we don't worry that much about these short-term headwinds."

Think about how competitive has been Brazil in the world market where Paraguay with the same weather, with the same climate hasn't been. It's not that Brazil is any different competitive advantage than Paraguay, it's just the real has devalued significantly versus what the Paraguayan currency have done. So 2 things, they ebb and flow and we profited from our origination in Brazil. Our volumes in Brazil are like have exploded versus last year and we see parts of that reflected in ag services. So at the end of the day, the good thing is that there are large crops everywhere and we're going to commercialize those crops, but it certainly affects the timing of all thus far and we're going through that period."

We see the balance is pretty similar to what we see now. Again, I think the 2 positive side could be if we get another 1%, 1.5% domestic demand growth and then we see ethanol in Brazil be more requested internally and China, China went from like 3 million gallons last year of imports to maybe 60 million gallons this year. So what that's going to bode well for 2016. Those are probably positive. On the negative side, capacity utilization in the industry continues to be in maybe 2%, and it should go a little bit higher to see margin expansion."

It may not happen exactly the way we have described it to you before in 4 orderly packets of $0.30, but let me walk you through some of those issues. We certainly had a little bit higher ethanol margins in our original projections, and we have had those ethanol margins and eyes I said, when we stress test it the more levels we have today. We also look at what if the U.S. dollar continued to be strong and ag services will remain in this kind of range? And then, we looked at the positives and there are some businesses in certain portfolios that we are recovering, that we haven't highlighted to you because it was not a need to invest this business from a portfolio much, but those businesses are businesses that have specific actions to recover, and we feel strongly about being able to achieve that over the next 1 year, 1.5 year. Then we have operational excellence and operational efficiencies and as I described in my remarks, when we started to look at this target of $550 million in 5 years and having the $0.10 per year out of that, we are already after the first year, Adam, we have unveiled a pipeline of $700 million, and we continue to find more. So we have programs to accelerate that, to bring them faster into the program. We'll also continue to deploy our cash into these bolt-on acquisitions and as we did, Eatem, we have more in the pipeline and when we put all of those things together, again, the recovery of some of the units, some of the operational efficiencies, some of the M&A and we also have the ability to maybe been accelerated the buybacks as we mentioned of the will be in the upper side of our range this year. Again, we have stress tested, and we looked at 2 different scenarios, and we always come back within that range.

After that, the business have the lower seasonality. So there was some, as you described, underperformance, but part of the normal seasonality. So the other performance that I described before, specialty proteins is we export everything at this point from the U.S., so we're still building our plant in Brazil and the strong dollar some of the exports. Some of the destination markets have issues I described before, whether it was Venezuela, whether it was Brazil, whether it was Russia. In the WILD Flavors, there was some softness in some accounts that are large produce that they came a little bit softer in Japan and in China. Nothing that is structure ago nothing that we were we significantly above, and we saw also in the specialty proteins and some of these products that are soy-related, customers actually these talked because they saw the pricing of soy beans all that coming down and there was not a lot of incentive for them to Q&A 12 forward both in any of that. So we saw a little bit of a de-stocking. So their fundamental indicators about the strength of this business have not changed. The full from customers, the number of projects, that extent of the solutions haven't changed.

Third quarter will come down, and that's the seasonal pattern, and in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, generally, with the lowest quarters in terms of profitability for WFSI. So I think once you've kind of gone through 1-year, you'll start understanding the seasonal pattern of this business for modeling. The second point I want to make is, as Juan reaffirmed, and we are WILD Flavors, we're still on track for the first year accretion. We provide guidance and the -- we did $0.10 to $0.15 a share. We're still on track despite the headwinds that we've seen in terms of foreign exchange, in terms of the weakness of certain markets around the world. We're still on track towards the lower end of that range for WILD Flavors. And then, thirdly, if you recall, I did provide some guidance earlier here in the WFSI segment. I said it will be somewhere above $300 million, $340 million for the calendar year. We're still on track towards the lower end of that range. So I think it's fair to say, the team has done a very good job in terms of confronting the headwinds that we've seen in the business, yet I'm still very, very comfortable that the financial results for this segment as well as for WILD Flavors, are still consistent, again, on the lower end of the range, we're still consistent with what we're tracking in terms of helping this business actually move towards supporting our $4 to $4.50 earnings power over the medium term."

We're going to see other customers coming to the market. Remember that ethanol continues to be the cheapest concessionary and all the others are in the range of $2.50 even at these oil prices.

Naturally, if we get to a point in which we cannot improve our cost position to the point of differentiation, if you will, for whatever reason, and if we believe that they can not compete in a more challenging U.S. ethanol environment, we will naturally look at various alternatives to maximize shareholder value. At this point in time, we haven't found the end of that, and we continue to find opportunities, and we want to see, listen, it could be that the ethanol dry mill cost curve is very flat and even if we improve, we don't get the point of differentiation. And in that sense, we would like to probably need to make a decision. At this point, we are not there yet. We are still finding opportunities to differentiate our dry mills, but I'm not surprised with your question or your assessment. We constantly are reviewing them."

This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.60. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $684 million. Adjusted ROIC of 8.3% was 170 basis points above our cost of capital. 
The ADM team executed well in an environment very similar to the second quarter. Ag services earnings were limited by lower margins on volumes of North American exports due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and ample crop supplies, particularly from South America. 
In corn, we continue to confront very weak industry ethanol margins, while sweeteners and starches results remain solid amid tight supplies.
In oilseeds, good global meal demand again supported soy crushing results and solid origination volumes contributed to our South American operations, while continued weak oil demand, particularly outside the U.S., weighted on our softseeds business. 
And in WFSI, the impact of microeconomic headwinds, weaker demand from some emerging companies and the strong U.S. dollar, was greater than we've expected. 
We continue to execute our strategic plan. Among other actions, we've closed on the sale of the global cocoa business, acquired Eatem Foods and closed the Eaststarch transaction. 
We're also making a strong progress in driving operational efficiencies, which will further enhance our cost position, and we remain committed to our balanced approach to capital allocation for our shareholders.
I'll provide more detail on our scorecard activities later in the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, down 30% from the $0.86 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $684 million, down $257 million. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 31% compared to 28% in the third quarter the prior year. Our tax rate was higher this quarter due to some discrete items that impacted us for the quarter, mainly the finalization of some international tax returns. 
Our calendar year 2015 estimate for the effective tax rate remains at around 28%. Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 8.3% is down by 40 basis points from the 8.7% at the end of the third quarter last year. 
The 8.3% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 as well as our long-term WACC of 8%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.
In the third quarter, our trailing 4-quarter average EVA was $428 million based upon the adjusted earnings and the annual WACC, down $178 million from 2014.
On Chart 18 in the Appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.41 to the adjusted earnings of $0.60. For this quarter, LIFO represented a $0.07 per share after tax credit. 
We had gains on the sale of the global chocolate operations net of expenses of $0.04 per share with a charge related to buying back U.S. debt of $0.19 per share as part of a series of transactions to issue a lower-cost Euro-denominated debt with asset impairment charges of $0.06 per share and we had some restructuring and pension settlement charges of $0.04 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items that impacted our quarterly results. In the Corn Processing segment, we had a $33 million charge related to the partial impairment of our Brazilian sugar processing assets, and oilseeds recorded a $32 million gain net of expenses related to the sale of our global chocolate operations in the third quarter. 
As a reminder, our cocoa business remain part of our segment reporting result in the third quarter. We closed on the sale of the business in October and the sale will be recognized and recorded in our fourth quarter results.
Our new fourth business segment, WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, includes the 2 businesses we acquired in 2014, namely WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities, Inc. as well as certain specialty ingredients business that were previously reported in the ADM's 3 other segments. With purposes of comparison to prior results, the year-ago quarter segment operating profit for ag services, corn and oilseeds were moved to earnings of the businesses that are now reported in the WFSI segment. To assist you with your analysis, we've included a chart in the appendix that recap the 2014 segment quarterly results to the new segments.
In the corporate lines. Net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates, unallocated corporate costs of $113 million were within the $110 million to $120 million guidance that we provided to you last quarter. Our run rate in underlying corporate cost is consistent with the prior year excluding the special project costs, such as the implementation of our ERP program.
Also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the Appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $16.6 billion, down from last year's $18.1 billion. This significant reduction was mainly driven by large declines in commodity prices and foreign exchange translation, but these factors also impacted our cost of goods sold as our input costs were lower. 
I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements for this year and last are not entirely comparable due to some significant transactions over the past 12 months, including fertilizer, chocolate, WILD and SCI.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for the 9 months period ending September 30, 2015, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $1.5 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first 9 months of this year. Total capital spending for the 9 months was $819 million, up from the prior year. 
Our CapEx guidance for the calendar year was $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, and based upon our run rate of spending, it's likely we'll finish up the year at the lower end of the range or below that range. Given the more challenging business conditions we have encountered in 2015, we had been even more cautious in our capital spending.
We acquired several businesses this year including AOR, the European bottled oil company and our remaining interest in the Romanian port totaling $83 million. And the other investing activities line, mainly reflects the proceeds from divestitures, such as our global chocolate business and the sale of our stake in our port in Northern Brazil less the increased investment in Wilmar in the first quarter.
During the 9 months, we spent about $1.8 billion to repurchase about 37.5 million shares towards our 2015 target of repurchasing $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of shares subject to strategic capital requirements. 
Our average share count for the first 9 months was 627 million diluted shares outstanding, down 31 million from this time 1 year ago. At the end of the third quarter, we had 607 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.
For the 9-month period, our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was over $2.3 billion. You should expect that we will complete about $2 billion of share repurchase by the end of the calendar year and finish up with about 600 million shares outstanding on a diluted basis.
On Slide 7, it shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30 for 2015 and 2014. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Operating working capital of $7.9 billion was down $0.3 billion from a year-ago period. 
Total debt was about $6.8 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $5.6 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $0.7 billion. 
In part, reflecting the fourth quarter cash outflows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI as well as the issuance this year of EUR 1.1 billion of debt or roughly 1.2 billions in U.S. dollar terms and the subsequent repurchase of about $0.9 billion of U.S. debt. 
Our shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion is $2.4 billion lower than the level last year due to its share buybacks and with the cumulative translation account down about $1.1 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
We had $5.3 billion available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we have access to over $6.4 billion of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance."

Please turn to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $684 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. Compared to the second quarter, market conditions in the third quarter were fairly similar with weak industry ethanol margin",1491,"Thanks, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $684 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. Compared to the second quarter, market conditions in the third quarter were fairly similar with weak industry ethanol margins and then competitive U.S. exports. So not surprisingly, our operating profits were in line. On a 4-quarter-trailing average basis, our ROIC of 8.3% was above our annual WACC of 6.6% and our EVA was $428 million.
Now I'll review the performance of each segment. Starting on Slide 9. In the third quarter, ag services results were similar to last year's but reflected historically different set of market conditions. Overall, despite robust global demand, we saw a general lack of merchandising opportunities as the global market was well supplied. 
Last year's third quarter saw merchandising and handling result, driven by the normal seasonal July, August decline in exports and the normal uptick with the harvest in September, driving near-record volumes out of the goal.
This year, ample global crop supplies, particularly from South America and the strong dollar kept North American exports, particularly corn and wheat, largely out of the global market for the third quarter. 
However, we did see some soybeans exports pick up later in the quarter because of weaker global demand for U.S. exports due to the strong dollar, elevation margins at our export terminals were significantly lower this third quarter compared to last year.
You'll also recall that the second quarter global trade desk results reflected the late quarter market shift that negatively impacted some merchandising positions, and we were able to recognize the benefit of these positions in Q3. 
However, our global trade desk results were slightly down from last year due to lower margins from a more competitive global supply environment and global customers delaying some purchases in a declining price environment.
In transportation, lower U.S. exports reduced large freight rates. Milling and Other results again increased due to improvements in product margins, mix and strong merchandising results.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn processing results declined from the year-ago period. In sweeteners and starches, we continued to see strong sweetener demand, supporting both margins and volumes. Across the subsegment, domestic shipments were flat, while exports, particularly corn products, were limited due to the low export demand for DDGs in July and August and the impact of a strong U.S. dollar on the competitiveness of corn products exports. 
And as our new sweetener plant in Tianjin works to commercialize its capacity, we had to absorb the fixed costs for that operation. And in bioproducts, ethanol earnings were lower. Industry ethanol inventories throughout the third quarter were higher than last year and industry production levels were also higher, causing ethanol margins to be considerably weaker than the prior year despite increases in domestic demand. Our ethanol profitability reflects third quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds had yet another solid quarter. In crushing and origination, strong demand for meal in the U.S. and many of our traditional export destinations throughout Latin America, helped support good volumes and margins in our North American soybean crushing operations. 
Likewise, in Europe, good meal demand drove soy crush utilization. Weak global demand for vegetable oil reduced softseed margins on volumes around the world, particularly in Europe where rapeseed crushing results were down significantly. 
This was another quarter in which our switch capacity paid off, and as the large Brazilian corn and soybeans crop combine with the weak real to encourage farmer selling, origination volumes increased significantly and margins rose, contributing to stronger year-over-year South American crushing and origination results.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and others results declined mainly on the absence of biodiesel blenders' credits we recorded last year. However, North American refined oils had the best third quarter ever from good domestic demand, and the results were offset by weaker demand for refined oils outside of the U.S. and also weaker overall biodiesel margins. Results from Asia rose primarily on Wilmar's improved performance.
Slide 12, please. In their third reporting quarter, the WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit earned $70 million. It was a tough quarter for the team. As I've mentioned, the strong dollar and weakness in some emerging economies affected results across a number of product lines. 
And while these factors are largely beyond our control, we're focusing on the levers we can pull to deliver results and strengthen the business. We're seeing improved gross margins on some key product categories, including flavors, polyols and protein. We are seeing U.S. Domestic business generating good results from solid demand.
We're seeing improved volumes in our polyols business. We're addressing some inventory management issues in our Specialty Commodities business and this issue should be behind us by the end of the year, and our synergy work is paying off as a result of benefiting from margin expansion, cost savings and mix.
The team remains laser-focused on our synergy work. That's resulted in a steady customer and pipeline growth. We have delivered 81 new wins and have an active pipeline of more than 675 projects. As a result of these efforts, we are seeing many new RFPs for SCI, for WILD Flavors and for ADM. And as I mentioned, we continue to see strong interest in our offering and lots of product launches.
Since the WILD acquisition, the team has implemented about $30 million in annualized run rate cost synergies, and we are on track to reach about $40 million by the end of this calendar year. We remain confident that the team will deliver EUR 100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of Year 3, which is 2017, and we're still on track toward the lower end of the $0.10 to $0.15 per share first year accretion for WILD Flavors.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at Investor Day in December. It lists the actions we are taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few.
In ag services, we expanded our destination sales operations, opening offices in El Salvador and Guatemala. In corn, in July, we acquired Lyrco Nutrition, an animal feed business that serves, primarily the baby and swine market in Québec. And yesterday, we closed the Eaststarch acquisition, enabling ADM to better serve growing the European demand as the EU lifts its artificial cap on cereal-based sweeteners. 
In oilseeds, we closed the sale of our global cocoa business to Olam. We closed the acquisition of AOR, the oil bottling company based in Belgium. This is allowing us to better reach the Continental European retail and food service markets and enhancing our ability to export value-added products internationally. And we're adding soy switch capacity to our rapeseed processing plant at Straubing, Germany. 
And in WFSI, we acquired Eatem Foods, a leading developer of savory flavors, having deep expertise in savory flavors and ethnic cuisines and broadening our capabilities in the food service and private brand channels.
We announced the construction of the state-of-the-art flavor lab and customer center in Cranbury, New Jersey. We located the new information technology support center and existing building on the WILD campus in Erlanger, Kentucky. We remain on track to deliver synergy targets, and we continue to advance our construction projects in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U.S. 
And we have made great progress in the area of driving operational efficiencies. We have targeted $550 million of run rate savings by the end of Year 5. In fact, we have already identified a pipeline of more than $700 million. We'll update you on our scorecard each quarter, and over time, you should expect to see the results of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We have a large U.S. harvest in front of us and the U.S. crop will eventually move to the world markets, which will benefit our ag services business. 
In corn, the sweetener balance sheet should remain tight, while ethanol industry margins will move based upon supply and demand dynamics. In oilseeds, global demand for protein remains strong, and we're watching working Asia polyols and soybean oil production and Brazilian biodiesel legislation, which could improve the global vegetable oil balance sheet. And WFSI continues to capture synergies related to the WILD acquisition, and integrated recent acquisitions, such as Eatem Foods.
As you saw moments ago, we continue to make progress advancing our plan, and as I mentioned earlier, we remain committed to our capital allocation framework that was set out at the end of 2014 in terms of a balanced approach for our shareholders.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

U.S. farmers don't like these prices, and at this point in time, they are holders of grain. If we look at their normal pattern of commercialization of before the harvest, during the harvest and postharvest, this year, we've seen that in corn, they probably sold about 30% of the new crop, while normally they will be about 45% by this time of the year. If we look at beans, they probably sold about 35% of the new crop and normally, they would have averaged about 60%. We still believe that our Q4 earnings in ag services will grow versus Q3, but we probably see more commercialization of grain either in rice, that will depend probably on the weather event, where there is a concern about potentially South America maybe later on in December or something like that or with the regular cash flow needs maybe during 2016."

I will qualify the following way, Rob, I think it's at one of the largest exporter of grain in Argentina, our reduction in restrictions and licenses will be positive for our ag services business. And if you think that there's going to be more soybeans coming to market and more crushed than in Argentina, then maybe potential negative for the competitiveness of U.S. meal exports out of the U.S. and it might impact a little bit the situation in Europe.

So probably this year, we may end up lower than that range given the conditions of the U.S. dollar and the very strong crops in South America. But let me give you some perspective. If we look at the last 8 years, ag services has hit that range in 7 of the last 8, and the only the year in which it didn't it was because of this 50-year drought that we had. So I would say at this point in time, we continue to maintain that, that's a fair range for ag services into the future."

The main thing that we can do to help ourselves certainly is continue to work on the cost of the plants, and we are evaluating. That is a constant process to see how much we can help ourselves into that, granted maybe dry mills are a little bit more limited in our ability to get savings and maybe a larger wet mill, but we'll continue to work on that. I will say the dynamics at this point in time, as we see, Patrick, are there has been some good news in this quarter about China getting into the export destination roster, if you will. Some of the plants have maybe came back a little bit later from their maintenance, which provided a little bit of time. But as you said, medium term, we continue to trade as a premium to gasoline, which will have some impact in certain export destinations. That way, we continue to call the net exports about the same even if China is coming into the export destination roster. So it will be -- it will continue to flow depending on how much the industry will produce. We are positive about the demand. Demand is up in gasoline about 3% this year, and maybe it's going to be up 1% to 1.5% for next year. Exports continue to be robust. Ethanol is growing very, very fast in Brazil and now with the increasing gasoline prices in Brazil, ethanol has become a little bit more expensive. Petrobras is in strike today, so they are not producing that much oil, so maybe they need a little bit more ethanol. So I would say, at this point, we handicap it a little bit like the margins we have today going forward, and with hopes into the global domestic demand and keeping those export markets."

Well, at this point in time, we source everything from the plant in the U.S. Certainly, with the strong U.S. dollar, our ability to export to the world has been reduced. There are some countries that have some issues of importing like Venezuela, for example, even if our customers want to get their product. Some key markets -- key emerging markets have been soft, whether it's cold, Middle East, whether it's Russia, whether it's China. And some of these products like emulsifiers or hydrocolloids are used in oil field drilling. And obviously, you see that the rig count going down in the U.S. with less drilling going on as oil prices have declined. So several factors, I would say none of the fundamentals have changed into this business. We continue to be excited. We continue to be building capabilities. We have bought 3 companies in the last year with WILD, SCI and Eatem Foods. They are all on trend. They all on target. So we continue to feel very strong about it.

South America has recovered a little bit and is doing better this coming third in the pecking order, if you will. And then, probably lagging is China, which still have good demand for meal in China, but is hovering into the breakeven territory, if you will.

Think about how competitive has been Brazil in the world market where Paraguay, with the same weather, with the same climate, hasn't been. It's not that Brazil has any different competitive advantage than Paraguay, it's just the real has devalued significantly versus what the Paraguayan currency have done. So 2 things, they ebb and flow and we profited from our origination in Brazil. Our volumes in Brazil are like -- have exploded versus last year and we see parts of that reflected in ag services. So at the end of the day, the good thing is that there are large crops everywhere and we're going to commercialize those crops, but it certainly affects the timing of all that, Farha, and we're going through that period."

The industry, Michael, has to normally take 2 shutdowns for maintenance, one before the driving season, one post the driving season to get the plants back in shape. Obviously, you have this corn dynamics in which corn is more plentiful or bases are lower in the West than in the East. So some of the East plants might have taken a little bit longer to come back from maintenance just because it was difficult maybe to get corn. And I think at the end of the day, with these low oil prices, domestic demand has been strong. And what -- with the -- with exports -- net exports staying in this range of maybe 750 million gallons, and that's kind of where we are seeing this year and maybe for next year, we see the balance is pretty similar to what we see now. Again, I think the 2 positive sides could be if we get another 1%, 1.5% domestic demand growth and then we see ethanol in Brazil be more requested internally, and China -- China went from like 3 million gallons last year of imports to maybe 60 million gallons this year. So -- well what that's going to go -- bode well for 2016. Those are probably positive. On the negative side, capacity utilization in the industry continues to be in maybe 2%, and it should go a little bit higher to see margin expansion."

It may not happen exactly the way we have described it to you before in 4 orderly buckets of $0.30, but let me walk you through some of those issues. We certainly had a little bit higher ethanol margins in our original projections, and we have had those ethanol margins, and as I said, when we stress tested, to more like the levels we have today. We also look at what if the U.S. dollar continue to be strong and ag services will remain in this kind of range? And then, we look at the positives and there are some businesses in certain portfolios that we are recovering that we haven't highlighted to you because there was not a need to divest those business from a portfolio management, but those businesses are businesses that are -- that have specific actions to recover, and we feel strongly about being able to achieve that over the next year, 1.5 years. Then we have operational excellence and operational efficiencies. And as I described in my remarks, when we started to look at this target of $550 million in 5 years and having the $0.10 per year out of that, we are already after the first year, Adam. We have unveiled a pipeline of $700 million, and we continue to find more. So we have programs to accelerate that to bring them faster into the program. We also continued to deploy our cash into these bolt-on acquisitions, and as we did Eatem, we have more in the pipeline. And when we put all these things together, again, the recovery of some of the units, some of the operational efficiencies, some of the M&A, and we also have the ability to maybe even accelerate the buybacks as Ray mentioned that we will be in the upper side of our range this year. Again, we have stress tested, and we look at 2 different scenarios, and we always come back within that range. So happy to report that at this point in time, we continue to see ourselves on track for end of '17 or early '18 deliver on that range."

After that, the business have the lower seasonality. So there was some, as you described, of underperformance, but part was the normal seasonality. So the underperformance that I described before, specialty proteins is we export everything at this point from the U.S., so we're still building our plant in Brazil and the strong dollar hurt some of the exports. Some of the destination markets have issues I described before, whether it was Venezuela, whether it was Brazil, whether it was Russia. In the WILD Flavors, there was some softness in some accounts that are large produce that they came a little bit softer in Japan and in China. Nothing that is structural, nothing that we worry significantly above. And we saw also in the specialty proteins and some of these products that are soy-related, customers actually destocked because they saw the pricing of soy beans and all that coming down, there was not a lot of incentive for them to accumulate products or have forward moves on any of that. So we saw a little bit of a destocking. So the fundamental indicators about the strength of this business have not changed. The pull from customers, the number of projects, the excitement about all these solutions haven't changed. So I would say, just -- it's just an adjustment in terms of destocking and emerging market softness, if you will."

After the second quarter, you will see declines. Third quarter will come down because that's the seasonal pattern, and then the fourth quarter and the first quarter, generally will be the lowest quarters in terms of profitability for WFSI. So I think once you've kind of gone through 1 year, you'll start understanding the seasonal pattern of this business for modeling. The second point I want to make is, as Juan reaffirmed -- and we are for WILD Flavors. We're still on track for the first year accretion. We provided guidance there'll be $0.10 to $0.15 a share. We're still on track despite the headwinds that we've seen in terms of foreign exchange, in terms of the weakness of certain markets around the world. We're still on track towards the lower end of that range for WILD Flavors. And then, thirdly, if you recall, I did provide some guidance earlier in the year for the entire WFSI segment. I said that it will be somewhere above $300 million, $340 million for the calendar year. We're still on track towards the lower end of that range. So I think it's fair to say, the team has done a very good job in terms of confronting the headwinds that we've seen in the business, yet I'm still very, very comfortable that the financial results for this segment as well as for WILD Flavors are still consistent. Again, on the lower end of the range, we're still consistent with what we're tracking in terms of helping this business actually move towards supporting our $4 to $4.50 earnings power over the medium term."

So there is a lot of dynamic into these and as some customers are looking at these and saying, okay, it's more expensive than gasoline, I don't export it anymore or I don't import from the U.S. anymore. We're going to see other customers coming to the market. Remember that ethanol continues to be the cheapest oxygenate and all the other oxygenates are in the range of $2.50 even at these oil prices. So there's always going to be an opportunity for ethanol to replace other oxygenates. So -- but it will all hinge on how much capacity runs and how much capacity runs at full capacity."

At this point in time, we haven't found the end of that, and we continue to find opportunities, and we want to see -- listen, it could be that the ethanol dry mill cost curve is very flat and even if we improve, we don't get the point of differentiation. And in that sense, we will like to make -- we will probably need to make a decision. At this point, we are not there yet.

This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.60. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $684 million. Adjusted ROIC of 8.3% was 170 basis points above our cost of capital. 
The ADM team executed well in an environment very similar to the second quarter. Ag services earnings were limited by lower margins on volumes of North American exports due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and ample crop supplies, particularly from South America. 
In corn, we continue to confront very weak industry ethanol margins, while sweeteners and starches results remain solid amid tight supplies.
In oilseeds, good global meal demand again supported soy crushing results and solid origination volumes contributed to our South American operations, while continued weak oil demand, particularly outside the U.S., weighted on our softseeds business. 
And in WFSI, the impact of microeconomic headwinds, weaker demand from some emerging companies and the strong U.S. dollar, was greater than we've expected. 
We continue to execute our strategic plan. Among other actions, we've closed on the sale of the global cocoa business, acquired Eatem Foods and closed the Eaststarch transaction. 
We're also making a strong progress in driving operational efficiencies, which will further enhance our cost position, and we remain committed to our balanced approach to capital allocation for our shareholders.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, down 30% from the $0.86 last year. Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $684 million, down $257 million. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 31% compared to 28% in the third quarter the prior year. Our tax rate was higher this quarter due to some discrete items that impacted us for the quarter, mainly the finalization of some international tax returns. 
Our calendar year 2015 estimate for the effective tax rate remains at around 28%. Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 8.3% is down by 40 basis points from the 8.7% at the end of the third quarter last year. 
The 8.3% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 as well as our long-term WACC of 8%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 19 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.
In the third quarter, our trailing 4-quarter average EVA was $428 million based upon the adjusted earnings and the annual WACC, down $178 million from 2014.
On Chart 18 in the Appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.41 to the adjusted earnings of $0.60. For this quarter, LIFO represented a $0.07 per share after tax credit. 
We had gains on the sale of the global chocolate operations net of expenses of $0.04 per share with a charge related to buying back U.S. debt of $0.19 per share as part of a series of transactions to issue lower-cost Euro-denominated debt with asset impairment charges of $0.06 per share and we had some restructuring and pension settlement charges of $0.04 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items that impacted our quarterly results. In the Corn Processing segment, we had a $33 million charge related to the partial impairment of our Brazilian sugar processing assets. In oilseeds we recorded a $32 million gain, net of expenses related to the sale of our global chocolate operations in the third quarter. 
As a reminder, our cocoa business remains part of our segment reporting result in the third quarter. We closed on the sale of the business in October and the sale will be recognized and recorded in our fourth quarter results.
Our new fourth business segment, WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, or WFSI for short, includes the 2 businesses we acquired in 2014, namely WILD Flavors and Specialty Commodities, Inc. as well as certain specialty ingredients businesses that were previously reported in the ADM's 3 other segments. With purposes of comparison to prior results, the year-ago quarter segment operating profit for Ag Services, corn and oilseeds were moved to earnings of the businesses that are now reported in the WFSI segment. To assist you with your analysis, we've included a chart in the appendix that recaps the 2014 segment quarterly results to the new segments.
In the corporate lines. Net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates, unallocated corporate costs of $113 million were within the $110 million to $120 million guidance that we provided to you last quarter. Our run rate in underlying corporate cost is consistent with the prior year excluding the special project costs, such as the implementation of our ERP program.
Also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the Appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter were $16.6 billion, down from last year's $18.1 billion. This significant reduction was mainly driven by large declines in commodity prices and foreign exchange translation, but these factors also impacted our cost of goods sold as our input costs were lower. 
I also want to highlight that the GAAP statements for this year and last are not entirely comparable due to some significant transactions over the past 12 months, including fertilizer, chocolate, WILD and SCI.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for the 9 months period ending September 30, 2015, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $1.5 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first 9 months of this year. Total capital spending for the 9 months was $819 million, up from the prior year. 
Our CapEx guidance for the calendar year was $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, and based upon our run rate of spending, it's likely we'll finish up the year at the lower end of the range or below that range. Given the more challenging business conditions we have encountered in 2015, we had been even more cautious in our capital spending.
We acquired several businesses this year including AOR, the European bottled oil company and our remaining interest in a Romanian port totaling $83 million. And the other investing activities line, mainly reflects the proceeds from divestitures, such as our global chocolate business and the sale of our stake in our port in Northern Brazil less the increased investment in Wilmar in the first quarter.
During the 9 months, we spent about $1.8 billion to repurchase about 37.5 million shares towards our 2015 target of repurchasing $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of shares subject to strategic capital requirements. 
Our average share count for the first 9 months was 627 million diluted shares outstanding, down 31 million from this time 1 year ago. At the end of the third quarter, we had 607 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.
For the 9-month period, our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was over $2.3 billion. You should expect that we will complete about $2 billion of share repurchase by the end of the calendar year and finish up with about 600 million shares outstanding on a diluted basis.
On Slide 7, it shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30 for 2015 and 2014. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Operating working capital of $7.9 billion was down $0.3 billion from a year-ago period. 
Total debt was about $6.8 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash of $5.6 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level to [ph] $0.7 billion. 
In part, reflecting the fourth quarter cash outflows related to our acquisitions of WILD and SCI as well as the issuance this year of EUR 1.1 billion of debt or roughly 1.2 billion in U.S. dollar terms and the subsequent repurchase of about $0.9 billion of U.S. debt. 
Our shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion is $2.4 billion lower than the level last year due to share buybacks and with the cumulative translation account down about $1.1 billion due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
We had $5.3 billion available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we have access to over $6.4 billion of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance."

Compared to the second quarter, market conditions in the third quarter were fairly similar, with weak industry ethanol margi",1490,"Thanks, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $684 million of operating profits, excluding specified items. Compared to the second quarter, market conditions in the third quarter were fairly similar, with weak industry ethanol margins and uncompetitive U.S. exports. So not surprisingly, our operating profits were in line. On a 4-quarter-trailing average basis, our ROIC of 8.3% was above our annual WACC of 6.6% and our EVA was $428 million.
Now I'll review the performance of each segment. Starting on Slide 9. In the third quarter, Ag Services results were similar to last year's but reflected historically different set of market conditions. Overall, despite robust global demand, we saw a general lack of merchandising opportunities as the global market was well supplied. 
Last year's third quarter saw merchandising and handling result, driven by the normal seasonal July, August decline in exports and the normal uptick with the harvest in September, driving near-record volumes out of the goal.
This year, ample global crop supplies, particularly from South America and the strong dollar kept North American exports, particularly corn and wheat, largely out of the global market for the third quarter. 
However, we did see some soybeans exports pick up later in the quarter. Because of weaker global demand for U.S. exports due to the strong dollar, elevation margins at our export terminals were significantly lower this third quarter compared to last year.
You'll also recall that the second quarter global trade desk results reflected the late quarter market shift that negatively impacted some merchandising positions, and we were able to recognize the benefit of these positions in Q3. 
However, our global trade desk results were slightly down from last year due to lower margins from a more competitive global supply environment and global customers delaying some purchases in a declining price environment.
In transportation, lower U.S. exports reduced large freight rates. Milling and Other results again increased due to improvements in product margins, mix and strong merchandising results.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn processing results declined from the year-ago period. In sweeteners and starches, we continued to see strong sweetener demand, supporting both margins and volumes. Across the subsegment, domestic shipments were flat, while exports, particularly corn products, were limited due to the low export demand for DDGs in July and August and the impact of a strong U.S. dollar on the competitiveness of corn products exports. 
And as our new sweetener plant in Tianjin worked to commercialize its capacity, we had to absorb the fixed costs for that operation. And in bioproducts, ethanol earnings were lower. Industry ethanol inventories throughout the third quarter were higher than last year and industry production levels were also higher, causing ethanol margins to be considerably weaker than the prior year, despite increases in domestic demand. Our ethanol profitability reflects third quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds had yet another solid quarter. In crushing and origination, strong demand for meal in the U.S. and many of our traditional export destinations throughout Latin America, helped support good volumes and margins in our North American soybean crushing operations. 
Likewise, in Europe, good meal demand drove soy crush utilization. Weak global demand for vegetable oil reduced softseed margins on volumes around the world, particularly in Europe where rapeseed crushing results were down significantly. 
This was another quarter in which our switch capacity paid off, and as the large Brazilian corn and soybeans crop combined with the weak real to encourage farmer selling, origination volumes increased significantly and margins rose, contributing to stronger year-over-year South American crushing and origination results.
Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and others results declined mainly on the absence of biodiesel blenders' credits we recorded last year. However, North American refined oils had its best third quarter ever from good domestic demand, and the results were offset by weaker demand for refined oils outside of the U.S. and also weaker overall biodiesel margins. Results from Asia rose primarily on Wilmar's improved performance.
Slide 12, please. In their third reporting quarter, the WILD Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business unit earned $70 million. 
It was a tough quarter for the team. As I've mentioned, the strong dollar and weakness in some emerging economies affected results across a number of product lines.  And while these factors are largely beyond our control, we're focusing on the levers we can pull to deliver results and strengthen the business. We're seeing improved gross margins on some key product categories, including Flavors, Polyols and Protein. We are seeing U.S. Domestic business generating good results from solid demand.
We're seeing improved volumes in our Polyols business. We're addressing some inventory management issues in our Specialty Commodities business and this issue should be behind us by the end of the year, and our synergy work is paying off as a result of benefiting from margin expansion, cost savings and mix.
The team remains laser-focused on our synergy work. That's resulted in steady customer and pipeline growth. We delivered 81 new wins and have an active pipeline of more than 675 projects. As a result of these efforts, we are seeing many new RFPs for SCI, for WILD Flavors and for ADM. And as I mentioned, we continue to see strong interest in our offering and lots of product launches.
Since the WILD acquisition, the team has implemented about $30 million in annualized run rate cost synergies, and we are on track to reach about $40 million by the end of this calendar year. We remain confident that the team will deliver EUR 100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of Year 3, which is 2017. And we're still on track toward the lower end of the $0.10 to $0.15 per share first year accretion for WILD Flavors.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at Investor Day in December. It lists the actions we are taking to help grow our business, our earnings and our returns. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, we expanded our destination sales operations, opening offices in El Salvador and Guatemala. In corn, in July, we acquired Lyrco Nutrition, an animal feed business that serves, primarily the baby [ph] and swine market in Québec. 
And yesterday, we closed the Eaststarch acquisition, enabling ADM to better serve the growing European demand as the EU lifts its artificial cap on cereal-based sweeteners. 
In oilseeds, we closed the sale of our global cocoa business to Olam. We closed the acquisition of AOR, the oil bottling company based in Belgium. This is allowing us to better reach the Continental European retail and food service markets and enhancing our ability to export value-added products internationally. And we're adding soy switch capacity to our rapeseed processing plant at Straubing, Germany. 
And in WFSI, we acquired Eatem Foods, a leading developer of savory flavors, adding deep expertise in savory flavors and ethnic cuisines, and broadening our capabilities in the food service and private brand channels.
We announced the construction of the state-of-the-art flavor lab and customer center in Cranbury, New Jersey. We located the new information technology support center in an existing building on the WILD campus in Erlanger, Kentucky. We remain on track to deliver synergy targets, and we continue to advance our construction projects in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U.S. 
And we have made great progress in the area of driving operational efficiencies. We have targeted $550 million of run rate savings by the end of Year 5. In fact, we have already identified a pipeline of more than $700 million. We'll update you on our scorecard each quarter, and over time, you should expect to see the results of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. We have a large U.S. harvest in front of us and the U.S. crop will eventually move to the world markets, which will benefit our Ag Services business. 
In corn, the sweetener balance sheet should remain tight, while ethanol industry margins will move based upon supply and demand dynamics. In oilseeds, global demand for protein remains strong, and we're watching Asia polyols and soybean oil production and Brazilian biodiesel legislation, which could improve the global vegetable oil balance sheet. And WFSI continues to capture synergies related to the WILD acquisition, and integrate the recent acquisitions, such as Eatem Foods.
As you saw moments ago, we continue to make progress advancing our plan, and as I mentioned earlier, we remain committed to our capital allocation framework that was set out at the end of 2014 in terms of a balanced approach for our shareholders.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

If we look at their normal pattern of commercialization of before the harvest, during the harvest and post-harvest, this year, we've seen that in corn, they probably sold about 30% of the new crop, while normally they will be about 45% by this time of the year. If we look at beans, they probably sold about 35% of the new crop and normally, they would have averaged about 60%. We still believe that our Q4 earnings in Ag Services will grow versus Q3, but we probably see more commercialization of grain either in rice, that will depend probably on the weather event, where there is a concern about potentially South America maybe later on in December or something like that or with the regular cash flow needs maybe during 2016."

The main thing that we can do to help ourselves certainly is continue to work on the cost of the plants, and we are evaluating. That is a constant process to see how much we can help ourselves into that, granted maybe dry mills are a little bit more limited in our ability to get savings than maybe a larger wet mill, but we'll continue to work on that. I will say the dynamics at this point in time, as we see it, Patrick, are there has been some good news in this quarter about China getting into the export destination roster, if you will. Some of the plants have maybe came back a little bit later from their maintenance, which provided a little bit of tightness[ph] . But as you said, medium term, we continue to trade as a premium to gasoline, which will have some impact in certain export destinations. That why, we continue to call the net exports about the same even if China is coming into the export destination roster. So it will be -- it will continue to flow depending on how much the industry will produce. We are positive about the demand. Demand is up in gasoline about 3% this year, and maybe it's going to be up 1% to 1.5% for next year. Exports continue to be robust. Ethanol is growing very, very fast in Brazil and now with the increasing gasoline prices in Brazil, ethanol has become a little bit more expensive. Petrobras is in strike today, so they are not producing that much oil, so maybe they need a little bit more ethanol. So I would say, at this point, we handicap it a little bit like the margins we have today going forward, and with hopes into the global domestic demand and keeping those export markets."

Well, at this point in time, we source everything from the plant in the U.S. Certainly, with the strong U.S. dollar, our ability to export to the world has been reduced.

Some key markets -- key emerging markets have been soft, whether it's called [ph] Middle East, whether it's Russia, whether it's China. And some of these products like emulsifiers or hydrocolloids are used in oil field drilling.

Think about how competitive has been Brazil in the world market where Paraguay, with the same weather, with the same climate, hasn't been. It's not that Brazil has any different competitive advantage than Paraguay, it's just the real has devalued significantly versus what the Paraguayan currency have done. So 2 things, they ebb and flow and we profited from our origination in Brazil. Our volumes in Brazil are like -- have exploded versus last year and we see parts of that reflected in Ag Services.

And what with exports -- net exports staying in this range of maybe 750 million gallons, and that's kind of where we are seeing this year and maybe for next year, we see the balance is pretty similar to what we see now. Again, I think the 2 positive sides could be if we get another 1%, 1.5% domestic demand growth and then we see ethanol in Brazil be more requested internally, and China -- China went from like 3 million gallons last year of imports to maybe 60 million gallons this year.

And then, we look at the positives and there are some businesses in certain portfolios that we are recovering, that we haven't highlighted to you because there was not a need to divest those business from a portfolio management, but those businesses are businesses that are -- that have specific actions to recover, and we feel strongly about being able to achieve that over the next year, 1.5 years. Then we have operational excellence and operational efficiencies. And as I described in my remarks, when we started to look at this target of $550 million in 5 years and having the $0.10 per year out of that, we are already after the first year, Adam, we have unveiled a pipeline of $700 million, and we continue to find more. So we have programs to accelerate that, to bring them faster into the program. We also continue to deploy our cash into these bolt-on acquisitions, and as we did Eatem, we have more in the pipeline. And when we put all these things together, again: The recovery of some of the units, some of the operational efficiencies, some of the M&A, and we also have the ability to maybe even accelerate the buybacks as Ray mentioned that we will be in the upper side of our range this year. Again, we have stress tested, and we look at 2 different scenarios, and we always come back within that range. So happy to report that at this point in time, we continue to see ourselves on track for end of '17 or early '18 delivery on that range."

But I would say, we've seen both the U.S. government and the Brazilian government a little bit more proactive to be supportive of biodiesel, whether we're going to have different RVOs here in the U.S. which is a guess at this point, but that's kind of seems to be the rumor and whether Brazil is thinking of increasing from a B7 to maybe a B8 [ph]. So we feel positive at this point into that -- my speculation is probably as good as yours at this point, so we don't have any inside information. But we seem to see signs in the market that, again, both governments may be more positive towards biodiesel and supporting biodiesel programs."

I just wanted to start off on the WILD Flavors segment. I believe, earlier, it was mentioned that the company is still looking for that business to kind of come in line where it previously thought it would for the full year. However, it looks like the results in the quarter are really soft, I think $70 million or so is down a lot from what you did in the second quarter. And I know that 2Q and 3Qs are supposedly the seasonally strong quarters for that segment, so it seemed like that segment significantly underperformed in the quarter. One, is that true? And then, if that's the case, what would be the offset going forward that would keep the full year guidance intact?"

Let me clarify to you -- and we are learning on this business it's obviously, because they are new to us. But Q3, we were expecting to be softer than Q2. This business is heavy on the summer season because it's all about beverages and the summer in Europe is very important, and so the preparation for that summer is important. After that, the business have the lower seasonality. So there was some, as you described, of underperformance, but part was the normal seasonality. So the underperformance that I described before, specialty proteins is -- we export everything at this point from the U.S., so we're still building our plant in Brazil and the strong dollar hurt some of the exports. Some of the destination markets have issues I described before, whether it was Venezuela, whether it was Brazil, whether it was Russia. In the WILD Flavors, there was some softness in some accounts that are large for juice that they came a little bit softer in Japan and in China. Nothing that is structural, nothing that we worry significantly about. And we saw also in the specialty proteins and some of these products that are soy-related, customers actually destocked because they saw the pricing of soy beans and all that coming down, there was not a lot of incentive for them to accumulate products or have forward moves on any of that. So we saw a little bit of a destocking. So the fundamental indicators about the strength of this business have not changed. The pull from customers, the number of projects, the excitement about all these solutions haven't changed. So I would say, just -- it's just an adjustment in terms of destocking and emerging market softness, if you will."

After the second quarter, you will see declines. Third quarter will come down because that's the seasonal pattern, and then the fourth quarter and the first quarter, generally will be the lowest quarters in terms of profitability for WFSI. So I think once you've kind of gone through 1 year, you'll start understanding the seasonal pattern of this business for modeling. The second point I want to make is, as Juan reaffirmed -- and we are for WILD Flavors -- we're still on track for the first year accretion. We provided guidance that'll be $0.10 to $0.15 a share. We're still on track despite the headwinds that we've seen in terms of foreign exchange, in terms of the weakness of certain markets around the world. We're still on track towards the lower end of that range for WILD Flavors. And then, thirdly, if you recall, I did provide some guidance earlier in the year for the entire WFSI segment. I said that it will be somewhere about $300 million, $340 million for the calendar year. We're still on track towards the lower end of that range. So I think it's fair to say, the team has done a very good job in terms of confronting the headwinds that we've seen in the business, yet I'm still very, very comfortable that the financial results for this segment as well as for WILD Flavors are still consistent. Again, on the lower end of the range, but still consistent with what we're tracking in terms of helping this business actually move towards supporting our $4 to $4.50 earnings power over the medium term."

If we look at the top 12 export destinations of U.S. ethanol, year-to-date, even within this dynamic, only 2 are down versus last year. 10 of them are up or 3 of those 10 are actually new destinations. So there is a lot of dynamic into these and as some customers are looking at these and saying, okay, it's more expensive than gasoline, I don't export it anymore -- or I don't import from the U.S. anymore. We're going to see other customers coming to the market. Remember that ethanol continues to be the cheapest oxygenate and all the other oxygenates are in the range of $2.50 even at these oil prices. So there's always going to be an opportunity for ethanol to replace other oxygenates. So -- but it will all hinge on how much capacity runs and how much capacity runs at full capacity."

Naturally, if we get to a point in which we cannot improve our cost position to the point of differentiation, if you will, for whatever reason, and if we believe that they cannot compete in a more challenging U.S. ethanol environment, we will naturally look at various alternatives to maximize shareholder value. At this point in time, we haven't found the end of that, and we continue to find opportunities, and we want to see -- listen, it could be that the ethanol dry mill cost curve is very flat and even if we improve, we don't get to a point of differentiation.
