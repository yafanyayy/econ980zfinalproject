Before we begin, keep in mind that our discussion will contain predictions, expectations and forward-looking statements. Actual results in the future may be materially different from those discussed here. These could be due to a variety of factors.

I appreciate your interest and your support. 2014 was a busy and productive year. We started the year as one company with a very long list of tasks to complete and we finished the year as Navient having successfully completed the legal and operational separation from Sallie Mae. 
While the separation project consumed most of the resources here, we retained our focus on our business, delivering outstanding performance and generating strong financial results. Highlights for the year include: Of course, our completion of the separation from Sallie Mae; the acquisition of $13 billion in student loans; we reduced the private credit charge-offs by 18% to $717 million for the year; our servicing skills enabled our federal loan customers to significantly outperform the national average with a cohort to rate 48% lower than all other servicers; we distributed $849 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and we generated $2.10 of core earnings per share. 
I'm very pleased with our performance in 2014 and the resulting gains for our shareholders. The separation not only provide proof to be a catalyst to unlock the value of our business, but also to unlock Navient's potential to grow in businesses beyond education finance. 
While I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2014, I want to focus my comments on here and now, our plans for 2015. Our goals for 2015 can be summed up by one word: Growth. We see growth opportunities in each of our operating areas. 
In asset management, we continue to see opportunities to purchase both federal and private loan portfolios. And while we are unlikely to repeat the volume acquired in 2014, we believe there will be substantial opportunities in 2015 as the environmental factors remains unchanged. Our competitive advantage has also remained intact though we did see what we believed to be irrational pricing on some portfolios in late 2014. 
We also see continued opportunities to increase the expected cash flows from our federal and private loan portfolios as credit continues to improve and we benefit from lower financing costs and low interest rates. During 2014, we increased the undiscounted expected cash flows from our loan portfolios by $3.6 billion, including $3 billion from portfolio acquisitions. 
In our business services segment, while total revenues will decline as a result of rehabilitation fee cuts from last year and the wind down of the transition services we provided to Sallie Mae Bank in 2014, we expect to see growth in our loan servicing business from both the Department of Education and third-party service contracts. We also see opportunities to grow our municipal asset recovery business and believe we'll have the opportunity to bid on meaningful government collection contracts. 
Our success and opportunities in this area are driven by our strong performance. Our goals to deliver industry leading results and to enable customer success while doing so on a cost-effective and compliant fashion. We believe our industry-leading performance, cost efficiency and control structure are significant competitive advantages. 
The improving economy and growth in employment for young workers is helping student loan performance. We also see borrowers making better decisions, allowing them to successfully manage their student loan payments. The fact is that nationally, delinquencies and defaults are declining and Navient is leading the way with more customers enrolled in affordable repayment programs and dramatically lowered default rates compared to the national average. 
With the separation complete, we'll return our focus to improving our operational efficiency. We have a long track record of annual efficiency gains and we are confident we can continue to produce further improvement. 
We are also keeping our commitments to return the value we create to investors. In December, we announced a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion in our common stock. This authority is based on a very strong capital foundation and the very sizable and predictable cash flows generated by our student loan portfolio. 
Given the season nature of our portfolio, our significant reserves and conservative funding approach, we allocate 50 basis points of capital to our FFELP portfolio and 8% to our private loan portfolio. The result is an exceptionally strong capital base, well in excess of our capital locations. It supports our outstanding debt, our capital return plans, and the investments required to support our growth objectives. To borrow a phrase, our predictable cash flow, high percentage of duration match debt and strong capital base truly creates a fortress balance sheet. 
While our outlook for growth is positive, like to remind folks that 2015 related will need to overcome some significant headwind. For example, the rehabilitation fee cuts and the amortization of our FFELP portfolio will reduce net income from these businesses by an estimated $75 million in 2015. In addition, we continue to feel the number of information requests and exams from federal and state regulators and expect the level of activity in 2015 to remain similar to last year. Though these request are time-consuming and expensive, we continue -- we are committed to being a responsible partner. 
We are confident in our ability to generate core earnings per share of $2.20 in 2015 and to generate ongoing EPS growth in the years beyond. I see a company and a team with significant strengths and with the cash flows, performance, efficiency and controls to grow and succeed, creating value for our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Somsak will now provide more details of our financial results for the quarter and the full year. Thank you."

During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on our website beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. Excluding expenses associated",1134,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on our website beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. 
Excluding expenses associated with regulatory matters, we earned $2.10 per share for the full year and $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter. And as Jack mentioned, we expect our core EPS to be $2.20 for 2015. 
Our fourth quarter operating expenses totaled $206 million and $804 million for the year. These expenses included a $4 million incremental costs related to the $9.5 billion of loans acquired during the quarter. We do expect to transfer a majority of these loans to our servicing platform by the third quarter of 2015. As a result, we expect to incur onetime conversion expenses of approximately $25 million and ongoing incremental servicing expenses of approximately $20 million in 2015. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. Core earnings were $82 million for the fourth quarter compared with $81 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. FFELP student loan spread was 100 basis points in the quarter as these assets continue to generate high-quality, predictable returns and cash flows. For 2015, we expect our student loan spread for FFELP to be in the mid-90s.  We acquired $9.5 billion of FFELP loans during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date FFELP loan acquisitions to $11.3 billion. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 in our private education loans segment. Core earnings in this segment increased $6 million from the year-ago quarter to $92 million. Profitability continues to improve as spreads remain consistent and losses continue to decline. Our fourth quarter student loan spread came in at 3.99%. And for 2015, we expect our student loan spread for our private portfolio to be approximately 4%. 
Charge-offs for the fourth quarter were at 2.5%, which is a significant reduction from the year-ago quarter. We continue to see year-over-year improvements in both our total and 90-plus day delinquency rates. The improvement in our outlook for future charge-offs led to a decrease in our position for loan losses was came in at $128 million for the quarter and that's a decrease of $24 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over time and how our portfolio are dominated by high-quality loans. Our highest risk segment, what we call nontraditional loans, is now down to only 8% of our portfolio. And as you can see on the chart on the right, losses have steadily declined across all our loan segments in the past 4 years. This portfolio is well-seasoned with 91% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $98 million for the quarter compared with $187 million in the fourth quarter 2013. We saw a decrease in our asset recovery revenue for $28 million versus the year-ago quarter. This decline was driven by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which reduced the revenue earned from helping previously defaulted federal loan borrowers rehabilitate their loans. The new fee -- new reduced fee structure became effective on July 1, 2014. We do expect our asset recovery revenues has to be between $75 million and $80 million per quarter during 2015. 
The company now services 12 million borrowers with 6.2 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Servicing revenue from this contract was $34 million for the quarter compared with $31 million in the prior year. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 and review the increases we have seen in our projected cash flows from our educational loan portfolio. This portfolio is expected to generate significant and predictable cash flows of $36 billion over the next 20-plus years. In 2014, we received actual cash collections of $2.7 billion, but yet added $3.6 billion of future cash flows through acquisitions, refinancings, improvement in credit quality and additional foreign income. During the quarter, we added more certainty to our cash flows by hedging $14 billion of loans and locking in on $660 million of future floor income. To date, we have locked or hedged $1.0 billion of the $1.9 billion of projected future floor income. We do expect to enhance these cash flows in meaningful ways as we take advantage of the marketplace overall. 
I'm going to move to Slide 10 and highlight our loan acquisition refinancing activity for the year. We acquired $13 billion of loans in 2014 and closed on the $10 billion ABCP facility that helped financed these acquisitions. We do believe that student loan purchase opportunities will continue going forward. 
On the financing front, our ABS transactions continue to attract strong investor demand. For the year, we should $6.8 billion of ABS. Just last week, we priced a $689 million private ABS transactions, which came in at tighter spreads than our previous private ABS deal. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 8.7 million shares for $168 million. And for the full year, we repurchased 30.4 million shares for $600 million. And during the fourth quarter, the board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. All of these activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position. 
On Slide 11, you will see that since 2006, we have increased our tangible equity ratio as well as our net asset ratio, while at the same time, reducing our unsecured debt outstanding from nearly $50 billion to $17.5 billion today. We feel that our debt maturities are well matched to our expected cash flows and our coverage ratios are conservative. At year-end 2014, our tangible equity ratio was 2.6% compared to 2.3% in 2013.
With a well-seasoned portfolio and conservative funding strategy, we believe that the appropriate capital level for our private credit portfolio is 8%. In the past, when we were an originator of private loans, we have provided an additional 4% of capital against these assets. 
And finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 12, we recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $263 million or $0.64 per share. And that's compared to net income of $270 million or $0.60 per share for the year-ago quarter. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the March related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring or reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo prior to the spin. 
Just to reiterate, our core EPS guidance of $2.20 for 2015 includes: FFELP student loans spread in the mid-90s; private student loan spread of approximately 4%; onetime conversion expenses of $25 million; and ongoing incremental servicing expenses of $20 million in 2015; and asset recovery revenues between $75 million and $80 million per quarter. 
With that, I'd like to now open the call for questions."

An example of a big item that we rolled out last year or this fall, 2014 fall, was our mobile web application for customers. And this dramatically simplified their ability to make payments on a mobile device, which our customers increasingly do.

I appreciate your interest and your support. 2014 was a busy and productive year. We started the year as one company with a very long list of tasks to complete, and we finished the year as Navient, having successfully completed the legal and operational separation from Sallie Mae.
While the separation project consumed most of the resources here, we retained our focus on our business, delivering outstanding performance and generating strong financial results. Highlights for the year include, of course, our completion of the separation from Sallie Mae; the acquisition of $13 billion in student loans; we reduced the private credit charge-offs by 18% to $717 million for the year; our servicing skills enabled our federal loan customers to significantly outperform the national average with a cohort default rate 48% lower than all other servicers; we distributed $849 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and we generated $2.10 of core earnings per share.
I'm very pleased with our performance in 2014 and the resulting gains for our shareholders. The separation not only provide proof to be a catalyst to unlock the value of our business, but is also unlock Navient's potential to grow in businesses beyond education finance.
While I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2014, I want to focus my comments on here and now, our plans for 2015. Our goals for 2015 can be summed up by one word: growth. We see growth opportunities in each of our operating areas.
In Asset Management, we continue to see opportunities to purchase both federal and private loan portfolios. And while we are unlikely to repeat the volume acquired in 2014, we believe there will be substantial opportunities in 2015 as the environmental factors remain unchanged. Our competitive advantage has also remained intact, though we did see what we believed to be irrational pricing on some portfolios in late 2014.
We also see continued opportunities to increase the expected cash flows from our federal and private loan portfolios as credit continues to improve and we benefit from lower financing costs and low interest rates. During 2014, we increased the undiscounted expected cash flows from our loan portfolios by $3.6 billion, including $3 billion from portfolio acquisitions.
In our Business Services segment, while total revenues will decline as a result of rehabilitation fee cuts from last year and the wind-down of the transition services we provided to Sallie Mae Bank in 2014, we expect to see growth in our loan servicing business from both the Department of Education and third-party service contracts. We also see opportunities to grow our municipal asset recovery business and believe we'll have the opportunity to bid on meaningful government collection contracts.
Our success and opportunities in this area are driven by our strong performance. Our goals are to deliver industry leading results and to enable customer success while doing so on a cost-effective and compliant fashion. We believe our industry-leading performance, cost efficiency and control structure are significant competitive advantages.
The improving economy and growth in employment for young workers is helping student loan performance. We also see borrowers making better decisions, allowing them to successfully manage their student loan payments. The fact is that nationally, delinquencies and defaults are declining, and Navient is leading the way with more customers enrolled in affordable repayment programs and dramatically lowered default rates compared to the national average.
With the separation complete, we'll return our focus to improving our operational efficiency. We have a long track record of annual efficiency gains, and we are confident we can continue to produce further improvement.
We are also keeping our commitments to return the value we create to investors. In December, we announced a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion in our common stock. This authority is based on a very strong capital foundation and the very sizable and predictable cash flows generated by our student loan portfolio.
Given the season nature of our portfolio, our significant reserves and conservative funding approach, we allocate 50 basis points of capital to our FFELP portfolio and 8% to our private loan portfolio. The result is an exceptionally strong capital base, well in excess of our capital allocations. It supports our outstanding debt, our capital return plans and the investment required to support our growth objectives. To borrow a phrase, our predictable cash flow, high percentage of duration match debt and strong capital base truly creates a fortress balance sheet.
While our outlook for growth is positive, I'd like to remind folks that 2015 will need to overcome some significant headwinds. For example, the rehabilitation fee cuts and the amortization of our FFELP portfolio will reduce net income from these businesses by an estimated $75 million in 2015. In addition, we continue to feel the number of information requests and exams from federal and state regulators and expect the level of activity in 2015 to remain similar to last year. Though these requests are time-consuming and expensive, we are committed to being a responsive partner.
We are confident in our ability to generate core earnings per share of $2.20 in 2015 and to generate ongoing EPS growth in the years beyond. I see a company and a team with significant strengths and with the cash flows, performance, efficiency and controls to grow and succeed, creating value for our customers, employees and shareholders.
Somsak will now provide more details of our financial results for the quarter and the full year. Thank you."

During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on our website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.Excluding expenses associated",1133,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on our website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
Excluding expenses associated with regulatory matters, we earned $2.10 per share for the full year and $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter. And as Jack mentioned, we expect our core EPS to be $2.20 for 2015.
Our fourth quarter operating expenses totaled $206 million and $804 million for the year. These expenses included a $4 million incremental costs related to the $9.5 billion of loans acquired during the quarter. We do expect to transfer a majority of these loans to our servicing platform by the third quarter of 2015. As a result, we expect to incur onetime conversion expenses of approximately $25 million and ongoing incremental servicing expenses of approximately $20 million in 2015.
Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. Core earnings were $82 million for the fourth quarter compared with $81 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. FFELP student loan spread was 100 basis points in the quarter as these assets continue to generate high-quality, predictable returns and cash flows. For 2015, we expect our student loan spread for FFELP to be in the mid-90s.  We acquired $9.5 billion of FFELP loans during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date FFELP loan acquisitions to $11.3 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 6 in our Private Education Loans segment. Core earnings in this segment increased $6 million from the year-ago quarter to $92 million. Profitability continues to improve as spreads remain consistent and losses continue to decline. Our fourth quarter student loan spread came in at 3.99%. And for 2015, we expect our student loan spread for our private portfolio to be approximately 4%.
Charge-offs for the fourth quarter were at 2.5%, which is a significant reduction from the year-ago quarter. We continue to see year-over-year improvements in both our total and 90-plus day delinquency rates. The improvement in our outlook for future charge-offs led to a decrease in our position for loan losses, which came in at $128 million for the quarter, and that's a decrease of $24 million from the year-ago quarter.
Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over time and how our portfolio are dominated by high-quality loans. Our highest risk segment, what we call nontraditional loans, is now down to only 8% of our portfolio. And as you can see on the chart on the right, losses have steadily declined across all our loan segments in the past 4 years. This portfolio is well-seasoned, with 91% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $98 million for the quarter compared with $187 million in the fourth quarter 2013. We saw a decrease in our asset recovery revenue of $28 million versus the year-ago quarter. This decline was driven by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which reduced the revenue earned from helping previously defaulted federal loan borrowers rehabilitate their loans. The new fee -- new reduced fee structure became effective on July 1, 2014. We do expect our asset recovery revenues to be between $75 million and $80 million per quarter during 2015.
The company now services 12 million borrowers, with 6.2 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Servicing revenue from this contract was $34 million for the quarter compared with $31 million in the prior year.
Let's turn to Slide 9 and review the increases we have seen in our projected cash flows from our education loan portfolio. This portfolio is expected to generate significant and predictable cash flows of $36 billion over the next 20-plus years. In 2014, we received actual cash collections of $2.7 billion but yet added $3.6 billion of future cash flows through acquisitions, refinancings, improvement in credit quality and additional floor income. During the quarter, we added more certainty to our cash flows by hedging $14 billion of loans and locking in on $660 million of future floor income. To date, we have locked in or hedged $1.0 billion of the $1.9 billion of projected future floor income. We do expect to enhance these cash flows in meaningful ways as we take advantage of the marketplace overall.
I'm going to move to Slide 10 and highlight our loan acquisition refinancing activity for the year. We acquired $13 billion of loans in 2014 and closed on the $10 billion ABCP facility that helped finance these acquisitions. We do believe that student loan purchase opportunities will continue going forward.
On the financing front, our ABS transactions continue to attract strong investor demand. For the year, we issued $6.8 billion of ABS. Just last week, we priced $689 million private ABS transactions, which came in at tighter spreads than our previous private ABS deal.
During the quarter, we repurchased 8.7 million shares for $168 million. And for the full year, we repurchased 30.4 million shares for $600 million. And during the fourth quarter, the board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. All of this activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position.
On Slide 11, you will see that since 2006, we have increased our tangible equity ratio as well as our net asset ratio, while at the same time, reducing our unsecured debt outstanding from nearly $50 billion to $17.5 billion today. We feel that our debt maturities are well matched to our expected cash flows and our coverage ratios are conservative. At year-end 2014, our tangible equity ratio was 2.6% compared to 2.3% in 2013.
With a well-seasoned portfolio and conservative funding strategy, we believe that the appropriate capital level for our private credit portfolio is 8%. In the past, when we were an originator of private loans, we had provided an additional 4% of capital against these assets.
And finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 12. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $263 million or $0.64 per share, and that's compared to net income of $270 million or $0.60 per share for the year-ago quarter. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks  related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring or reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo prior to the spin.
Just to reiterate, our core EPS guidance of $2.20 for 2015 includes: FFELP student loan spread in the mid-90s; private student loan spread of approximately 4%; onetime conversion expenses of $25 million and ongoing incremental servicing expenses of $20 million in 2015; and asset recovery revenues between $75 million and $80 million per quarter.
With that, I'd like to now open the call for questions."

I mean, in demonstrating what we're doing on that side of the equation and how we're helping customers. I also think that if the loans are third-party serviced, the regulatory environment and ownership of the lender over that third party's performance is a growing factor that is driving the interest of banks, in particular, to sell. And so when you look at it on the FFELP side, that's a very significant factor. But got to oversee a third-party vendor is if it's my own and internal shock for a business that I'm not in any longer.

I appreciate your interest and your support. 2014 was a busy and productive year. We started the year as one company with a very long list of tasks to complete, and we finished the year as Navient, having successfully completed the legal and operational separation from Sallie Mae.
While the separation project consumed most of the resources here, we retained our focus on our business, delivering outstanding performance and generating strong financial results. Highlights for the year include, of course, our completion of the separation from Sallie Mae; the acquisition of $13 billion in student loans; we reduced private credit charge-offs by 18% to $717 million for the year; our servicing skills enabled our federal loan customers to significantly outperform the national average with a cohort default rate 48% lower than all other servicers; we distributed $849 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and we generated $2.10 of core earnings per share.
I'm very pleased with our performance in 2014 and the resulting gains for our shareholders. The separation not only provide -- proved to be a catalyst to unlock the value of our business, but has also unlocked Navient's potential to grow in businesses beyond education finance.
While I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2014, I want to focus my comments on here and now, our plans for 2015. Our goals for 2015 can be summed up by one word: growth. We see growth opportunities in each of our operating areas.
In Asset Management, we continue to see opportunities to purchase both federal and private loan portfolios. And while we are unlikely to repeat the volume acquired in 2014, we believe there will be substantial opportunities in 2015 as the environmental factors remain unchanged. Our competitive advantage has also remained intact, though we did see what we believed to be irrational pricing on some portfolios in late 2014.
We also see continued opportunities to increase the expected cash flows from our federal and private loan portfolios as credit continues to improve and we benefit from lower financing costs and low interest rates. During 2014, we increased the undiscounted expected cash flows from our loan portfolios by $3.6 billion, including $3 billion from portfolio acquisitions.
In our Business Services segment, while total revenues will decline as a result of rehabilitation fee cuts from last year and the wind-down of the transition services we provided to Sallie Mae Bank in 2014, we expect to see growth in our loan servicing business from both the Department of Education and third-party service contracts. We also see opportunities to grow our municipal asset recovery business and believe we'll have the opportunity to bid on meaningful government collection contracts.
Our success and opportunities in this area are driven by our strong performance. Our goals are to deliver industry leading results and to enable customer success while doing so in a cost-effective and compliant fashion. We believe our industry-leading performance, cost efficiency and control structure are significant competitive advantages.
The improving economy and growth in employment for young workers is helping student loan performance. We also see borrowers making better decisions, allowing them to successfully manage their student loan payments. The fact is that nationally, delinquencies and defaults are declining, and Navient is leading the way with more customers enrolled in affordable repayment programs and dramatically lower default rates compared to the national average.
With the separation complete, we'll return our focus to improving our operational efficiency. We have a long track record of annual efficiency gains, and we are confident we can continue to produce further improvement.
We are also keeping our commitments to return the value we create to investors. In December, we announced a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion in our common stock. This authority is based on a very strong capital foundation and the very sizable and predictable cash flows generated by our student loan portfolio.
Given the season nature of our portfolio, our significant reserves and conservative funding approach, we allocate 50 basis points of capital to our FFELP portfolio and 8% to our private loan portfolio. The result is an exceptionally strong capital base, well in excess of our capital allocations. It supports our outstanding debt, our capital return plans and the investment required to support our growth objectives. To borrow a phrase, our predictable cash flow, high percentage of duration match debt and strong capital base truly creates a fortress balance sheet.
While our outlook for growth is positive, I'd like to remind folks that 2015 will need to overcome some significant headwinds. For example, the rehabilitation fee cuts and the amortization of our FFELP portfolio will reduce net income from these businesses by an estimated $75 million in 2015. In addition, we continue to field a number of information requests and exams from federal and state regulators and expect the level of activity in 2015 to remain similar to last year. Though these requests are time-consuming and expensive, we are committed to being a responsive partner.
We are confident in our ability to generate core earnings per share of $2.20 in 2015 and to generate ongoing EPS growth in the years beyond. I see a company and a team with significant strengths and with the cash flows, performance, efficiency and controls to grow and succeed, creating value for our customers, employees and shareholders.
Somsak will now provide more details of our financial results for the quarter and the full year. Thank you."

During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on our website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.Excluding expenses associated",1134,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, which is available on our website, beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
Excluding expenses associated with regulatory matters, we earned $2.10 per share for the full year and $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter. And as Jack mentioned, we expect our core EPS to be $2.20 for 2015.
Our fourth quarter operating expenses totaled $206 million and $804 million for the year. These expenses included a $4 million incremental costs related to the $9.5 billion of loans acquired during the quarter. We do expect to transfer a majority of these loans to our servicing platform by the third quarter of 2015. As a result, we expect to incur onetime conversion expenses of approximately $25 million and ongoing incremental servicing expenses of approximately $20 million in 2015.
Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. Core earnings were $82 million for the fourth quarter compared with $81 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. FFELP student loan spread was 100 basis points in the quarter as these assets continue to generate high-quality, predictable returns and cash flows. For 2015, we expect our student loan spread for FFELP to be in the mid-90s.  We acquired $9.5 billion of FFELP loans during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date FFELP loan acquisitions to $11.3 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 6 in our Private Education Loans segment. Core earnings in this segment increased $6 million from the year-ago quarter to $92 million. Profitability continues to improve as spreads remain consistent and losses continue to decline. Our fourth quarter student loan spread came in at 3.99%. And for 2015, we expect our student loan spread for our private portfolio to be approximately 4%.
Charge-offs for the fourth quarter were at 2.5%, which is a significant reduction from the year-ago quarter. We continue to see year-over-year improvements in both our total and 90-plus day delinquency rates. The improvement in our outlook for future charge-offs led to a decrease in our position for loan losses, which came in at $128 million for the quarter, and that's a decrease of $24 million from the year-ago quarter.
Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over time and how our portfolio are dominated by high-quality loans. Our highest risk segment, what we call nontraditional loans, is now down to only 8% of our portfolio. And as you can see on the chart on the right, losses have steadily declined across all our loan segments in the past 4 years. This portfolio is well-seasoned, with 91% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $98 million for the quarter compared with $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. We saw a decrease in our asset recovery revenue of $28 million versus the year-ago quarter. This decline was driven by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which reduced the revenue earned from helping previously defaulted federal loan borrowers rehabilitate their loans. The new fee -- new reduced fee structure became effective on July 1, 2014. We do expect our asset recovery revenues to be between $75 million and $80 million per quarter during 2015.
The company now services 12 million borrowers, with 6.2 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Servicing revenue from this contract was $34 million for the quarter compared with $31 million in the prior year.
Let's turn to Slide 9 and review the increases we have seen in our projected cash flows from our education loan portfolio. This portfolio is expected to generate significant and predictable cash flows of $36 billion over the next 20-plus years. In 2014, we received actual cash collections of $2.7 billion but yet added $3.6 billion of future cash flows through acquisitions, refinancings, improvement in credit quality and additional floor income. During the quarter, we added more certainty to our cash flows by hedging $14 billion of loans and locking in on $660 million of future floor income. To date, we have locked in or hedged $1.0 billion of the $1.9 billion of projected future floor income. We do expect to enhance these cash flows in meaningful ways as we take advantage of the marketplace overall.
I'm going to move to Slide 10 and highlight our loan acquisition refinancing activity for the year. We acquired $13 billion of loans in 2014 and closed on the $10 billion ABCP facility that helped finance these acquisitions. We do believe that student loan purchase opportunities will continue going forward.
On the financing front, our ABS transactions continue to attract strong investor demand. For the year, we issued $6.8 billion of ABS. Just last week, we priced $689 million private ABS transactions, which came in at tighter spreads than our previous private ABS deal.
During the quarter, we repurchased 8.7 million shares for $168 million. And for the full year, we repurchased 30.4 million shares for $600 million. And during the fourth quarter, the board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position.
On Slide 11, you will see that since 2006, we have increased our tangible equity ratio as well as our net asset ratio, while at the same time, reducing our unsecured debt outstanding from nearly $50 billion to $17.5 billion today. We feel that our debt maturities are well matched to our expected cash flows and our coverage ratios are conservative. At year-end 2014, our tangible equity ratio was 2.6% compared to 2.3% in 2013.
With a well-seasoned portfolio and conservative funding strategy, we believe that the appropriate capital level for our private credit portfolio is 8%. In the past, when we were an originator of private loans, we had provided an additional 4% of capital against these assets.
And finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 12. We recorded fourth quarter GAAP net income of $263 million or $0.64 per share, and that's compared to net income of $270 million or $0.60 per share for the year-ago quarter. The primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks  related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring or reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo prior to the spin.
Just to reiterate, our core EPS guidance of $2.20 for 2015 includes: FFELP student loan spread in the mid-90s; private student loan spread of approximately 4%; onetime conversion expenses of $25 million and ongoing incremental servicing expenses of $20 million in 2015; and asset recovery revenues between $75 million and $80 million per quarter.
With that, I'd like to now open the call for questions."

And so that would be everything from what does it cost to service a loan in repayment, to what is our cost of collecting on a delinquent account, to boarding new acquisitions onto our servicing platform. What we typically do is we measure the unit activities in those areas. And over the years, we've been automating a number of the functions in that space, improving both our operating efficiencies as well as the control structure associated with those activities, and we continue to see opportunities to do that. An example of a big item that we rolled out last year or this fall, 2014 fall, was our mobile web application for customers. And this dramatically simplified their ability to make payments on a mobile device, which our customers increasingly do. And it gave them the flexibility to actually make -- allocate those payments to specific loans.

Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support. 
Later this month, on April 30, we will mark our 1 year anniversary at Navient. We've accomplished much in this 12-month period, and we are well positioned to continue our ongoing success in the future. 
In the past 12 months, we've acquired $13 billion in student loans, assisted over 12 million student loans, servicing customers in their path to successfully managing their loans, added $2.6 billion of projected cash flows to our Student Loan portfolio and received $4.2 billion from cash collections and financings. We returned over $948 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. 
We began executing on our growth strategy, most notably with this quarter's acquisition of Gila, and we launched the Navient brand to our customers. This quarter's results, which Somsak will cover in more detail in a few minutes, continued these trends with core earnings of $0.48 a share, $830 million in student loan acquisitions, continued improvement in Student Loan performance and $363 million returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
While this quarter's results are good, we can and will do better. We need to move faster to grow and diversify our business revenues. We need to decrease our need for high cost unsecured debt, and we must continue to do more to make our business efficient. 
In Asset Management, in addition to the $830 million in student loans we acquired this quarter, we sold $189 million in third-party service FFELP loans, generating a gain of $5 million. The market for loan assets today, including student loans, is a sellers market. While we continue to expect the volume of loans available for sale to be sizable, we often see very high prices being paid. We will remain disciplined in our pricing and not chase volume for volume's sake. 
Given our significant cost advantage in servicing and our ability to deliver superior performance and customer success, our sweet spot remains whole loans, where we can convert the portfolio to our servicing platform. Here, we believe we will continue to remain competitive. However, depending on market conditions, we may offer additional portfolios of third-party service loans for sale. 
During the quarter, we realized $800 million in cash flow from our Student Loan portfolio and added an additional $1.1 billion to our future cash flows through acquisitions on lower interest rates and an improved credit expectations. 
In Business Services, we now service over $300 billion in student loans for more than 12.5 million customers. On the credit front, we continue see delinquency rates and our outlook for future expected charge-offs on our private portfolio improved. For example, the 90-day delinquency rate on our private loan portfolio fell to 3.6% at March 31 from 3.9% a year ago. 
On the FFELP side, contrary to reports of much higher national rates, our 90-day delinquency rate was 8.4% at month-end, and yes, our rate is calculated using only loans in repayment in the denominator. More importantly, for the federal loans we service, we continue to see significant improvement in recent graduates' ability to successfully manage their loans. 
For example, the class of 2014, which recently entered repayment, is showing the best performance of any recent graduating class. In fact, measured at the same time in repayment, their 30-plus delinquency rate is 1/2 the rate for borrowers who graduated in the Great Recession and 6% lower than the class of 2013. These results illustrate the continued material improvement in student loan performance we've seen since the peak of the Great Recession. 
When used wisely, educational loans help millions of students achieve their education dreams and earn a higher standard of living. And our data shows that on average, these borrowers have manageable balances and are successful in managing their loans. 
The federal loan program, however, offers limited resources to help students and families make more informed and better decisions before they borrow. As a result, although overall trends are good and are improving, not all borrowers are experiencing the potential benefits of higher education. 
As a servicer, relationship with borrowers only begins after the loan is made. As a result, our efforts and outreach are designed to help all borrowers understand the repayment options available to them and to help them navigate a path to successfully manage their loans. 
In our asset recovery business, I'm very pleased to welcome Gila to our team. Gila, which was acquired in February, adds a talented, innovative management team, proven capabilities and over 600 clients to our business platform. This acquisition is a very strong fit with our growth objectives in this space, and in just a few months, they are already exceeding plan. We'll continue to look for ways to grow in this space, both organically and through future acquisitions. 
Also during the quarter, the Department of Education decided to not extend our 2009 education loan collections contract. This was disappointing and surprising news as we have consistently achieved top performance rankings and received satisfactory reviews from the department, including the most recent review conducted after their announcement of nonrenewal. 
While the long-term opportunities for the Department of Education loan collections contract remain unresolved, we'll continue to focus our efforts on delivering superior results and the strong compliance focus our asset recovery customers have long experienced from us and count on us for. 
Total operating expenses for the quarter include several seasonal factors that did not repeat during the rest of the year. In addition, we are incurring expense associated with the acquisition of the Wells portfolio, which includes both third-party rates that run significantly higher than our own costs and onetime costs associated with the planning and execution of the transfer to the majority of these loans onto our platform. 
The conversion process remains on track to be completed before the end of the third quarter, and we will produce material benefits in both operating expense and loan performance. 
During the quarter, we continue to receive a number of requests for information from multiple regulatory bodies. The information required to be produced is voluminous and is both time intensive and costly to produce, adding to our total expenses. 
We continue to be responsive and collaborative while providing additional insight into the efforts we make to help our customers successfully manage their loans. For example, in addition to helping our customers avoid the negative consequences of default with default rates 40% better than the industry average, we recently launched a series of webinars to help our customers on a variety of financial topics, including navigating the significant and growing complexity of the Federal Student Loan Program such as differences between income-sensitive or income-based repayment options. Working with policymakers to reduce program complexity has been a significant focus for us. 
Finally, we're also keeping our commitment to maintain a strong financial profile and create value for our shareholders. Our capital levels remain both strong and conservative given our risk profile, and our reserves for loan losses cover more than 2x annualized charge-offs. 
While maintaining the strong financial profile, we've repurchased $300 million in shares, mainly in February and March and paid out $63 million in dividends during the quarter. 
I continue to remain confident in our ability to generate core earnings per share of $2.20 for the year and our ability to lead the industry and helping customers successfully manage their loans and to execute on our growth initiatives. Combined with the $35 million -- $35 billion in cash flows we expect to generate from our loan portfolio, we will continue to deliver value for our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Somsak will now provide more details of our financial results for the quarter."
260005529,290566574,791673,"Navient Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Navient Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. In the first quarter, we reported core earnings of $0.48 per shar",1002,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. 
In the first quarter, we reported core earnings of $0.48 per share compared to $0.49 per share from a year ago after adjusting for expenses related to regulatory matters. Our first quarter operating expenses totaled $230 million, and that's compared to adjusted operating expenses of $207 million from the year-ago quarter. 
The increase in operating expenses is related to incremental cost for -- resulting from the recent Gila acquisition, incremental third-party servicing cost related to the $8.5 billion of loans acquired from Wells in the prior quarter and cost related to operating as a new separate company post spin. As a result, we do expect our core EPS to be $2.20 in 2015 and operating expenses to come in less than $900 million in 2015. 
Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $85 million for the first quarter compared with $64 million in first quarter 2014. In the quarter, FFELP student loan spread was 96 basis points, and the associated NIM was 88 basis points. The full year spread will be impacted by a potential future loan acquisitions as well as future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of unhedged floor income in our portfolio. Going forward, we expect our FFELP student loan spread to be in the low to mid-90s and the net interest margin to be roughly 8 basis points lower than this spread. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loan segment results. Core earnings in this segment increased $3 million from the year-ago quarter to $77 million. Our first quarter student loan spread came in at 3.87%, and the associated NIM was 3.74%. Compared to the prior year, the spread was impacted by an increase in cost of funds in several onetime items, the largest of which was a $4.2 million acceleration of deferred financing fees. 
For the rest of 2015, we expect the private student loan spread to be approximately 4% and the associated net interest margin to be approximately 10 basis points lower than the spread. 
Our first quarter charge-offs were 2.9% or $28 million lower than the first quarter of last year. We continue to see year-over-year improvements in our forbearance, total delinquency and 90-plus day delinquency rates. The improvement in our outlook for future charge-offs led to a decrease in our provision for losses, which came in at $120 million for the quarter, and that's a decrease of $16 million from a year-ago quarter. 
Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over the last 5 years. Our private credit portfolio is well-seasoned portfolio with 93% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. Our highest-risk segment, what we call nontraditional loans, that portfolio is now down to only 8% of our portfolio. We expect charge-offs to continue their year-over-year improvement and our annual charge-offs for 2015 is expected to end between 2.2% and 2.4%.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our Business Services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $86 million in the quarter, and that's compared with $116 million in first quarter of 2014. We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenues of $9 million versus the fourth quarter, and this increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Gila, which expands our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space. 
The decline from the year-ago quarter was driven by a new reduced free structure for guarantee agencies, which became effective on July 1, 2014. We do expect our asset recovery revenues to be approximately $90 million per quarter for the remainder of 2015. 
Today, the company services loans for 12.5 million borrowers with 6.2 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Our third-party servicing revenue increased to $44 million in the quarter with $31 million coming from the Department of Education servicing contract. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9 for highlights of our loan acquisition or financing activity for the year. We acquired $830 million of student loans in the first quarter. 
As Jack mentioned, our best opportunity for loan purchases remain whole loan portfolios that we can convert our servicing platform. And in addition, we may be seller of additional portfolios of third-party service loans. 
Our ABS transaction continued to attract strong investor demand. In the quarter, we issued $1.7 billion of asset backed securitizations, and just last week, we priced a $997 million FFELP ABS transaction, which came in at tighter spreads than our previous ABS issuance. 
In the quarter, we issued $0.5 billion of 6-year unsecured notes to better match our maturity profile to the predictable cash flows that come from our Student Loan portfolio. In the past year, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by roughly $600 million while increasing our projected cash flows by $2.6 billion, which came through loan acquisitions, higher floor income and improving credit performance. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 14.7 million shares with $300 million, and that activity mainly occurred in February and March. We have remaining authority of $700 million under our current share repurchase plan, and all of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position. 
As of March 31, 2015, our tangible net asset to unsecured debt ratio was at 1.25x. 
And finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded first quarter GAAP net income of $292 million or $0.72 per share, and that's compared with net income of $219 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization that came as a result of the spin transaction and an income associated with SLM BankCo. 
With that, I will now open the call for questions."

So I think this is one of the challenges in this space in which we operate is that student loan servicers are deemed responsible for how well or not well borrowers do in managing their loans yet we're handed the account only after the monies been lent and spent, as we say. And one of things that we've been advocating for both on a policy side as well as with on the Department of Education is specifically that, is use some of the skills that we -- and data that we built over the years to help customers make better or more informed decisions before they borrow the funds. If you think about all of the efforts that go on in the federal loan programs today, all the borrowing initiatives are driven towards helping borrowers who have already find themselves in a position of having borrowed too much money or money than they can afford, and we think a portion of that should really go to prevention, and it's not as if you're saying, no, you can't go to school. It's just hopping borrowers pick the school that better fits their profile or understand what the true cost of or the full cost of getting a degree will be and making sure that they have the resources to be able to do that. We have all of that data and skills today. We can use that to the -- with a high degree of accuracy to predict performance and allow for very direct and almost customized outreach to borrowers before loans are made. Of course, someone has to be willing to pay for that, that level of education and service."

The transaction that you mentioned was sold in both ABS and then a residual sale, and buyers are -- I would look at it as being people who are looking at alternatives to just traditional corporate debt. That makes it difficult for us to compete in that particular space. Whether or not you're a buyer or seller, our own portfolios really as a function of the individual cash flows associated with those deals and not so much the price that's being paid, but it is the reflection of what we would expect the cash flows to be, what the appropriate discount rate is and then what a potential buyer would apply in those set of circumstances. So it's to the extent they match up against what we would expect or be different, that would drive most of those decisions."

Portfolios that are sold with life-of-loan servicing on third-party platforms, we can't bring any of those benefits to the borrowers or to the portfolio, and so our pricing is, by definition, less competitive, and those portfolios are less attractive to us.

When we do things in a municipal area, it may be fines or taxes that need to be paid in order to renew their license or free up a lien on property. So there's an added incentive to do that. We like the space a lot. It's an area where we have a relatively small market share today even with the Gila acquisition. We think the space, in particular, offers an opportunity to combine both asset recovery and business processing services to the entities, which help make the business more leverageable from a margin perspective, and that's really where the focus has been in terms of our growth. We do an outstanding job in the education space. We lead the industry in terms of helping customers rehabilitate their loans. A huge benefit to the customer in terms of the value that they receive for resolving a debt obligation owed to the federal government, which does not go away, but it is an area on the guarantor side of the equation, where the portfolio available to collect is declining as loans have moved into direct lending and the contract moves to the Department of Ed side of the equation. We are very interested in winning a role in the new contract in that space, but it obviously has to be at the economics in terms of both margin and regulatory aspects that combined to make it attractive for us."

Later this month, on April 30, we will mark our 1 year anniversary at Navient. We've accomplished much in this 12-month period, and we are well positioned to continue our ongoing success in the future.
In the past 12 months, we've acquired $13 billion in student loans, assisted over 12 million student loans, servicing customers in their path to successfully managing their loans, added $2.6 billion of projected cash flows to our student loan portfolio and received $4.2 billion from cash collections and financings. We returned over $948 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We began executing on our growth strategy, most notably with this quarter's acquisition of Gila, and we launched the Navient brand to our customers.
This quarter's results, which Somsak will cover in more detail in a few minutes, continued these trends with core earnings of $0.48 a share, $830 million in student loan acquisitions, continued improvement in student loan performance and $363 million returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. While this quarter's results are good, we can and will do better. We need to move faster to grow and diversify our business revenues. We need to decrease our need for high-cost unsecured debt, and we must continue to do more to make our business efficient.
In asset management, in addition to the $830 million in student loans we acquired this quarter, we sold $189 million in third-party service FFELP loans, generating a gain of $5 million. The market for loan assets today, including student loans, is a sellers' market. While we continue to expect the volume of loans available for sale to be sizable, we often see very high prices being paid. We will remain disciplined in our pricing and not chase volume for volumes' sake.
Given our significant cost advantage in servicing and our ability to deliver superior performance and customer success, our sweet spot remains whole loans where we can convert the portfolio to our servicing platform. Here, we believe we will continue to remain competitive. However, depending on market conditions, we may offer additional portfolios of third-party service loans for sale.
During the quarter, we realized $800 million in cash flow from our student loan portfolio and added an additional $1.1 billion to our future cash flows through acquisitions from lower interest rates and in improved credit expectations.
In business services, we now service over $300 billion in student loans for more than 12.5 million customers. On the credit front, we continue see delinquency rates and our outlook for future expected charge-offs on our private portfolio improve. For example, the 90-day delinquency rate on our private loan portfolio fell to 3.6% at March 31 from 3.9% a year ago.
On the FFELP side, contrary to reports of much higher national rates, our 90-day delinquency rate was 8.4% at month end, and yes, our rate is calculated using only loans in repayment in the denominator.
More importantly, for the federal loans we service, we continue to see significant improvement in recent graduates' ability to successfully manage their loans. For example, the class of 2014, which recently entered repayment, is showing the best performance of any recent graduating class. In fact, measured at the same time in repayment, their 30-plus delinquency rate is 1/2 the rate for borrowers who graduated in the Great Recession and 6% lower than the class of 2013. These results illustrate the continued material improvement in student loan performance we have seen since the peak of the Great Recession.
When used wisely, educational loans help millions of students achieve their education dreams and earn a higher standard of living. And our data shows that on average, these borrowers have manageable balances and are successful in managing their loans.
The federal loan program, however, offers limited resources to help students and families make more informed and better decisions before they borrow. As a result, although overall trends are good and are improving, not all borrowers are experiencing the potential benefits of higher education.
As a servicer, our relationship with borrowers only begins after the loan is made. As a result, our efforts and outreach are designed to help all borrowers understand the repayment options available to them and to help them navigate a path to successfully manage their loans.
In our asset recovery business, I'm very pleased to welcome Gila to our team. Gila, which was acquired in February, adds a talented, innovative management team, proven capabilities and over 600 clients to our business platform. This acquisition is a very strong fit with our growth objectives in this space, and in just a few months, they are already exceeding plan. We'll continue to look for ways to grow in this space, both organically and through future acquisitions.
Also during the quarter, the Department of Education decided to not extend our 2009 education loan collections contract. This was disappointing and surprising news as we had consistently achieved top performance rankings and received satisfactory reviews from the department, including the most recent review conducted after their announcement of nonrenewal.
While the long-term opportunities for the Department of Education loan collections contract remain unresolved, we'll continue to focus our efforts on delivering superior results and the strong compliance focus our asset recovery customers have long experienced from us and count on us for.
Total operating expenses for the quarter include several seasonal factors that did not repeat during the rest of the year. In addition, we are incurring expense associated with the acquisition of the Wells portfolio, which includes both third-party rates that run significantly higher than our own costs and onetime costs associated with the planning and execution of the transfer of the majority of these loans onto our platform. The conversion process remains on track to be completed before the end of the third quarter, and we will produce material benefits in both operating expense and loan performance.
During the quarter, we continue to receive a number of requests for information from multiple regulatory bodies. The information required to be produced is voluminous and is both time intensive and costly to produce, adding to our total expenses.
We continue to be responsive and collaborative while providing additional insight into the efforts we make to help our customers successfully manage their loans. For example, in addition to helping our customers avoid the negative consequences of default with default rates 40% better than the industry average, we recently launched a series of webinars to help our customers on a variety of financial topics, including navigating the significant and growing complexity of the Federal Student Loan Program such as differences between income-sensitive or income-based repayment options. Working with policymakers to reduce program complexity has been a significant focus for us.
Finally, we're also keeping our commitment to maintain a strong financial profile and create value for our shareholders. Our capital levels remain both strong and conservative given our risk profile, and our reserves for loan losses cover more than 2x annualized charge-offs.
While maintaining the strong financial profile, we've repurchased $300 million in shares, mainly in February and March, and paid out $63 million in dividends during the quarter.
I continue to remain confident in our ability to generate core earnings per share of $2.20 for the year and our ability to lead the industry and helping customers successfully manage their loans and to execute on our growth initiatives. Combined with the $35 million -- $35 billion in cash flows we expect to generate from our loan portfolio, we will continue to deliver value for our customers, employees and shareholders.
Somsak will now provide more details of our financial results for the quarter. Sak?"
260005529,290566574,791792,"Navient Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Navient Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.In the first quarter, we reported core earnings of $0.48 per share",1012,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the first quarter, we reported core earnings of $0.48 per share compared to $0.49 per share from a year ago after adjusting for expenses related to regulatory matters. Our first quarter operating expenses totaled $230 million, and that's compared to adjusted operating expenses of $207 million from the year ago quarter.
The increase in operating expenses is related to incremental cost for -- resulting from the recent Gila acquisition, incremental third-party servicing cost related to the $8.5 billion of loans acquired from Wells in the prior quarter and cost related to operating as a new separate company post spin. As a result, we do expect our core EPS to be $2.20 in 2015 and operating expenses to come in less than $900 million for 2015.
Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $85 million for the first quarter compared with $64 million in first quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FFELP student loan spread was 96 basis points, and the associated NIM was 88 basis points.
The full year spread will be impacted by potential future loan acquisitions as well as future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of unhedged floor income in our portfolio. Going forward, we expect our FFELP student loan spread to be in the low to mid-90s and the net interest margin to be roughly 8 basis points lower than this spread.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loan segment results. Core earnings in this segment increased $3 million from the year ago quarter to $77 million. Our first quarter student loan spread came in at 3.87% and the associated NIM was 3.74%.
Compared to the prior year, the spread was impacted by an increase in cost of funds in several onetime items, the largest of which was a $4.2 million acceleration of deferred financing fees. For the rest of 2015, we expect the private student loan spread to be approximately 4% and the associated net interest margin to be approximately 10 basis points lower than the spread.
Our first quarter charge-offs were 2.9% or $28 million lower than the first quarter of last year. And we continue to see year-over-year improvements in our forbearance, total delinquency and 90-plus-day delinquency rates. The improvement in our outlook for future charge-offs led to a decrease in our provision for losses, which came in at $120 million for the quarter, and that's a decrease of $16 million from a year ago quarter.
Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over the last 5 years. Our private credit portfolio is a well-seasoned portfolio with 93% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. Our highest risk segment, what we call nontraditional loans, that portfolio is now down to only 8% of our portfolio. We expect charge-offs to continue their year-over-year improvement, and our annual charge-offs for 2015 is expected to end between 2.2% and 2.4%.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $86 million in the quarter, and that's compared with $116 million in first quarter of 2014. We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenues of $9 million versus the fourth quarter, and this increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Gila, which expands our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space.
The decline from the year ago quarter was driven by a new reduced free [ph] structure for guarantee agencies, which became effective on July 1, 2014. We do expect our asset recovery revenues to be approximately $90 million per quarter for the remainder of 2015.
Today, the company services loans for 12.5 million borrowers, with 6.2 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Our third-party servicing revenue increased to $44 million in the quarter, with $31 million coming from the Department of Education servicing contract.
Let's now turn to Slide 9 for highlights of our loan acquisition or financing activity for the year. We acquired $830 million of student loans in the first quarter. As Jack mentioned, our best opportunity for loan purchases remain whole loan portfolios that we can convert to our servicing platform. And in addition, we may be a seller of additional portfolios of third-party service loans.
Our ABS transaction continued to attract strong investor demand. In the quarter, we issued $1.7 billion of asset-backed securitizations. And just last week, we priced a $997 million FFELP ABS transaction, which came in at tighter spreads than our previous ABS issuance.
In the quarter, we issued $0.5 billion of 6-year unsecured notes to better match our maturity profile to the predictable cash flows that come from our student loan portfolio. In the past year, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by roughly $600 million while increasing our projected cash flows by $2.6 billion, which came through loan acquisitions, higher floor income and improving credit performance.
In the quarter, we repurchased 14.7 million shares for $300 million, and that activity mainly occurred in February and March. We have remaining authority of $700 million under our current share repurchase plan, and all of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position. As of March 31, 2015, our tangible net asset to unsecured debt ratio was at 1.25x.
And finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded first quarter GAAP net income of $292 million or $0.72 per share, and that's compared with net income of $219 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the march [ph] related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization that came as a result of the spin transaction and any income associated with SLM BankCo.
With that, I will now open the call for questions."

So I think this is one of the challenges in this space in which we operate, is that student loan servicers are deemed responsible for how well or not well borrowers do in managing their loans, yet we're handed the account only after the money has been lent and spent, as we say. And one of things that we've been advocating for, both on a policy side as well as with -- on -- with the Department of Education is specifically that, is use some of the skills that we -- and data that we've built over the years to help customers make better or more informed decisions before they borrow the funds. If you think about all of the efforts that go on in the federal loan programs today, all the borrower initiatives are driven towards helping borrowers who have already -- or find themselves in a position of having borrowed too much money or more money than they can afford, and we think a portion of that should really go to prevention. And it's not as if you're saying, ""No, you don't -- you can't go to school,"" it's just helping borrowers pick the school that better fits their profile or understand what the true cost or the full cost of getting a degree will be and making sure that they have the resources to be able to do that. We have all of that data and skills today. We can use that to the -- with a high degree of accuracy to predict performance and allow for our very direct and almost customized outreach to borrowers before the loans are made. Of course, someone has to be willing to pay for that, that level of education and service."

That makes it difficult for us to compete in that particular space. Whether or not you're a buyer or seller of our own portfolios, it's really as a function of the individual cash flows associated with those deals and not so much the price that's being paid, but it is the reflection of what we would expect the cash flows to be, what the appropriate discount rate is and then what a potential buyer would apply in those set of circumstances.

We like the space a lot. It's an area where we have a relatively small market share today even with the Gila acquisition. We think the space, in particular, offers an opportunity to combine both asset recovery and business processing services to the entities, which help make the business more leverageable from a margin perspective, and that's really where the focus has been in terms of our growth. We do an outstanding job in the education space. We lead the industry in terms of helping customers rehabilitate their loans, a huge benefit to the customer in terms of the value that they receive for resolving a debt obligation owed to the federal government, which does not go away. But it is an area on the guarantor side of the equation, where the portfolio available to collect is declining as loans have moved into direct lending, and the contract moves to the Department of Ed side of the equation. We are very interested in winning a role in the new contract in that space. But it obviously has to be at the economics in terms of both margin and regulatory aspects that combine to make it attractive for us."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter's earnings call. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support.
Later this month, on April 30, we will mark our 1 year anniversary at Navient. We've accomplished much in this 12-month period, and we are well positioned to continue our ongoing success in the future.
In the past 12 months, we've acquired $13 billion in student loans, assisted over 12 million student loans, servicing customers in their path to successfully managing their loans, added $2.6 billion of projected cash flows to our student loan portfolio and received $4.2 billion from cash collections and financings. We returned over $948 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We began executing on our growth strategy, most notably with this quarter's acquisition of Gila, and we launched the Navient brand to our customers.
This quarter's results, which Somsak will cover in more detail in a few minutes, continued these trends with core earnings of $0.48 a share, $830 million in student loan acquisitions, continued improvement in student loan performance and $363 million returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. While this quarter's results are good, we can and will do better. We need to move faster to grow and diversify our business revenues. We need to decrease our need for high-cost unsecured debt, and we must continue to do more to make our business efficient.
In asset management, in addition to the $830 million in student loans we acquired this quarter, we sold $189 million in third-party service FFELP loans, generating a gain of $5 million. The market for loan assets today, including student loans, is a sellers' market. While we continue to expect the volume of loans available for sale to be sizable, we often see very high prices being paid. We will remain disciplined in our pricing and not chase volume for volumes' sake.
Given our significant cost advantage in servicing and our ability to deliver superior performance and customer success, our sweet spot remains whole loans where we can convert the portfolio to our servicing platform. Here, we believe we will continue to remain competitive. However, depending on market conditions, we may offer additional portfolios of third-party service loans for sale.
During the quarter, we realized $800 million in cash flow from our student loan portfolio and added an additional $1.1 billion to our future cash flows through acquisitions from lower interest rates and improved credit expectations.
In business services, we now service over $300 billion in student loans for more than 12.5 million customers. On the credit front, we continue see delinquency rates and our outlook for future expected charge-offs on our private portfolio improve. For example, the 90-day delinquency rate on our private loan portfolio fell to 3.6% at March 31 from 3.9% a year ago.
On the FFELP side, contrary to reports of much higher national rates, our 90-day delinquency rate was 8.4% at month end, and yes, our rate is calculated using only loans in repayment in the denominator.
More importantly, for the federal loans we service, we continue to see significant improvement in recent graduates' ability to successfully manage their loans. For example, the class of 2014, which recently entered repayment, is showing the best performance of any recent graduating class. In fact, measured at the same time in repayment, their 30-plus delinquency rate is 1/2 the rate for borrowers who graduated in the Great Recession and 6% lower than the class of 2013. These results illustrate the continued material improvement in student loan performance we have seen since the peak of the Great Recession.
When used wisely, educational loans help millions of students achieve their education dreams and earn a higher standard of living. And our data shows that on average, these borrowers have manageable balances and are successful in managing their loans.
The federal loan program, however, offers limited resources to help students and families make more informed and better decisions before they borrow. As a result, although overall trends are good and are improving, not all borrowers are experiencing the potential benefits of higher education.
As a servicer, our relationship with borrowers only begins after the loan is made. As a result, our efforts and outreach are designed to help all borrowers understand the repayment options available to them and to help them navigate a path to successfully manage their loans.
In our asset recovery business, I'm very pleased to welcome Gila to our team. Gila, which was acquired in February, adds a talented, innovative management team, proven capabilities and over 600 clients to our business platform. This acquisition is a very strong fit with our growth objectives in this space, and in just a few months, they are already exceeding plan. We'll continue to look for ways to grow in this space, both organically and through future acquisitions.
Also during the quarter, the Department of Education decided to not extend our 2009 education loan collections contract. This was disappointing and surprising news as we had consistently achieved top performance rankings and received satisfactory reviews from the department, including the most recent review conducted after their announcement of nonrenewal.
While the long-term opportunities for the Department of Education loan collections contract remain unresolved, we'll continue to focus our efforts on delivering superior results and the strong compliance focus our asset recovery customers have long experienced from us and count on us for.
Total operating expenses for the quarter include several seasonal factors that did not repeat during the rest of the year. In addition, we are incurring expense associated with the acquisition of the Wells portfolio, which includes both third-party rates that run significantly higher than our own costs and onetime costs associated with the planning and execution of the transfer of the majority of these loans onto our platform. The conversion process remains on track to be completed before the end of the third quarter, and we will produce material benefits in both operating expense and loan performance.
During the quarter, we continue to receive a number of requests for information from multiple regulatory bodies. The information required to be produced is voluminous and is both time intensive and costly to produce, adding to our total expenses.
We continue to be responsive and collaborative while providing additional insight into the efforts we make to help our customers successfully manage their loans. For example, in addition to helping our customers avoid the negative consequences of default with default rates 40% better than the industry average, we recently launched a series of webinars to help our customers on a variety of financial topics, including navigating the significant and growing complexity of the Federal Student Loan Program such as differences between income-sensitive or income-based repayment options. Working with policymakers to reduce program complexity has been a significant focus for us.
Finally, we're also keeping our commitment to maintain a strong financial profile and create value for our shareholders. Our capital levels remain both strong and conservative given our risk profile, and our reserves for loan losses cover more than 2x annualized charge-offs.
While maintaining the strong financial profile, we've repurchased $300 million in shares, mainly in February and March, and paid out $63 million in dividends during the quarter.
I continue to remain confident in our ability to generate core earnings per share of $2.20 for the year and our ability to lead the industry and helping customers successfully manage their loans and to execute on our growth initiatives. Combined with the $35 million -- $35 billion in cash flows we expect to generate from our loan portfolio, we will continue to deliver value for our customers, employees and shareholders.
Somsak will now provide more details of our financial results for the quarter. Sak?"
260005529,290566574,791915,"Navient Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Navient Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.In the first quarter, we reported core earnings of $0.48 per share",1011,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the first quarter, we reported core earnings of $0.48 per share compared to $0.49 per share from a year ago after adjusting for expenses related to regulatory matters. Our first quarter operating expenses totaled $230 million, and that's compared to adjusted operating expenses of $207 million from the year ago quarter.
The increase in operating expenses is related to incremental cost for -- resulting from the recent Gila acquisition, incremental third-party servicing cost related to the $8.5 billion of loans acquired from Wells in the prior quarter and cost related to operating as a new separate company post spin. As a result, we do expect our core EPS to be $2.20 in 2015 and operating expenses to come in less than $900 million for 2015.
Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $85 million for the first quarter compared with $64 million in first quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FFELP student loan spread was 96 basis points, and the associated NIM was 88 basis points.
The full year spread will be impacted by potential future loan acquisitions as well as future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of unhedged floor income in our portfolio. Going forward, we expect our FFELP student loan spread to be in the low to mid-90s and the net interest margin to be roughly 8 basis points lower than this spread.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to review our private education loan segment results. Core earnings in this segment increased $3 million from the year ago quarter to $77 million. Our first quarter student loan spread came in at 3.87% and the associated NIM was 3.74%.
Compared to the prior year, the spread was impacted by an increase in cost of funds in several onetime items, the largest of which was a $4.2 million acceleration of deferred financing fees. For the rest of 2015, we expect the private student loan spread to be approximately 4% and the associated net interest margin to be approximately 10 basis points lower than the spread.
Our first quarter charge-offs were 2.9% or $28 million lower than the first quarter of last year. And we continue to see year-over-year improvements in our forbearance, total delinquency and 90-plus-day delinquency rates. The improvement in our outlook for future charge-offs led to a decrease in our provision for losses, which came in at $120 million for the quarter, and that's a decrease of $16 million from a year ago quarter.
Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over the last 5 years. Our private credit portfolio is a well-seasoned portfolio with 93% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. Our highest risk segment, what we call nontraditional loans, that portfolio is now down to only 8% of our portfolio. We expect charge-offs to continue their year-over-year improvement, and our annual charge-offs for 2015 is expected to end between 2.2% and 2.4%.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $86 million in the quarter, and that's compared with $116 million in first quarter of 2014. We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenues of $9 million versus the fourth quarter, and this increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Gila, which expands our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space.
The decline from the year ago quarter was driven by a new reduced free [ph] structure for guarantee agencies, which became effective on July 1, 2014. We do expect our asset recovery revenues to be approximately $90 million per quarter for the remainder of 2015.
Today, the company services loans for 12.5 million borrowers, with 6.2 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Our third-party servicing revenue increased to $44 million in the quarter, with $31 million coming from the Department of Education servicing contract.
Let's now turn to Slide 9 for highlights of our loan acquisition or financing activity for the year. We acquired $830 million of student loans in the first quarter. As Jack mentioned, our best opportunity for loan purchases remain whole loan portfolios that we can convert to our servicing platform. And in addition, we may be a seller of additional portfolios of third-party service loans.
Our ABS transaction continued to attract strong investor demand. In the quarter, we issued $1.7 billion of asset-backed securitizations. And just last week, we priced a $997 million FFELP ABS transaction, which came in at tighter spreads than our previous ABS issuance.
In the quarter, we issued $0.5 billion of 6-year unsecured notes to better match our maturity profile to the predictable cash flows that come from our student loan portfolio. In the past year, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by roughly $600 million while increasing our projected cash flows by $2.6 billion, which came through loan acquisitions, higher floor income and improving credit performance.
In the quarter, we repurchased 14.7 million shares for $300 million, and that activity mainly occurred in February and March. We have remaining authority of $700 million under our current share repurchase plan, and all of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position. As of March 31, 2015, our tangible net asset to unsecured debt ratio was at 1.25x.
And finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded first quarter GAAP net income of $292 million or $0.72 per share, and that's compared with net income of $219 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization that came as a result of the spin transaction and any income associated with SLM BankCo.
With that, I will now open the call for questions."

So I think this is one of the challenges in this space in which we operate, is that student loan servicers are deemed responsible for how well or not well borrowers do in managing their loans, yet we're handed the account only after the money has been lent and spent, as we say. And one of things that we've been advocating for, both on a policy side as well as with -- on -- with the Department of Education is specifically that, is use some of the skills that we -- and data that we've built over the years to help customers make better or more informed decisions before they borrow the funds. If you think about all of the efforts that go on in the federal loan programs today, all the borrower initiatives are driven towards helping borrowers who have already -- or find themselves in a position of having borrowed too much money or more money than they can afford, and we think a portion of that should really go to prevention. And it's not as if you're saying, ""No, you don't -- you can't go to school,"" it's just helping borrowers pick the school that better fits their profile or understand what the true cost or the full cost of getting a degree will be and making sure that they have the resources to be able to do that. We have all of that data and skills today. We can use that to the -- with a high degree of accuracy to predict performance and allow for our very direct and almost customized outreach to borrowers before the loans are made. Of course, someone has to be willing to pay for that, that level of education and service."

We think the space, in particular, offers an opportunity to combine both asset recovery and business processing services to the entities, which help make the business more leverageable from a margin perspective, and that's really where the focus has been in terms of our growth. We do an outstanding job in the education space. We lead the industry in terms of helping customers rehabilitate their loans, a huge benefit to the customer in terms of the value that they receive for resolving a debt obligation owed to the federal government, which does not go away.

You did buy back a little bit more than kind of the annualized pace of $1 billion. Should we still expect that, that's kind of the number for 2015?

So even though the financial performance on many of our segments of our business was strong, a few",1410,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter's earnings call. Thanks for listening, and I appreciate your interest and support. 
So even though the financial performance on many of our segments of our business was strong, a few areas were not. This quarter's results and our revised guidance for 2015 are clearly a disappointment in direction and impact. 
Our results and the change in guidance were really driven by 3 main items. First, our original forecast assumed we would be able to purchase Private Education Loans this year. Aggressive bidding from others and delayed timing by some sellers reduced the prospects here. While we still expect to have the opportunity to bid on private loan portfolios later this year, if successful, they will likely occur too late to contribute to this year's earnings. 
Also included in our forecast was the ability to refinance some of our higher-cost asset-backed securities issued during the recession. The opportunities to do so have not materialized thus far, but we will continue to pursue them. 
Finally, we've seen higher default rates than we projected in a narrow segment of our private loan portfolio. This segment of borrowers returned to school during the great recession and exited from their in-school deferment in 2014. 
The size of exits also increased to $2.5 billion in 2014, up from $1.8 billion in 2013. We expect deferment exits to decline to $1.7 billion in 2015. These 2014 exits, which did not include borrowers who were entering repayment for the first time, are experiencing significantly higher levels of delinquency and default from prior cohorts. 
As a result, we increased our loss forecast for 2015 by approximately $100 million. We believe we have this issue well reserved for. 
While the impact on our financial results for 2015 from these items is not insignificant, they're not reflective of the larger story here. 
First, our expected cash flows from our Student Loan portfolio remain a sizable $33.2 billion, and year-to-date, our Student Loan portfolio generated $1.6 billion in loan-related cash flow, and we added $500 million in expected future cash flows from a combination of student loan acquisitions, net of financings, and increased forecast of floor income. 
This quarter also saw positive trends in several other areas. For example, we've purchased $1 billion in student loans. We achieved a second-place finish in the Department of Education loan servicing scorecard, driven by our industry-leading default prevention success. 
We saw another year-over-year improvement in new college graduate credit trends and generated strong growth of fee income from our asset recovery businesses, and we returned over $360 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Earlier this quarter, we announced an organizational redesign and a corresponding restructuring. This effort is designed to align our business units to further improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency. 
We created 2 main business teams: an asset management and servicing group and asset recovery and business services group. We also streamlined layers to improve speed of execution, efficiency and enhanced the lines of responsibility in these business areas. 
While the primary objectives of this change -- changes, which contributed to a restructuring charge of $29 million this quarter, which will improve the effectiveness and align our team into the related business groups, these changes will also improve our operating efficiency going forward. 
For example, we expect to see a total run rate benefit in operating expense of approximately $25 million in 2016. Growing our fee-related business lines and improving our operating margins continues to be a major area of focus for us. For example, we have been successfully growing our asset recovery revenue with a focus in areas beyond student loans. 
Earlier this year, we acquired Gila, a $70 million in revenue asset recovery and business service company, to add to this effort. The integration process has proceeded very smoothly, and Gila's management team has quickly demonstrated their capabilities with the successful implementation of a large and very complicated services contract and overall performance better than expectations. 
We continue to look for opportunities to expand our asset recovery and business services skills into new areas. In our loan servicing operations, we also continue to deliver superior results. We excel at helping our federal student loan customers successfully manage their student loans with overall default rates that are 48% lower than all other servicers combined. 
Our efforts to help our customers understand the very complex array of repayment options available to them and select the option that helps them successfully manage their loans. While our efforts continue to produce lower delinquency and default rates, the economy is also helping borrowers as they leave school. 
Combined, these factors are driving significantly better loan performance. Each spring, we track the performance of recent graduates as they enter repayment for the first time. 
Looking at the performance of recent graduates 6 months into repayment, we see that the incidence of severe delinquency has fallen each and every year from a recession high of 22% for the class of 2010 to a low of 8% for the class of 2014, the most recent graduating class to enter repayment. Our better-than-average delinquency default performance is the result of our data-driven outreach efforts that help us reach borrowers and offer affordable solutions. This is why we advocate so strongly for customer contact. It works. 
With the reauthorization of the federal student loan programs gearing up, we've been strong advocates for program simplicity and for tools that help students and families make their decisions about paying for college before they borrow. Today, in the federal loan programs, there are 15 repayment options, 8 loan forgiveness programs and some 35 forbearance and deferment options for federal borrowers to navigate. 
Not surprisingly, our customers seek our help to understand the options they're eligible for and how to choose the plan that works best for them. These federal efforts, however, are focused on helping borrowers manage payments only after the loan is made. Simplifying this complexity and helping borrowers make more informed decisions before they borrow should be top priorities. 
Moody's and Fitch's ABS teams recently wrote about the impact of extended repayment options on federal student loan asset-backed securities. In their view, this may impact whether or not a bond is paid in full by the bond -- legal final maturity date. We actively monitor the performance of our student loans Securitization Trust, including adherence to the final -- the legal final maturity date. 
Since 2013, we have amended 17 trusts and exercised loan purchase rights of $428 million to address potential issues. In order to amend the legal final maturity date, we encourage note holders to reach out to us so we can work with the agencies to modify the terms and successfully resolve this potential issue. 
As the largest issuer of student loan backed securities, we take our leadership role seriously, and we're working with the rating agencies, trustees and investors to develop alternatives to minimize any impact to our ABS investors. These efforts are consistent with our commitments to maintain a strong financial profile for our investors. 
Our capital and liquidity remain both strong and conservative given our risk profile, and our reserves for loan losses cover more than 2x annualized charge-offs. Our capital return approach is fully consistent with these commitments. 
At Navient, we have made a significant and ongoing investments in customer success and compliance. We believe that our success is aligned with our customers' success. 
Since the recession, we've been engaged with several regulatory agencies and have responded to numerous data requests. While these inquiries are time and data intensive and therefore, are costly, our focus is to remain responsive and collaborative. We also make the effort to provide additional insight into the trends we see and the efforts we make to drive customer success. 
We're extremely proud of our track record in producing the highest success rates in the industry. We believe our experience and ability to use our deep data to continue to drive customer success are the foundation of our continued ability to add value. 
Finally, while I am deeply disappointed with the impact a few areas had on our financial goals, I am confident in our ability to execute on our business plan, and I am committed and our team is committed to creating value for our customers, employees, bond investors and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Somsak for a more detailed view of the financial results."

During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning on Slide 4, which provides a summary of our. In the second quarter, we reported $0.40 per share, and that's compared to $0.56",1028,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning on Slide 4, which provides a summary of our. 
In the second quarter, we reported $0.40 per share, and that's compared to $0.56 per share from a year-ago quarter. Our second quarter operating expenses totaled $225 million compared to operating expenses of $195 million from the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating expenses related to incremental cost resulting from the recent acquisition of Gila, incremental third-party servicing cost related to the $8.5 billion of loans acquired in fourth quarter of 2014, higher servicing and asset recovery bonds and increased regulatory compliance costs. 
We expect core EPS to be approximately $1.85 in 2015 and operating expenses of less than $900 million for 2015. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $93 million for the second quarter compared to $72 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
In the quarter, the FFELP student loan spread was 91 basis points, and the associated NIM was 81 basis points. The FFELP NIM may be impacted by future loan acquisitions and future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of unhedged core income in our portfolio. We do expect the FFELP net interest margin to range between 81 and 85 basis points for the second half of 2015. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 and our private education loans segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased by $64 million from the year-ago quarter to $22 million. Our second quarter student loan spread came in at 3.66%, and the associated NIM was 3.55%. Compared to the prior year, the net interest margin was primarily impacted by the interest rate reserve adjustments associated with the increase to our provision for the quarter and higher cost of funds. 
The increase in our provision for loan losses, which came in at $191 million for the quarter, came as a result of the segment of borrowers that Jack mentioned previously. These borrowers extended deferment in 2014 and are experiencing unfavorable credit trends compared to those who exited in deferment in previous years. 
For the second half of 2015, we do expect the private student loan net interest margin to range between 3.83% and 3.85%, and we expect the provision for private education loans losses to between $575 million and $600 million for 2015. 
As a result of the recent performance in our long-term recovery rate on defaulted loans, the company changed its recovery rate assumption on charge-off loans 21%. In recent years, we have been charging off periodic shortfalls and expected recoveries against our allowance for private education loans losses and the related receivable for partially charged-off loan. 
The $330 million adjustment eliminates the allowance for estimated recovery shortfalls and reflects the company's confidence in its long-term recovery related assumptions. Our second quarter charge-offs came in at 2.3% -- 2.7%, excuse me, or $13 million higher than the second quarter of last year. Total delinquency was at 6.8%, and that's compared to 7.1% from a year ago, and the forbearance rate was 3.7% compared to 4.2% from a year ago.
Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over the last 5 years. Our portfolio is well seasoned with 93% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. And our highest-risk portfolio, what we call nontraditional loans, was down to only 8% of our portfolio. We expect annualized charge-off rates for the second half of 2015 to be between 2.2% and 2.4%.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $90 million in the quarter compared with $130 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenue of $10 million versus first quarter. This increase was primarily related to the full integration of Gila, which expands our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space. The decline from the year ago was driven by the new reduced fee structure for guaranty agencies, which became effective on July 1, 2014. 
We expect asset recovery revenues to be between $360 million and $370 million for the year. The company services loans for more than 12 million borrowers with 6.1 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Third-party loan servicing revenue increased to $47 million in the quarter with $35 million coming from the Department of Education servicing contract.
Let's turn to Slide 9 for highlights of our loan acquisition and financing activity. We acquired $1 billion of student loans in the second quarter. And while we removed future private loan acquisition from our guidance, our best opportunity for loan purchases remained default loans that we could convert onto our servicing platform and take advantage -- in order to take advantage of our significant cost advantage in servicing and our ability to deliver superior performance and customer success. 
In the quarter, we issued $1.8 billion of asset-backed securitizations. And as Jack mentioned, we are proactively working with rating agencies and investors to develop alternatives to minimize any impact to our ABS investors. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $522 million of unsecured notes. In 2015, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by roughly $1.2 billion through repurchases and maturities. 
In the quarter, we've repurchased 15.2 million shares or $300 million. We do have remaining authority of $400 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining strong capital position. And as of the -- June 30, 2015, our tangible net asset to unsecured debt ratio was at 1.25x. 
And finally, turning GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded second quarter GAAP net income of $182 million or $0.47 per share, and that's compared to net income of $370 million -- $307 million or $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative position, expenses related to restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo. 
With that, I'll now open the call for questions."

This is what I think makes us a little bit unusual. What we saw in this portfolio compared to other years is obviously a worse default performance as loans came out of fee and school deferment. When we look a little bit deeper at these loans, we saw that this year's cohort had a higher percentage of borrowers who are having difficulty making payments before they had returned to school than prior portfolios. And in particular, this portfolio had multiple occurrences of in-school deferments, meaning that these customers exited school, entered repayment, returned to school, exited school, entered repayment and then went back again, and that's what's a little bit unusual is normally, our in-school deferments are students from the undergraduate side going back together to graduate degree. We're seeing a little bit more students who are working hard to get their undergraduate degree, and with the recession impact, we just -- they did not perform. When we look at our overall delinquencies, particularly our high-level delinquencies over 90 days, we are at June 30, a dollar low for the last year and a low that is -- a rate that is $150 million less than what we were at, at year-end. So I think this issue was somewhat behind us. We -- our reserve policy, which looks at a 2-year window, certainly covers future expectations at similar rates from exits going forward. But both that and the lower dollar amount we think we've got this issue under control at this point."

We have the normal trend we would see in our private loan portfolio is undergrads, which is the primary customer of which private loans are made, returning to school to get a graduate degree. Those are generally positive trends, right? You are getting an advanced degree, and all of the history and data suggest that these customers coming out of graduate school have higher incomes, more stable jobs. In fact, in our private loan book, the best performing segment across the board is loans made to graduate school students. What we saw here is a second group of return to school, which is borrowers who, this isn't true for the entire 2.5 billion of course, but borrowers who did not attain their undergraduate degree went back to more classes, reentered repayment and were back again, and so these customers take long -- took longer to either attain an undergraduate degree or maybe did not obtain it at all, and the incidence of delinquency and default of borrowers who take more time to get an undergraduate degree is only higher, and I think that's what we're seeing in this particular cohort. Generally speaking, every year, it takes someone to graduate increases their debt load by about 10%. So if you're going from 4 years to 6 years, you have -- not only is it taking longer to get to the point of where you're going to generate higher income, but you've got more -- you have a higher debt burden as well.

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter's earnings call. Thanks for listening, and I appreciate your interest and support. So even though the financial performance on many of our segments of our business was strong, a few",1410,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter's earnings call. Thanks for listening, and I appreciate your interest and support. 
So even though the financial performance on many of our segments of our business was strong, a few areas were not. This quarter's results and our revised guidance for 2015 are clearly a disappointment in direction and impact. 
Our results and the change in guidance were really driven by 3 main items. First, our original forecast assumed we would be able to purchase private education loans this year. Aggressive bidding from others and delayed timing by some sellers reduced the prospects here. While we still expect to have the opportunity to bid on private loan portfolios later this year, if successful, they will likely occur too late to contribute to this year's earnings. 
Also included in our forecast was the ability to refinance some of our higher cost asset-backed securities issued during the recession. The opportunities to do so have not materialized thus far, but we will continue to pursue them. 
Finally, we've seen higher default rates than we projected in a narrow segment of our private loan portfolio. This segment of borrowers returned to school during the Great Recession and exited from their in-school deferment in 2014. The size of exits also increased to $2.5 billion in 2014, up from $1.8 billion in 2013. We expect deferment exits to decline to $1.7 billion in 2015.
These 2014 exits, which did not include borrowers who were entering repayment for the first time, are experiencing significantly higher levels of delinquency and default than prior cohorts. As a result, we increased our loss forecast for 2015 by approximately $100 million. We believe we have this issue well-reserved for. 
While the impact on our financial results for 2015 from these items is not insignificant, they're not reflective of the larger story here. First, our expected cash flows from our student loan portfolio remain a sizable $33.2 billion, and year-to-date, our student loan portfolio generated $1.6 billion in loan-related cash flow, and we added $500 million in expected future cash flows from a combination of student loan acquisitions, net of financings, and increased forecast of floor income. 
This quarter also saw positive trends in several other areas. For example, we purchased $1 billion in student loans. We achieved a second-place finish in the Department of Education loans servicing scorecard, driven by our industry-leading default prevention success. 
We saw another year-over-year improvement in new college graduate credit trends and generated strong growth in fee income from our asset recovery businesses, and we returned over $360 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Earlier this quarter, we announced an organizational redesign and a corresponding restructuring. This effort is designed to align our business units to further improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency. 
We created 2 main business teams: an asset management and servicing group, and asset recovery and business services group. We also streamlined layers to improve speed of execution, efficiency and enhanced the lines of responsibility in these business areas. 
While the primary objectives of these change -- changes, which contributed to a restructuring charge of $29 million this quarter, which will improve the effectiveness and align our team into the related business groups, these changes will also improve our operating efficiency going forward. For example, we expect to see a total run rate benefit in operating expense of approximately $25 million in 2016.
Growing our fee-related business lines and improving our operating margins continues to be a major area of focus for us. For example, we have been successfully growing our asset recovery revenue with a focus in areas beyond student loans. 
Earlier this year, we acquired Gila, a $70 million in revenue asset recovery and business service company, to add to this effort. The integration process has proceeded very smoothly, and Gila's management team has quickly demonstrated their capabilities with the successful implementation of a large and very complicated services contract and overall performance better than expectations. 
We continue to look for opportunities to expand our asset recovery and business services skills into new areas. In our loan servicing operations, we also continue to deliver superior results. We excel at helping our federal student loan customers successfully manage their student loans with overall default rates that are 48% lower than all other servicers combined. 
Our efforts to help our customers understand the very complex array of repayment options available to them and select the option that helps them successfully manage their loans. While our efforts continue to produce lower delinquency and default rates, the economy is also helping borrowers as they leave school. Combined, these factors are driving significantly better loan performance.
Each spring, we track the performance of recent graduates as they enter repayment for the first time. Looking at the performance of recent graduates 6 months into repayment, we see that the incidence of severe delinquency has fallen each and every year from a recession high of 22% for the class of 2010 to a low of 8% for the class of 2014, the most recent graduating class to enter repayment. Our better-than-average delinquency default performance is the result of our data-driven outreach efforts that help us reach borrowers and offer affordable solutions. This is why we advocate so strongly for customer contact. It works. 
With the reauthorization of the Federal Student Loan Programs gearing up, we've been strong advocates for program simplicity and for tools that help students and families make better decisions about paying for college before they borrow. Today, in the federal loan programs, there are 15 repayment options, 8 loan-forgiveness programs and some 35 forbearance and deferment options for federal borrowers to navigate. 
Not surprisingly, our customers seek our help to understand the options they're eligible for and how to choose the plan that works best for them. These federal efforts, however, are focused on helping borrowers manage payments only after the loan is made. Simplifying this complexity and helping borrowers make more informed decisions before they borrow should be top priorities. 
Moody's and Fitch's ABS teams recently wrote about the impact of extended repayment options on federal student loan asset-backed securities. In their view, this may impact whether or not a bond is paid in full by the bond [ph] legal final maturity date. We actively monitor the performance of our student loan securitization trust, including adherence to the final -- the legal final maturity date. 
Since 2013, we have amended 17 trusts and exercised loan purchase rights of $428 million to address potential issues here. In order to amend the legal final maturity date, we encourage note holders to reach out to us so we can work with the agencies to modify the terms and successfully resolve this potential issue. 
As the largest issuer of student loan backed securities, we take our leadership role seriously, and we're working with the rating agencies, trustees and investors to develop alternatives to minimize any impact to our ABS investors.
These efforts are consistent with our commitment to maintain a strong financial profile for our investors. Our capital and liquidity remain both strong and conservative given our risk profile, and our reserves for loan losses cover more than 2x annualized charge-offs. Our capital return approach is fully consistent with these commitments. 
At Navient, we have made a significant and ongoing investments in customer success and compliance. We believe that our success is aligned with our customers' success. 
Since the recession, we've been engaged with several regulatory agencies and have responded to numerous data requests. While these inquiries are time and data intensive and therefore are costly, our focus is to remain responsive and collaborative.
We also make the effort to provide additional insight into the trends we see in the efforts we make to drive customer success. We're extremely proud of our track record in producing the highest success rates in the industry. We believe our experience and ability to use our deep data to continue to drive customer success are the foundation of our continued ability to add value. 
Finally, while I am deeply disappointed with the impact a few areas had on our financial goals, I am confident in our ability to execute on our business plan, and I am committed and our team is committed to creating value for our customers, employees, bond investors and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Somsak, for a more detailed view of the financial results."

During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning on Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. In the second quarter, we reported $0.40 per share, and that's comp",1028,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning on Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. 
In the second quarter, we reported $0.40 per share, and that's compared to $0.56 per share from a year-ago quarter.
Our second quarter operating expenses totaled $225 million compared to operating expenses of $195 million from a year-ago quarter. The increase in operating expenses related to incremental costs resulting from the recent acquisition of Gila, incremental third-party servicing costs related to the $8.5 billion of loans acquired in fourth quarter of 2014, higher servicing and asset recovery bonds, and increased regulatory compliance costs. We expect core EPS to be approximately $1.85 in 2015 and operating expenses of less than $900 million for 2015. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $93 million for the second quarter compared to $72 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the quarter, the FFELP student loan spread was 91 basis points, and the associated NIM was 81 basis points. The FFELP NIM may be impacted by future loan acquisitions and future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of unhedged core income in our portfolio. We do expect the FFELP net interest margin to range between 81 and 85 basis points for the second half of 2015. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 and our private education loans segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased by $64 million from the year-ago quarter to $22 million. Our second quarter student loan spread came in at 3.66%, and the associated NIM was 3.55%. Compared to the prior year, the net interest margin was primarily impacted by the interest rate reserve adjustments associated with the increase to our provision for the quarter and higher cost of funds. 
The increase in our provision for loan losses, which came in at $191 million for the quarter, came as a result of the segment of borrowers that Jack mentioned previously. These borrowers exited deferment in 2014 and are experiencing unfavorable credit trends compared to those who exited in deferment previous years. 
For the second half of 2015, we do expect the private student loan net interest margin to range between 3.83% and 3.85%, and we expect the provision for private education loans losses to between $575 million and $600 million for 2015. 
As a result of the recent performance in our long-term recovery rate on defaulted loans, the company changed its recovery rate assumption on charge-off loans 21%. In recent years, we have been charging off periodic shortfalls and expected recoveries against our allowance for private education loans losses and the related receivable for partially charged-off loan. 
The $330 million adjustment eliminates the allowance for estimated recovery shortfalls and reflects the company's confidence in its long-term recovery rate assumptions. Our second quarter charge-offs came in at 2.3% -- 2.7%, excuse me, or $13 million higher than the second quarter of last year. Total delinquency was at 6.8%, and that's compared to 7.1% from a year ago, and the forbearance rate was 3.7% compared to 4.2% from a year ago.
Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over the last 5 years. Our portfolio is well seasoned with 93% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. And our highest-risk portfolio, what we call nontraditional loans, was down to only 8% of our portfolio. We expect annualized charge-off rates for the second half of 2015 to be between 2.2% and 2.4%.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $90 million in the quarter compared with $130 million in the second quarter of 2014. We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenue of $10 million versus first quarter. This increase was primarily related to the full integration of Gila, which expands our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space. The decline from the year ago was driven by the new reduced fee structure for guarantee agencies, which became effective on July 1, 2014. 
We expect asset recovery revenues to be between $360 million and $370 million for the year. The company services loans for more than 12 million borrowers with 6.1 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Third-party loan servicing revenue increased to $47 million in the quarter with $35 million coming from the Department of Education servicing contract.
Let's turn to Slide 9 for highlights of our loan acquisition and financing activity. We acquired $1 billion of student loans in the second quarter. And while we removed future private loan acquisitions from our guidance, our best opportunity for loan purchases remain default loans that we could convert onto our servicing platform and take advantage -- in order to take advantage of our significant cost advantage in servicing and our ability to deliver superior performance and customer success. 
In the quarter, we issued $1.8 billion of asset-backed securitizations. And as Jack mentioned, we are proactively working with rating agencies and investors to develop alternatives to minimize any impact to our ABS investors. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $522 million of unsecured notes. In 2015, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by roughly $1.2 billion through repurchases and maturities. 
In the quarter, we've repurchased 15.2 million shares with $300 million. We do have remaining authority of $400 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining strong capital position. And as of the -- June 30, 2015, our tangible net asset to unsecured debt ratio was at 1.25x. 
And finally, turning GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded second quarter GAAP net income of $182 million or $0.47 per share, and that's compared to net income of 370 -- $307 million or $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo. 
With that, I'll now open the call for questions."

This is what I think makes us a little bit unusual. What we saw in this portfolio compared to other years is obviously a worse default performance as the loans came out of fee and school deferment. When we looked a little bit deeper at these loans, we saw that this year's cohort had a higher percentage of borrowers who are having difficulty making payments before they had returned to school than prior portfolios. And in particular, this portfolio had multiple occurrences of in-school deferments, meaning that these customers exited school, entered repayment, returned to school, exited school, entered repayment and then went back again. And that's what's a little bit unusual is normally our in-school deferments are students from the undergraduate side going back together to graduate degree and here I think we're seeing a little bit more students who are working hard to get their undergraduate degree, and with the recession impact, we just -- they did not perform. When we look at our overall delinquencies, particularly our high-level delinquencies over 90 days, we are at June 30, $1 low for the last year and a low that is -- a rate that is $150 million less than what we were at, at year-end. So I think this issue is somewhat behind us. We -- our reserve policy, which looks at a 2-year window, certainly covers future expectations at similar rates from exits going forward. But both that and the lower dollar amount, we think we've got this issue under control at this point."

So as loans mature and they actually become less costly, they can become less costly to service if they're making payments on a regular scheduled time frame. Our big drivers of servicing expense are the number of units we're adding as we increase the number of accounts we are servicing for the Department of Education. So if you look at our business on the loan servicing side as an example, our account load has actually increased over the last 3 years even though our loan portfolio is amortizing down, right? Because we're adding new business and revenues associated with that. In the asset recovery side of the equation, we have a similar activity of our FFELP-related work loads are decreasing, but our other workloads, particularly outside of the education lending space, have been increasing.

And look, the people return to school for multiple reasons, right? We have -- the normal trend we would see in our private loan portfolio is undergrads, which is the primary customer of which private loans are made, returning to school to get a graduate degree. Those are generally positive trends, right? You are getting an advanced degree, and all of the history and data suggest that these customers coming out of graduate school have higher incomes, more stable jobs. In fact, in our private loan book, the best performing segment across the board is loans made to graduate school students. What we saw here is a second group of return to school, which is borrowers who -- this isn't true for the entire 2.5 billion of course, but borrowers who did not obtain their undergraduate degree went back, have took more classes, reentered repayment and were back again. And so these customers take long -- took longer to either obtain an undergraduate degree or maybe did not obtained it at all. And the incidence of delinquency and default on borrowers who take more time to get an undergraduate degree is certainly higher, and I think that's what we're seeing in this particular cohort. Generally speaking, every year, it takes someone to graduate increases their debt load by about 10%. So if you're going from 4 years to 6 years, you have -- not only has it taken you longer to get to the point of where you're going to generate higher income, but you've got more -- you have a higher debt burden as well. I would describe this pool and the losses coming more from customers who didn't complete their degree."

It brings in -- because there's no financing requirements and because the servicing is structured as part of the agreement, it brings in buyers who were not traditional buyers, and they're willing to pay higher prices than we would pay.

Good morning everybody, and welcome to our second quarter's earnings call. Thanks for listening, and I appreciate your interest and support. So even though the financial performance on many of our segments of our business was strong, a few",1406,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning everybody, and welcome to our second quarter's earnings call. Thanks for listening, and I appreciate your interest and support. 
So even though the financial performance on many of our segments of our business was strong, a few areas were not. This quarter's results and our revised guidance for 2015 are clearly a disappointment in direction and impact. 
Our results and the change in guidance were really driven by 3 main items. First, our original forecast assumed we would be able to purchase private education loans this year. Aggressive bidding from others and delayed timing by some sellers reduced the prospects here. While we still expect to have the opportunity to bid on private loan portfolios later this year, if successful, they will likely occur too late to contribute to this year's earnings. 
Also included in our forecast was the ability to refinance some of our higher-cost asset-backed securities issued during the recession. The opportunities to do so have not materialized thus far, but we will continue to pursue them. 
Finally, we've seen higher default rates than we projected in a narrow segment of our private loan portfolio. This segment of borrowers returned to school during the Great Recession and exited from their in-school deferment in 2014. The size of exits also increased to $2.5 billion in 2014, up from $1.8 billion in 2013. We expect deferment exits to decline to $1.7 billion in 2015.
These 2014 exits, which do not include borrowers who are entering repayment for the first time, are experiencing significantly higher levels of delinquency and default than prior cohorts. As a result, we increased our loss forecast for 2015 by approximately $100 million. We believe we have this issue well reserved for. 
While the impact on our financial results for 2015 from these items is not insignificant, they're not reflective of the larger story here. First, our expected cash flows from our student loan portfolio remain a sizable $33.2 billion, and year-to-date, our student loan portfolio generated $1.6 billion in loan-related cash flow, and we added $500 million in expected future cash flows from a combination of student loan acquisitions, net of financings, and increased forecast of floor income. 
This quarter also saw positive trends in several other areas. For example, we purchased $1 billion in student loans. We achieved a second-place finish in the Department of Education loans servicing scorecard, driven by our industry-leading default prevention success. 
We saw another year-over-year improvement in new college graduate credit trends and generated strong growth in fee income from our asset recovery businesses, and we returned over $360 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Earlier this quarter, we announced an organizational redesign and a corresponding restructuring. This effort is designed to align our business units to further improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency. 
We created 2 main business teams: an asset management and servicing group, and asset recovery and business services group. We also streamlined layers to improve speed of execution, efficiency and enhance the lines of responsibility in these business areas. 
While the primary objectives of these change -- changes, which contributed to a restructuring charge of $29 million this quarter, which will improve the effectiveness and align our team into the related business groups, these changes will also improve our operating efficiency going forward. For example, we expect to see a total run-rate benefit in operating expense of approximately $25 million in 2016.
Growing our fee-related business lines and improving our operating margins continues to be a major area of focus for us. For example, we have been successfully growing our asset recovery revenue with a focus in areas beyond student loans. 
Earlier this year, we acquired Gila, a $70 million in revenue asset recovery and business service company, to add to this effort. The integration process has proceeded very smoothly, and Gila's management team has quickly demonstrated their capabilities with the successful implementation of a large and very complicated services contract and overall performance better than expectations. 
We continue to look for opportunities to expand our asset recovery and business services skills into new areas. In our loan servicing operations, we also continue to deliver superior results. We excel at helping our federal student loan customers successfully manage their student loans, with overall default rates that are 48% lower than all other servicers combined. 
Our efforts to help our customers understand the very complex array of repayment options available to them and select the option that helps them successfully manage their loans. While our efforts continue to produce lower delinquency and default rates, the economy is also helping borrowers as they leave school. Combined, these factors are driving significantly better loan performance.
Each spring, we track the performance of recent graduates as they enter repayment for the first time. Looking at the performance of recent graduates 6 months into repayment, we see that the incidence of severe delinquency has fallen each and every year from a recession high of 22% for the class of 2010 to a low of 8% for the class of 2014, the most recent graduating class to enter repayment. Our better-than-average delinquency and default performance is the result of our data-driven outreach efforts that help us reach borrowers and offer affordable solutions. This is why we advocate so strongly for customer contact. It works. 
With the reauthorization of the Federal Student Loan Programs gearing up, we've been strong advocates for program simplicity and for tools that help students and families make better decisions about paying for college before they borrow. Today, in the federal loan programs, there are 15 repayment options, 8 loan-forgiveness programs and some 35 forbearance and deferment options for federal borrowers to navigate. 
Not surprisingly, our customers seek our help to understand the options they're eligible for and how to choose the plan that works best for them. These federal efforts, however, are focused on helping borrowers manage payments only after the loan is made. Simplifying this complexity and helping borrowers make more informed decisions before they borrow should be top priorities. 
Moody's and Fitch's ABS teams recently wrote about the impact of extended repayment options on federal student loan asset-backed securities. In their view, this may impact whether or not a bond is paid in full by the bond's legal final maturity date. We actively monitor the performance of our student loan securitization trust, including adherence to the final -- the legal final maturity date. 
Since 2013, we have amended 17 trusts and exercised loan purchase rights of $428 million to address potential issues here. In order to amend the legal final maturity date, we encourage note holders to reach out to us so we can work with the agencies to modify the terms and successfully resolve this potential issue. 
As the largest issuer of student loan-backed securities, we take our leadership role seriously, and we're working with the rating agencies, trustees and investors to develop alternatives to minimize any impact to our ABS investors.
These efforts are consistent with our commitment to maintain a strong financial profile for our investors. Our capital and liquidity remain both strong and conservative given our risk profile, and our reserves for loan losses cover more than 2x annualized charge-offs. Our capital return approach is fully consistent with these commitments. 
At Navient, we have made significant and ongoing investments in customer success and compliance. We believe that our success is aligned with our customers' success. 
Since the recession, we've been engaged with several regulatory agencies and have responded to numerous data requests. While these inquiries are time and data intensive, and therefore costly, our focus is to remain responsive and collaborative.
We also make the effort to provide additional insight into the trends we see and the efforts we make to drive customer success. We're extremely proud of our track record in producing the highest success rates in the industry. We believe our experience and ability to use our deep data to continue to drive customer success are the foundation of our continued ability to add value. 
Finally, while I am deeply disappointed with the impact a few areas had on our financial goals, I am confident in our ability to execute on our business plan, and I am committed and our team is committed to creating value for our customers, employees, bond investors and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Somsak for a more detailed view of the financial results."

During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning on Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. In the second quarter, we reported $0.40 per share, and that's comp",1032,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning on Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings. 
In the second quarter, we reported $0.40 per share, and that's compared to $0.56 per share from the year-ago quarter.
Our second quarter operating expenses totaled $225 million compared to operating expenses of $195 million from the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating expenses related to incremental costs resulting from the recent acquisition of Gila, incremental third-party servicing costs related to the $8.5 billion of loans acquired in fourth quarter of 2014, higher servicing and asset recovery bonds [ph], and increased regulatory compliance costs. We expect core EPS to be approximately $1.85 in 2015 and operating expenses of less than $900 million for 2015. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $93 million for the second quarter compared to $72 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the quarter, the FFELP student loan spread was 91 basis points, and the associated NIM was 81 basis points. The FFELP NIM may be impacted by future loan acquisitions and future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of unhedged core income in our portfolio. We do expect the FFELP net interest margin to range between 81 and 85 basis points for the second half of 2015. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 and our private education loans segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased by $64 million from the year-ago quarter to $22 million. Our second quarter student loan spread came in at 3.66%, and the associated NIM was 3.55%. Compared to the prior year, the net interest margin was primarily impacted by the interest rate reserve adjustments associated with the increase to our provision for the quarter and higher cost of funds. 
The increase in our provision for loan losses, which came in at $191 million for the quarter, came as a result of the segment of borrowers that Jack mentioned previously. These borrowers exited deferment in 2014 and are experiencing unfavorable credit trends compared to those who exited deferment previous years. 
For the second half of 2015, we do expect the private student loan net interest margin to range between 3.83% and 3.85%, and we expect the provision for private education loans losses to between $575 million and $600 million for 2015. 
As a result of the recent performance in our long-term recovery rate on defaulted loans, the company changed its recovery rate assumption on charge-off loans to 21%. In recent years, we have been charging off periodic shortfalls and expected recoveries against our allowance for private education loans losses and the related receivable for partially charged-off loans. 
The $330 million adjustment eliminates the allowance for estimated recovery shortfalls and reflects the company's confidence in its long-term recovery rate assumptions. Our second quarter charge-offs came in at 2.3% -- 2.7%, excuse me, or $13 million higher than the second quarter of last year. Total delinquency was at 6.8%, and that's compared to 7.1% from a year ago. And the forbearance rate was 3.7% compared to 4.2% from a year ago.
Slide 7 shows our asset quality trends over the last 5 years. Our portfolio is well seasoned, with 93% of our loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments. And our highest-risk portfolio, what we call nontraditional loans, was down to only 8% of our portfolio. We expect annualized charge-off rates for the second half of 2015 to be between 2.2% and 2.4%.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings were $90 million in the quarter compared with $130 million in the second quarter of 2014. We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenue of $10 million versus the first quarter. This increase was primarily related to the full integration of Gila, which expands our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space. The decline from the year ago was driven by the new reduced fee structure for guarantee agencies, which became effective on July 1, 2014. 
We expect asset recovery revenues to be between $360 million and $370 million for the year. The company services loans for more than 12 million borrowers, with 6.1 million borrowers under the Department of Education servicing contract. Third-party loan servicing revenue increased to $47 million in the quarter, with $35 million coming from the Department of Education servicing contract.
Let's turn to Slide 9 for highlights of our loan acquisition and financing activity. We acquired $1 billion of student loans in the second quarter. And while we removed future private loan acquisitions from our guidance, our best opportunity for loan purchases remain default loans that we could convert onto our servicing platform and take advantage -- in order to take advantage of our significant cost advantage in servicing and our ability to deliver superior performance and customer success. 
In the quarter, we issued $1.8 billion of asset-backed securitizations. And as Jack mentioned, we are proactively working with rating agencies and investors to develop alternatives to minimize any impact to our ABS investors. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $522 million of unsecured notes. In 2015, we have reduced our unsecured debt outstanding by roughly $1.2 billion through repurchases and maturities. 
In the quarter, we've repurchased 15.2 million shares with $300 million. We do have remaining authority of $400 million under our current share repurchase plan. All of this activity was undertaken while maintaining a strong capital position. And as of the -- June 30, 2015, our tangible net asset to unsecured debt ratio was at 1.25x. 
And finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded second quarter GAAP net income of $182 million or $0.47 per share, and that's compared to net income of 370 -- $307 million or $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP results are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo. 
With that, I'll now open the call for questions."

This is what I think makes us a little bit unusual. What we saw in this portfolio compared to other years is obviously a worse default performance as the loans came out of the in-school deferment. When we looked a little bit deeper at these loans, we saw that this year's cohort had a higher percentage of borrowers who are having difficulty making payments before they had returned to school than prior portfolios. And in particular, this portfolio had multiple occurrences of in-school deferments, meaning that these customers exited school, entered repayment, returned to school, exited school, entered repayment and then went back again. And that's what's a little bit unusual is normally our in-school deferments are students from the undergraduate side going back to get a graduate degree, and here I think we're seeing a little bit more students who are working hard to get their undergraduate degree, and with the recession impact, we just -- they did not perform. When we look at our overall delinquencies, particularly our high-level delinquencies over 90 days, we are, at June 30, a dollar low for the last year and a low that is -- a rate that is $150 million less than what we were at, at year-end. So I think this issue is somewhat behind us. We -- our reserve policy, which looks at a 2-year window, certainly covers future expectations at similar rates from exits going forward. But both that and the lower dollar amount, we think we've got this issue under control at this point."

But when we look at our operating expense items here, they're driven -- a good portion of them are driven by the variable nature of our revenues. So as loans mature and they actually become less costly, they can become less costly to service if they're making payments on a regular scheduled time frame. Our big drivers of servicing expense are the number of units we're adding as we increase the number of accounts we are servicing for the Department of Education. So if you look at our business on the loan servicing side as an example, our account load has actually increased over the last 3 years even though our loan portfolio is amortizing down, right? Because we're adding new business and revenues associated with that. In the asset recovery side of the equation, we have a similar activity of our FFELP-related workloads are decreasing, but our other workloads, particularly outside of the education lending space, have been increasing. So to some extent, operating expense is a function of the revenue drivers that we have going. And my preference is, of course, to see revenues increasing."

And look, the people return to school for multiple reasons, right? We have -- the normal trend we would see in our private loan portfolio is undergrads, which is the primary customer of which private loans are made, returning to school to get a graduate degree. Those are generally positive trends, right? You are getting an advanced degree, and all of the history and data suggest that these customers coming out of graduate school have higher incomes, more stable jobs. In fact, in our private loan book, the best performing segment across the board is loans made to graduate school students. What we saw here is a second group return to school, which is borrowers who -- this isn't true for the entire $2.5 billion of course, but borrowers who did not obtain their undergraduate degree, went back, took more classes, reentered repayment and were back again. And so these customers take long -- took longer to either obtain an undergraduate degree or maybe did not obtain it at all. And the incidence of delinquency and default on borrowers who take more time to get an undergraduate degree is certainly higher, and I think that's what we're seeing in this particular cohort. Generally speaking, every year it takes someone to graduate increases their debt load by about 10%. So if you're going from 4 years to 6 years, you have -- not only has it taken you longer to get to the point of where you're going to generate higher income, but you've got more -- you have a higher debt burden as well. I would describe this pool and the losses coming more from customers who didn't complete their degree."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter's earnings call. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support.Our results this quarter of $0.48, excluding regulatory expenses, are holding in line with our ex",1603,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter's earnings call. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support.
Our results this quarter of $0.48, excluding regulatory expenses, are holding in line with our expectations. They demonstrate the quality of our loan portfolio, the earnings they generate and our strong capabilities in delinquency and default convention. Our provision for private credit loan losses declined to $117 million in this quarter, a reduction of 39% from the prior quarter and 10% from the year-ago period.
For federal education loans, we owned and service, performance trends continued to improve since the peak of the recession, with Navient delivering results 38% better than our peers. Our results also benefited from our continued expansion into services beyond student loans. Year-to-date, our non-student loan-related revenue totaled $75 million, twice the amount earned in the first 9 months of 2014.
ELO which we acquired earlier this year as part of our strategy to leverage our asset recovery and business services capabilities, has generated a 38% increase in net income year-over-year. In addition to the $8 million in regulatory expense, this quarter's results also included the impact of $11 million in loan servicing conversion expense, $6 million from the reduction in asset recovery revenue from a change in interpretation of the Department of Education allowed collection fees and the write-off of $5 million in deferred financing costs as a result of our calling ABS Securities. 
Today, we also completed the acquisition of Xtend Healthcare. This acquisition is consistent with our previously announced intentions that leverages our core capabilities in the asset recovery and business services area to the attractive health care payment sector. Xtend works with over 130 hospitals and medical providers to process payments for the large and rapidly growing patient pay marketplace. This transaction provides a footprint in this attractive sector from which we believe we can drive significant organic growth. This transaction will bring value to our shareholders and our franchise, will be more accretive than share repurchases, even in current market conditions, and after the purchase price is cash flow positive. We're delighted to welcome the Xtend team to Navient.
Our business units continued to deliver on the operations front. For example, we successfully completed the conversion of nearly $5 billion in FFELP loans from a third-party servicer platform to our own. Our conversion methodology met or exceeded best practices, including robust data mapping and testing, multiple communications prior to and after the conversion to the customer and a dedicated and specially trained call center team.
Our team worked hard to deliver a positive experience for customers, and I'm pleased with the rewarding customer feedback. This past week, we launched a new customer online portal, designed to simplify the experience for customers and improve operating efficiency. We also continued our conversion to a new collections platform that will create flexibility for on boarding new clients as well as drive lower operating cost.
We continued to leverage automation tools to support compliant and consistency while delivering operating efficiency. In addition, we continued to assist our customers in the successful management of their loans. Last month, the Department of Education released the 2012 3-year cohort default rates. And once again, Navient service several loans, defaulted at a significantly lower rate than other borrowers. As I stated earlier, 38% lower. Our efforts to help customers succeed drive these results. We help over customers successfully manage their loans through extensive and targeted outreach efforts, to promote affordable payment solutions.
For example, nearly 1 in 5 borrowers and 1/3 of all dollar serviced are enrolled in income driven repayment plans. We promote repayment options to our 10 million federal loan customers through over 170 million letters, e-mails and text each year. And we assist the 345,000 borrowers who paid their loans in full this year.
As you and certain we management and fellow shareholders are well aware, several items, including industry-specific issues, are weighing heavily on our stock price and credit spreads. The status have put limits on our access to new sources of liquidity, particularly new issuance of unsecured notes. Ironically, while the price of our unsecured debt makes it very attractive to repurchase, it's very difficult to find willing sellers.
While these issues have created some uncertainty for our investors, I considered the market reaction to be significantly out of proportion. As a result, I will address the main issues of the legal final maturity date in the current regulatory environment directly.
Earlier this year, Moody's and Fitch placed $34 billion of our FFELP ABS on credit watch due to concerns that trust cash flows will not be sufficient to pay all bonds by the legal final maturity date. This concern is based largely on the increased use of income driven repayment programs and other repayment options.
While borrowers aren't back using these important options, particularly income driven repayment programs at higher rates, we still expect borrower payments will be sufficient to meet the legal final maturity dates. To provide added assurance, we have added call rights on most trust that allow us to purchase up to 20% of the original balance of student loans sold to the trust.
To help put this issue in perspective, of the $34 billion in bonds on credit watch, less than $2.2 billion have a maturity date in the next 5 years. Even at a 0% prepayment speed, a rate our trust have never experienced, we expect loan cash flows to be sufficient to meet the maturity dates. Our data show borrower payment did slow with the recovery of the economy in the improvement in the job markets, due to a rapidly falling default rates. This is a good thing. Since then, borrower prepayment speeds have returned to historical levels and remained at levels that are significantly greater than 0%.
Last week, we released an in-depth loan payment data package including an audio explanation of the slides. And earlier this week, we filed a very detailed response to Moody's request for comment. We'll continue to work with the rating agencies to produce the appropriate outcome.
As you know, the CFPB and state agencies have been reviewing our servicing and collections operations. The common public narrative is that the majority of borrowers are struggling with excess to student loan debt. And further, it only services informed borrowers of the available repayment options, delinquency and defaults would all but disappear.
In reality, the vast majority of all borrowers are successfully meeting their payment obligations, and we have assisted more than 1/2 of borrowers that we service, covering nearly 70% of balances to select and enrolled an alternative payment program.
At Navient, we developed sophisticated data-driven strategies to reach struggling borrowers. When we do connect, more than 9 out of 10x, we are able to enroll the customer in a program that keeps them out of default. Sadly, over 90% of our borrowers that do reach default, do not respond to our hundreds of attempts to contact them. It goes without saying, we cannot enroll a borrower in an alternative payment program if we cannot connect with them.
Some also believe that all borrowers should be enrolled in income driven repayment options. And for some borrowers, enrollment in an income driven payment plan is the right choice. Income driven repayment plans, however, extend the loan term. As a result from any borrowers, this would significant increase the total amount paid over the life of the loan. For example, a borrower with $30,000 in loans, and a starting salary of $30,000 per year, they would pay 33% more under payee than under the standard repayment term, even though a small portion of the loan would be forgiven after 20 years. For some borrowers, this is just not an attractive alternative.
Finally, there is some concern that regulatory changes will create significant increases in servicing cost. While we expect regulators to issue standard practices for students loan service and collection, we believe these standards will establish consistency within the industry and will be beneficial to borrowers and servicers. We would welcome the introduction of standards that are recognized by all of our regulators.
These factors have combined to weigh heavily on overstock price. Many analysts have written reasonable discounted value of our stable and predictable cash flows support a stock price north of $20 a share, I agree. Since quarter end, we have purchased 4.7 million shares, at an average price of $11.81, bringing our year-to-date purchases to 46.7 million shares, at an average price of $17.80. 
Also, since quarter end, we repurchased $43 million of unsecured debt, mainly at the July 2018 issue. Our near-term objective is to take advantage of these current market prices. And while we have ample liquidity to service our debt over the next few years, we are aggressively pursuing options that would allow us to increase our activities in both debt and share repurchases. We have substantial assets available to do so, and I am confident in our ability to execute here.
For example, we have $5.2 billion in unencumbered student loans, $11.5 billion in net assets in our securitization trust, and close to $5 billion in servicing cash flows from our securitization trust. 
Bottom line, our business is sound and is generating the earnings and cash flows we expect. Our student loan assets represent a rocksolid foundation of value that were well prepared to capture. These assets and our existing operating capabilities will allow us to continue to create value for our investors.
Sobczak will now provide more details on the results of the quarter. Sak?"
260005529,312957748,878515,"Navient Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Navient Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, beginning with Slide 4 which provides a summary of our core earnings.In the third quarter, we reported $0.47 per share of core earnings",1020,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation, beginning with Slide 4 which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the third quarter, we reported $0.47 per share of core earnings. These results included $0.01 per share or $8 million impact of regulatory-related cost and a $0.02 per share or $11 million of one-time conversion costs to nearly $5 billion of FFELP loans to our servicing system.
Our third quarter operating expenses totaled $228 million, compared to operating expenses of $195 million a year ago. The increase is related to the cost previously mentioned and additional costs resulting from the recent acquisition of Gila. We expect 2015 core EPS to be approximately $1.85 and operating expenses of less than $900 million. These items do exclude regulatory related costs as well as the impact of the acquisition of Xtend.
And before I go in to our segment results, I'd like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the third quarter on Slide 5. In the quarter, we issued a $700 million private loan securitization transaction. The collateral for this transaction was made up of well seasoned, high-quality loans, primarily from our SLM 2010-B trust. This transaction resulted in lower cost of funds overall and raised over $70 million of cash after paying off the 2010-B transaction.
As Jack mentioned, we submitted our comments addressing the legal final maturity issue to Moody's earlier this week. And to help address this issue, during the quarter, we funded $852 million of cleanup calls associated with 7 FFELP trusts. Year-to-date, we have funded $1.1 billion of cleanup calls to our FFELP ABCP conduits. Additionally, we amended another 16 trust to include a 10% optional servicer purchase right.
Our unsecured debt declined by $428 million to less than $16 billion outstanding at quarter end. We maintained a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x and purchase an additional $43 million of unsecured debt in October.
In the quarter, we repurchased 12.1 million shares or $175 million and have repurchased an additional 4.8 million shares as of October 20. We have remaining authority of $168 million under our current share repurchase plan as of October 20. 
Although this activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position. And we will look for ways to manage the timing of our future cash flows from our student loan portfolio to better match the maturity profile of our unsecured debt. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $70 million of third quarter 2015 and that is compared with $79 million in the third quarter 2014. For the quarter, FFELP net interest margin was 81 basis points. And going forward, FFELP NIM maybe impacted by future LIBOR rates which will impact the amount of core income in our portfolio. We expect the fourth quarter FFELP net interest margin to remain in the low 80s.
I'm going to move to Slide 7 to review our private education loan segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased $21 million from a year-ago quarter to $77 million. Third quarter net interest margin came in at 3.77%. The private net interest margin was 6 basis points lower than our expectations, primarily due to a decrease in the spread between our prime earnings assets that are funded with LIBOR-based debt.
For the fourth quarter, we expect the private student loan net interest margin to be approximately 3.65%. The decrease in our provision for losses of $74 million in the prior quarter is a result of the additional reserve we booked in the second quarter for segment of borrowers who exited the firm in 2014 And are experiencing unfavorable credit trends compared to those who exited the firm in the previous years.
Slide 8 shows our private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This is a portfolio that is well seasoned with 94% of our loans and repayment status, having made more than 12 payments.
Third quarter charge-offs were at 2.3% or $10 million lower than the third quarter of last year. Our total delinquency rate, which is 7.4%, and that's compared to 7.9% in the year-ago quarter. We do expect our annualized charge-off rates for the full year to be approximately 2.6%.
Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings of $79 million in the quarter compared with $85 million in the third quarter of 2014. We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenues of $20 million versus the prior year. This increase was primarily related to the full integration of Gila, which expanded our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space. The decline in asset recovery revenues from the prior quarter is mainly related to 3 items: First, an expected reduction of volume for student loan collections. Second, an unexpected rate change to a flat yearly fee structure associated with the Department of Education collection contract, which became effective on July 1; and third, change in the interpretation of Department of Education, which impacted allowed collection fees for FFELP loans that Jack mentioned earlier.
During the quarter, we were awarded the state tax amnesty contract that resulted in an increase in our contingency asset recovery receivable inventory of $5.7 billion. The amnesty program will be conducted from September 15 through November 16 of this year. In the past 10 years, we've recovered over $1 billion under similar tax amnesty contracts for states and large municipalities. We expect our asset recovery revenues to be approximately $355 million for 2015.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $237 million or $0.63 per share, as compared with net income of $359 million or $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP are to March related to our position, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM Banco.
With that, let's open up the call up for questions."

There's not a specific time frame for that process but certainly very eager to engage and begin to resolve some of these items. I think it's important to note that several of the items here on this list our items that were previously covered through other regulatory settlements, particularly with the FDIC. Some items are related to Department of Ed policies and regulations. And to my earlier comments, we and borrowers, I think, would certainly benefit from a common understanding of regulators of what the rules and program terms and conditions should be. And some were just will continue to work with them or items that we have addressed and changed in prior years, just as we continue to work with customers to make the process of managing their loans easier. On the needle final maturity date issue, I -- this is obviously, a complicated issue and has lots of moving parts. But at the end of the day, we believe that borrower payments and cash flows coming off the student loan portfolio, while they did slow during that 2008 and 2013 period were loss of air various reasons, the activities or the performance of those periods really don't form a baseline, which would extrapolate off of. And that if you look at historical norms and that is probably closer to what we're experiencing today, prepayment speeds for borrowed loans are substantially higher than they were during that time frame. And when you run cash flows and expected borrower behavior off of those numbers, you do get very, very good different results. And so having -- we would certainly rather the rating agencies take more time to evaluate the data and get a more comprehensive understanding of potential cash flows here and borrower behavior then to make a short term answer or solution. Obviously, we'd like the issue resolved, but it certainly better it to have it resolved right or appropriately."

I mean to take loans that are basically the same across all servicers and deliver a 38% lower default rate as those are the results people are looking for here, right? Getting borrowers into programs they can afford. As I mentioned, some folks do believe that income driven repayment is the ultimate solution. What we do is we really work with customers to let them understand the range of options that they have available to them and they get to pick the one that fits their budget fast. And 70% of our dollar volume is enrolled in an alternative payment program, which would include everything from income driven repayment solutions to loan consolidation, which extends of the long-term out. So these are the solutions that work for our customers and drive the substantially lower default rates. I think -- that's just kind of how we've been working with the regulators in this, and if it means changing some of our practices to be -- to improve outcomes, we're all in on that."

Certainly, we would argue here that there's a couple of things that need to happen. And certainly encouraging borrowers to contact their services is something that we would like to see more of, because when we do contact the customer and can connect with them, more than 9x out of 10, we're able to resolve that delinquency. And the other issue period which without your about before and everything else is simplification of the program. The share volume and terms of some of these repayment options can be very overwhelming to people who are not dealing this pay today, it's hard for them to understand which program produces the best results for them. And if we can simplify and narrow and shrink them down to a fewer, but more simple programs to understand, I think everyone benefits from that."

And in the asset recovery business services sector, this is an area where we have developed a very, very strong and successful track record of helping our customers manage their cash flows to either asset recovery or business processes types of things. And for years, our focus here was on educational loans, almost exclusively. And we began to develop alternatives, working with state agencies and municipalities. Somsak referenced the state tax amnesty program that we're running as an example. We have long-standing contracts with a number of cities and states, managing their receivables book. And we thought that there are a couple of places that we could go to expand our footprint and really put us in a place that we can grow rapidly on an organic basis off of that. Gila, the acquisition of Gila earlier this year, was one example of leveraging those skills and capabilities into a broader municipal arena and geographic areas where we were not strong, to begin with, and Xtend does the same thing for us in a new area of health care payments. Our view here was that an acquisition in this space was really necessary for us to bring a resume to bear and yet the activities that they do are very, very similar to what we do in other asset classes and so bringing our scale, our data, sophistication and strategies to that process is something that we think will allow us to grow those businesses rapidly. And when you look at the opportunities there, relative to share repurchases, you know that's where we do our math and understand what we can drive in terms of the economics. It's a better deal for shareholders, in our view, to allocate that capital to the acquisition than it is to do share repurchases. I want to be clear, however, that these are small -- relatively small acquisitions that has helped us built a footprint, it's not -- our strategy is not by our -- buy these businesses through series of acquisitions, but to build a footprint and grow organically."

I think, if my numbers are right, that since the spin, we have spent $1.242 billion buying back 69 million shares in an average price of $18, and when you increased about the repurchase program, I think the response of the company generally has been that you believe the net asset value was to the area of 22 or 23, and repurchasing to make sense. We agree with that by the way, of numbers 23. If we still believe that, we would urge you to find ways of being creative to raise additional funds, double down or tripled down. I think your in sympathy with that, we were just urge you, there's no better use of shareholder money than buying something back $0.50 and a dollar, particularly in this environment where they are few things selling $0.50 and a dollar, so that's kind of advocacy question -- not a question, but an advocacy statement. Second, I noticed recently that a company, by the name, Realty, announced an intention to liquidate. And when I called the CEO, I was not a shareholder in the company, when I call the seal what motivated them, he said he felt that the prospect of him getting the net asset value that he believed the company had was so remote that he felt the best thing to do is to liquidate the company or return the money to shareholders. And kind of a theme out of that book, you deal with many regulators, some of which have conflict views, we're living with constant criticism and hostile environment despite the social good you do for the people that borrow money from you. Has the Board considered part by stability of liquidating the company but run off and returned the money to shareholders so the can invest the companies that are more appreciated by shareholders or the government? And so that's kind of a philosophical question. And third, your comment, I felt was very interesting. I have no problem with the Xtend acquisition, companies cannot the purchase stock success in you've got to grow the business. But when you said it's more accretive to stock repurchase, I would probably challenge that because essentially, when you buy back stock, you're probably looking at the earnings per share impact of what earnings you got versus the quest of money, et cetera. But in the stock repurchase, you're retiring a 5% dividend and you're capturing a $9 discount to NAV. And obviously, as we retire more share at a $9 discount to NAV then NAV goes up. So I'm not sure you're calculating correctly the virtue of Xtend versus a stock repurchase, but that's not a big deal I think you're trying to grow the company. Those are observations, I don't know if you want to comment on them but I leave them up to you. We're very supportive of management of complaint, this is an observation."

We definitely agree with your first point, and we are working hard to find those creative alternatives to allow us to do more and more both in 2 things are on sale here, both at the debt and the share price. And so we are aggressively working on both of those. One of the unique parts of our business is if we can finance assets through an ABS transaction, we're able to raise funds substantially cheaper than our cost of debt in an unsecured arena so it's an easy arbitrage to take advantage of and one that would like to do see more of that, same is true on the share repurchase side. I do want to spend a little I'm just on your comment on the liquidation issue here. The value -- the franchise value of this company is really anchored in the cash flows coming from the student loan portfolios. And I would say the regulatory issues are coming from our service -- the servicing of student loans. Be -- in effect, not because we chose this, it was chosen by Congress, we are liquidating our student loan holdings. They're amortizing portfolio, no new FFELP loans are being created and those loans will -- those portfolios will go to 0 over time and our job is to maximize the earnings of that portfolio. We think we can -- we're doing that and running the operation on that side of the equation is frankly not a whole lot different in either kind of alternative structure. On the servicing side of the equation, you know, there's no question that as a business, we do a great job in this space and we deliver value for our customers and taxpayers and the results that we generate. If the regulatory environment is not going to allow that business to work, and be profitable, then it's not an attractive business. And that is certainly something we would take a look at. We need to work with the regulators today to resolve the open issues with and then CFPB and we're going to do that. And a big part of our strategy is this really about driving and producing the results that all including the regulators are looking for here. But it's to be determined opportunity for sure."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter's earnings call. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support.Our results this quarter of $0.48, excluding regulatory expenses, are holding in line with our ex",1600,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter's earnings call. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support.
Our results this quarter of $0.48, excluding regulatory expenses, are holding in line with our expectations. They demonstrate the quality of our loan portfolio, the earnings they generate and our strong capabilities in delinquency and default prevention. Our provision for private credit loan losses declined to $117 million this quarter, a reduction of 39% from the prior quarter and 10% from the year-ago period.
For federal education loans we own and service, performance trends continued to improve since the peak of the recession, with Navient delivering results 38% better than our peers. Our results also benefited from our continued expansion into services beyond student loans. Year-to-date, our nonstudent loan-related revenue totaled $75 million, twice the amount earned in the first 9 months of 2014.
Gila, which we acquired earlier this year as part of our strategy to leverage our asset recovery and business services capabilities, has generated a 38% increase in net income year-over-year. In addition to the $8 million in regulatory expense, this quarter's results also included the impact of $11 million in loan servicing conversion expense, $6 million from the reduction in asset recovery revenue from a change in interpretation of the Department of Education allowed collection fees and the write-off of $5 million in deferred financing costs as a result of our calling ABS securities. 
Today, we also completed the acquisition of Xtend Healthcare. This acquisition is consistent with our previously announced intentions that leverages our core capabilities in the asset recovery and business services area to the attractive health care payment sector. Xtend works with over 130 hospitals and medical providers to process payments for the large and rapidly growing patient pay marketplace. This transaction provides a footprint in this attractive sector from which we believe we can drive significant organic growth. This transaction will bring value to our shareholders and our franchise, will be more accretive than share repurchases even in current market conditions and after the purchase price is cash flow positive. We're delighted to welcome the Xtend team to Navient.
Our business units continued to deliver on the operations front. For example, we successfully completed the conversion of nearly $5 billion in FFELP loans from a third-party servicer platform to our own. Our conversion methodology met or exceeded best practices, including robust data mapping and testing, multiple communications prior to and after the conversion to the customer and a dedicated and specially trained call center team. Our team worked hard to deliver a positive experience for customers, and I'm pleased with the rewarding customer feedback. 
This past week, we launched a new customer online portal designed to simplify the experience for customers and improve operating efficiency. We also continued our conversion to a new collections platform that will create flexibility for onboarding new clients as well as drive lower operating costs.
We continue to leverage automation tools to support compliance and consistency while delivering operating efficiency. In addition, we continue to assist our customers in the successful management of their loans. Last month, the Department of Education released the 2012 3-year cohort default rates. And once again, Navient-serviced federal loans defaulted at a significantly lower rate than other borrowers. As I stated earlier, 38% lower. 
Our efforts to help customers succeed drive these results. We help our customers successfully manage their loans through extensive and targeted outreach efforts to promote affordable payment solutions. For example, nearly 1 in 5 borrowers and 1/3 of all dollar serviced are enrolled in income-driven repayment plans. We promote repayment options to our 10 million federal loan customers through over 170 million letters, e-mails and texts each year, and we assist the 345,000 borrowers who paid their loans in full this year.
As you and certainly we as management and fellow shareholders are well aware, several items, including industry-specific issues, are weighing heavily on our stock price and credit spreads. These factors have put limits on our access to new sources of liquidity, particularly new issuance of unsecured notes. Ironically, while the price of our unsecured debt makes it very attractive for us to repurchase, it's very difficult to find willing sellers.
While these issues have created some uncertainty for our investors, I consider the market reaction to be significantly out of proportion. As a result, I will address the main issues of the legal final maturity date in the current regulatory environment directly.
Earlier this year, Moody's and Fitch placed $34 billion of our FFELP ABS on credit watch due to concerns that trust cash flows will not be sufficient to pay all bonds by the legal final maturity date. This concern is based largely on the increased use of income-driven repayment programs and other repayment options. While borrowers are in fact using these important options, particularly income-driven repayment programs, at higher rates, we still expect borrower payments will be sufficient to meet the legal final maturity dates. To provide added assurance, we've added call rights on most trusts that allow us to purchase up to 20% of the original balance of student loans sold to the trust.
To help put this issue in perspective, of the $34 billion in bonds on credit watch, less than $2.2 billion have a maturity date in the next 5 years. Even at a 0% prepayment speed, a rate our trusts have never experienced, we expect loan cash flows to be sufficient to meet the maturity dates. Our data show borrower payment did slow with the recovery of the economy and the improvement in the job markets due to a rapidly falling default rates. This is a good thing. Since then, borrower prepayment speeds have returned to historical levels and remain at levels that are significantly greater than 0%.
Last week, we released an in-depth loan payment data package, including an audio explanation of the slides. And earlier this week, we filed a very detailed response to Moody's request for comment. We'll continue to work with the rating agencies to produce the appropriate outcome.
As you know, the CFPB and state agencies have been reviewing our servicing and collections operations. The common public narrative is that the majority of borrowers are struggling with excessive student loan debt. And further, if only servicers informed borrowers of the available repayment options, delinquency and defaults would all but disappear. In reality, the vast majority of all borrowers are successfully meeting their payment obligations, and we have assisted more than 1/2 of borrowers that we service, covering nearly 70% of balances to select and enroll in an alternative payment program.
At Navient, we developed sophisticated data-driven strategies to reach struggling borrowers. When we do connect more than 9 out of 10x, we are able to enroll the customer in a program that keeps them out of default. Sadly, over 90% of our borrowers that do reach default do not respond to our hundreds of attempts to contact them. It goes without saying, we cannot enroll a borrower in an alternative payment program if we cannot connect with them.
Some also believe that all borrowers should be enrolled in income-driven repayment options. And for some borrowers, enrollment in an income-driven payment plan is the right choice. Income-driven repayment plans, however, extend the loan term. As a result for many borrowers, this would significantly increase the total amount paid over the life of the loan. For example, a borrower with $30,000 in loans and a starting salary of $30,000 per year, they would pay 33% more under payee than under the standard repayment term even though a small portion of the loan would be forgiven after 20 years. For some borrowers, this is just not an attractive alternative.
Finally, there is some concern that regulatory changes will create significant increases in servicing costs. While we expect regulators to issue standard practices for student loan servicing and collection, we believe these standards will establish consistency within the industry and will be beneficial to borrowers and servicers. We would welcome the introduction of standards that are recognized by all of our regulators.
These factors have combined to weigh heavily on our stock price. Many analysts have written that a reasonable discounted value of our stable and predictable cash flows support a stock price north of $20 a share. I agree. Since quarter end, we have purchased 4.7 million shares at an average price of $11.81, bringing our year-to-date purchases to 46.7 million shares at an average price of $17.80. 
Also since quarter end, we repurchased $43 million of unsecured debt mainly at the July 2018 issue. Our near-term objective is to take advantage of these current market prices. And while we have ample liquidity to service our debt over the next few years, we are aggressively pursuing options that would allow us to increase our activities in both debt and share repurchases. We have substantial assets available to do so, and I am confident in our ability to execute here. For example, we have $5.2 billion in unencumbered student loans, $11.5 billion in net assets in our securitization trusts and close to $5 billion in servicing cash flows from our securitization trusts. 
Bottom line, our business is sound and is generating the earnings and cash flows we expect. Our student loan assets represent a rock-solid foundation of value that we're well prepared to capture. These assets and our existing operating capabilities will allow us to continue to create value for our investors.
Somsak will now provide more details on the results of the quarter. Sak?"

During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.In the third quarter, we reported $0.47 per share of core earnings",1029,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the third quarter, we reported $0.47 per share of core earnings. These results included $0.01 per share or a $8 million impact of regulatory-related costs and a $0.02 per share or $11 million of onetime conversion costs through nearly $5 billion of FFELP loans to our servicing system.
Our third quarter operating expenses totaled $228 million compared to operating expenses of $195 million a year ago. The increase is related to the cost previously mentioned and additional costs resulting from the recent acquisition of Gila. We expect 2015 core EPS to be approximately $1.85 and operating expenses of less than $900 million. These items do exclude regulatory-related costs as well as the impact of the acquisition of Xtend.
And before I go into our segment results, I'd like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the third quarter on Slide 5. In the quarter, we issued a $700 million private loan securitization transaction. The collateral for this transaction was made up of well-seasoned, high-quality loans, primarily from our SLM 2010-B trust. This transaction resulted in lower cost of funds overall and raised over $70 million of cash after paying off the 2010-B transaction.
As Jack mentioned, we submitted our comments addressing the legal final maturity issue to Moody's earlier this week. And to help address this issue, during the quarter, we funded $852 million of cleanup calls associated with 7 FFELP trusts. Year-to-date, we have funded $1.1 billion of cleanup calls through our FFELP ABCP conduits. And additionally, we amended another 16 trusts to include a 10% optional servicer purchase right.
Our unsecured debt declined by $428 million to less than $16 billion outstanding at quarter end. We maintained a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x and have purchased an additional $43 million of unsecured debt in October.
In the quarter, we repurchased 12.1 million shares for $175 million and have repurchased an additional 4.8 million shares as of October 20. We have remaining authority of $168 million under our current share repurchase plan as of October 20. All this activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position. And we will look for ways to manage the timing of our future cash flows from our student loan portfolio to better match the maturity profile of our unsecured debt. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $70 million for third quarter 2015, and that's compared with $79 million in the third quarter 2014. For the quarter, FFELP net interest margin was 81 basis points. And going forward, FFELP NIM may be impacted by future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of core income in our portfolio. We expect the fourth quarter FFELP net interest margin to remain in the low 80s.
I'm going to slide to -- I'm going to move to Slide 7 to review our private education loan segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased $21 million from the year-ago quarter to $77 million. Third quarter net interest margin came in at 3.77%. The private net interest margin was 6 basis points lower than our expectations, primarily due to a decrease in the spread between our prime earning assets that are funded with LIBOR-based debt. For the fourth quarter, we expect the private student loan net interest margin to be approximately 3.65%. 
The decrease in our provision for losses of $74 million in the prior quarter is as a result of the additional reserve we booked in the second quarter for a segment of borrowers who exited the firm in 2014 and are experiencing unfavorable credit trends compared to those who exited the firm in previous years.
Slide 8 shows our private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This is a portfolio that is well seasoned with 94% of loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.
The third quarter charge-offs were at 2.3% or $10 million lower than the third quarter of last year. Our total delinquency rate was at 7.4%, and that's compared to 7.9% in the year-ago quarter. We do expect our annualized charge-off rates for the full year to be approximately 2.6%.
Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings of $79 million in the quarter compare with $85 million in the third quarter of 2014. We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenues of $20 million versus the prior year. This increase was primarily related to the full integration of Gila, which expanded our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space. The decline in asset recovery revenues from the prior quarter is mainly related to 3 items: first, an expected reduction of volume for student loan collections; second, an expected rate change to a flat unit fee structure associated with the Department of Education collections contract, which became effective on July 1; and third, a change in the interpretation of the Department of Education, which impacted allowed collection fees for FFELP loans that Jack mentioned earlier.
During the quarter, we were awarded the state tax amnesty contract that resulted in an increase in our contingency asset recovery receivable inventory of $5.7 billion. The amnesty program will be conducted from September 15 through November 16 of this year. In the past 10 years, we've recovered over $1 billion under similar tax amnesty contracts for states and large municipalities. We expect our asset recovery revenues to be approximately $355 million for 2015.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $237 million or $0.63 per share as compared with net income of $359 million or $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo.
With that, let's open the call up for questions."

There's not a specific time frame for that process. But certainly, we're eager to engage and begin to resolve some of these items. I think it's important to note that several of the items here on this list are items that were previously covered through other regulatory settlements, particularly with the FDIC. Some items are related to Department of Ed policies and regulations. And to my earlier comments, we and borrowers, I think, would certainly benefit from a common understanding of regulators of what the rules and program terms and conditions should be. And some will just -- we will continue to work with them or items that we have addressed and changed in prior years, just as we continue to work with customers to make the process of managing their loans easier. On the legal final maturity date issue, I -- this is -- it's obviously a complicated issue and has lots of moving parts. But at the end of the day, we believe that borrower payments and cash flows coming off the student loan portfolios, while they did slow during that 2008 and 2013 period, were loss of various reasons, that the activities or the performance in those periods really don't form a baseline in which one should extrapolate off of. And that if you look at historical norms, and that is probably closer to what we're experiencing today, prepayment speeds for borrower loans are substantially higher than they were during that time frame. And when you run cash flows and expected borrower behavior off of those numbers, you do get very, very different results. And so having -- we would certainly rather the rating agencies take more time to evaluate the data and get a more comprehensive understanding of potential cash flows here and borrower behavior than to make a short-term answer or solution. So obviously, we'd like the issue resolved, but it's certainly better to have it resolved right or appropriately."

That means getting them into repayment programs they can afford. And as the Department of Ed default statistics illustrate here, we do this better than anybody. I mean, to take loans that are basically the same across all servicers and deliver a 38% lower default rate as -- those are the results people are looking for here, right, getting borrowers into programs they can afford. As I mentioned, some folks do believe that income-driven repayment is the ultimate solution. What we do is we really work with customers to let them understand the range of options that they have available to them, and they get to pick the one that fits their budget best. And 70% of our dollar volume is enrolled in an alternative payment program, which would include everything from income-driven repayment solutions to loan consolidation, which extends the loan term out. So these are the solutions that work for our customers and drive the substantially lower default rates. I think that's kind of how we've been working with the regulators in this.

And the other big issue here, which we have talked about before and I've written about, is simplification of the program. The share volume and terms of some of these repayment options can be very overwhelming to people who are not dealing with this day to day. It's hard for them to understand which program produces the best results for them.

One of the things that we have looked at as we completed the separation is what are our core capabilities and how are those transferable into different areas or different asset classes. And in the asset recovery business services sector, this is an area where we have developed a very, very strong and successful track record of helping our customers manage their cash flows through either asset recovery or business processes types of things. And for years, our focus here was on educational loans almost exclusively. And we began to develop alternatives working with state agencies and municipalities. Somsak referenced the state tax amnesty program that we're running as an example. We've had long-standing contracts with a number of cities and states managing their receivables book. And we thought that there are a couple of places that we could go to expand our footprint and really put us in a place that we can grow rapidly on an organic basis off of that. Gila -- the acquisition of Gila earlier this year was one example of leveraging those skills and capabilities into a broader municipal arena and geographic areas where we were not strong to begin with. And Xtend does the same thing for us in a new area of health care payments. Our view here was that an acquisition in this space was really necessary for us to bring a resume to bear and -- but yet, the activities that they do are very, very similar to what we do with other asset classes and so bringing our scale, our data, sophistication and strategies to that process is something that we think will allow us to grow those businesses rapidly. And when you look at the opportunities there relative to share repurchases, that's where we do our math and understand what we can drive in terms of the economics. It's a better deal for shareholders, in our view, to allocate that capital to that acquisition than it is to do share repurchases. I want to be clear, however, that these are small -- relatively small acquisitions that help us build a footprint.

I think, if my numbers are right, that since the spin, we have spent $1.242 billion buying back 69 million shares in an average price of $18. And when you increased about the repurchase program, I think the response in the company generally has been that you believe the net asset value is in the area of $22 or $23, and repurchasing to make sense. We agree with that, by the way. That number is $23. If we still believe that, we would urge you to find ways of being creative to raise additional funds, double down or triple down. I think you're in sympathy with that, but we will just urge you. There's no better use of shareholder money than buying something back at $0.50 and a dollar, particularly in this environment where there's very few things selling at $0.50 and a dollar. So that's kind of an advocacy question -- not a question, but an advocacy statement. Second, I noticed recently that a company by name of Winthrop Realty announced the intention to liquidate. And when I called the CEO -- I was not a shareholder in the company. When I called the CEO I knew, I asked him what motivated him. He said he felt that the prospect of him getting the stock to sell at the net asset value that he believed the company had was so remote that he felt the best thing to do is to liquidate the company, return the money to shareholders. And kind of a theme out of that book, you deal with many regulators, some of which have conflicting views. We're living with constant criticism and a hostile environment despite the social good you do for the people that borrow money from you. Has the Board considered the advice of liquidating the company by going into a runoff and returning the money to shareholders so they can invest in companies that are more appreciated by shareholders or the government? And so that's kind of a philosophical question. And third, your comment, I thought, was very interesting. I have no problem with the Xtend acquisition. Companies cannot repurchase stock at a success, you got to grow the business. But when you said that it's more accretive than stock repurchase, I would probably challenge that because, essentially, when you buy back stock, you're probably looking at the earnings per share impact of what earnings we got versus the cost of money, et cetera. But in the stock repurchase, you're retiring a 5% dividend and you're capturing a $9 discount to NAV. And obviously, as you retire more shares at a $9 discount to NAV, then NAV goes up. So I'm not sure you're calculating correctly the virtue of Xtend versus a stock repurchase. But that's not a big deal because I think you're trying to grow the company. So those are just observations. I don't know if you want to comment on them, but I'll leave them up to you. But we're very supportive of management. That's not a complaint, just an observation."

And we are working hard to find those creative alternatives to allow us to do more and more both in -- 2 things are on sale here, right, at both the debt and the share price. And so we are aggressively working on both of those. And one of the unique parts of our business is if we can finance assets through an ABS transaction, we're able to raise funds substantially cheaper than our cost of debt in the unsecured arena, and so it's an easy arbitrage to take advantage of and one that would like to do -- see more of that. Same is true on the share repurchase side. I do want to spend a little bit of time on your -- just on your comment about the liquidation issue here. The value -- the franchise value of this company is really anchored in the cash flows coming from the student loan portfolios, and I would say the regulatory issues are coming from our service -- the servicing of student loans. The -- in effect, not because we chose this, it was chosen by Congress, we are liquidating our student loan holdings. They're amortizing portfolio. No new FFELP loans are being created. And those loans will -- those portfolios will go to 0 over time, and our job is to maximize the earnings of that portfolio. We think we can -- we're doing that. And running the operation on that side of the equation is frankly not a whole lot different in either kind of alternative structure. On the servicing side of the equation, there's no question that as a business, we do a great job in this space, and we deliver value for our customers and taxpayers in the results that we generate. If the regulatory environment is not going to allow that business to work and be profitable, then it's not an attractive business, and that is certainly something we would take a look at. We need to work with the regulators today to resolve this -- the open issues with the state agencies and the CFPB, and we're going to do that. And a big part of our strategy is really about driving and producing the results that all, including the regulators, are looking for here. But that's a to-be-determined opportunity for sure."

I think we've clearly explained that, that is not the case, as an example. And as we've kind of responded to the -- some of the thesis here and items, I think you're seeing both our credit spreads tighten and our stock price improve. Our goal and objective is, of course, to produce the outcomes that -- and make sure people understand the outcomes that are likely to occur here. And that's what we've been working on, on both the legal final maturity and the regulatory cost side of the equation. But we do need those items to resolve before I think you get back to completely normal.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter's earnings call. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support.Our results this quarter of $0.48, excluding regulatory expenses, are holding in line with our ex",1600,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter's earnings call. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support.
Our results this quarter of $0.48, excluding regulatory expenses, are holding in line with our expectations. They demonstrate the quality of our loan portfolio, the earnings they generate and our strong capabilities in delinquency and default prevention. Our provision for private credit loan losses declined to $117 million this quarter, a reduction of 39% from the prior quarter and 10% from the year-ago period.
For federal education loans we own and service, performance trends continued to improve since the peak of the recession, with Navient delivering results 38% better than our peers. Our results also benefited from our continued expansion into services beyond student loans. Year-to-date, our nonstudent loan-related revenue totaled $75 million, twice the amount earned in the first 9 months of 2014.
Gila, which we acquired earlier this year as part of our strategy to leverage our asset recovery and business services capabilities, has generated a 38% increase in net income year-over-year. In addition to the $8 million in regulatory expense, this quarter's results also included the impact of $11 million in loan servicing conversion expense, $6 million from the reduction in asset recovery revenue from a change in interpretation of the Department of Education allowed collection fees and the write-off of $5 million in deferred financing costs as a result of our calling ABS securities. 
Today, we also completed the acquisition of Xtend Healthcare. This acquisition is consistent with our previously announced intentions that leverages our core capabilities in the asset recovery and business services area to the attractive health care payment sector. Xtend works with over 130 hospitals and medical providers to process payments for the large and rapidly growing patient pay marketplace. This transaction provides a footprint in this attractive sector from which we believe we can drive significant organic growth. This transaction will bring value to our shareholders and our franchise, will be more accretive than share repurchases even in current market conditions and after the purchase price is cash flow positive. We're delighted to welcome the Xtend team to Navient.
Our business units continued to deliver on the operations front. For example, we successfully completed the conversion of nearly $5 billion in FFELP loans from a third-party servicer platform to our own. Our conversion methodology met or exceeded best practices, including robust data mapping and testing, multiple communications prior to and after the conversion to the customer and a dedicated and specially trained call center team. Our team worked hard to deliver a positive experience for customers, and I'm pleased with the rewarding customer feedback. 
This past week, we launched a new customer online portal designed to simplify the experience for customers and improve operating efficiency. We also continued our conversion to a new collections platform that will create flexibility for onboarding new clients as well as drive lower operating costs.
We continue to leverage automation tools to support compliance and consistency while delivering operating efficiency. In addition, we continue to assist our customers in the successful management of their loans. Last month, the Department of Education released the 2012 3-year cohort default rates. And once again, Navient-serviced federal loans defaulted at a significantly lower rate than other borrowers. As I stated earlier, 38% lower. 
Our efforts to help customers succeed drive these results. We help our customers successfully manage their loans through extensive and targeted outreach efforts to promote affordable payment solutions. For example, nearly 1 in 5 borrowers and 1/3 of all dollars serviced are enrolled in income-driven repayment plans. We promote repayment options to our 10 million federal loan customers through over 170 million letters, e-mails and texts each year, and we assist the 345,000 borrowers who paid their loans in full this year.
As you and certainly we, as management and fellow shareholders are well aware, several items, including industry-specific issues are weighing heavily on our stock price and credit spreads. These factors have put limits on our access to new sources of liquidity, particularly new issuance of unsecured notes. Ironically, while the price of our unsecured debt makes it very attractive for us to repurchase, it's very difficult to find willing sellers.
While these issues have created some uncertainty for our investors, I consider the market reaction to be significantly out of proportion. As a result, I will address the main issues of the legal final maturity date in the current regulatory environment directly.
Earlier this year, Moody's and Fitch placed $34 billion of our FFELP ABS on credit watch due to concerns that trust cash flows will not be sufficient to pay all bonds by the legal final maturity date. This concern is based largely on the increased use of income-driven repayment programs and other repayment options. While borrowers are in fact using these important options, particularly income-driven repayment programs, at higher rates, we still expect borrower payments will be sufficient to meet the legal final maturity dates. To provide added assurance, we've added call rights on most trusts that allow us to purchase up to 20% of the original balance of student loans sold to the trust.
To help put this issue in perspective, of the $34 billion in bonds on credit watch, less than $2.2 billion have a maturity date in the next 5 years. Even at a 0% prepayment speed, a rate our trusts have never experienced, we expect loan cash flows to be sufficient to meet the maturity dates. Our data show borrower payment did slow with the recovery of the economy and the improvement in the job markets due to a rapidly falling default rates. This is a good thing. Since then, borrower prepayment speeds have returned to historical levels and remain at levels that are significantly greater than 0%.
Last week, we released an in-depth loan payment data package, including an audio explanation of the slides and earlier this week, we filed a very detailed response to Moody's request for comment. We'll continue to work with the rating agencies to produce the appropriate outcome.
As you know, the CFPB and state agencies have been reviewing our servicing and collections operations. The common public narrative is that the majority of borrowers are struggling with excessive student loan debt. And further, if only servicers informed borrowers of the available repayment options, delinquency and defaults would all but disappear. In reality, the vast majority of all borrowers are successfully meeting their payment obligations, and we have assisted more than 1/2 of borrowers that we service, covering nearly 70% of balances to select and enroll in an alternative payment program.
At Navient, we developed sophisticated data-driven strategies to reach struggling borrowers. When we do connect, more than 9 out of 10x we are able to enroll the customer in a program that keeps them out of default. Sadly, over 90% of our borrowers that do reach default do not respond to our hundreds of attempts to contact them. It goes without saying, we cannot enroll a borrower in an alternative payment program if we cannot connect with them.
Some also believe that all borrowers should be enrolled in income-driven repayment options. And for some borrowers, enrollment in an income-driven payment plan is the right choice. Income-driven repayment plans, however, extend the loan term. As a result for many borrowers, this would significantly increase the total amount paid over the life of the loan. For example, a borrower with $30,000 in loans and a starting salary of $30,000 per year, they would pay 33% more under payee than under the standard repayment term even though a small portion of the loan would be forgiven after 20 years. For some borrowers, this is just not an attractive alternative.
Finally, there is some concern that regulatory changes will create significant increases in servicing costs. While we expect regulators to issue standard practices for student loan servicing and collection, we believe these standards will establish consistency within the industry and will be beneficial to borrowers and servicers. We would welcome the introduction of standards that are recognized by all of our regulators.
These factors have combined to weigh heavily on our stock price. Many analysts have written that a reasonable discounted value of our stable and predictable cash flows support a stock price north of $20 a share. I agree. Since quarter end, we have purchased 4.7 million shares at an average price of $11.81, bringing our year-to-date purchases to 46.7 million shares at an average price of $17.80. 
Also since quarter end, we repurchased $43 million of unsecured debt mainly at the July 2018 issue. Our near-term objective is to take advantage of these current market prices. And while we have ample liquidity to service our debt for the next few years, we are aggressively pursuing options that would allow us to increase our activities in both debt and share repurchases. We have substantial assets available to do so, and I am confident in our ability to execute here. For example, we have $5.2 billion in unencumbered student loans, $11.5 billion in net assets in our securitization trusts and close to $5 billion in servicing cash flows from our securitization trusts. 
Bottom line, our business is sound and is generating the earnings and cash flows we expect. Our student loan assets represent a rock-solid foundation of value that we're well prepared to capture. These assets and our existing operating capabilities will allow us to continue to create value for our investors.
Somsak will now provide more details on the results of the quarter. Sak?"

During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.In the third quarter, we reported $0.47 per share of core earnings",1031,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the third quarter, we reported $0.47 per share of core earnings. These results included $0.01 per share or a $8 million impact of regulatory-related costs and a $0.02 per share or $11 million of onetime conversion costs through nearly $5 billion of FFELP loans to our servicing system.
Our third quarter operating expenses totaled $228 million compared to operating expenses of $195 million a year ago. The increase is related to the cost previously mentioned and additional costs resulting from the recent acquisition of Gila. We expect 2015 core EPS to be approximately $1.85 and operating expenses of less than $900 million. These items do exclude regulatory-related costs as well as the impact of the acquisition of Xtend.
And before I go into our segment results, I'd like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the third quarter on Slide 5. In the quarter, we issued a $700 million private loan securitization transaction. The collateral for this transaction was made up of well-seasoned, high-quality loans, primarily from our SLM 2010-B trust. This transaction resulted in lower cost of funds overall and raised over $70 million of cash after paying off the 2010-B transaction.
As Jack mentioned, we submitted our comments addressing the legal final maturity issue to Moody's earlier this week. And to help address this issue, during the quarter, we funded $852 million of cleanup calls associated with 7 FFELP trusts. Year-to-date, we have funded $1.1 billion of cleanup calls through our FFELP ABCP conduits. And additionally, we amended another 16 trusts to include a 10% optional servicer purchase right.
Our unsecured debt declined by $428 million to less than $16 billion outstanding at quarter end. We maintained a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x and have purchased an additional $43 million of unsecured debt in October.
In the quarter, we repurchased 12.1 million shares for $175 million and have repurchased an additional 4.8 million shares as of October 20. We have remaining authority of $168 million under our current share repurchase plan as of October 20. All this activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position. And we will look for ways to manage the timing of our future cash flows from our student loan portfolio to better match the maturity profile of our unsecured debt. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $70 million for third quarter 2015, and that's compared with $79 million in the third quarter 2014. For the quarter, FFELP net interest margin was at 81 basis points and going forward, FFELP NIM may be impacted by future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of core income in our portfolio. We expect the fourth quarter FFELP net interest margin to remain in the low 80s.
I'm going to slide to -- I'm going to move to Slide 7 to review our private education loan segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased $21 million from the year-ago quarter to $77 million. Third quarter net interest margin came in at 3.77%. The private net interest margin was 6 basis points lower than our expectations, primarily due to a decrease in the spread between our prime earning assets that are funded with LIBOR-based debt. For the fourth quarter, we expect the private student loan net interest margin to be approximately 3.65%. 
The decrease in our provision for losses of $74 million in the prior quarter is as a result of the additional reserve we booked in the second quarter for a segment of borrowers who exited the firm in 2014 and are experiencing unfavorable credit trends compared to those who exited the firm in previous years.
Slide 8 shows our private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This is a portfolio that is well seasoned, with 94% of all loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.
The third quarter charge-offs were at 2.3% or $10 million lower than the third quarter of last year. Our total delinquency rate was at 7.4%, and that's compared to 7.9% in the year-ago quarter. We do expect our annualized charge-off rates for the full year to be approximately 2.6%.
Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings of $79 million in the quarter compare with $85 million in the third quarter of 2014. We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenues of $20 million versus the prior year. This increase was primarily related to the full integration of Gila, which expanded our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space. The decline in asset recovery revenues from the prior quarter is mainly related to 3 items: first, an expected reduction of volume for student loan collections; second, an expected rate change to a flat unit fee structure associated with the Department of Education collections contract, which became effective on July 1; and third, a change in the interpretation of the Department of Education, which impacted allowed collection fees for FFELP loans that Jack mentioned earlier.
During the quarter, we were awarded the state tax amnesty contract that resulted in an increase in our contingency asset recovery receivable inventory of $5.7 billion. The amnesty program will be conducted from September 15 through November 16 of this year. In the past 10 years, we've recovered over $1 billion under similar tax amnesty contracts for states and large municipalities. We expect our asset recovery revenues to be approximately $355 million for 2015.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $237 million or $0.63 per share as compared with net income of $359 million or $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo.
With that, let's open the call up for questions."

There's not a specific time frame for that process. But certainly, we're eager to engage and begin to resolve some of these items. I think it's important to note that several of the items here on this list are items that were previously covered through other regulatory settlements, particularly with the FDIC. Some items are related to Department of Ed policies and regulations. And to my earlier comments, we and borrowers, I think, would certainly benefit from a common understanding of regulators of what the rules and program terms and conditions should be. And some will just -- we will continue to work with them or items that we have addressed and changed in prior years, just as we continue to work with customers to make the process of managing their loans easier. On the legal final maturity date issue, I -- this is -- it's obviously a complicated issue and has lots of moving parts. But at the end of the day, we believe that borrower payments and cash flows coming off the student loan portfolios, while they did slow during that 2008 and 2013 period, for lots of various reasons, that the activities or the performance in those periods really don't form a baseline in which one should extrapolate off of. And that if you look at historical norms, and that is probably closer to what we're experiencing today, prepayment speeds for borrower loans are substantially higher than they were during that time frame. And when you run cash flows and expected borrower behavior off of those numbers, you do get very, very different results. And so having -- we would certainly rather the rating agencies take more time to evaluate the data and get a more comprehensive understanding of potential cash flows here and borrower behavior than to make a short-term answer or solution. So obviously, we'd like the issue resolved, but it's certainly better to have it resolved right or appropriately."

I think the most important thing we do and the thing that we feel most strongly about is helping customers avoid default and the severe consequences of that. That means getting them into repayment programs they can afford. And as the Department of Ed default statistics illustrate here, we do this better than anybody. I mean, to take loans that are basically the same across all servicers and deliver a 38% lower default rate as -- those are the results people are looking for here, right, getting borrowers into programs they can afford. As I mentioned, some folks do believe that income-driven repayment is the ultimate solution. What we do is we really work with customers to let them understand the range of options that they have available to them, and they get to pick the one that fits their budget best. And 70% of our dollar volume is enrolled in an alternative payment program, which would include everything from income-driven repayment solutions to loan consolidation, which extends the loan term out. So these are the solutions that work for our customers and drive the substantially lower default rates. I think that's kind of how we've been working with the regulators in this.

And the other big issue here, which we have talked about before and I've written about, is simplification of the program. The share volume and terms of some of these repayment options can be very overwhelming to people who are not dealing with this day to day. It's hard for them to understand which program produces the best results for them.

One of the things that we have looked at as we completed the separation is what are our core capabilities and how are those transferable into different areas or different asset classes. And in the asset recovery business services sector, this is an area where we have developed a very, very strong and successful track record of helping our customers manage their cash flows through either asset recovery or business processes types of things. And for years, our focus here was on educational loans almost exclusively. And we began to develop alternatives working with state agencies and municipalities. Somsak referenced the state tax amnesty program that we're running as an example. We've had long-standing contracts with a number of cities and states managing their receivables book. And we thought that there are a couple of places that we could go to expand our footprint and really put us in a place that we can grow rapidly on an organic basis off of that. Gila -- the acquisition of Gila earlier this year was one example of leveraging those skills and capabilities into a broader municipal arena and geographic areas where we were not strong to begin with. And Xtend does the same thing for us in a new area of health care payments. Our view here was that an acquisition in this space was really necessary for us to bring a resume to bear and -- but yet, the activities that they do are very, very similar to what we do with other asset classes and so bringing our scale, our data, sophistication and strategies to that process is something that we think will allow us to grow those businesses rapidly. And when you look at the opportunities there relative to share repurchases, that's where we do our math and understand what we can drive in terms of the economics. It's a better deal for shareholders, in our view, to allocate that capital to that acquisition than it is to do share repurchases. I want to be clear, however, that these are small -- relatively small acquisitions that help us build a footprint. It's not a -- our strategy is not to buy our -- buy these businesses through a series of acquisitions, but to build a footprint and grow organically."

I think, if my numbers are right, that since the spin, we have spent $1.242 billion buying back 69 million shares at an average price of $18. And when you increased about the repurchase program, I think the response in the company generally has been that you believe the net asset value is in the area of $22 or $23, and that repurchasing to make sense. We agree with that, by the way. That number is $23. If we still believe that, we would urge you to find ways of being creative to raise additional funds, to double down or triple down. I think you're in sympathy with that, but we would just urge you, there's no better use of shareholder money than buying something back at $0.50 on the dollar, particularly in this environment where there's very few things selling at $0.50 on the dollar. So that's kind of an advocacy question -- not a question, but an advocacy statement. Second, I noticed that recently that a company by name of Winthrop Realty announced the intention to liquidate. And when I called the CEO -- I was not a shareholder in the company. When I called the CEO I knew, I asked him what motivated him. He said he felt that the prospect of him getting the stock to sell at the net asset value that he believed the company had was so remote that he felt the best thing to do is to liquidate the company, return the money to shareholders. And kind of a theme out of that book, you deal with many regulators, some of which have conflicting views. We're living with constant criticism and a hostile environment despite the social good you do for the people that borrow money from you. Has the Board considered the advised ability of liquidating the company by going into a runoff and returning the money to shareholders so they can invest in companies that are more appreciated by shareholders or the government? And so that's kind of a philosophical question. And third, your comment, I thought, was very interesting, I have no problem with the Xtend acquisition, companies cannot repurchase stock to success and you got to grow the business. But when you said that it's more accretive than stock repurchase, I would probably challenge that because, essentially, when you buy back stock, you're probably looking at the earnings per share impact of what earnings you got versus the cost of money, et cetera. But in the stock repurchase, you're retiring a 5% dividend and you're capturing a $9 discount to NAV. And obviously, as you retire more shares at a $9 discount to NAV, then NAV goes up. So I'm not sure you're calculating correctly the virtue of Xtend versus a stock repurchase. But that's not a big deal because I think you're trying to grow the company. So those are just observations. I don't know if you want to comment on them, but I'll leave them up to you. But we're very supportive of management. That's not a complaint, just an observation."

And we are working hard to find those creative alternatives to allow us to do more and more both in -- 2 things are on sale here, right, at both the debt and the share price. And so we are aggressively working on both of those. And one of the unique parts of our business is if we can finance assets through an ABS transaction, we're able to raise funds substantially cheaper than our cost of debt in the unsecured arena, and so it's an easy arbitrage to take advantage of and one that would like to do -- see more of that. Same is true on the share repurchase side. I do want to spend a little bit of time on your -- just on your comment about the liquidation issue here. The value -- the franchise value of this company is really anchored in the cash flows coming from the student loan portfolios, and I would say the regulatory issues are coming from our service -- the servicing of student loans. The -- in effect, not because we chose this, it was chosen by Congress, we are liquidating our student loan holdings. They're an amortizing portfolio. No new FFELP loans are being created. And those loans will -- those portfolios will go to 0 over time, and our job is to maximize the earnings of that portfolio. We think we can -- we're doing that and running the operation on that side of the equation is frankly not a whole lot different in either kind of alternative structure. On the servicing side of the equation, there's no question that as a business, we do a great job in this space, and we deliver value for our customers and taxpayers in the results that we generate. If the regulatory environment is not going to allow that business to work and be profitable, then it's not an attractive business, and that is certainly something we would take a look at. We need to work with the regulators today to resolve this -- the open issues with the state agencies and the CFPB, and we're going to do that. And a big part of our strategy is really about driving and producing the results that all, including the regulators, are looking for here. But that's a to-be-determined opportunity for sure."

So what I was curious about, and I've asked the question a little bit differently from what Lee was asking earlier, rather than going to liquidation, in your discussions with fixed income investors, is the concern here in the widening of credit spreads for you guys more a function of some concern that you might split the company up into some sort of servicing and asset management business, such that credit spreads -- that would explain the spread widening?

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter's earnings call. Thank you for listening.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter's earnings call. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your interest and your support.
Our results this quarter of $0.48, excluding regulatory expenses, are holding in line with our expectations. They demonstrate the quality of our loan portfolio, the earnings they generate and our strong capabilities in delinquency and default prevention. Our provision for private credit loan losses declined to $117 million this quarter, a reduction of 39% from the prior quarter and 10% from the year-ago period.
For federal education loans we own and service, performance trends continued to improve since the peak of the recession, with Navient delivering results 38% better than our peers. Our results also benefited from our continued expansion into services beyond student loans. Year-to-date, our nonstudent loan-related revenue totaled $75 million, twice the amount earned in the first 9 months of 2014.
Gila, which we acquired earlier this year as part of our strategy to leverage our asset recovery and business services capabilities, has generated a 38% increase in net income year-over-year. In addition to the $8 million in regulatory expense, this quarter's results also included the impact of $11 million in loan servicing conversion expense, $6 million from the reduction in asset recovery revenue from a change in interpretation of the Department of Education allowed collection fees and the write-off of $5 million in deferred financing costs as a result of our calling ABS securities. 
Today, we also completed the acquisition of Xtend Healthcare. This acquisition is consistent with our previously announced intentions that leverages our core capabilities in the asset recovery and business services area to the attractive health care payment sector. Xtend works with over 130 hospitals and medical providers to process payments for the large and rapidly growing patient pay marketplace. This transaction provides a footprint in this attractive sector from which we believe we can drive significant organic growth. This transaction will bring value to our shareholders and our franchise, will be more accretive than share repurchases even in current market conditions and after the purchase price is cash flow positive. We're delighted to welcome the Xtend team to Navient.
Our business units continued to deliver on the operations front. For example, we successfully completed the conversion of nearly $5 billion in FFELP loans from a third-party servicer platform to our own. Our conversion methodology met or exceeded best practices, including robust data mapping and testing, multiple communications prior to and after the conversion to the customer and a dedicated and specially trained call center team. Our team worked hard to deliver a positive experience for customers, and I'm pleased with the rewarding customer feedback. 
This past week, we launched a new customer online portal designed to simplify the experience for customers and improve operating efficiency. We also continued our conversion to a new collections platform that will create flexibility for onboarding new clients as well as drive lower operating costs.
We continue to leverage automation tools to support compliance and consistency while delivering operating efficiency. In addition, we continue to assist our customers in the successful management of their loans. Last month, the Department of Education released the 2012 3-year cohort default rates. And once again, Navient-serviced federal loans defaulted at a significantly lower rate than other borrowers. As I stated earlier, 38% lower. 
Our efforts to help customers succeed drive these results. We help our customers successfully manage their loans through extensive and targeted outreach efforts to promote affordable payment solutions. For example, nearly 1 in 5 borrowers and 1/3 of all dollars serviced are enrolled in income-driven repayment plans. We promote repayment options to our 10 million federal loan customers through over 170 million letters, e-mails and texts each year, and we assist the 345,000 borrowers who paid their loans in full this year.
As you and certainly we, as management and fellow shareholders are well aware, several items, including industry-specific issues are weighing heavily on our stock price and credit spreads. These factors have put limits on our access to new sources of liquidity, particularly new issuance of unsecured notes. Ironically, while the price of our unsecured debt makes it very attractive for us to repurchase, it's very difficult to find willing sellers.
While these issues have created some uncertainty for our investors, I consider the market reaction to be significantly out of proportion. As a result, I will address the main issues of the legal final maturity date in the current regulatory environment directly.
Earlier this year, Moody's and Fitch placed $34 billion of our FFELP ABS on credit watch due to concerns that trust cash flows will not be sufficient to pay all bonds by the legal final maturity date. This concern is based largely on the increased use of income-driven repayment programs and other repayment options. While borrowers are in fact using these important options, particularly income-driven repayment programs, at higher rates, we still expect borrower payments will be sufficient to meet the legal final maturity dates. To provide added assurance, we've added call rights on most trusts that allow us to purchase up to 20% of the original balance of student loans sold to the trust.
To help put this issue in perspective, of the $34 billion in bonds on credit watch, less than $2.2 billion have a maturity date in the next 5 years. Even at a 0% prepayment speed, a rate our trusts have never experienced, we expect loan cash flows to be sufficient to meet the maturity dates. Our data show borrower payment did slow with the recovery of the economy and the improvement in the job markets due to a rapidly falling default rates. This is a good thing. Since then, borrower prepayment speeds have returned to historical levels and remain at levels that are significantly greater than 0%.
Last week, we released an in-depth loan payment data package, including an audio explanation of the slides and earlier this week, we filed a very detailed response to Moody's request for comment. We'll continue to work with the rating agencies to produce the appropriate outcome.
As you know, the CFPB and state agencies have been reviewing our servicing and collections operations. The common public narrative is that the majority of borrowers are struggling with excessive student loan debt. And further, if only servicers informed borrowers of the available repayment options, delinquency and defaults would all but disappear. In reality, the vast majority of all borrowers are successfully meeting their payment obligations, and we have assisted more than 1/2 of borrowers that we service, covering nearly 70% of balances to select and enroll in an alternative payment program.
At Navient, we developed sophisticated data-driven strategies to reach struggling borrowers. When we do connect, more than 9 out of 10x we are able to enroll the customer in a program that keeps them out of default. Sadly, over 90% of our borrowers that do reach default do not respond to our hundreds of attempts to contact them. It goes without saying, we cannot enroll a borrower in an alternative payment program if we cannot connect with them.
Some also believe that all borrowers should be enrolled in income-driven repayment options. And for some borrowers, enrollment in an income-driven payment plan is the right choice. Income-driven repayment plans, however, extend the loan term. As a result for many borrowers, this would significantly increase the total amount paid over the life of the loan. For example, a borrower with $30,000 in loans and a starting salary of $30,000 per year, they would pay 33% more under payee than under the standard repayment term even though a small portion of the loan would be forgiven after 20 years. For some borrowers, this is just not an attractive alternative.
Finally, there is some concern that regulatory changes will create significant increases in servicing costs. While we expect regulators to issue standard practices for student loan servicing and collection, we believe these standards will establish consistency within the industry and will be beneficial to borrowers and servicers. We would welcome the introduction of standards that are recognized by all of our regulators.
These factors have combined to weigh heavily on our stock price. Many analysts have written that a reasonable discounted value of our stable and predictable cash flows support a stock price north of $20 a share. I agree. Since quarter end, we have purchased 4.7 million shares at an average price of $11.81, bringing our year-to-date purchases to 46.7 million shares at an average price of $17.80. 
Also since quarter end, we repurchased $43 million of unsecured debt mainly at the July 2018 issue. Our near-term objective is to take advantage of these current market prices. And while we have ample liquidity to service our debt for the next few years, we are aggressively pursuing options that would allow us to increase our activities in both debt and share repurchases. We have substantial assets available to do so, and I am confident in our ability to execute here. For example, we have $5.2 billion in unencumbered student loans, $11.5 billion in net assets in our securitization trusts and close to $5 billion in servicing cash flows from our securitization trusts. 
Bottom line, our business is sound and is generating the earnings and cash flows we expect. Our student loan assets represent a rock-solid foundation of value that we're well prepared to capture. These assets and our existing operating capabilities will allow us to continue to create value for our investors.
Somsak will now provide more details on the results of the quarter. Sak?"

During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.In the third quarter, we reported $0.47 per share of core earnings",1031,"Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. During my prepared remarks, I'll be referencing the earnings call presentation beginning with Slide 4, which provides a summary of our core earnings.
In the third quarter, we reported $0.47 per share of core earnings. These results included $0.01 per share or a $8 million impact of regulatory-related costs and a $0.02 per share or $11 million of onetime conversion costs through nearly $5 billion of FFELP loans to our servicing system.
Our third quarter operating expenses totaled $228 million compared to operating expenses of $195 million a year ago. The increase is related to the cost previously mentioned and additional costs resulting from the recent acquisition of Gila. We expect 2015 core EPS to be approximately $1.85 and operating expenses of less than $900 million. These items do exclude regulatory-related costs as well as the impact of the acquisition of Xtend.
And before I go into our segment results, I'd like to highlight the financing activities that took place in the third quarter on Slide 5. In the quarter, we issued a $700 million private loan securitization transaction. The collateral for this transaction was made up of well-seasoned, high-quality loans, primarily from our SLM 2010-B trust. This transaction resulted in lower cost of funds overall and raised over $70 million of cash after paying off the 2010-B transaction.
As Jack mentioned, we submitted our comments addressing the legal final maturity issue to Moody's earlier this week. And to help address this issue, during the quarter, we funded $852 million of cleanup calls associated with 7 FFELP trusts. Year-to-date, we have funded $1.1 billion of cleanup calls through our FFELP ABCP conduits. And additionally, we amended another 16 trusts to include a 10% optional servicer purchase right.
Our unsecured debt declined by $428 million to less than $16 billion outstanding at quarter end. We maintained a tangible net asset ratio of 1.25x and have purchased an additional $43 million of unsecured debt in October.
In the quarter, we repurchased 12.1 million shares for $175 million and have repurchased an additional 4.8 million shares as of October 20. We have remaining authority of $168 million under our current share repurchase plan as of October 20. All this activity was undertaking while maintaining a strong capital position. And we will look for ways to manage the timing of our future cash flows from our student loan portfolio to better match the maturity profile of our unsecured debt. 
Let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our FFELP segment results. FFELP core earnings were $70 million for third quarter 2015, and that's compared with $79 million in the third quarter 2014. For the quarter, FFELP net interest margin was at 81 basis points and going forward, FFELP NIM may be impacted by future LIBOR rates, which will impact the amount of core income in our portfolio. We expect the fourth quarter FFELP net interest margin to remain in the low 80s.
I'm going to slide to -- I'm going to move to Slide 7 to review our private education loan segment. Core earnings in this segment decreased $21 million from the year-ago quarter to $77 million. Third quarter net interest margin came in at 3.77%. The private net interest margin was 6 basis points lower than our expectations, primarily due to a decrease in the spread between our prime earning assets that are funded with LIBOR-based debt. For the fourth quarter, we expect the private student loan net interest margin to be approximately 3.65%. 
The decrease in our provision for losses of $74 million in the prior quarter is as a result of the additional reserve we booked in the second quarter for a segment of borrowers who exited the firm in 2014 and are experiencing unfavorable credit trends compared to those who exited the firm in previous years.
Slide 8 shows our private education loan asset quality trends over the last 5 years. This is a portfolio that is well seasoned, with 94% of all loans in repayment status having made more than 12 payments.
The third quarter charge-offs were at 2.3% or $10 million lower than the third quarter of last year. Our total delinquency rate was at 7.4%, and that's compared to 7.9% in the year-ago quarter. We do expect our annualized charge-off rates for the full year to be approximately 2.6%.
Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our business services segment. In this segment, core earnings of $79 million in the quarter compare with $85 million in the third quarter of 2014. We saw an increase in our asset recovery revenues of $20 million versus the prior year. This increase was primarily related to the full integration of Gila, which expanded our footprint in the asset recovery and business process outsourcing space. The decline in asset recovery revenues from the prior quarter is mainly related to 3 items: first, an expected reduction of volume for student loan collections; second, an expected rate change to a flat unit fee structure associated with the Department of Education collections contract, which became effective on July 1; and third, a change in the interpretation of the Department of Education, which impacted allowed collection fees for FFELP loans that Jack mentioned earlier.
During the quarter, we were awarded the state tax amnesty contract that resulted in an increase in our contingency asset recovery receivable inventory of $5.7 billion. The amnesty program will be conducted from September 15 through November 16 of this year. In the past 10 years, we've recovered over $1 billion under similar tax amnesty contracts for states and large municipalities. We expect our asset recovery revenues to be approximately $355 million for 2015.
Finally, turning to GAAP results on Slide 10. We recorded third quarter GAAP net income of $237 million or $0.63 per share as compared with net income of $359 million or $0.85 per share in the third quarter of 2014. And just as a reminder, the primary differences between core earnings and GAAP are the marks related to our derivative positions, expenses related to the restructuring and reorganization and the income associated with SLM BankCo.
With that, let's open the call up for questions."

There's not a specific time frame for that process. But certainly, we're eager to engage and begin to resolve some of these items. I think it's important to note that several of the items here on this list are items that were previously covered through other regulatory settlements, particularly with the FDIC. Some items are related to Department of Ed policies and regulations. And to my earlier comments, we and borrowers, I think, would certainly benefit from a common understanding of regulators of what the rules and program terms and conditions should be. And some will just -- we will continue to work with them or items that we have addressed and changed in prior years, just as we continue to work with customers to make the process of managing their loans easier. On the legal final maturity date issue, I -- this is -- it's obviously a complicated issue and has lots of moving parts. But at the end of the day, we believe that borrower payments and cash flows coming off the student loan portfolios, while they did slow during that 2008 and 2013 period, for lots of various reasons, that the activities or the performance in those periods really don't form a baseline in which one should extrapolate off of. And that if you look at historical norms, and that is probably closer to what we're experiencing today, prepayment speeds for borrower loans are substantially higher than they were during that time frame. And when you run cash flows and expected borrower behavior off of those numbers, you do get very, very different results. And so having -- we would certainly rather the rating agencies take more time to evaluate the data and get a more comprehensive understanding of potential cash flows here and borrower behavior than to make a short-term answer or solution. So obviously, we'd like the issue resolved, but it's certainly better to have it resolved right or appropriately."

I mean, to take loans that are basically the same across all servicers and deliver a 38% lower default rate as -- those are the results people are looking for here, right, getting borrowers into programs they can afford. As I mentioned, some folks do believe that income-driven repayment is the ultimate solution. What we do is we really work with customers to let them understand the range of options that they have available to them, and they get to pick the one that fits their budget best. And 70% of our dollar volume is enrolled in an alternative payment program, which would include everything from income-driven repayment solutions to loan consolidation, which extends the loan term out. So these are the solutions that work for our customers and drive the substantially lower default rates. I think that's kind of how we've been working with the regulators in this.

And the other big issue here, which we have talked about before and I've written about, is simplification of the program. The share volume and terms of some of these repayment options can be very overwhelming to people who are not dealing with this day to day. It's hard for them to understand which program produces the best results for them. And if we can simplify, then narrow, then shrink them down into a fewer but more simple programs to understand, I think everyone benefits from that."

One of the things that we have looked at as we completed the separation is what are our core capabilities and how are those transferable into different areas or different asset classes. And in the asset recovery business services sector, this is an area where we have developed a very, very strong and successful track record of helping our customers manage their cash flows through either asset recovery or business processes types of things. And for years, our focus here was on educational loans almost exclusively. And we began to develop alternatives working with state agencies and municipalities. Somsak referenced the state tax amnesty program that we're running as an example. We've had long-standing contracts with a number of cities and states managing their receivables book. And we thought that there are a couple of places that we could go to expand our footprint and really put us in a place that we can grow rapidly on an organic basis off of that. Gila -- the acquisition of Gila earlier this year was one example of leveraging those skills and capabilities into a broader municipal arena and geographic areas where we were not strong to begin with. And Xtend does the same thing for us in a new area of health care payments. Our view here was that an acquisition in this space was really necessary for us to bring a resume to bear and -- but yet, the activities that they do are very, very similar to what we do with other asset classes and so bringing our scale, our data, sophistication and strategies to that process is something that we think will allow us to grow those businesses rapidly. And when you look at the opportunities there relative to share repurchases, that's where we do our math and understand what we can drive in terms of the economics. It's a better deal for shareholders, in our view, to allocate that capital to that acquisition than it is to do share repurchases. I want to be clear, however, that these are small -- relatively small acquisitions that help us build a footprint. It's not a -- our strategy is not to buy our -- buy these businesses through a series of acquisitions, but to build a footprint and grow organically."

I think, if my numbers are right, that since the spin, we have spent $1.242 billion buying back 69 million shares at an average price of $18. And when you increased about the repurchase program, I think the response in the company generally has been that you believe the net asset value is in the area of $22 or $23, and that repurchasing to make sense. We agree with that, by the way. That number is $23. If we still believe that, we would urge you to find ways of being creative to raise additional funds, to double down or triple down. I think you're in sympathy with that, but we would just urge you, there's no better use of shareholder money than buying something back at $0.50 on the dollar, particularly in this environment where there's very few things selling at $0.50 on the dollar. So that's kind of an advocacy question -- not a question, but an advocacy statement. Second, I noticed that recently that a company by name of Winthrop Realty announced the intention to liquidate. And when I called the CEO -- I was not a shareholder in the company. When I called the CEO I knew, I asked him what motivated him. He said he felt that the prospect of him getting the stock to sell at the net asset value that he believed the company had was so remote that he felt the best thing to do is to liquidate the company, return the money to shareholders. And kind of a theme out of that book, you deal with many regulators, some of which have conflicting views. We're living with constant criticism and a hostile environment despite the social good you do for the people that borrow money from you. Has the Board considered the advised ability of liquidating the company by going into a runoff and returning the money to shareholders so they can invest in companies that are more appreciated by shareholders or the government? And so that's kind of a philosophical question. And third, your comment, I thought, was very interesting, I have no problem with the Xtend acquisition, companies cannot repurchase stock to success and you got to grow the business. But when you said that it's more accretive than stock repurchase, I would probably challenge that because, essentially, when you buy back stock, you're probably looking at the earnings per share impact of what earnings you got versus the cost of money, et cetera. But in the stock repurchase, you're retiring a 5% dividend and you're capturing a $9 discount to NAV. And obviously, as you retire more shares at a $9 discount to NAV, then NAV goes up. So I'm not sure you're calculating correctly the virtue of Xtend versus a stock repurchase. But that's not a big deal because I think you're trying to grow the company. So those are just observations. I don't know if you want to comment on them, but I'll leave them up to you. But we're very supportive of management. That's not a complaint, just an observation."

Same is true on the share repurchase side. I do want to spend a little bit of time on your -- just on your comment about the liquidation issue here. The value -- the franchise value of this company is really anchored in the cash flows coming from the student loan portfolios, and I would say the regulatory issues are coming from our service -- the servicing of student loans. The -- in effect, not because we chose this, it was chosen by Congress, we are liquidating our student loan holdings. They're an amortizing portfolio. No new FFELP loans are being created. And those loans will -- those portfolios will go to 0 over time, and our job is to maximize the earnings of that portfolio. We think we can -- we're doing that and running the operation on that side of the equation is frankly not a whole lot different in either kind of alternative structure. On the servicing side of the equation, there's no question that as a business, we do a great job in this space, and we deliver value for our customers and taxpayers in the results that we generate. If the regulatory environment is not going to allow that business to work and be profitable, then it's not an attractive business, and that is certainly something we would take a look at. We need to work with the regulators today to resolve this -- the open issues with the state agencies and the CFPB, and we're going to do that. And a big part of our strategy is really about driving and producing the results that all, including the regulators, are looking for here. But that's a to-be-determined opportunity for sure."

And Jack, you talked about it earlier, either several things that seem to have come together all at one time from a headline perspective that I think made, perhaps, bondholders nervous and also some stockholders nervous expecting the selloff.

So what I was curious about, and I've asked the question a little bit differently from what Lee was asking earlier, rather than going to liquidation, in your discussions with fixed income investors, is the concern here in the widening of credit spreads for you guys more a function of some concern that you might split the company up into some sort of servicing and asset management business, such that credit spreads -- that would explain the spread widening?

And as we've kind of responded to the -- some of the thesis here and items, I think you're seen both our credit spreads tighten and our stock price improve.
