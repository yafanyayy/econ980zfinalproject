We delivered record results in the fourth quarter and full year, a result of solid execution within our business and our focus on the fundamentals. We are pleased that we are able to learn from our underperformance in last year's fourth quarter and build momentum throughout 2014. We had sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management across all of our businesses in the fourth quarter.
Earnings per share increased 15% to $1.89 versus $1.65 last year. To take you through the fourth quarter results, as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales for the quarter increased 7% to $4.069 billion and comps increased 6%. The gross margin rate increased 210 basis points to 45.1%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The SG&A rate increased by 120 basis points, driven primarily by increased incentive compensation and, to a lesser extent, an increase in store selling cost. Operating income dollars increased 11% to $957 million. The tax rate in the quarter of 35.8% provided $0.07 of upside to our initial guidance and an additional $0.06 versus last year.
Turning to our full year results on Page 5. Earnings per share increased 15% to $3.50 per share versus $3.05 last year. Net sales increased 6% to $11.454 billion and comps increased 4% on top of 2% last year. The gross margin rate increased 90 basis points to 42%, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The SG&A rate was flat year-over-year.
Page 7 details our full year operating income results. Our full year operating income rate was 17.1%, up 90 basis points to last year. Operating income dollars increased $209.6 million or 12%, driven by growth in all 3 business segments.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square-foot at cost ended the quarter down 10% versus last year. Inventories are clean and well-positioned. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square foot down in the mid single-digit range.
Operating cash flow in 2014 was $1.786 billion. Free cash flow was $1.071 billion and capital expenditures was $715 million. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock this year for $84 million. As we announced earlier this month, our Board authorized a new $250 million share repurchase program, which included the $91 million remaining under the previous program.
We also announced the 47% increase in our annual dividend to $2 per share and declared a special dividend of $2 per share. The $2 special dividend and the quarterly dividend of $0.50 a share will be paid on March 6 to shareholders of record on February 20.
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in Victoria's Secret real estate increased store selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates.
Our first quarter earnings forecast reflects a low to mid single-digit comp increase, reflects an updated February comp forecast of up mid single-digits. We expect the first quarter gross margin rate to be about flat to last year. We expect some deleverage in the SG&A rate, driven primarily by an increase in marketing and store selling cost. We expect nonoperating expense in the first quarter to be about flat to last year at $80 million.
We expect earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.55 in the first quarter against last year's $0.53 result. This forecast includes a net negative impact of about $0.03 related to a decline in operating income at Victoria's Secret Direct, as we are lapping about $65 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel from last year. It also includes a negative $0.01 to $0.02 impact from foreign change.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage and our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 percentage point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be about flat and the SG&A rate to be about flat to down slightly to last year. Nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are protected to be about $315 million, roughly flat to last year.
Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07.
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 300 million in the first quarter and the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.45 and $3.65. This estimates includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10 to $0.12.
We are projecting 2015 capital spending between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores, the remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities. As detailed on Page 13 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret's square footage in North America will increase by about 5% this year driven by expansions of existing VS stores and 26 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 24 net new openings and 90 remodels.
Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%. Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, just more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

In 2014, we exited both the apparel and makeup businesses, which allowed us to focus",693,"Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. 2014 was an important year for us, as we delivered positive results while also making significant changes to our business. In 2014, we exited both the apparel and makeup businesses, which allowed us to focus more on our 4 and shared product offering. We delivered strong growth in sales and profitability despite these headwinds. Now let's talk about our performance in Q4.
The Victoria's Secret segment grew both sales and operating income. Total sales increased 5% to $2.4 billion and comp sales increased 4% on top of 2% last year, with operating income increasing $46 million or 10% and our operating income rate increasing 110 basis points.
Merchandise margin dollars and rate for the segment increased, led by the growth in the stores channel. We also finished the quarter in good inventory position, down double digits per square foot to last year. Now let's turn to specific channel performance, starting with the stores.
We are pleased with the fourth quarter as sales in operating income both increased to record results. Entering the quarter with leaner inventory levels allowed us to read and react with speed and agility. It positioned us to be able to get back into trends while quickly reducing markdowns. 
In addition, we exited a thoughtful approach to our promotions. As a result, this approach and leaner inventory levels allowed us to drive significant improvement in our margin rate. SG&A deleveraged by higher incentive compensation and store selling cost. Buy-in occupancy also deleveraged driven by our continued investment in store real estate. Operating income in the quarter increased, a result of higher sales coupled with margin rate expansion.
Now turning to the direct channel. Our fourth quarter results continue to reflect our strategy to exit noncore apparel categories. Fourth quarter sales were down 2%, as we exited roughly $80 million of non-go-forward apparels sales in the fourth quarter last year. 
Our strategy to distort the core categories, where we have our best growth opportunities, is working. Collectively, in sales in bras, panties, PINK, sport, beauty and lounge were up mid-teens. The merchandise margin rate was up during the quarter, as we continue to distort to the core. This increase was partially offset by the exit of non-go-forward apparel merchandise. Merchandise margin dollars were flat to last year. Operating income dollars and rate declined, driven by investments in our digital shopping experience and higher incentive compensation.
Turning to our full year results. Total Victoria's Secret segment sales increased 5% to $7.2 billion. Operating income increased by $118 million to $1.3 billion, and the operating income rate improved by 80 basis points to 17.6%. In the stores channel, comps increased 3% with total store channel sales up 6%. The merchandise margin rate increased versus last year. As a result, operating income rate and dollars were up year-over-year.
In the direct channel, sales were roughly flat. The merchandise margin rate declined driven by the exit of non-go-forward apparel and expenses deleverage. As a result, operating income rate in dollars were down.
Looking ahead to 2015, we will continue our focused, fast, frugal approach managing both inventory and expenses appropriately to optimize our business. We are planning conservatively while focusing on driving growth in our core categories and leveraging speed to read and react.
As a reminder, we will continue to be up against the exits of non-go-forward apparel and makeup, which collectively represented roughly $185 million in sales in 2014. However, we are cautiously optimistic that we will maintain our positive trend. We are excited about our fashion offerings this season and feel good about our bra business in Lingerie, sport and PINK. We are investing in real estate, store selling and digital enhancement to create even better shopping experience for our customers. We have momentum across the brand coming off holiday and heading into Spring Break for both PINK and Victoria's Secret lingerie. 
Finally, we are very excited for the first ever Victoria's Secret Swim Special, which will air tonight on CBS. So make sure to tune in, featuring musical performance by Maroon 5 and 1S. Thanks. And now, I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our record results during the quarter after disappointing fourth quarter last year. We were able to drive significant growth in sales while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down. 
Total sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 9% or $122 million to last year. Comps increased 8%, and our direct channel sales grew at 25%. Sales were strong across of the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: Our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business, and our home fragrance assortment. The we're pleased with the customers acceptance of our holiday assortment, the visual appeal of our stores and the in-store execution of our plans.
We were looking to reestablish ourselves as the holiday destination by celebrating the moment better in our floor sets and in our activities. We believe that this approach helps drives a successful holiday period. The momentum for holiday continued with a strong semiannual sale performance and a positive response to our early spring collections. Promotional activity was relatively flat to last year, and we were able to execute a plan that balance fewer or more impactful activities that generated a strong response from our customers. For the quarter, operating income was $449 million, up 13% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 110 basis points to 32%, driven by expense leverage and improvement in merchandise margin rates.
We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel. Fourth quarter operating income grew significantly versus last year and annual sales went over $300 million. For fiscal 2014, total sales grew by 7% versus last year and comps ended up 6%. 
Operating income was $737 million, up 14% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 120 basis points to 22%, driven by expense leverage and an improvement in merchandise margin rates. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2015, we will continue to leverage our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class in-store experience to our customers. We're optimistic about the trend of our business and confident in our plans. But understand, we need to keep getting better to win in the competitive retail with our event. We will flow newness throughout the quarter beginning this month with our 11 sunshine theme that features new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses. 
Our inventories are well-positioned heading into the new year and are flexible enough to react to customer's preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, but we will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business. 
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin."

As in previous calls, I should give you a brief overview of our progress in the international businesses. As we all know, our opportunity for international growth is significant, and we feel good about the strategic choices we make to be steady and purposeful, to pursue a test and learn philosophy that reflects the DNA of our company. We made good progress in the fourth quarter. And as detailed on Page 14 of your presentation, we opened 140 international locations in 2014 to end the year with 394 stores in the segment. For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 40% to $105.5 million and operating income increased 76% to $29.5 million.
In 2014, revenue and profit from our Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works stores outside of North America grew substantially. Revenue increased by 51% to $335.9 million and operating income more than doubled to $78 million and 23.2% in revenue.
At Victoria's Secret International, we're pleased with the performance to our full assortment stores. In the U.K., we continue to be very pleased with our London flagship store on Bond Street, as well as our 9 mall stores. We'll open another 4 stores in the U.K. this year. In the Middle East, we now have 13 Victoria's Secret stores and 1 PINK store open under our partnership with Alshaya. 
We continue to be delighted with the results and will open another 8 to 10 stores this year. Staying with Victoria's Secret, our Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories business continues to progress well with 290 locations open at the end of the year, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We've opened 9 VSBA stores in China, and I'm pleased with the results. 
Mexico is also looking promising with 14 local market VSBA stores now open. We'll open another 120 stores also across the globe in 2015. 
Turning to Bath & Body Works. We now have 80 BBW stores under our franchise partnerships, and we continue to be very pleased with the performance of these stores with notable openings in Southeast Asia and Latin America in 2014. We expect to open another 50 or so BBW franchise stores in the year ahead. 
So in summary, a good year for international in 2014, and we remain focused on the fundamentals, great execution of our brands wherever we go."

We continue to think about the bra business, which obviously has a little bit more complexity to it. That's probably an understatement. And we have worked very hard to both in the PINK and Lingerie business to be able to read those businesses on a Monday and to get back into inventory -- back into the stores within 4 weeks. We continue to think about different ways in how we can even improve our opportunities across all categories. And as I said earlier, the opportunity as well is how do we can even shorten our development time. Now we've already taken probably 4 months out of our development time and believe there's probably another 2 months to continue to work in as we go into 2015. We've done dot work.

We decided that we just did not want to continue to play in that, that we feel that more emotion is better than promotion. I think even the consumer are kind of seeing a fatigue in promotion. The opportunity to win even earlier in the holiday season, whether it's the first part of November, continues to be an opportunity for us. We had a stellar record. Thanks, Black Friday. So I can't tell you that there was really any surprises for us. We were fortunate to pull back on to promotions. And then, therefore, I think the real opportunity, as we continue to think about holiday 2015, again, it's how do we get more emotion, better products, better fashion, more covetable items, and I think that's what the customer is yearning for versus just discontinued slogging it out to the promotional world."

In terms of further opportunity to improve turn, it's not going to be at the same level that we've accomplished over the last few years.

And we believe that our average sellings could be dependent on the market, probably needs almost be double that. When you think about the opportunities and growth that we have in PINK and the productivity that we're doing in PINK, we think that there's huge upside in that category. That is where we've been investing a lot of our real estate growth. But at the same time, we're still under space in terms of Victoria's Secret lingerie. And we probably quoted these numbers before that 80% of our stores don't have the full assortment of PINK and don't have the full assortment of Victoria's Secret lingerie. So these larger square footage stores gives us the opportunity, not only to do Victoria's Secret lingerie correctly, it gives us the opportunity to do PINK correctly. And then the 2 merging categories, when you think about sport and swim. So we're at a great place today in the fact that we don't -- we have more proven ideas than we have real estate to support them. So this real estate and bigger stores gives us that opportunity. As we have learned over the last 3 years with the bigger real estate, not only have we've grown square footage, we've also grown productivity in these larger square foot stores. Now we're very cautious. We don't want to over bill. We don't want to over bill the square footage. So therefore, gives us excitement and opportunity to grow the categories are just as I spoke a little bit about the sport business earlier, we only really have real estate in 189 stores out of the 1,049 that we have actually do sport and to do sport well. So I'm excited about this. It's the right strategy, and I honestly wish I could go faster."

We delivered record results in the fourth quarter and full year, a result of solid execution within our business and a focus on the fundamentals. We are pleased that we are able to learn from our underperformance",1012,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered record results in the fourth quarter and full year, a result of solid execution within our business and a focus on the fundamentals. We are pleased that we are able to learn from our underperformance in last year's fourth quarter and build momentum throughout 2014. We had sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management across all of our businesses in the fourth quarter.
Earnings per share increased 15% to $1.89 versus $1.65 last year. To take you through the fourth quarter results, as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales for the quarter increased 7% to $4.069 billion and comps increased 6%. The gross margin rate increased 210 basis points to 45.1%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The SG&A rate increased by 120 basis points, driven primarily by increased incentive compensation and, to a lesser extent, an increase in store selling cost. Operating income dollars increased 11% to $957 million. The tax rate in the quarter of 35.8% provided $0.07 of upside to our initial guidance and an additional $0.06 versus last year.
Turning to our full year results on Page 5. Earnings per share increased 15% to $3.50 per share versus $3.05 last year. Net sales increased 6% to $11.454 billion and comps increased 4% on top of 2% last year. The gross margin rate increased 90 basis points to 42%, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The SG&A rate was flat year-over-year.
Page 7 details our full year operating income results. Our full year operating income rate was 17.1%, up 90 basis points to last year. Operating income dollars increased $209.6 million or 12%, driven by growth in all 3 business segments.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 10% versus last year. Inventories are clean and well positioned. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square foot down in the mid single-digit range.
Operating cash flow in 2014 was $1.786 billion. Free cash flow was $1.071 billion, and capital expenditures were $715 million. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock this year for $84 million. As we announced earlier this month, our board authorized a new $250 million share repurchase program, which included the $91 million remaining under the previous program.
We also announced the 47% increase in our annual dividend to $2 per share and declared a special dividend of $2 per share. The $2 special dividend and the quarterly dividend of $0.50 a share will be paid on March 6 to shareholders of record on February 20.
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in Victoria's Secret real estate increased store selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates.
Our first quarter earnings forecast reflects a low to mid single-digit comp increase, reflects an updated February comp forecast of up mid single-digits. We expect the first quarter gross margin rate to be about flat to last year. We expect some deleverage in the SG&A rate, driven primarily by an increase in marketing and store selling cost. We expect nonoperating expense in the first quarter to be about flat to last year at $80 million.
We expect earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.55 in the first quarter against last year's $0.53 result. This forecast includes a net negative impact of about $0.03 related to a decline in operating income at Victoria's Secret Direct, as we are lapping about $65 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel from last year. It also includes a negative $0.01 to $0.02 impact from foreign exchange.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage and our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 percentage point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be about flat and the SG&A rate to be about flat to down slightly to last year. Nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $315 million, roughly flat to last year.
Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07.
We are forecasting weighted average shares is about 300 million in the first quarter and the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.45 and $3.65. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10 to $0.12.
We are projecting 2015 capital spending between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget, is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities. As detailed on Page 13 in the presentation, Victoria's Secret's square footage in North America will increase by about 5% this year, driven by expansions of existing VS stores and 26 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 24 net new openings and 90 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%.
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

In 2014, we exited both the apparel and makeup businesses, which allowed us to focus more on our core and shared product offerings. We delivered strong growth in sales and profitability despite these headwinds.
Now let's talk about our performance in Q4. The Victoria's Secret segment grew both sales and operating income. Total sales increased 5% to $2.4 billion and comp sales increased 4% on top of 2% last year, with operating income increasing $46 million or 10% and our operating income rate increasing 110 basis points.
Merchandise margin dollars and rate for the segment increased, led by the growth in the stores channel. We also finished the quarter in good inventory position, down double digits per square foot to last year.
Now let's turn to specific channel performance, starting with the stores. We are pleased with the fourth quarter as sales and operating income both increased to record results. Entering the quarter with leaner inventory levels allowed us to read and react with speed and agility. It positioned us to be able to get back into trends, while quickly reducing markdowns. 
In addition, we exited a thoughtful approach to our promotions. As a result, this approach and leaner inventory levels allowed us to drive significant improvement in our margin rate. SG&A deleveraged, driven by higher incentive compensation and store selling cost. Buy-in occupancy also deleveraged, driven by our continued investment in store real estate. Operating income in the quarter increased, a result of higher sales coupled with margin rate expansion.
Now turning to the direct channel. Our fourth quarter results continue to reflect our strategy to exit non-core apparel categories. Fourth quarter sales were down 2% as we exited roughly $80 million of non-go-forward apparel sales in the fourth quarter last year. 
Our strategy to distort the core categories, where we have our best growth opportunities, is working. Collectively, in sales in bras, panties, PINK, Sport, beauty and lounge were up mid-teens. The merchandise margin rate was up during the quarter as we continue to distort to the core. This increase was partially offset by the exit of non-go-forward apparel merchandise. Merchandise margin dollars were flat to last year. Operating income dollars and rate declined, driven by investments in our digital shopping experience and higher incentive compensation.
Turning to our full year results. Total Victoria's Secret segment sales increased 5% to $7.2 billion. Operating income increased by $118 million to $1.3 billion, and the operating income rate improved by 80 basis points to 17.6%. In the stores channel, comps increased 3% with total store channel sales up 6%. The merchandise margin rate increased versus last year. As a result, operating income rate and dollars were up year-over-year.
In the direct channel, sales were roughly flat. The merchandise margin rate declined, driven by the exit of non-go-forward apparel and expenses deleveraged. As a result, operating income rate in dollars were down.
Looking ahead to 2015, we will continue our focused, fast, frugal approach, managing both inventory and expenses appropriately to optimize our business. We are planning conservatively, while focusing on driving growth in our core categories and leveraging speed to read and react.
As a reminder, we will continue to be up against the exits of non-go-forward apparel and makeup, which collectively represented roughly $185 million in sales in 2014. However, we are cautiously optimistic that we will maintain our positive trend. We are excited about our fashion offerings this season and feel good about our bra business in lingerie, Sport and PINK. We are investing in real estate, store selling and digital enhancement to create an even better shopping experience for our customers. We have momentum across the brand coming off holiday and heading into spring break for both PINK and Victoria's Secret lingerie. 
Finally, we are very excited for the first-ever Victoria's Secret Swim Special, which will air tonight on CBS, so make sure to tune in, featuring musical performance by Maroon 5 and Juanes.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our record results during the quarter after a disappointing fourth quarter last year. We were able to drive significant growth in sales while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down. 
Total sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 9% or $122 million to last year. Comps increased 8%, and our direct channel sales grew at 25%. Sales were strong across of the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business, and our home fragrance assortment. We were pleased with the customers' acceptance of our holiday assortment, the visual appeal of our stores and the in-store execution of our plans.
We were looking to reestablish ourselves as the holiday destination by celebrating the moment better in our floor sets and in our activities. We believe that this approach helps drive a successful holiday period. The momentum from holiday continued with a strong semiannual sale performance and a positive response to our early spring collections. Promotional activity was relatively flat to last year, and we were able to execute a plan that balance fewer and more impactful activities that generated a strong response from our customers. For the quarter, operating income was $449 million, up 13% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 110 basis points to 32%, driven by expense leverage and improvement in merchandise margin rates.
We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel. Fourth quarter operating income grew significantly versus last year, and annual sales went over $300 million. For fiscal 2014, total sales grew by 7% versus last year and comps ended up 6%. 
Operating income was $737 million, up 14% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 120 basis points to 22%, driven by expense leverage and an improvement in merchandise margin rates. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2015, we will continue to leverage our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class in-store experience to our customers. We're optimistic about the trend of our business and confident in our plans, but understand we need to keep getting better to win in the competitive retail environment. We will flow newness throughout the quarter beginning this month with our Love & Sunshine theme that features new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses. 
Our inventories are well positioned heading into the new year and are flexible enough to react to customers' preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, but we will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business. 
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin."

We are very fast in panties and continue to get faster in panties. And basically, almost all of our panties today are on some kind of speed program. And those speed programs allow us to read the business on a Monday and be back in stock in the stores within 15 to 25 days. So we continue to hone in, in terms of making sure our toolboxes that we've put together in -- with our vendors are important. We continue to think about the bra business, which obviously has a little bit more complexity to it. That's probably an understatement. And we have worked very hard to both in the PINK and lingerie business to be able to read those businesses on a Monday and to get back into inventory -- back into the stores within 4 weeks. We continue to think about different ways in how we can even improve our opportunities across all categories. And as I said earlier, the opportunity as well is how do we can even shorten our development time. Now we've already taken probably 4 months out of our development time and believe there's probably another 2 months to continue to work in as we go into 2015. We've done that work and so we're in the piloting stage of that work for this year. Very excited about the opportunities. And it really takes a strong partnership with our vendor and supply base, and we are very fortunate to have a lot of strength in our supply base and with our partners."

I mean, I think that the holiday season is really just one of promotion out there, starting from the weekend before Thanksgiving all the way through Christmas. We decided that we just did not want to continue to play in that, that we feel that more emotion is better than promotion. I think even the consumer are kind of seeing a fatigue in promotion. The opportunity to win even earlier in the holiday season, whether it's the first part of November, continues to be an opportunity for us. We had a stellar record. Thanks, Black Friday. So I can't tell you that there was really any surprises for us. We were fortunate to pull back on to promotions. And then, therefore, I think the real opportunity as we continue to think about holiday 2015, again, is how do we get more emotion, better products, better fashion, more covetable items, and I think that's what the customer is yearning for versus just this continued slogging it out into the promotional world."

And we believe that our average sellings could be depending on the market, probably needs almost be double that. When you think about the opportunities in growth that we have in PINK and the productivity that we're doing in PINK, we think that there's huge upside in that category. That is where we've been investing a lot of our real estate growth. But at the same time, we're still under-spaced in terms of Victoria's Secret lingerie. And we probably quoted these numbers before that 80% of our stores don't have the full assortment of PINK and don't have the full assortment of Victoria's Secret lingerie. So these larger square footage stores gives us the opportunity, not only to do Victoria's Secret lingerie correctly, it gives us the opportunity to do PINK correctly. And then the 2 emerging categories, when you think about Sport and Swim. So we're at a great place today in the fact that we don't -- we have more proven ideas than we have real estate to support them. So this real estate and bigger store gives us that opportunity. As we have learned over the last 3 years with the bigger real estate, not only have we grown square footage, we've also grown productivity in these larger square foot stores. Now we're very cautious. We don't want to overbuild. We don't want to overbuild the square footage. And so therefore, it gives us excitement and opportunity to grow the categories. And just as I spoke a little bit about the Sport business earlier, we only really have real estate in 189 stores out of the 1,049 that we have to actually do Sport and to do Sport well. So I'm excited about this. It's the right strategy, and I honestly wish I could go faster."

We delivered record results in the fourth quarter and full year, a result of solid execution within our business and a focus on the fundamentals. We are pleased that we are able to learn from our underperformance",1010,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered record results in the fourth quarter and full year, a result of solid execution within our business and a focus on the fundamentals. We are pleased that we are able to learn from our underperformance in last year's fourth quarter and build momentum throughout 2014. We had sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management across all of our businesses in the fourth quarter.
Earnings per share increased 15% to $1.89 versus $1.65 last year. To take you through the fourth quarter results, as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales for the quarter increased 7% to $4.069 billion and comps increased 6%. The gross margin rate increased 210 basis points to 45.1%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The SG&A rate increased by 120 basis points, driven primarily by increased incentive compensation and, to a lesser extent, an increase in store selling cost. Operating income dollars increased 11% to $957 million. The tax rate in the quarter of 35.8% provided $0.07 of upside to our initial guidance and an additional $0.06 versus last year.
Turning to our full year results on Page 5. Earnings per share increased 15% to $3.50 per share versus $3.05 last year. Net sales increased 6% to $11.454 billion and comps increased 4% on top of 2% last year. The gross margin rate increased 90 basis points to 42%, primarily driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. The SG&A rate was flat year-over-year.
Page 7 details our full year operating income results. Our full year operating income rate was 17.1%, up 90 basis points to last year. Operating income dollars increased $209.6 million or 12%, driven by growth in all 3 business segments.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 10% versus last year. Inventories are clean and well positioned. We expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square foot down in the mid-single-digit range.
Operating cash flow in 2014 was $1.786 billion. Free cash flow was $1.071 billion, and capital expenditures were $715 million. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock this year for $84 million. As we announced earlier this month, our board authorized a new $250 million share repurchase program, which included the $91 million remaining under the previous program.
We also announced the 47% increase in our annual dividend to $2 per share and declared a special dividend of $2 per share. The $2 special dividend and the quarterly dividend of $0.50 a share will be paid on March 6 to shareholders of record on February 20.
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business: growth in Victoria's Secret real estate; an increased store selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates.
Our first quarter earnings forecast reflects a low to mid-single-digit comp increase, reflects an updated February comp forecast of up mid-single-digits. We expect the first quarter gross margin rate to be about flat to last year. We expect some deleverage in the SG&A rate, driven primarily by an increase in marketing and store selling cost. We expect nonoperating expense in the first quarter to be about flat to last year at $80 million.
We expect earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.55 in the first quarter against last year's $0.53 result. This forecast includes a net negative impact of about $0.03 related to a decline in operating income at Victoria's Secret Direct, as we are lapping about $65 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel from last year. It also includes a negative $0.01 to $0.02 impact from foreign exchange.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage and our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 percentage point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be about flat and the SG&A rate to be about flat to down slightly to last year. Nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $315 million, roughly flat to last year.
Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07.
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 300 million in the first quarter and the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.45 and $3.65. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10 to $0.12.
We are projecting 2015 capital spending between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget, is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities. As detailed on Page 13 in the presentation, Victoria's Secret's square footage in North America will increase by about 5% this year, driven by expansions of existing VS stores and 26 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 24 net new openings and 90 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%.
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

In 2014, we exited both the apparel and makeup businesses, which allowed us to focus more on our core and shared product offerings. We delivered strong growth in sales and profitability despite these headwinds.
Now let's talk about our performance in Q4. The Victoria's Secret segment grew both sales and operating income. Total sales increased 5% to $2.4 billion and comp sales increased 4% on top of 2% last year, with operating income increasing $46 million or 10% and our operating income rate increasing 110 basis points.
Merchandise margin dollars and rate for the segment increased, led by the growth in the stores channel. We also finished the quarter in good inventory position, down double digits per square foot to last year.
Now let's turn to specific channel performance, starting with the stores. We are pleased with the fourth quarter as sales and operating income both increased to record results. Entering the quarter with leaner inventory levels allowed us to read and react with speed and agility. It positioned us to be able to get back into trends, while quickly reducing markdowns. 
In addition, we executed a thoughtful approach to our promotions. As a result, this approach and leaner inventory levels allowed us to drive significant improvement in our margin rate. SG&A deleveraged, driven by higher incentive compensation and store selling cost. Buy-in occupancy also deleveraged, driven by our continued investment in store real estate. Operating income in the quarter increased, a result of higher sales coupled with margin rate expansion.
Now turning to the direct channel. Our fourth quarter results continue to reflect our strategy to exit non-core apparel categories. Fourth quarter sales were down 2% as we exited roughly $80 million of non-go-forward apparel sales in the fourth quarter last year. 
Our strategy to distort to core categories, where we have our best growth opportunities, is working. Collectively, in sales in bras, panties, PINK, Sport, beauty and lounge were up mid-teens. The merchandise margin rate was up during the quarter as we continue to distort to the core. This increase was partially offset by the exit of non-go-forward apparel merchandise. Merchandise margin dollars were flat to last year. Operating income dollars and rate declined, driven by investments in our digital shopping experience and higher incentive compensation.
Turning to our full year results. Total Victoria's Secret segment sales increased 5% to $7.2 billion. Operating income increased by $118 million to $1.3 billion, and the operating income rate improved by 80 basis points to 17.6%. In the stores channel, comps increased 3% with total store channel sales up 6%. The merchandise margin rate increased versus last year. As a result, operating income rate and dollars were up year-over-year.
In the direct channel, sales were roughly flat. The merchandise margin rate declined, driven by the exit of non-go-forward apparel and expenses deleveraged. As a result, operating income rate in dollars were down.
Looking ahead to 2015, we will continue our focused, fast, frugal approach, managing both inventory and expenses appropriately to optimize our business. We are planning conservatively, while focusing on driving growth in our core categories and leveraging speed to read and react.
As a reminder, we will continue to be up against the exits of non-go-forward apparel and makeup, which collectively represented roughly $185 million in sales in 2014. However, we are cautiously optimistic that we will maintain our positive trend. We are excited about our fashion offerings this season and feel good about our bra business in lingerie, Sport and PINK. We are investing in real estate, store selling and digital enhancement to create an even better shopping experience for our customers. We have momentum across the brand coming off holiday and heading into spring break for both PINK and Victoria's Secret lingerie. 
Finally, we are very excited for the first-ever Victoria's Secret Swim Special, which will air tonight on CBS, so make sure to tune in, featuring musical performance by Maroon 5 and Juanes.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our record results during the quarter after a disappointing fourth quarter last year. We were able to drive significant growth in sales while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down. 
Total sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 9% or $122 million to last year. Comps increased 8%, and our direct channel sales grew at 25%. Sales were strong across of the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business, and our home fragrance assortment. We were pleased with the customers' acceptance of our holiday assortment, the visual appeal of our stores and the in-store execution of our plans.
We were looking to reestablish ourselves as the holiday destination by celebrating the moment better in our floor sets and in our activities. We believe that this approach helps drive a successful holiday period. The momentum from holiday continued with a strong semiannual sale performance and a positive response to our early spring collections. Promotional activity was relatively flat to last year, and we were able to execute a plan that balanced fewer and more impactful activities that generated a strong response from our customers. For the quarter, operating income was $449 million, up 13% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 110 basis points to 32%, driven by expense leverage and improvement in merchandise margin rates.
We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel. Fourth quarter operating income grew significantly versus last year, and annual sales went over $300 million. For fiscal 2014, total sales grew by 7% versus last year and comps ended up 6%. 
Operating income was $737 million, up 14% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 120 basis points to 22%, driven by expense leverage and an improvement in merchandise margin rates. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2015, we will continue to leverage our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class in-store experience to our customers. We're optimistic about the trend of our business and confident in our plans, but understand we need to keep getting better to win in the competitive retail environment. We will flow newness throughout the quarter beginning this month with our Love & Sunshine theme that features new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses. 
Our inventories are well positioned heading into the New Year and are flexible enough to react to customers' preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, but we will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business. 
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin."

At Victoria's Secret International, we're pleased with the performance of our full assortment stores. In the U.K., we continue to be very pleased with our London flagship store on Bond Street as well as our 9 mall stores. We'll open another 4 stores in the U.K. this year.

Because, as you know, we keep our open-to-buys very, very open, which allows us to be as nimble as we can. So to me, it's the breadth of assortments that we can get into the speed model so that we've got a broader chance of reading and reacting to a broader selection of products that would then allow us to actually shift the inventory to match that. So in terms of percentages, I'm not going to go into the percentages, but the breadth continues to grow of things that we can get into the pipeline on a faster basis so that we can react to the business. And that was an important piece of why we had a good fourth quarter, that we had a slightly broader amount and we were able to chase into it."

We are very fast in panties and continue to get faster in panties. And basically, almost all of our panties today are on some kind of speed program. And those speed programs allow us to read the business on a Monday and be back in stock in the stores within 15 to 25 days. So we continue to hone in, in terms of making sure our toolboxes that we've put together in -- with our vendors are important. We continue to think about the bra business, which obviously has a little bit more complexity to it. That's probably an understatement. And we have worked very hard to -- both in the PINK and lingerie business to be able to read those businesses on a Monday and to get back into inventory -- back into the stores within 4 weeks. We continue to think about different ways in how we can even improve our opportunities across all categories. And as I said earlier, the opportunity as well is how do we -- can even shorten our development time. Now we've already taken probably 4 months out of our development time and believe there's probably another 2 months to continue to work in as we go into 2015. We've done that work and so we're in the piloting stage of that work for this year. Very excited about the opportunities. And it really takes a strong partnership with our vendor and supply base, and we are very fortunate to have a lot of strength in our supply base and with our partners."

We decided that we just did not want to continue to play in that, that we feel that more emotion is better than promotion. I think even the consumer are kind of seeing a fatigue in promotion. The opportunity to win even earlier in the holiday season, whether it's the first part of November, continues to be an opportunity for us. We had a stellar record. Thanks, Black Friday. So I can't tell you that there was really any surprises for us. We were fortunate to pull back on to promotions.

When you think about the opportunities in growth that we have in PINK and the productivity that we're doing in PINK, we think that there's huge upside in that category. That is where we've been investing a lot of our real estate growth. But at the same time, we're still under-spaced in terms of Victoria's Secret lingerie. And we probably quoted these numbers before that 80% of our stores don't have the full assortment of PINK and don't have the full assortment of Victoria's Secret lingerie. So these larger square footage stores gives us the opportunity, not only to do Victoria's Secret lingerie correctly, it gives us the opportunity to do PINK correctly. And then the 2 emerging categories, when you think about Sport and Swim. So we're at a great place today in the fact that we don't -- we have more proven ideas than we have real estate to support them. So this real estate and bigger store gives us that opportunity. As we have learned over the last 3 years with the bigger real estate, not only have we grown square footage, we've also grown productivity in these larger square foot stores. Now we're very cautious. We don't want to overbuild. We don't want to overbuild the square footage. And so therefore, it gives us excitement and opportunity to grow the categories. And just as I spoke a little bit about the Sport business earlier, we only really have real estate in 189 stores out of the 1,049 that we have to actually do Sport and to do Sport well. So I'm excited about this. It's the right strategy, and I honestly wish I could go faster."

We continue to get better in the first quarter and delivered record results. We continue to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and found inventory management across all of our businesses. Adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to $0.61 versus $0.53 last year.
To take you through the first quarter results, as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales for the quarter increased 5% to $2.512 billion and comps increased 5%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 point. The gross margin rate increased by 90 basis points to 42%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. SG&A expenses deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily driven by our investment in store selling.
Operating income dollars increased 11%, driven by growth in all 3 of our major business segments, and our operating income rate improved by 70 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to a record $0.61. Foreign currency negatively impacted our first quarter EPS results by about $0.02.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 7% versus last year. We repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock in the first quarter for $170.5 million. At quarter-end, we had $79.5 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program. 
Turning to Page 8 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in Victoria's Secret real estate, increased store selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflect an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates. Our second quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect the second quarter approaching rate to increase versus last year, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, partially offset by buying and occupancy expense de-leverage.
We expect the SG&A rate to deleverage driven primarily by an increase in store selling cost. We expect second quarter net nonoperating expense consisting primarily of interest expense to be about flat to last year at $80 million.
We expect earnings per share between $0.60 and $0.65 in the second quarter against last year's $0.63 result. This forecast includes a negative $0.02 to $0.03 impact from foreign exchange. We are also lapping approximately $60 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel and makeup at Victoria's Secret. We expect to end the second quarter with inventory per square foot up low single-digits to last year.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps the growth in square footage and our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up slightly and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat to last year. Net nonoperating expenses consisting principally of interest expense are projected to be about $350 [ph] million, roughly flat to last year.
Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07.
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 300 million in the second quarter and the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.50 and $3.70. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10 to $0.12. We are projecting 2015 capital spending between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.
As detailed on Page 9 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret's square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 25 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 24 net new openings and 83 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%.
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results to very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures dividends and any other foreseeable needs.

The Victoria's Secret segment delivered positive results in the first quarter while continuing to make significant changes to the business before we were able to grow both sales and profits despite an $80 million reduction in sales from non-go-forward apparel and makeup. Total sales increased 5% to $1.7 billion and comp sales increased 5%. Operating income increased $10.6 million or 4%, and our operating income rate decreased 20 basis points to 17.1. We finished the quarter in good inventory position, down to last year.
Now let's turn to specific channel performance starting with the stores. We are pleased with the first quarter, as both sales and operating income increased to record results. Sales for the quarter increased 8% to $1.3 billion and comps increased 5. Sales growth was driven by PINK and Lingerie. Our beauty business was down to last year, reflecting the impact of the exiting of makeup category.
We were very focused on our core categories. And as a result, delivered high single to double-digit growth in bras, panties and fragrance. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up to last year driven by strength in full-price selling. Buying and occupancy expense leveraged versus last year, SG&A deleveraged driven by our investment to improve the customer experience. Operating income dollars and rate increased versus last year, a result of higher sale, coupled with margin rate expansion.
Now turning to the direct channel. Our first quarter result continue to reflect our strategy to exit noncore apparel categories. First quarter sales were down 6%, as we anniversary roughly $65 million of non-go-forward apparel sales in the first quarter versus last year. Our strategy to distort the core categories where we have our best growth opportunities is working collectively.
Sales in bras, panties, PINK, sport, beauty and lounge were up mid-teens. The merchandise margin rate was up significantly during the quarter as we continue to distort the core merchandise margin -- as we continue to distort to the core. The merchandise margin dollars were down slightly to last year. Our operating income dollars and rate declined driven by the decline in sale and an increase in expenses driven by investments in our digital shopping experience.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue our focus, fast and frugal approach in order to optimize our business. We are excited about our fashion offerings this quarter and are focused on driving growth in our core categories. As a reminder, we will continue to be up against the exit of non-go-forward apparel and makeup, which collectively represented roughly $60 million sales in the second quarter last year.
In addition, as part of our continuing efforts to align with the customer experience, we are shortening the semiannual sale in the direct channel by about 2 weeks, which will negatively impact sale in the second quarter.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our first quarter results, where we were able to grow sales and increase earnings versus our record performance last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down.
First quarter sales of Bath & Body Works in North America was $613 million, up 5% or $32 million to last year, and comps increased 4% on top of 2% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses. Our Signature Collection product line, Soap and Sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. We continue to be pleased with the customer's acceptance of product newness and our in-store execution.
For the quarter, operating income was $97 million, up 22% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 210 basis points to 15.8%, driven by expense leverage and improvement in merchandise margin rates. We were able to effectively pull back on promotional activity versus last year driving growth in average unit retail. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel, which grew sales by 15% and operating income significantly in the first quarter versus last year.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2015. We will continue to leverage our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class in-store experience by constantly pushing differentiation within visual display and maintaining a strong customer service focus. We're optimistic about the trend of our business and confidence in our plans, but understand, we need to keep getting better to win in a competitive retail environment. We've began May focus on Mother's Day and transition into our Meet Me in Tahiti that features new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses.
We ended the quarter with inventory down to last year while positioned heading into the second quarter are flexible enough to react to customer preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, but we'll continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.

So importantly, as we think about our business, it really comes to life in the most compelling rate in the store environment. Obviously, we have the direct businesses as well. But first and foremost, our brands come together most clearly in a physical environment in stores. As you know, our real estate is in very good shape in terms of the percentage of stores that generate profit and cash flow 99% plus. Productivities were very good. As it relates to what's going on in the real estate environment generally, I think generalizations can be dangerous. Obviously, the very best malls are doing very well with growing sales, growing traffic, increasing rents, reflected of the fact that their dynamic vibrant environments. We do see a share in outline. We talked about pretty consistently. we see the opportunity for sales growth and profitable sales growth, good returns, to expanding square footage in the United States. As it relates what I'd call the stressed real estate, typically, in the lower volume malls and maybe some others that are struggling with real estate, frankly, that would real estate that we would be less interested in, obviously. So our real estate locations are generally very good, may not main locations in the better malls in the United States. And we're not as focused on how do we get $5 off the cost per foot, but rather how do we make sure that we've got great locations, driving sales growth and profitability, working with the key developers in North America and internationally. So again, generalizations are dangerous. It's not a cost game for us. Obviously, we don't want to overpay for anything. But it's the most important economic evaluation is gaining a great location getting the right size and creating the right store environments. And that's what we're focused on. And analytic, where that comes through is increasing sales productivity, sales growth, good investment returns, good cash flow and profit for our store base business. So that's how we think about it."

We continue to get better in the first quarter and delivered record results. We continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management across all of our businesses. Adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to $0.61 versus $0.53 last year.
To take you through the first quarter results, as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales for the quarter increased 5% to $2.512 billion and comps increased 5%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 point. The gross margin rate increased by 90 basis points to 42%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. SG&A expenses deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily driven by our investment in store selling.
Operating income dollars increased 11%, driven by growth in all 3 of our major business segments, and our operating income rate improved by 70 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to a record $0.61. Foreign currency negatively impacted our first quarter EPS results by about $0.02.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 7% versus last year. We repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock in the first quarter for $170.5 million. At quarter-end, we had $79.5 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program. 
Turning to Page 8 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in Victoria's Secret real estate, increased store selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflect an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates. 
Our second quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect the second quarter gross margin rate to increase versus last year, driven by improvement in the merchandise margin rate, partially offset by buying and occupancy expense de-leverage.
We expect the SG&A rate to de-leverage, driven primarily by an increase in store selling cost. We expect second quarter net non-operating expense, consisting primarily of interest expense, to be about flat to last year at $80 million.
We expect earnings per share between $0.60 and $0.65 in the second quarter against last year's $0.63 result. This forecast includes a negative $0.02 to $0.03 impact from foreign exchange. We are also lapping approximately $60 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel and makeup at Victoria's Secret. We expect to end the second quarter with inventory per square foot up low single-digits to last year.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps the growth in square footage and our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up slightly and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat to last year. 
Net non-operating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $315  million, roughly flat to last year.
Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07.
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 300 million in the second quarter and the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.50 and $3.70. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10 to $0.12. We are projecting 2015 capital spending between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.
As detailed on Page 9 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 25 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 24 net new openings and 83 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%.
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results to very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.

The Victoria's Secret segment delivered positive results in the first quarter while continuing to make significant changes to the business. We were able to grow both sales and profits despite an $80 million reduction in sales from non-go-forward apparel and makeup. Total sales increased 5% to $1.7 billion and comp sales increased 5%. Operating income increased $10.6 million or 4%, and our operating income rate decreased 20 basis points to 17.1. We finished the quarter in good inventory position, down to last year.
Now let's turn to specific channel performance, starting with the stores. 
We are pleased with the first quarter, as both sales and operating income increased to record results. Sales for the quarter increased 8% to $1.3 billion and comps increased 5. Sales growth was driven by PINK and Lingerie. Our beauty business was down to last year, reflecting the impact of the exiting of makeup category.  We were very focused on our core categories. And as a result, delivered high single to double-digit growth in bras, panties and fragrance. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up to last year, driven by strength in full-price selling. Buying and occupancy expense leveraged versus last year. SG&A de-leveraged, driven by our investment to improve the customer experience. Operating income dollars and rate increased versus last year, a result of higher sales, coupled with margin rate expansion.
Now turning to the direct channel. Our first quarter results continue to reflect our strategy to exit non-core apparel categories. First quarter sales were down 6%, as we anniversary roughly $65 million of non-go-forward apparel sales in the first quarter versus last year. Our strategy to distort the core categories where we have our best growth opportunities is working collectively.
Sales in bras, panties, PINK, sport, beauty and lounge were up mid-teens. The merchandise margin rate was up significantly during the quarter as we continued to distort the core merchandise margin -- as we continue to distort to the core. The merchandise margin dollars were down significantly -- down slightly to last year. Operating income dollars and rate declined, driven by the decline in sale and an increase in expenses driven by investments in our digital shopping experience.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue our focused, fast and frugal approach in order to optimize our business. We are excited about our fashion offerings this quarter and are focused on driving growth in our core categories. As a reminder, we will continue to be up against the exit of non-go-forward apparel and makeup, which collectively represented roughly $60 million sales in the second quarter last year.
In addition, as part of our continuing efforts to align with customer experience, we are shortening the semiannual sale in the direct channel by about 2 weeks, which will negatively impact sale in the second quarter.
Thanks. And now, I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

First quarter sales of Bath & Body Works North America was $613 million, up 5% or $32 million to last year, and comps increased 4% on top of 2% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: Our Signature Collection product line, soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. We continue to be pleased with the customers' acceptance of products' newness and our in-store execution.
For the quarter, operating income was $97 million, up 22% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 210 basis points to 15.8%, driven by expense leverage and improvement in merchandise margin rates. We were able to effectively pull back on promotional activity versus last year, driving growth in average unit retail. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel, which grew sales by 15% and operating income significantly in the first quarter versus last year.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2015. We will continue to leverage our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class in-store experience by constantly pushing differentiation within visual display and maintaining a strong customer service focus. We are optimistic about the trend of our business and confidence in our plans, but understand, we need to keep getting better to win in a competitive retail environment. We began May focused on Mother's Day and transitioned into our Meet Me in Tahiti that features new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses.
We ended the quarter with inventory down to last year well-positioned heading into the second quarter and flexible enough to react to customer preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, but we'll continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.

As we all know, our opportunity for international growth is significant, and we feel good about the strategic choices we made to be steady and purposeful, to pursue a test-and-learn philosophy that reflects the DNA of our company.
We made good progress in the first quarter. And as detailed on Page 10 of your presentation, we opened 29 gross international locations in the first quarter to end the quarter with 420 stores in the segment. For the first quarter, revenue increased 29% to $91.5 million and operating income increased 38% to $21.5 million.
At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. In the U.K., we continue to be very pleased with all of our 10 stores. We'll open another 4 stores this year and the expansion of Bond Street opened today by chance.
In the Middle East, we now have 14 Victoria's Secret stores and 1 PINK store. We continue to be very pleased with the results and will open another 8 or so this year. Same with Victoria's Secret, our beauty and accessories business continues to progress well with 304 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We've opened 10 VSBA stores in China and are pleased with the results. We'll open about 100 or so stores across the globe in 2015.
Turning now to Bath & Body Works. We have 91 stores open, and we continue to be very pleased with their performance. We expect to open another 40 or so BBW International stores in the year ahead.
So in summary, continued progress from our international business in the first quarter and we remain focused on the fundamentals, great execution of our brands wherever we go.

So importantly, as we think about our business, it really comes to life in the most compelling way in the store environment. Obviously, we have the direct businesses as well. But first and foremost, our brands come together most clearly in a physical environment in stores. As you know, our real estate is in very good shape in terms of the percentage of stores that generate profit and cash flow 99% plus. Productivities were very good. As it relates to what's going on in the real estate environment generally, I think generalizations can be dangerous. Obviously, the very best malls are doing very well with growing sales, growing traffic, increasing rents, reflective of the fact that they're dynamic, vibrant environments. We do see a share in outline. We talked about pretty consistently. We see the opportunity for sales growth and profitable sales growth, good returns, good expanding square footage in the United States. As it relates to what I'd call the stressed real estate, typically, in the lower volume malls and maybe some others that are struggling with real estate, frankly, that would be real estate that we would be less interested in, obviously. So our real estate locations are generally very good, main -- on main locations in the better malls in the United States. And we're not as focused on how do we get $5 off the cost per foot, but rather how do we make sure that we've got great locations, driving sales growth and profitability, working with the key developers in North America and internationally. So again, generalizations are dangerous. It's not a cost game for us. Obviously, we don't want to overpay for anything. But it's -- the most important economic evaluation is getting a great location and getting the right size and creating the right store environment, and that's what we're focused on. And analytically, where that comes through is in increasing sales productivity, sales growth, good investment returns, good cash flow and profit for our store base business. So that's how we think about it."

We continued to get better in the first quarter and delivered record results. We continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management across all of our businesses.",788,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We continued to get better in the first quarter and delivered record results. We continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management across all of our businesses. Adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to $0.61 versus $0.53 last year.
To take you through the first quarter results, as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales for the quarter increased 5% to $2.512 billion and comps increased 5%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 point. The gross margin rate increased by 90 basis points to 42%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate. SG&A expenses deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily driven by our investment in store selling.
Operating income dollars increased 11%, driven by growth in all 3 of our major business segments, and our operating income rate improved by 70 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share increased 15% to a record $0.61. Foreign currency negatively impacted our first quarter EPS results by about $0.02.
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter down 7% versus last year. We repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock in the first quarter for $170.5 million. At quarter-end, we had $79.5 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program. 
Turning to Page 8 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in Victoria's Secret real estate, increased store selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates. 
Our second quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect the second quarter gross margin rate to increase versus last year, driven by improvement in the merchandise margin rate, partially offset by buying and occupancy expense de-leverage.
We expect the SG&A rate to de-leverage, driven primarily by an increase in store selling costs. We expect second quarter net non-operating expense, consisting primarily of interest expense, to be about flat to last year at $80 million.
We expect earnings per share between $0.60 and $0.65 in the second quarter against last year's $0.63 result. This forecast includes a negative $0.02 to $0.03 impact from foreign exchange. We are also lapping approximately $60 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel and makeup at Victoria's Secret. We expect to end the second quarter with inventory per square foot up low single-digits to last year.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps, the growth in square footage and our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up slightly and the SG&A rate to be roughly flat to last year. 
Net non-operating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $315 million, roughly flat to last year.
Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07.
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 300 million in the second quarter and the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.50 and $3.70. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.10 to $0.12. We are projecting 2015 capital spending between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.
As detailed on Page 9 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 25 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 24 net new openings and 83 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%.
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of about $700 million to $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs. 
Thanks. And now, I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We were able to grow both sales and profits despite an $80 million",488,"Thank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. 
The Victoria's Secret segment delivered positive results in the first quarter while continuing to make significant changes to the business. We were able to grow both sales and profits despite an $80 million reduction in sales from non-go-forward apparel and makeup. Total sales increased 5% to $1.7 billion and comp sales increased 5%. Operating income increased $10.6 million or 4%, and our operating income rate decreased 20 basis points to 17.1. We finished the quarter in good inventory position, down to last year.
Now let's turn to specific channel performance, starting with the stores. 
We are pleased with the first quarter, as both sales and operating income increased to record results. Sales for the quarter increased 8% to $1.3 billion and comps increased 5. Sales growth was driven by PINK and Lingerie. Our beauty business was down to last year, reflecting the impact of the exiting of makeup category. We were very focused on our core categories. And as a result, delivered high single to double-digit growth in bras, panties and fragrance. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up to last year, driven by strength in full-price selling. Buying and occupancy expense leveraged versus last year. SG&A de-leveraged, driven by our investment to improve the customer experience. Operating income dollars and rate increased versus last year, a result of higher sales, coupled with margin rate expansion.
Now turning to the direct channel. Our first quarter results continue to reflect our strategy to exit non-core apparel categories. First quarter sales were down 6%, as we anniversary roughly $65 million of non-go-forward apparel sales in the first quarter versus last year. Our strategy to distort to core categories where we have our best growth opportunities is working collectively.
Sales in bras, panties, PINK, sport, beauty and lounge were up mid-teens. The merchandise margin rate was up significantly during the quarter as we continued to distort the core merchandise margin -- as we continue to distort to the core. The merchandise margin dollars were down significantly -- down slightly to last year. Operating income dollars and rate declined, driven by the decline in sale and an increase in expenses driven by investments in our digital shopping experience.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we will continue our focused, fast and frugal approach in order to optimize our business. We are excited about our fashion offerings this quarter and are focused on driving growth in our core categories. As a reminder, we will continue to be up against the exit of non-go-forward apparel and makeup, which collectively represented roughly $60 million sales in the second quarter last year.
In addition, as part of our continuing efforts to align the customer experience, we are shortening the semiannual sale in the direct channel by about 2 weeks, which will negatively impact sales in the second quarter.
Thanks. And now, I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our first quarter results, where we were able to grow sales and increase earnings versus our record performance last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down.
First quarter sales of Bath & Body Works North America was $613 million, up 5% or $32 million to last year, and comps increased 4% on top of 2% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: Our Signature Collection product line, soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. We continue to be pleased with the customers' acceptance of products' newness and our in-store execution.
For the quarter, operating income was $97 million, up 22% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 210 basis points to 15.8%, driven by expense leverage and improvement in merchandise margin rates. We were able to effectively pull back on promotional activity versus last year, driving growth in average unit retail. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel, which grew sales by 15% and operating income significantly in the first quarter versus last year.
Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2015. We will continue to leverage our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class in-store experience by constantly pushing differentiation within visual display and maintaining a strong customer service focus. We are optimistic about the trend of our business and confident in our plans, but understand, we need to keep getting better to win in a competitive retail environment. We began May focused on Mother's Day and transitioned into our Meet Me in Tahiti that features new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses.
We ended the quarter with inventory down to last year well-positioned heading into the second quarter and flexible enough to react to customer preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, but we'll continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.

As we all know, our opportunity for international growth is significant, and we feel good about the strategic choices we made to be steady and purposeful, to pursue a test-and-learn philosophy that reflects the DNA of our company.
We made good progress in the first quarter. And as detailed on Page 10 of your presentation, we opened 29 gross international locations in the first quarter to end the quarter with 420 stores in the segment. For the first quarter, revenue increased 29% to $91.5 million and operating income increased 38% to $21.5 million.
At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. In the U.K., we continued to be very pleased with all of our 10 stores. We'll open another 4 stores this year and the expansion of Bond Street opened today by chance.
In the Middle East, we now have 14 Victoria's Secret stores and 1 PINK store. We continue to be very pleased with the results and will open another 8 or so this year. Staying with Victoria's Secret, our beauty and accessories business continues to progress well with 304 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We've opened 10 VSBA stores in China and are pleased with the results. We'll open about 100 or so stores across the globe in 2015.
Turning now to Bath & Body Works. We have 91 stores open, and we continue to be very pleased with their performance. We expect to open another 40 or so BBW International stores in the year ahead.
So in summary, continued progress from our international business in the first quarter and we remain focused on the fundamentals, great execution of our brands wherever we go.

Obviously, when we execute that strategy well and plan conservatively and leverage our speed agenda and our shorter lead times, as you understand, and we've already talked about some again this morning, that creates opportunity for more full-price selling. And one of the drivers of some expansion opportunity, merchandise margin rates. So I'm not trying to be general in the answer, I'm just trying to share with you how we think about it, and that is how we plan our business conservatively. And then where we've got trend and business, we chase like heck to maximize sales. And through that, we get some opportunity to improve merchandise margin rates. And there's nothing about 2015 on that agenda that's different than how we thought about it for the last 3 to 5 years."

So importantly, as we think about our business, it really comes to life in the most compelling way in the store environment. Obviously, we have good direct businesses as well. But first and foremost, our brands come together most clearly in a physical environment in stores. As you know, our real estate is in very good shape in terms of the percentage of stores that generate profit and cash flow 99% plus. Productivities are very good. As it relates to what's going on in the real estate environment generally, I think generalizations can be dangerous. Obviously, the very best malls are doing very well with growing sales, growing traffic, increasing rents, reflective of the fact that they're dynamic, vibrant environments. We do see a share in outline. We talk about pretty consistently. We see the opportunity for sales growth and profitable sales growth, good returns, good expanding square footage in the United States. As it relates to what I'd call distressed real estate, typically, in the lower volume malls and maybe some others that are struggling with real estate, frankly, that would be real estate that we would be less interested in, obviously. So our real estate locations are generally very good, main-on-main locations in the better malls in the United States. And we're not as focused on how do we get $5 off the cost per foot, but rather how do we make sure that we've got great locations, driving sales growth and profitability, working with the key developers in North America and internationally. So again, generalizations are dangerous. It's not a cost game for us. Obviously, we don't want to overpay for anything. But it's -- the most important economic evaluation is getting a great location and getting the right size and creating the right store environment, and that's what we're focused on. And analytically, where that comes through is in increasing sales productivity, sales growth, good investment returns, good cash flow and profit for our store base business. So that's how we think about it."

We delivered solid second quarter results as we continue to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management.Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68 versus $0.63 last yea",799,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid second quarter results as we continue to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management.
Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68 versus $0.63 last year. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange rates, earnings growth was 11%. 
To take you through the second quarter results as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation, net sales for the quarter increased 3% to $2.765 billion and comps increased 4%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 point. The gross margin rate increased by 130 basis points to 40.3% driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate.
Buying and occupancy expense deleveraged driven by our investments in real estate. SG&A expenses deleveraged by 70 basis points primarily driven by our investment in store selling to improve the customer experience. Operating income dollars increased by 7%, and our operating income rate improved by 50 basis points. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68. Foreign currency negatively impacted our second quarter EPS results by about $0.02. Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. 
Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter flat versus last year. Inventory were clean and we are well-positioned. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock in the second quarter for $131.2 million. At quarter-end, we had $197.8 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program.
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in square footage increased selling payroll driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and the higher tax rate. Our third quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect the third quarter gross margin rate to increase driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage. We expect the SG&A rate to delever driven primarily by an increase in store selling cost.
We expect third quarter net nonoperating expense, consisting primarily of interest expense, to be about flat to last year at $80 million. We expect earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45 in the third quarter against last year's $0.44 result. This forecast includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.03. We are also lapping approximately $35 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel at Victoria's Secret Direct. We expect to end the third quarter with inventory per square foot up low to mid single-digits to last year.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage in our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up and the SG&A rate to be slightly up to last year. Net nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $315 million, roughly flat to last year. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07. 
We are forecasting weighted average shares to about 296 million in the third quarter and 297 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.58 and $3.73. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.12. We are projecting 2015 CapEx between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.
As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 25 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3% driven by 28 net new openings and 83 remodels.
Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%. Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of between $700 million and $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.
Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates. 
Comps increased 3% on top of 3% last year reaching $1.8 billion in total sales for the second quarter. Operating income of $298 million was up $5 million or 2% to last year. We had hoped to do even better, but remain committed and focused on the fundamentals. We recognize that we must keep getting better to win.
Included in our results are the exit of apparel and makeup last year or $65 million in sales. Excluding these items, our segment sales growth would have been up mid single-digits and comps would've been about 1 point higher. We had solid performance in bras and panties with positive double-digit growth and increased margin rate. In addition, we remain pleased with the growth and strong customer response to our PINK loungewear business.
We were disappointed in the performance of swim and beauty, which were both below our expectations and were the primary drivers of our miss in operating income. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up low single-digits for foot to last year and in line with our expectation. Now let's turn to the specific channel performance, starting with stores.
Sales for the quarter increased 5% to $1.4 billion and comps increased 3 on top of 3 last year. Sales growth was driven by strength in PINK, along with growth in Lingerie, bras and panties. Our beauty business was down to last year, reflecting the impact of exiting the makeup category and softness in gifting. Swim was also down to last year, driven by fashion misses during the second quarter. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year, but the rate was about flat as strength in full-price selling was mostly offset by increased swim clearance and unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business. Expenses, including buying and occupancy and SG&A, delevered in the quarter versus last year, driven by investments in store real estate and higher store selling cost. Operating income dollars were about flat to last year. Excluding the impact of exiting makeup, earnings would have been up mid single-digit versus last year. Now turning to the direct channel.
Our strategy to distort the core categories with our best growth opportunities is working, and we were pleased with the results in our direct channel. Second quarter sales were down 4%, as we anniversary roughly $45 million of non-go-forward apparel. Operating income dollars and rate improved driven by the increase in merchandise margin and decrease in expenses. Collectively, sales in go forward categories were up over 10%. Swim also missed expectation in the direct channel. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up in last year during the quarter as we continue to distort to the core.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we will continue our focused, fast and frugal approach in order to grow our business. Our fashion offerings are strong, and we will continue to flow newness this quarter. We are focused on driving growth in our core category, bras, panties, lounge and fragrance. We started August with the Body by Victoria and Wear Everywhere bra launches. We prepared for a strong back-to-school season with our second annual PINK Friday. We are entering the season with well-positioned inventory, enabling us to be agile and respond with speed. We will continue to be up against the exit of non-go-forward apparel, which represents roughly $35 million in sales in the third quarter last year. In addition, we are continuing to invest in real estate, store selling and digital enhancements to create a more seamless shopping experience for our customer. These are the right investments for the long-term growth of our business, but will pressure rate in the third quarter.
We are continuing to test and learn for holiday in order to set ourselves up for success in the fourth quarter. Thank you. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our second quarter results, where we were again able to grow sales and increase earnings versus our record performance last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates and continuing to maintain inventory levels -- manage inventory levels down.
Second quarter sales of Bath & Body Works North America was $748 million, up 6% or $44 million to last year, and comps increased 5% on top of 3% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: Our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. We were able to pull back in promotional activity versus last year.
We reduced clearance selling throughout the quarter and we were able to effectively leverage product newness in our semiannual sales. We were very pleased with our customer's continued positive reactions to our brand, our product assortment and our storytelling, as well as our in-store experience.
For the quarter, operating income was $138 million, up 20% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 210 basis points to 18.4%, driven by improvements in gross profit and SG&A expense leverage. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel, which grew sales by 15% and operating income significantly in the second quarter versus last year.
We ended the quarter with inventory down to last year, well-positioned heading into the third quarter and flexible enough to react to customer's preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, but will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2015. We will continue to leverage the strength of our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class, in-store experience by constantly delivering differentiation within visual display and maintaining a strong customer service focus. We begin the quarter focused on our Welcome to Wine Country theme, featuring new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses, and we'll transition to our full floor set in September time period.

As detailed on Page 13 of your presentation, we opened 64 gross international locations so far this year, 35 in the second quarter, to end the quarter with 453 stores in the segment. Revenue increased 12% in the quarter to $88.7 million and operating income increased 19% to $20.2 million. The operating income rate increased 140 basis points to 22.8%. The revenue growth deceleration versus the first quarter was driven by timing shifts in the shipments of products to our wholesale partners in the VSBA business. These timing shifts will smooth out over a longer period of time.
Importantly, retail sales growth in the international business continues to be strong and has been consistent over the last several quarters. At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full assortment stores.
In the U.K., we continue to be pleased with our 10 stores. We opened the Bond Street expansion in May, and we will open another 4 stores in the U.K. later this year. In the Middle East, we now have 14 Victoria's Secret stores and 3 PINK stores. We continue to be very pleased with the results there and will open a few more stores later this year.
Staying with Victoria's Secret. Our Victoria's Secret Beauty & Accessories business continues to progress well with 325 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We've opened 12 VSBA stores in China and are pleased with the results. We will open about 100 or so VSBA stores across the globe by the end of 2015.
Turning to Bath & Body Works International. We now have 101 BBW stores outside of North America, and we continue to be very pleased with our performance. We expect to open another 30 or so BBW stores in the balance of the year.
So in summary, continued progress for our international business in the second quarter, and we remain focused on the fundamentals, growth execution of our brands wherever we go. And with that, I'll say thank you and turn the discussion back over to Amie."

And what I mean by that is the -- how consumers react to our product. And when we get it right, as you know, we got a lot of pricing power with the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret brand. So it really does start with getting the product right, which as you know, is one of the key reasons or rationals for all the work that we've done and that we continue to do on our speed agenda. When you combine that with inventory management and discipline, those things in combination get to merchandise margin rate improvements that we've realized over time, including year-to-date in 2015. With that said, you also know that we try to be smart about the trade-off between rate and dollars. And we really think a lot about reinvesting in our products and driving dollar volume at the end of the day, trading off price levels promotions, opening price points, et cetera, to get the best merchandise margin dollar result. And then as you move into occupancy, the other component of the gross profit rate, frankly, we are very enthused and bullish about the opportunity that we have to reinvest in our store fleet. And as we report our regularly at our annual investor meeting, those investments certainly in aggregate have been paying off very well in terms of investment returns, driving sales growth, profit dollar growth and very importantly, setting our business up for the next 5 or 10 years with the store environment that's very compelling to consumers. And so reflecting those investments, I would expect that we'll continue to see some deleverage in the occupancy line over time. But again, view that very favorably because of how that contributes to the long-term health and growth potential for this business. So big subject. I think that reflects our views. And we'll be careful about managing rate versus dollars."

Think about how to approach things differently and to maximize that timeframe between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day because we all had know that, that has been declining for the industry over time and we're just trying to make sure that we can get more of our fair share.

As I think about omnichannel, I think Victoria's Secret, because we've been in the catalog business so long, because we moved to the Internet business, we've been an omnichannel business. We're just getting stronger and stronger. We're engaging more with our customers. Our customers are buying more with that. They're becoming our -- they're not tweeting at a -- they're tweeting at a slower rate for us. So I think that from a brand perspective and from a direct perspective, we're moving in the right direction. We're going to continue to elevate our catalog.

As we look forward into the back half of the year, I think we're very well-positioned across all of our markets.

We have over 100 stores to open in the back half, and getting them opened on time and getting them opened well is mission critical. So I'm more focused on that and predicting precisely what the rate will be. But I will tell you that this has been a great deal of consistency in our growth rates across each of the last 4 quarters in terms of retail sales. Highs and lows in terms of things most pleased with, I would say China is an area that we have excitement for us, as we've opened 12 stores, VSBA stores. We have another 7 or 8 to open in the balance of this year. We're well-positioned to open full assortment stores in China in 2015. So particularly excited about that. If I had to pull out 1 big challenge that we face, it's really delivering the right real estate. We've made a strategic choice not to go at a pace that means that we need to compromise our retail real estate. If we want the best real estate in any, we have to wait for it. So there's frustration in getting the right real estate as quickly as I would like it. But by and large, we'll work our way through that and continue to stay focused on some of the confusion."

So then therefore, you'll have a pre standing PINK store and a free-standing Victoria's Secret store. The other piece is just making our stores larger and having PINK be side-by-side. We still have, when we look at it, probably 50% to 60% of our plate still cannot hold all of our assortments. And that's just going to take time because, first of all, you want to get the right real estate. And as I think from a Limited Brands perspective, that we do an outstanding job managing that real estate plate because we had very few stores that don't make money. So one of the things that I think about real estate as well is that how do we -- are we our dominant real estate, is it actually more leverage to our core categories? That it takes a repositioning and adjacencies with inside our store. That is one piece that we're working on as well. We have proven that we can actually pay for these, gets a very high 20% over return in the first year, which is great from our real estate. So I think that we're on the right track and excited about where we're going. And it's still a lot of opportunity that we have left on the table. When we I think about the direct business, we've already shifted probably I think 52% or about 52% of our business is coming through mobile. So that is something that we are -- have been focused on and that continue to focus on and continue to leverage. In terms of the omnichannel work, we actually have -- where you can buy online, return in store -- buy online and return in store. If we're out of stock, looking by from store and buy out of stock for we have and on the pickup it. Something that we are continuing to think about.

And as you know, we are reinvesting meaningfully in our business to grow it. And doing so, we think, in a very profitable way. And then to the extent that we have free cash flow after that, we're very clear minded again about returning that to shareholders. And as you know, first and foremost, is a regular dividend that we want to be very compelling and appropriate for our shareholders. And we've increased that regular dividend very materially or very significantly over the last several years, including a very significant increase over the last 12 months. Then in terms of the interplay between special dividends and share repurchases, we use our judgment. And we use our judgment about our sense of the desire of shareholders and our sense of relative opportunity to marketplace. One component of that thinking is we do want to generally offset dilution from equity awards with share repurchases. But beyond that, we'll be what we believe to be opportunistic, obviously, thinking about our view of the intrinsic value of the company. So again,, first and foremost is invest of the business. Second, any excess coming back to shareholders. Third, compelling regular dividend. And then, fourth, some swing between repurchase and specialist depending on facts and circumstances at the time."

So in terms of leverage point, we mentioned that we're, and you said on the fixed cost and you mentioned some expenses. I mean, selling expenses to some degree of fixed. And some degree, you would appreciate that they're variable. So we fee put that selling expenses off to the side for second and really more so think about occupancy expenses, as we've mentioned pretty consistently, we're investing in our business. And that percentage increases depending upon the business and the period of time 6%, 7% maybe in some periods, 8%. But again, that's because we're investing in the business. So that -- on that part of expense structure, that's kind of the breakpoint in terms of total sales growth. That's not comp. It's the total sales growth. And then the selling expense will be in season, in annual management. And as I've heard, we're investing in that part of our business to improve the customer experience. And that's, right now, we're seeing some deleverage in that part of our P&L."

But I wouldn't describe them as an aggregate material. And again, our big opportunity is to minimize markdowns and drive compelling product inflow and speed and innovation and quality in our product.

285544,306239484,861394,"L Brands, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid second quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68 versus $0.63 last yea",801,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid second quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68 versus $0.63 last year. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange rates, earnings growth was 11%. 
To take you through the second quarter results as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales for the quarter increased 3% to $2.765 billion and comps increased 4%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 point. The gross margin rate increased by 130 basis points to 40.3%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate.
Buying and occupancy expense deleveraged, driven by our investments in real estate. SG&A expenses deleveraged by 70 basis points, primarily driven by our investment in store selling to improve the customer experience. Operating income dollars increased by 7%, and our operating income rate improved by 50 basis points. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68. Foreign currency negatively impacted our second quarter EPS result by about $0.02. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter flat versus last year. Inventories were clean and we are well positioned. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock in the second quarter for $131.2 million. At quarter end, we had $197.8 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program.
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in square footage increased selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and the higher tax rate. Our third quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect the third quarter gross margin rate to increase, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage. We expect the SG&A rate to delever, driven primarily by an increase in store selling costs.
We expect third quarter net nonoperating expense, consisting primarily of interest expense, to be about flat to last year at $80 million. We expect earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45 in the third quarter against last year's $0.44 result. This forecast includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.03. We are also lapping approximately $35 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel at Victoria's Secret Direct. We expect to end the third quarter with inventory per square foot of low to mid-single digits to last year.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage in our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up and the SG&A rate to be slightly up to last year. Net nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $315 million, roughly flat to last year. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07. 
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 296 million in the third quarter and 297 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.58 and $3.73. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.12. We are projecting 2015 CapEx between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.
As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 25 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3% driven by 28 net new openings and 83 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of between $700 million and $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates. 
Comps increased 3% on top of 3% last year, reaching $1.8 billion in total sales for the second quarter. Operating income of $298 million was up $5 million or 2% to last year. We had hoped to do even better, but remain committed and focused on the fundamentals. We recognize that we must keep getting better to win.
Included in our results are the exit of apparel and makeup last year or $65 million in sales. Excluding these items, our segment sales growth would have been up mid-single digits and comps would've been about 1 point higher. We had solid performance in bras and panties with positive double-digit growth and increased margin rate. In addition, we remain pleased with the growth and strong customer response to our PINK loungewear business.
We were disappointed in the performance of swim and beauty, which were both below our expectations and were the primary drivers of our miss in operating income. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up low single-digits per foot to last year and in line with our expectation. 
Now let's turn to the specific channel performance, starting with stores. Sales for the quarter increased 5% to $1.4 billion and comps increased 3 on top of 3 last year. Sales growth was driven by strength in PINK, along with growth in lingerie, bras and panties. Our beauty business was down to last year, reflecting the impact of exiting the makeup category and softness in gifting. Swim was also down to last year, driven by fashion misses during the second quarter. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year, but the rate was about flat as strength in full-price selling was mostly offset by increased swim clearance and unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business. Expenses, including buying and occupancy and SG&A, delevered in the quarter versus last year, driven by investments in store real estate and higher store selling costs. Operating income dollars were about flat to last year. Excluding the impact of exiting makeup, earnings would have been up mid-single digit versus last year. 
Now turning to the direct channel. Our strategy to distort to core categories with our best growth opportunities is working, and we were pleased with the results in our direct channel. Second quarter sales were down 4%, as we anniversaried roughly $45 million of non-go-forward apparel. Operating income dollars and rate improved, driven by the increase in merchandise margin and decrease in expenses. Collectively, sales in go-forward categories were up over 10%. Swim also missed expectation in the direct channel. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continued to distort to the core.
Looking ahead to the third quarter. We will continue our focused, fast and frugal approach in order to grow our business. Our fashion offerings are strong, and we will continue to flow newness this quarter. We are focused on driving growth in our core categories: bras, panties, lounge and fragrance. We started August with the Body by Victoria and Wear Everywhere Bra launches. We prepared for a strong back-to-school season with our second annual PINK Friday. We are entering the season with well-positioned inventory, enabling us to be agile and respond with speed. We will continue to be up against the exit of non-go-forward apparel, which represents roughly $35 million in sales in the third quarter last year. In addition, we are continuing to invest in real estate, store selling and digital enhancements to create a more seamless shopping experience for our customer. These are the right investments for the long-term growth of our business, but will pressure rate in the third quarter. We are continuing to test and learn for holiday in order to set ourselves up for success in the fourth quarter.

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our second quarter results, where we were again able to grow sales and increase earnings versus our record performance last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates and continuing to maintain inventory levels -- manage inventory levels down.
Second quarter sales of Bath & Body Works North America was $748 million, up 6% or $44 million to last year, and comps increased 5% on top of 3% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. 
We were able to pull back in promotional activity versus last year. We reduced clearance selling throughout the quarter and we were able to effectively leverage product newness in our semiannual sale. We were very pleased with our customers' continued positive reaction to our brand, our product assortment and our storytelling as well as our in-store experience.
For the quarter, operating income was $138 million, up 20% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 210 basis points to 18.4%, driven by improvement in gross profit and SG&A expense leverage. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel, which grew sales by 15% and operating income significantly in the second quarter versus last year.
We ended the quarter with inventory down to last year, well positioned heading into the third quarter and flexible enough to react to customers' preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management but will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2015. We will continue to leverage the strength of our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class, in-store experience by constantly delivering differentiation within visual display and maintaining a strong customer service focus. We begin the quarter focused on our Welcome to Wine Country theme, featuring new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses, and we'll transition to our full floor set in September time period.
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin Waters."

As in previous calls, I shall give you a brief overview of our progress in our international businesses. As we all know, our opportunity for international growth is significant, and we feel good about the strategic choices we made to be steady and purposeful, to pursue a test-and-learn philosophy that reflects the DNA of our company.
As detailed on Page 13 of your presentation, we opened 64 gross international locations so far this year, 35 in the second quarter, to end the quarter with 453 stores in the segment. Revenue increased 12% in the quarter to $88.7 million and operating income increased 19% to $20.2 million. The operating income rate increased 140 basis points to 22.8%. The revenue growth deceleration versus the first quarter was driven by timing shifts in the shipment of product to our wholesale partners in the VSBA business. These timing shifts will smooth out over a longer period of time.
Importantly, retail sales growth in the international business continues to be strong and has been consistent over the last several quarters. At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full-assortment stores.
In the U.K., we continue to be very pleased with our 10 stores. We opened the Bond Street expansion in May, and we will open another 4 stores in the U.K. later this year. In the Middle East, we now have 14 Victoria's Secret stores and 3 PINK stores. We continue to be very pleased with the results there and will open a few more stores later this year.
Staying with Victoria's Secret. Our Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories business continues to progress well with 325 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We've opened 12 VSBA stores in China and are pleased with the results. We will open about 100 or so VSBA stores across the globe by the end of 2015.
Turning to Bath & Body Works International. We now have 101 BBW stores outside of North America, and we continue to be very pleased with our performance. We expect to open another 30 or so BBW stores in the balance of the year.
So in summary, continued progress for our international business in the second quarter. And we remain focused on the fundamentals, great execution of our brands wherever we go.

And what I mean by that is the -- how consumers react to our product. And when we get it right, as you know, we got a lot of pricing power with the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret brand. So it really does start with getting the product right, which as you know, is one of the key reasons or rationals for all the work that we've done and that we continue to do on our speed agenda. When you combine that with inventory management and discipline, those things in combination get to merchandise margin rate improvements that we've realized over time, including year-to-date in 2015. With that said, you also know that we try to be smart about the trade-off between rate and dollars. And we really think a lot about reinvesting in our product and driving dollar volume at the end of the day, trading off price levels, promotions, opening price points, et cetera, to get the best merchandise margin dollar result. And then as you move into occupancy, the other component of the gross profit rate, frankly, we are very enthused and bullish about the opportunity that we have to reinvest in our store fleet. And as we report out regularly at our annual investor meeting, those investments, certainly in aggregate, had been paying off very well in terms of investment returns, driving sales growth, profit dollar growth and very importantly, setting our business up for the next 5 or 10 years with a store environment that's very compelling to consumers. And so reflecting those investments, I would expect that we'll continue to see some deleverage in the occupancy line over time. But again, view that very favorably because of how that contributes to the long-term health and growth potential for this business. So big subject. I think that reflects our views, and we'll be careful about managing rate versus dollars. Thanks."

We really tore holiday apart last year to think about how to approach things differently and to maximize that time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day because we all had note that, that has been declining for the industry over time, and we're just trying to make sure that we can get more of our fair share.

As we look forward into the back half of the year, I think we're very well positioned across all of our markets. To be honest, we focus less on trying to predict exactly what that growth rate will be and more on solid execution and getting the stores open that we have in our plans. We have over 100 stores to open in the back half, and getting them opened on time and getting them opened well is mission critical. So I'm more focused on that and predicting precisely what the rate will be. But I will tell you that there's been a great deal of consistency in our growth rates across each of the last 4 quarters in terms of retail sales. Highs and lows in terms of things most pleased with, I would say China is an area of real excitement for us. We've opened 12 stores, VSBA stores. We have another 7 or 8 to open in the balance of this year. We're well positioned to open full-assortment stores in China in 2016, so particularly excited about that. If I had to pull out one big challenge that we face, it's really delivering the right real estate. We've made a strategic choice not to go at a pace that means that we need to compromise our retail real estate. If we want the best real estate in any mall, sometimes we have to wait for it. So there's a frustration in getting the right real estate as quickly as I would like it. But by and large, we work our way through that and continue to stay focused on solid execution."

So then, therefore, you'll have a pre standing PINK store and a free-standing Victoria's Secret store. The other piece is just making our stores larger and having PINK be side-by-side. We still have, when we look at it, probably 50% to 60% of our plate still cannot hold all of our assortments. And that's just going to take time because, first of all, you want to get the right real estate. And as I think from a Limited Brands perspective, that we do an outstanding job managing that real estate slate because we have very few stores that don't make money. So one of the things -- as I think about our real estate as well, is that how do we -- our dominant real estate, is it actually more leveraged to our core categories? That is -- takes a repositioning and adjacencies with inside our store. That is one piece that we're working on as well. We have proven that we can actually pay for these. It gets a very high 20% over return in the first year, which is great from our real estate. So I think that we're on the right track and excited about where we're going. And it's still a lot of opportunity that we have left on the table. When I think about the direct business, we've already shifted probably, I think 52% or about 52% of our business is coming through mobile. So that is something that we are -- have been focused on and that continue to focus on and continue to leverage. In terms of the omni-channel work, we actually have -- where you can buy online, return in store -- buy online and return in store. If we're out of stock, we can buy -- from store out of stock, you can buy online. We haven't done the pickup yet and it's something that we're continuing to think about.

But there's not any major change in our thinking. It's a fundamental part of our business. We manage inventories well in the spring. Our inventories are very clean.

And as you know, we are reinvesting meaningfully in our business to grow it and doing so, we think, in a very profitable way. And then to the extent that we have free cash flow after that, we're very clear minded again about returning that to shareholders. And as you know, first and foremost, is a regular dividend that we want to be very compelling and appropriate for our shareholders. And we've increased that regular dividend very materially or very significantly over the last several years, including a very significant increase over the last 12 months. Then in terms of the interplay between special dividends and share repurchases, we use our judgment. And we use our judgment about our sense of the desire of shareholders and our sense of relative opportunity in the marketplace. One component of that thinking is we do want to generally offset dilution from equity awards with share repurchases. But beyond that, we'll be, what we believe to be opportunistic, obviously, thinking about our view of the intrinsic value of the company. So again, first and foremost is invest in the business; second, any excess coming back to shareholders; third, compelling regular dividend; and then, fourth, some swing between repurchase and specialist, depending on facts and circumstances at the time."

285544,306239484,861420,"L Brands, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid second quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68 versus $0.63 last yea",800,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid second quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68 versus $0.63 last year. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange rates, earnings growth was 11%. 
To take you through the second quarter results as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales for the quarter increased 3% to $2.765 billion and comps increased 4%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 point. The gross margin rate increased by 130 basis points to 40.3%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate.
Buying and occupancy expense deleveraged, driven by our investments in real estate. SG&A expenses deleveraged by 70 basis points, primarily driven by our investment in store selling to improve the customer experience. Operating income dollars increased by 7%, and our operating income rate improved by 50 basis points. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68. Foreign currency negatively impacted our second quarter EPS result by about $0.02. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter flat versus last year. Inventories were clean and we are well positioned. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock in the second quarter for $131.2 million. At quarter-end, we had $197.8 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program.
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in square footage increased selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and a higher tax rate. Our third quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect the third quarter gross margin rate to increase, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage. We expect the SG&A rate to delever, driven primarily by an increase in store selling costs.
We expect third quarter net nonoperating expense, consisting primarily of interest expense, to be about flat to last year at $80 million. We expect earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45 in the third quarter against last year's $0.44 result. This forecast includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.03. We are also lapping approximately $35 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel at Victoria's Secret Direct. We expect to end the third quarter with inventory per square foot of low to mid-single digits to last year.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage in our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up and the SG&A rate to be slightly up to last year. Net nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $315 million, roughly flat to last year. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07. 
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 296 million in the third quarter and 297 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.58 and $3.73. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.12. We are projecting 2015 CapEx between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.
As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 25 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 28 net new openings and 83 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of between $700 million and $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates. 
Comps increased 3% on top of 3% last year, reaching $1.8 billion in total sales for the second quarter. Operating income of $298 million was up $5 million or 2% to last year. We had hoped to do even better, but remain committed and focused on the fundamentals. We recognize that we must keep getting better to win.
Included in our results are the exit of apparel and makeup last year or $65 million in sales. Excluding these items, our segment sales growth would have been up mid-single digits and comps would've been about 1 point higher. We had solid performance in bras and panties with positive double-digit growth and increased margin rate. In addition, we remain pleased with the growth and strong customer response to our PINK loungewear business.
We were disappointed in the performance of swim and beauty, which were both below our expectations and were the primary drivers of our miss in operating income. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up low single-digits per foot to last year and in line with our expectations. 
Now let's turn to the specific channel performance, starting with stores. Sales for the quarter increased 5% to $1.4 billion and comps increased 3% on top of 3% last year. Sales growth was driven by strength in PINK, along with growth in lingerie, bras and panties. Our beauty business was down to last year, reflecting the impact of exiting the makeup category and softness in gifting. Swim was also down to last year, driven by fashion misses during the second quarter. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year, but the rate was about flat as strength in full-price selling was mostly offset by increased swim clearance and unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business. Expenses, including buying and occupancy and SG&A, delevered in the quarter versus last year, driven by investments in store real estate and higher store selling costs. Operating income dollars were about flat to last year. Excluding the impact of exiting makeup, earnings would have been up mid-single digits versus last year. 
Now turning to the direct channel. Our strategy to distort to core categories with our best growth opportunities is working, and we were pleased with the results in our direct channel. Second quarter sales were down 4%, as we anniversaried roughly $45 million of non-go-forward apparel. Operating income dollars and rate improved, driven by the increase in merchandise margin and decrease in expenses. Collectively, sales in go-forward categories were up over 10%. Swim also missed expectations in the direct channel. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continued to distort to the core.
Looking ahead to the third quarter. We will continue our focused, fast and frugal approach in order to grow our business. Our fashion offerings are strong, and we will continue to flow newness this quarter. We are focused on driving growth in our core categories: bras, panties, lounge and fragrance. We started August with the Body by Victoria and Wear Everywhere Bra launches. We prepared for a strong back-to-school season with our second annual PINK Friday. We are entering the season with well-positioned inventory, enabling us to be agile and respond with speed. We will continue to be up against the exit of non-go-forward apparel, which represents roughly $35 million in sales in the third quarter last year. In addition, we are continuing to invest in real estate, store selling and digital enhancements to create a more seamless shopping experience for our customer. These are the right investments for the long-term growth of our business, but will pressure rate in the third quarter. We are continuing to test and learn for holiday in order to set ourselves up for success in the fourth quarter. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our second quarter results, where we were again able to grow sales and increase earnings versus our record performance last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates and continuing to maintain inventory levels -- manage inventory levels down.
Second quarter sales of Bath & Body Works North America was $748 million, up 6% or $44 million to last year, and comps increased 5% on top of 3% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. 
We were able to pull back in promotional activity versus last year. We reduced clearance selling throughout the quarter and we were able to effectively leverage product newness in our semiannual sale. We were very pleased with our customers' continued positive reaction to our brand, our product assortments and our storytelling as well as our in-store experience.
For the quarter, operating income was $138 million, up 20% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 210 basis points to 18.4%, driven by improvement in gross profit and SG&A expense leverage. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel, which grew sales by 15% and operating income significantly in the second quarter versus last year.
We ended the quarter with inventory down to last year, well positioned heading into the third quarter and flexible enough to react to customers' preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management but will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2015. We will continue to leverage the strength of our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class, in-store experience by constantly delivering differentiation within visual display and maintaining a strong customer service focus. We begin the quarter focused on our Welcome to Wine Country theme, featuring new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses, and we'll transition to our fall floor set in September time period.
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin Waters."

As in previous calls, I shall give you a brief overview of our progress in our international businesses. As we all know, our opportunity for international growth is significant, and we feel good about the strategic choices we made to be steady and purposeful, to pursue a test-and-learn philosophy that reflects the DNA of our company.
As detailed on Page 13 of your presentation, we opened 64 gross international locations so far this year, 35 in the second quarter, to end the quarter with 453 stores in the segment. Revenue increased 12% in the quarter to $88.7 million and operating income increased 19% to $20.2 million. The operating income rate increased 140 basis points to 22.8%. The revenue growth deceleration versus the first quarter was driven by timing shifts in the shipment of product to our wholesale partners in the VSBA business. These timing shifts will smooth out over a longer period of time.
Importantly, retail sales growth in the international business continues to be strong and has been consistent over the last several quarters. At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full-assortment stores.
In the U.K., we continue to be very pleased with our 10 stores. We opened the Bond Street expansion in May, and we will open another 4 stores in the U.K. later this year. In the Middle East, we now have 14 Victoria's Secret stores and 3 PINK stores. We continue to be very pleased with the results there and will open a few more stores later this year.
Staying with Victoria's Secret. Our Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories business continues to progress well with 325 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We've opened 12 VSBA stores in China and are pleased with the results. We will open about 100 or so VSBA stores across the globe by the end of 2015.
Turning to Bath & Body Works International. We now have 101 BBW stores outside of North America, and we continue to be very pleased with their performance. We expect to open another 30 or so BBW stores in the balance of the year.
So in summary, continued progress for our international business in the second quarter, while we remain focused on the fundamentals: great execution of our brands wherever we go.

And what I mean by that is the -- how consumers react to our product. And when we get it right, as you know, we got a lot of pricing power with the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret brands. So it really does start with getting the product right, which as you know, is one of the key reasons or rationales for all the work that we've done and that we continue to do on our speed agenda. When you combine that with inventory management and discipline, those things in combination get to merchandise margin rate improvements that we've realized over time, including year-to-date in 2015. With that said, you also know that we try to be smart about the trade-off between rate and dollars. And we really think a lot about reinvesting in our product and driving dollar volume at the end of the day, trading off price levels, promotions, opening price points, et cetera, to get the best merchandise margin dollar result. And then as you move into occupancy, the other component of the gross profit rate, frankly, we are very enthused and bullish about the opportunity that we have to reinvest in our store fleet. And as we report out regularly at our annual investor meeting, those investments, certainly in aggregate, have been paying off very well in terms of investment returns, driving sales growth, profit dollar growth and very importantly, setting our business up for the next 5 or 10 years with a store environment that's very compelling to consumers. And so reflecting those investments, I would expect that we'll continue to see some deleverage in the occupancy line over time. But again, view that very favorably because of how that contributes to the long-term health and growth potential for this business. So big subject. I think that reflects our views, and we'll be careful about managing rate versus dollars. Thanks."

We're continuing to test early so that we can identify bigger opportunities. Our promotional activity is basically planned slightly down, but we have contingencies in place that if we need to balance out responding to traffic or driving to traffic as we protect the brand. I think for the PINK business, obviously, it's a good indicator for us about how holiday can be. We really tore holiday apart last year to think about how to approach things differently and to maximize that time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, because we all had known that, that has been declining for the industry over time, and we're just trying to make sure that we can get more of our fair share. So we're positioned well. Inventories are under control. We're doing a lot of testing. We've got a new bra launch that's happening. PINK has actually got some -- we're very fortunate that we're in a backpack cycle right now, which is just perfect for PINK. Our beauty business, we are in the throes of repositioning that beauty business because we want it to be more elevated and in line with the lingerie category. So we have introduced body care for the August time frame. We're repositioning Fantasy, which is a big chunk of that business, in October, and as we continue to elevate our fine fragrance.

So then, therefore, you'll have a free-standing PINK store and a free-standing Victoria's Secret store. The other piece is just making our stores larger and having PINK be side-by-side. We still have, when we look at it, probably 50% to 60% of our fleet still cannot hold all of our assortments. And that's just going to take time because, first of all, you want to get the right real estate. And as I think from a Limited Brands perspective, that we do an outstanding job managing that real estate fleet because we have very few stores that don't make money. So one of the things as I think about our real estate as well, is that how do we -- our dominant real estate, is it actually more leveraged to our core categories? That is -- takes a repositioning in adjacencies with -- inside our store. That is one piece that we're working on as well. We have proven that we can actually pay for these. It gets a very high 20% over return in the first year, which is great from our real estate. So I think that we're on the right track and excited about where we're going. And it's still a lot of opportunity that we have left on the table. When I think about the direct business, we've already shifted probably, I think, 52% -- or about 52% of our business is coming through mobile. So that is something that we are -- have been focused on and that -- continue to focus on and continue to leverage. In terms of the omni-channel work, we actually have -- where you can buy online, return in store -- buy online and return in store. If we're out of stock, we can buy -- from store out of stock, you can buy online. We haven't done the pickup yet, and it's something that we're continuing to think about. But we have already put all those other things in place and have had those things in place over 2 years now."

And we continue to see a very healthy customer ship against that core business of Signature. The other side of that is our home business continues to be very strong and our investments in the home business will maintain as we think about holiday. And really, the second half is the time that our home business typically grows, outpaces its first half results. So those are the really the 2 big opportunities for us really, and underpinning all of that is again, wanting to make sure that we have enough flexibility by leveraging the speed model that we have that really provides us the best opportunity to chase into the right business and drive first-quality selling."

But with that said, we want to be careful about it because you go back to point #1, which is we want to be in stock and we want to be well positioned to pursue business. But there's not any major change in our thinking. It's a fundamental part of our business. We managed inventories well in the spring. Our inventories are very clean. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect inventory per foot, store inventory per foot to be up low to mid-single. You might be curious about the mid-single digit. When you look at things on a 2-year basis, fall inventories will actually be down a little bit more or pretty consistent with the inventory changes in spring.

So on capital allocation, the thing that is very consistent for us is that any excess cash that we generate, and we generate a lot of excess cash through the profitability and the operating cash flow of the business, we're going to, first and foremost, reinvest in our business. And as you know, we are reinvesting meaningfully in our business to grow it and doing so, we think, in a very profitable way. And then to the extent that we have free cash flow after that, we're very clear minded again about returning that to shareholders. And as you know, first and foremost, is a regular dividend that we want to be very compelling and appropriate for our shareholders. And we've increased that regular dividend very materially or very significantly over the last several years, including a very significant increase over the last 12 months. Then in terms of the interplay between special dividends and share repurchases, we use our judgment. And we use our judgment about our sense of the desire of shareholders and our sense of relative opportunity in the marketplace. One component of that thinking is we do want to generally offset dilution from equity awards with share repurchases. But beyond that, we'll be, what we believe to be opportunistic, obviously, thinking about our view of the intrinsic value of the company. So again, first and foremost is invest in the business; second, any excess coming back to shareholders; third, compelling regular dividend; and then, fourth, some swing between repurchase and specialist, depending on facts and circumstances at the time."

And that percentage increases, depending upon the business and the period of time, 6%, 7%, maybe in some periods, 8%. But again, that's because we're investing in the business. So that -- on that part of the expense structure, that's kind of the breakpoint in terms of total sales growth. That's not comp, but total sales growth. And then the selling expense will be in season, in annual management. And as you've heard, we're investing in that part of our business to improve the customer experience.

285544,306239484,861589,"L Brands, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2015",2015-08-20,"Earnings Calls","Bath & Body Works, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid second quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68 versus $0.63 last yea",801,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid second quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68 versus $0.63 last year. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange rates, earnings growth was 11%. 
To take you through the second quarter results as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales for the quarter increased 3% to $2.765 billion and comps increased 4%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 point. The gross margin rate increased by 130 basis points to 40.3%, driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate.
Buying and occupancy expense deleveraged, driven by our investments in real estate. SG&A expenses deleveraged by 70 basis points, primarily driven by our investment in store selling to improve the customer experience. Operating income dollars increased by 7%, and our operating income rate improved by 50 basis points. Earnings per share increased 8% to $0.68. Foreign currency negatively impacted our second quarter EPS result by about $0.02. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter flat versus last year. Inventories were clean and we are well positioned. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of stock in the second quarter for $131.2 million. At quarter end, we had $197.8 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program.
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in square footage increased selling payroll, driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and a higher tax rate. Our third quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect the third quarter gross margin rate to increase, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage. We expect the SG&A rate to delever, driven primarily by an increase in store selling costs.
We expect third quarter net nonoperating expense, consisting primarily of interest expense, to be about flat to last year at $80 million. We expect earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45 in the third quarter against last year's $0.44 result. This forecast includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.03. We are also lapping approximately $35 million in sales of non-go-forward apparel at Victoria's Secret Direct. We expect to end the third quarter with inventory per square foot of low to mid-single digits to last year.
For the full year, we are projecting positive low single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage in our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about 1 point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up and the SG&A rate to be slightly up to last year. Net nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $315 million, roughly flat to last year. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact earnings per share by about $0.07. 
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 296 million in the third quarter and 297 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.58 and $3.73. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.12. We are projecting 2015 CapEx between $800 million and $850 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities.
As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions of existing Victoria's Secret stores and 25 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 28 net new openings and 83 remodels. Total company square footage will increase by about 3.5%. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of between $700 million and $800 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates. 
Comps increased 3% on top of 3% last year, reaching $1.8 billion in total sales for the second quarter. Operating income of $298 million was up $5 million or 2% to last year. We had hoped to do even better, but remain committed and focused on the fundamentals. We recognize that we must keep getting better to win.
Included in our results are the exit of apparel and makeup last year or $65 million in sales. Excluding these items, our segment sales growth would have been up mid-single digits and comps would've been about 1 point higher. We had solid performance in bras and panties with positive double-digit growth and increased margin rate. In addition, we remain pleased with the growth and strong customer response to our PINK loungewear business.
We were disappointed in the performance of swim and beauty, which were both below our expectations and were the primary drivers of our miss in operating income. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up low single-digits per foot to last year and in line with our expectations. 
Now let's turn to the specific channel performance, starting with stores. Sales for the quarter increased 5% to $1.4 billion and comps increased 3% on top of 3% last year. Sales growth was driven by strength in PINK, along with growth in lingerie, bras and panties. Our beauty business was down to last year, reflecting the impact of exiting the makeup category and softness in gifting. Swim was also down to last year, driven by fashion misses during the second quarter. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year, but the rate was about flat as strength in full-price selling was mostly offset by increased swim clearance and unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business. Expenses, including buying and occupancy and SG&A, delevered in the quarter versus last year, driven by investments in store real estate and higher store selling costs. Operating income dollars were about flat to last year. Excluding the impact of exiting makeup, earnings would have been up mid-single digits versus last year. 
Now turning to the direct channel. Our strategy to distort to core categories with our best growth opportunities is working, and we were pleased with the results in our direct channel. Second quarter sales were down 4%, as we anniversaried roughly $45 million of non-go-forward apparel. Operating income dollars and rate improved, driven by the increase in merchandise margin and decrease in expenses. Collectively, sales in go-forward categories were up over 10%. Swim also missed expectations in the direct channel. The merchandise margin rate in dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continued to distort to the core.
Looking ahead to the third quarter. We will continue our focused, fast and frugal approach in order to grow our business. Our fashion offerings are strong, and we will continue to flow newness this quarter. We are focused on driving growth in our core categories: bras, panties, lounge and fragrance. We started August with the Body by Victoria and Wear Everywhere Bra launches. We prepared for a strong back-to-school season with our second annual PINK Friday. We are entering the season with well-positioned inventory, enabling us to be agile and respond with speed. We will continue to be up against the exit of non-go-forward apparel, which represents roughly $35 million in sales in the third quarter last year. In addition, we are continuing to invest in real estate, store selling and digital enhancements to create a more seamless shopping experience for our customer. These are the right investments for the long-term growth of our business, but will pressure rate in the third quarter. We are continuing to test and learn for holiday in order to set ourselves up for success in the fourth quarter.

At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our second quarter results, where we were again able to grow sales and increase earnings versus our record performance last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates and continuing to maintain inventory levels -- manage inventory levels down.
Second quarter sales of Bath & Body Works North America was $748 million, up 6% or $44 million to last year, and comps increased 5% on top of 3% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. 
We were able to pull back in promotional activity versus last year. We reduced clearance selling throughout the quarter and we were able to effectively leverage product newness in our semiannual sale. We were very pleased with our customers' continued positive reaction to our brand, our product assortments and our storytelling as well as our in-store experience.
For the quarter, operating income was $138 million, up 20% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 210 basis points to 18.4%, driven by improvement in gross profit and SG&A expense leverage. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel, which grew sales by 15% and operating income significantly in the second quarter versus last year.
We ended the quarter with inventory down to last year, well positioned heading into the third quarter and flexible enough to react to customers' preferences. We remain focused on disciplined expense management but will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.
Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2015. We will continue to leverage the strength of our read-and-react capabilities and provide a world-class, in-store experience by constantly delivering differentiation within visual display and maintaining a strong customer service focus. We begin the quarter focused on our Welcome to Wine Country theme, featuring new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses, and we'll transition to our fall floor set in September time period.

As in previous calls, I shall give you a brief overview of our progress in our international businesses. As we all know, our opportunity for international growth is significant, and we feel good about the strategic choices we made to be steady and purposeful, to pursue a test-and-learn philosophy that reflects the DNA of our company.
As detailed on Page 13 of your presentation, we opened 64 gross international locations so far this year, 35 in the second quarter, to end the quarter with 453 stores in the segment. Revenue increased 12% in the quarter to $88.7 million and operating income increased 19% to $20.2 million. The operating income rate increased 140 basis points to 22.8%. The revenue growth deceleration versus the first quarter was driven by timing shifts in the shipment of product to our wholesale partners in the VSBA business. These timing shifts will smooth out over a longer period of time.
Importantly, retail sales growth in the international business continues to be strong and has been consistent over the last several quarters. At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full-assortment stores.
In the U.K., we continue to be very pleased with our 10 stores. We opened the Bond Street expansion in May, and we will open another 4 stores in the U.K. later this year. In the Middle East, we now have 14 Victoria's Secret stores and 3 PINK stores. We continue to be very pleased with the results there and will open a few more stores later this year.
Staying with Victoria's Secret. Our Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories business continues to progress well with 325 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We've opened 12 VSBA stores in China and are pleased with the results. We will open about 100 or so VSBA stores across the globe by the end of 2015.
Turning to Bath & Body Works International. We now have 101 BBW stores outside of North America, and we continue to be very pleased with their performance. We expect to open another 30 or so BBW stores in the balance of the year.
So in summary, continued progress for our international business in the second quarter, while we remain focused on the fundamentals: great execution of our brands wherever we go.

And what I mean by that is the -- how consumers react to our product. And when we get it right, as you know, we got a lot of pricing power with the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret brands. So it really does start with getting the product right, which as you know, is one of the key reasons or rationales for all the work that we've done and that we continue to do on our speed agenda. When you combine that with inventory management and discipline, those things in combination get to merchandise margin rate improvements that we've realized over time, including year-to-date in 2015. With that said, you also know that we try to be smart about the trade-off between rate and dollars. And we really think a lot about reinvesting in our product and driving dollar volume at the end of the day, trading off price levels, promotions, opening price points, et cetera, to get the best merchandise margin dollar result. And then as you move into occupancy, the other component of the gross profit rate, frankly, we are very enthused and bullish about the opportunity that we have to reinvest in our store fleet. And as we report out regularly at our annual investor meeting, those investments, certainly in aggregate, have been paying off very well in terms of investment returns, driving sales growth, profit dollar growth and very importantly, setting our business up for the next 5 or 10 years with a store environment that's very compelling to consumers. And so reflecting those investments, I would expect that we'll continue to see some deleverage in the occupancy line over time. But again, view that very favorably because of how that contributes to the long-term health and growth potential for this business. So big subject. I think that reflects our views, and we'll be careful about managing rate versus dollars. Thanks."

We changed, instead of reacting into the things that were working, we said, ""Oh, let's land a brand-new fashion delivery,"" which we did, and it was a big misstep. It affected both the store channel as well as the direct channel. When I think about our supply chain in swim, it was one of the first to go on a speed model. One of the other things that we did is we designed really complex swimsuits with macramé, all of those kinds of details that were much harder to chase into. So the whole swim thing is something we did to ourself. The business is there to have. We messed it up. We didn't follow our own fundamentals, and it's been my biggest disappointment."

Our marketing plan, we actually are adding a bra launch in the first week of December, which will be different this year versus last year. We're continuing to test early so that we can identify bigger opportunities. Our promotional activity is basically planned slightly down, but we have contingencies in place that if we need to balance out responding to traffic or driving to traffic as we protect the brand. I think for the PINK business, obviously, it's a good indicator for us about how holiday can be. We really tore holiday apart last year to think about how to approach things differently and to maximize that time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, because we all had known that, that has been declining for the industry over time, and we're just trying to make sure that we can get more of our fair share. So we're positioned well. Inventories are under control. We're doing a lot of testing. We've got a new bra launch that's happening. PINK has actually got some -- we're very fortunate that we're in a backpack cycle right now, which is just perfect for PINK. Our beauty business, we are in the throes of repositioning that beauty business because we want it to be more elevated and in line with the lingerie category. So we have introduced body care for the August time frame. We're repositioning Fantasy, which is a big chunk of that business, in October, and as we continue to elevate our fine fragrance. So I think that we're prepared, but we're also being very cautious in terms of going into holiday."

From a margin perspective, obviously, we'll plan that flat and then leverage the speed capabilities that we have to be able to react to what's working and what's selling, which should give us, hopefully, some upside.

We have over 100 stores to open in the back half, and getting them opened on time and getting them opened well is mission critical. So I'm more focused on that than predicting precisely what the rate will be. But I will tell you that there's been a great deal of consistency in our growth rates across each of the last 4 quarters in terms of retail sales. Highs and lows in terms of things most pleased with, I would say China is an area of real excitement for us. We've opened 12 stores, VSBA stores. We have another 7 or 8 to open in the balance of this year. We're well positioned to open full-assortment stores in China in 2016, so particularly excited about that. If I had to pull out one big challenge that we face, it's really delivering the right real estate. We've made a strategic choice not to go at a pace that means that we need to compromise on our retail real estate. If we want the best real estate in any mall, sometimes we have to wait for it.

So then, therefore, you'll have a free-standing PINK store and a free-standing Victoria's Secret store. The other piece is just making our stores larger and having PINK be side-by-side. We still have, when we look at it, probably 50% to 60% of our fleet still cannot hold all of our assortments. And that's just going to take time because, first of all, you want to get the right real estate. And as I think from a Limited Brands perspective, that we do an outstanding job managing that real estate fleet because we have very few stores that don't make money. So one of the things as I think about our real estate as well, is that how do we -- our dominant real estate, is it actually more leveraged to our core categories? That is -- takes a repositioning in adjacencies with -- inside our store. That is one piece that we're working on as well. We have proven that we can actually pay for these. It gets a very high 20% over return in the first year, which is great from our real estate. So I think that we're on the right track and excited about where we're going. And it's still a lot of opportunity that we have left on the table. When I think about the direct business, we've already shifted probably, I think, 52% -- or about 52% of our business is coming through mobile. So that is something that we are -- have been focused on and that -- continue to focus on and continue to leverage. In terms of the omni-channel work, we actually have -- where you can buy online, return in store -- buy online and return in store. If we're out of stock, we can buy -- from store out of stock, you can buy online. We haven't done the pickup yet, and it's something that we're continuing to think about.

With the swim business struggling a little bit in second quarter, just want to make sure that we're exiting the quarter clean in terms of any swim clearance product. Or is there any sort of residual that we should see in the third quarter?"

Betty, I think the way we're thinking about the second half is we still believe we have a tremendous business opportunity in our core businesses. We'd like to think there's opportunities still remaining within the Signature business as we come up against last year. We've got an awful lot of newness flowing. And we continue to see a very healthy customer ship against that core business of Signature. The other side of that is our home business continues to be very strong and our investments in the home business will maintain as we think about holiday. And really, the second half is the time that our home business typically grows, outpaces its first half results. So those are the really the 2 big opportunities for us really, and underpinning all of that is again, wanting to make sure that we have enough flexibility by leveraging the speed model that we have that really provides us the best opportunity to chase into the right business and drive first-quality selling."

With that said, we've been pursuing strong inventory management through what I call basic disciplines in pursuit of that speed agenda now for 3, 4, 5 years. Our numerical goal, if you will, is to continue to grow inventory slightly slower than sales, to have some spread. But with that said, we want to be careful about it because you go back to point #1, which is we want to be in stock and we want to be well positioned to pursue business. But there's not any major change in our thinking. It's a fundamental part of our business. We managed inventories well in the spring. Our inventories are very clean. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect inventory per foot, store inventory per foot to be up low to mid-single. You might be curious about the mid-single digit. When you look at things on a 2-year basis, fall inventories will actually be down a little bit more or pretty consistent with the inventory changes in spring. And there's a lot of moving pieces to it. But again, our overall thinking and our overall goals are very consistent, and we'll manage it with discipline."

So on capital allocation, the thing that is very consistent for us is that any excess cash that we generate, and we generate a lot of excess cash through the profitability and the operating cash flow of the business, we're going to, first and foremost, reinvest in our business. And as you know, we are reinvesting meaningfully in our business to grow it and doing so, we think, in a very profitable way. And then to the extent that we have free cash flow after that, we're very clear minded again about returning that to shareholders. And as you know, first and foremost, is a regular dividend that we want to be very compelling and appropriate for our shareholders. And we've increased that regular dividend very materially or very significantly over the last several years, including a very significant increase over the last 12 months. Then in terms of the interplay between special dividends and share repurchases, we use our judgment. And we use our judgment about our sense of the desire of shareholders and our sense of relative opportunity in the marketplace. One component of that thinking is we do want to generally offset dilution from equity awards with share repurchases. But beyond that, we'll be, what we believe to be opportunistic, obviously, thinking about our view of the intrinsic value of the company. So again, first and foremost is invest in the business; second, any excess coming back to shareholders; third, compelling regular dividend; and then, fourth, some swing between repurchase and specialist, depending on facts and circumstances at the time."

So if we put the selling expenses off to the side for a second and really more so think about occupancy expenses, as we've mentioned pretty consistently, we're investing in our business. And that percentage increases, depending upon the business and the period of time, 6%, 7%, maybe in some periods, 8%. But again, that's because we're investing in the business. So that -- on that part of the expense structure, that's kind of the breakpoint in terms of total sales growth. That's not comp, but total sales growth. And then the selling expense will be in season, in annual management. And as you've heard, we're investing in that part of our business to improve the customer experience. And thus, right now, we're seeing some deleverage in that part of our P&L."

We delivered record third quarter results as we continue to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 25% to $0.55 versus $0.44 last yea",918,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered record third quarter results as we continue to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 25% to $0.55 versus $0.44 last year. Excluding the $0.04 negative impact from foreign exchange rates, earnings growth was 34%. As Les commented in our press release, our brands are differentiated and have high emotional content, and we can continue to deliver new compelling merchandise in an exciting in-store experience.
We remain focused on executing fundamentals and staying close to our customers. We are pleased with our month-to-date performance and we are well-positioned for the most significant part of our year, which is in front of us. 
To take you through the third quarter results that is detailed on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales for the quarter increased 7% to $2.482 billion, and comps increased 7%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 percentage point. The gross margin rate increased by 80 basis points to 41.6%, driven roughly by an improvement -- driven roughly equally by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate in buying and occupancy leverage. SG&A expenses leveraged by 70 basis points.
Operating income dollars grew by 19% and our operating income rate improved by 140 basis points. Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter up 7% versus last year and down 6% on a 2-year basis.
Inventories reflects some early receipts at the end of the quarter and are clean, and we are well-positioned. We repurchased 751,000 shares of stock in the third quarter for $61 million. At quarter end, we had $137 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program.
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in square footage increased store selling payroll driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and a higher tax rate. Versus our previous forecast, our full year guidance reflects our third quarter feat, less of the impact of incremental interest expense from our recent $1 billion 20-year note issuance of about $0.04. As a reminder, interest expense related to this debt will be about $69 million on an annual basis.
Our fourth quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect a 2 to 3 point positive spread between comps and total sales. We expect the fourth quarter gross margin rate and SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. We expect fourth quarter net nonoperating expense consisting primarily of interest expense to be about $95 million, $18 million more than last year driven by the new debt.
We expect earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95 in the fourth quarter against last year's $1.89 result. This forecast includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.05 and the incremental interest expense of about $0.04. A higher assumed effective tax rate is having a negative $0.05 impact.
Adjusting for these factors, earnings per share growth at the high end of our range is about 10%.
We expect to end the fourth quarter with inventory per square foot up mid single-digits to last year. For the full year, we are projecting positive low- to mid single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than growth due to grow in square footage in our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about a point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up and the SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. Net nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $335 million. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact EPS by about $0.07.
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 296 million in the fourth quarter and 297 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.69 and $3.79. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.12.
We are projecting 2015 CapEx of about $800 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is from real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities. As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions at existing Victoria's Secret stores and 26 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 26 net new openings and 83 remodels.
Total company square footage will increase by between 3% and 4%. Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of between $750 million and $850 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

Total sales increased 8% to $1.6 billion, and comps increased 7% on top of 3% last year. Operating income of $211 million was at $19 [ph] million or up 10% to last year.
Included in last year's results are approximately $36 million in apparel sales in the direct channel, which we have fully exited this year. Excluding this item, our segment sales growth would have been between 2 and 3-point higher. We began the quarter with successful Body by Victoria and Wear Everywhere bra launches, as well as a record back-to-school result in our PINK business. That strength continued throughout the quarter as customers responded to our newness and fashion, leading to double-digit growth in our bra, panty and loungewear categories.
In regard to the beauty business, we are in the process of a full repositioning of this category and remain committed to delivering an elevated beauty business that is more consistent with the Victoria's Secret brand. Throughout this transition, we expect and are seeing beauty results, which are down to last year. Merchandise margin dollars for the segment increased versus last year driven by strength in both stores and direct. Rate was up slightly to last year. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up to last year, driven by planned strategic investments in PINK and increased beauty inventory related to the fantasy's restage.
Now let's turn to the specific channel performance starting with stores. Sales for the quarter increased 9% to $1.3 billion and comps increased 7% on top of 3% last year. Sales growth was driven by strength in bras and panties, as well as PINK loungewear. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year. Margin rate declined, driven by planned promotional activity, including our angel card reissue and unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business.
Additionally, lower beauty sales led to an unfavorable mix impact. Total expenses levered slightly versus last year, as an improvement in the buying and occupancy rate, which partially offset by deleverage in SG&A, driven by investments in selling expense to improve the customer experience within the stores. For the quarter, operating income dollars were up to last year and the operating income rate was down. Now turning to the direct channel.
Our strategy to distort to core categories is working, and we were pleased with the results in our direct channel. Third quarter sales were up 4%, as 20% growth in our go forward category more than offset $36 million of non-go-forward apparel. The merchandise margin rate and dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continue to distort to the quarter. Operating income dollars and rate increased significantly.
In summary, we know that the majority of the season is ahead of us. And in order to deliver our goal, we are going to remain focused on our cross customer, our core business and executing with excellence. We are excited and optimistic about holiday, which starts with Black Friday next week, so happy Thanksgiving, everyone. We are positioned with a strong, fashion-right assortment and activities that will drive both self purchase and gifting. This includes our new bra launch in early December.
Following Black Friday weekend, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will air on Tuesday, December 8, 10:00 p.m. Eastern standard time, featuring musical performance by Ellie Golding, Selena Gomez and The Weekend. Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

We were again able to increase earnings versus our record earnings last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates and continuing to manage inventory appropriately.
Third quarter sales of Bath & Body Works North America was $705 million, up 7% or $46 million to last year, and comps increased 6% on top of 7% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. Merchandise margin rate for the quarter was up with gains from effective leveraging pricing and promotion being partially offset by negative impact of foreign exchange in our Canadian business.
For the quarter, operating income was $136 million, up 46% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 510 basis points to 19.3%, driven by improvements in sales, margins and SG&A expense leverage. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel, which grew sales by 20% and operating income significantly in the quarter versus last year. We ended the quarter with inventory up slightly to last year as we prepare for the fourth quarter. We remain focused on disciplined inventory and expense management and will continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.
We have began fourth quarter 2015 with our holiday theme featuring customer fragrance favorites, as well as new winter fragrances in our 3 key businesses. We will be focused on delivering the Perfect Christmas and giving her the holiday experience that she has come to expense from Bath & Body Works, including newness in our core product categories, gifting options and an irresistible in-store experience. 
With that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin Waters."

As in previous calls, I should give you a brief overview of progress in our international businesses. As you know, our opportunity for international growth is significant, and we're making good progress. As detailed on Page 13 of your presentation, we've opened 93 growth international locations so far this year, 29 in the third quarter to end the quarter with 480 stores in the segment.
Revenue increased 16% in the quarter to $92.8 million operating income increased 13% to $18.2 million. The operating income rate decreased 60 basis points to 19.6 driven by FX headwinds. Absent the impact of FX, OI rate would have been 3 to 4 percentage points higher. Retail sales growth in local currency in the international business continues to be strong.
At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. In the U.K, we have a busy quarter ahead with another 4 stores to open to end the year with 14 stores. In the Middle East, we opened our fifth store of the year 2 weeks ago in Istanbul, bringing the total to 16 VS stores and 3 PINK stores.
Staying with Victoria's Secret, our beauty and accessories business continues to progress well with 342 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We have another 40 or so to open in Q4. 
Turning to Bath & Body Works, we now have 110 international stores, and we continue to be very pleased with their performance. We expect to open another 15 or so BBW international stores in the balance of the year.
So in summary, continued progress for our international business in the third quarter and we remain focused on the fundamentals, great execution of our brands wherever we go. With that, I'll say thank you. And I'll turn it back over to Amie."

As we think about merchandise margin and the related buying and occupancy expense, and we are thinking, it's been very consistent about this, we have some additional opportunity, probably not a lot in the merchandise margin rate. And the reason for that is, the most important thing is to get the product right. And from that, obviously, we get full-price selling and all good things happen. There's a little bit more opportunity or some more additional opportunity as related to speed and the value that, that creates. But all of that is balanced against making sure that we're providing great value to customers. And what we don't want to do is have the margin percents get too high and as a result, either limit our growth in terms of dollar growth or have the outcome where the customer doesn't feel like she's getting a terrific value. So that's really how we think about it. As we've talked about previously, we're not a company that's particularly focused on AUCs. We obviously do buy a lot of merchandise, and we're not looking to overpay. But what we're focused on is innovation, newness, fashion, speed, product quality. That's where we spend most of our time and energy working with a great group of partners in terms of the focus that manufacture our merchandise. As it relates to buying and occupancy expenses, we are investing in our stores. And as we outlined a few weeks ago at our annual update, we're very energized and optimistic about the growth that, that will provide for the company and frankly, the strategic in force of that, if you will, in terms of ensuring the full stores environment remain very compelling for our customers. And as a result, the dollar growth in our buying and occupancy expense will be in the mid single-digit range for the remainder of this year and going into next year. So that would be how I would outline our thinking about gross margin rates. Thanks."

The -- those recorded revenues have been up significantly to last year, but have been impacted by really 3 things. The first is FX headwinds, which had about 6 points of impact. The second is delays some store openings versus the prior year. We still have over 50 stores to open between now and the end of January, which is a little late than I would like.

There will be certain stores in certain regions depending on their penetration of beauty. But outside of that, there's pretty much of a consistency. So we're excited about that. As I'm thinking about the angel card relaunch and the margins that you're talking about for third quarter and the promotional activity, the promotional activity was not greater. We do not have more promotions this third quarter versus last year. We did the promotions we did actually were bigger and better. So we're trying to get fewer, but bigger and better. Therefore, driving traffic and efficiencies within the store. As I think about fourth quarter, right now, we are planning to have a few less promotions in the fourth quarter. We thought that we had so many last year. This year, we also have a lot of contingencies in place just in case that we need to react to the business to keeping that agility. So we're looking forward to how this fourth quarter does play out."

And you should be sure that we'll continue to look for ways to work to offset those investments. But as a general matter, we will be looking to hold SG&A rates flat or get slight leverage over time. We referenced in our remarks a few weeks ago in the broader group that we're also thinking about dollar growth versus rate expansion. And as you appreciate, there's a lot of balance in that.

But as we sit here and knowing the mindset of Sharen, Nick, Martin, the other leaders at the business left, at the end of the day, we will continue to make sure we're making the right investments to grow our business, but also be tough-minded about driving trade-offs to either fully fund or at least partly fund those investments.

We are the number 1, number 2, number 3 lingerie brands in the world. Having a value play underneath the Victoria's make a ton of strategic sense, so we're very committed to its future. The one bogey that we have on La Senza, of course, and we reference it a number of times in this call, is the FX rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, which gives us a really, really significant headwind.

But in answer to your question, $800 million to $1 billion with an assumption that we wouldn't seek to use the revolver. That number has come up a little bit as our capital spending levels have come up over the last few years."

So the travel retail business continues to be very, very good business. It's sophisticated customers around the world who have got money to spend, who have time on their hands. It's just a terrific space to be in, particularly for beauty and accessories businesses. So we remain committed to it. I think Victoria's is now the largest standalone retail operator, stand-alone stores in travel retail globally, which is terrific from a standing start in just a few years. And we still see significant growth ahead of us. So we're going to continue to open 30 or 40 more travel retail doors in 2016. Has there been a slowdown in the last 3 to 6 months? Yes, there had. And I think that's primarily driven by a couple of things. The world is not what is was. It's anymore security challenges around the world that was probably the case of this time last year. The Russian customers traveling to the extent that she was the Chinese consumer has changed patterns of travel. So all of those things in the mix, along with generally a bit of a malaise in travel retail driven by security concerns, I think have taken the market down overall, the overall travel retail market down some probably mid single-digit would be my guess. But overall, the message is we're very, very happy with the business, and we see it as a very productive and strategically right place for us to operate."

We delivered record third quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 25% to $0.55 versus $0.44 last ye",919,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered record third quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 25% to $0.55 versus $0.44 last year. Excluding the $0.04 negative impact from foreign exchange rates, earnings growth was 34%. As Les commented in our press release, our brands are differentiated and have high emotional content, and we can continue to deliver new, compelling merchandise in an exciting in-store experience. We remain focused on executing fundamentals and staying close to our customers. We are pleased with our month-to-date performance and we are well positioned for the most significant part of our year which is in front of us. 
To take you through the third quarter results that is detailed on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales for the quarter increased 7% to $2.482 billion. And comps increased 7%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 percentage point. The gross margin rate increased by 80 basis points to 41.6%, driven roughly by an improvement -- driven roughly equally by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate in buying and occupancy leverage. SG&A expenses leveraged by 70 basis points.  Operating income dollars grew by 19%, and our operating income rate improved by 140 basis points. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter up 7% versus last year and down 6% on a 2-year basis.
Inventories reflect some early receipts at the end of the quarter and are clean, and we are well positioned. We repurchased 751,000 shares of stock in the third quarter for $61 million. At quarter end, we had $137 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program.
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in square footage increased store selling payroll driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and a higher tax rate. Versus our previous forecast, our full year guidance reflects our third quarter peak, less the impact of incremental interest expense from our recent $1 billion 20-year note issuance of about $0.04. As a reminder, interest expense related to this debt will be about $69 million on an annual basis.
Our fourth quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect a 2- to 3-point positive spread between comps and total sales. We expect the fourth quarter gross margin rate and SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. We expect fourth quarter net nonoperating expense consisting primarily of interest expense to be about $95 million, $18 million more than last year driven by the new debt.
We expect earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95 in the fourth quarter against last year's $1.89 result. This forecast includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.05 and the incremental interest expense of about $0.04. A higher assumed effective tax rate is having a negative $0.05 impact.
Adjusting for these factors, earnings per share growth at the high end of our range is about 10%.
We expend -- expect to end the fourth quarter with inventory per square foot up mid single-digits to last year. For the full year, we are projecting positive low to mid-single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage and our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about a point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up and the SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. Net nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $335 million. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact EPS by about $0.07.
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 296 million in the fourth quarter and 297 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.69 and $3.79. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.12.
We are projecting 2015 CapEx of about $800 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities. As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions at existing Victoria's Secret stores and 26 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 26 net new openings and 83 remodels.
Total company square footage will increase by between 3% and 4%. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of between $750 million and $850 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

Total sales increased 8% to $1.6 billion, and comps increased 7% on top of 3% last year. Operating income of $211 million was at $19 [ph] million or up 10% to last year.
Included in last year's results are approximately $36 million in apparel sales in the direct channel, which we have fully exited this year. Excluding this item, our segment sales growth would have been between 2 and 3 points higher. We began the quarter with successful Body by Victoria and Wear Everywhere Bra launches as well as a record back-to-school result in our PINK business. That strength continued throughout the quarter as customers responded to our newness and fashion, leading to double-digit growth in our bra, panty and loungewear categories.
In regard to the Beauty business, we are in the process of a full repositioning of this category and remain committed to delivering an elevated Beauty business that is more consistent with the Victoria's Secret brand. Throughout this transition, we expect an outstanding Beauty results, which are down to last year. Merchandise margin dollars for the segment increased versus last year, driven by strength in both stores and direct. Rate was up slightly to last year. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up to last year, driven by planned strategic investments in PINK and increased Beauty inventory related to the fantasy's restage.
Now let's turn to the specific channel performance starting with stores. Sales for the quarter increased 9% to $1.3 billion and comps increased 7% on top of 3% last year. Sales growth was driven by strength in bras and panties as well as PINK loungewear. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year. Margin rate declined, driven by planned promotional activity, including our Angel Card reissue and unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business.
Additionally, lower Beauty sales led to an unfavorable mix impact. Total expenses levered slightly versus last year as an improvement in the buying and occupancy rate, which partially offset by deleverage in SG&A, driven by investments in selling expense to improve the customer experience within the stores. For the quarter, operating income dollars were up to last year, and the operating income rate was down. 
Now turning to the direct channel. Our strategy to distort to core categories is working, and we were pleased with results in our direct channel. Third quarter sales were up 4% as 20% growth in our go-forward category more than offset $36 million of non-go-forward apparel. The merchandise margin rate and dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continue to distort to the core. Operating income dollars and rate increased significantly.
In summary, we know that the majority of the season is ahead of us. And in order to deliver our goal, we are going to remain focused on our cross customer, our core business and executing with excellence. We are excited and optimistic about holiday, which starts with Black Friday next week. So happy Thanksgiving, everyone. We are positioned with a strong, fashion-right assortment and activities that will drive both self purchase and gifting. This includes our new bra launch in early December.
Following Black Friday weekend, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will air on Tuesday, December 8, 10:00 p.m. Eastern standard time, featuring musical performance by Ellie Goulding, Selena Gomez and The Weekend. Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

Third quarter sales of Bath & Body Works North America was $705 million, up 7% or $46 million to last year, and comps increased 6% on top of 7% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. Merchandise margin rate for the quarter was up with gains from effective leveraging pricing and promotion being partially offset by negative impact of foreign exchange in our Canadian business.
For the quarter, operating income was $136 million, up 46% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 510 basis points to 19.3%, driven by improvements in sales, margin and SG&A expense leverage. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel, which grew sales by 20% and operating income significantly in the quarter versus last year.

As in previous calls, I should give you a brief overview of progress in our international businesses. As you know, our opportunity for international growth is significant, and we're making good progress. As detailed on Page 13 of your presentation, we've opened 93 gross international locations so far this year, 29 in the third quarter, to end the quarter with 480 stores in the segment.
Revenue increased 16% in the quarter to $92.8 million and operating income increased 13% to $18.2 million. The operating income rate decreased 50 basis points to 19.6, driven by FX headwinds. Absent the impact of FX, OI rate would have been 3 to 4 percentage points higher. Retail sales growth in local currency in the international business continues to be strong.
At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. In the U.K., we have a busy quarter ahead with another 4 stores to open to end the year with 14 stores. In the Middle East, we opened our fifth store of the year 2 weeks ago in Istanbul, bringing the total to 16 VS stores and 3 PINK stores.
Staying with Victoria's Secret, our Beauty and Accessories business continues to progress well, with 342 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We have another 40 or so to open in Q4.
Turning to Bath & Body Works, we now have 110 international stores, and we continue to be very pleased with their performance. We expect to open another 15 or so BBW International stores in the balance of the year.
So in summary, continued progress for our international business in the third quarter, and we remain focused on the fundamentals, great execution of our brands wherever we go. 
With that, I'll say thank you. And I'll turn it back over to Amie."

As we think about merchandise margin and related buying an occupancy expense and we are thinking, it's been very consistent about this. We have some additional opportunity, probably not a lot in the merchandise margin rate. And the reason for that is, the most important thing is to get the product right. And from that, obviously, we get full-price selling and all good things happen. There is a little bit more opportunity or some more additional opportunity as it relates to speed and the value that, that creates. But all of that is balanced against making sure that we're providing great value to customers. And what we don't want to do is have the margin percents get too high and as a result, either limit our growth in terms of dollar growth or have the outcome where the customer doesn't feel like she's getting a terrific value. So that's really how we think about it. As we've talked about previously, we're not a company that's particularly focused on AUCs. We obviously do buy a lot of merchandise, and we're not looking to overpay. But what we're focused on is innovation, newness, fashion, speed, product quality. That's where we spend most of our time and energy working with a great group of partners in terms of the focus that manufacture our merchandise. As it relates to buying and occupancy expenses, we are investing in our stores. And as we outlined a few weeks ago at our annual update, we're very energized and optimistic about the growth that, that will provide for the company and frankly, the strategic importance of that, if you will, in terms of ensuring the store environment remain very compelling for our customers. And as a result, the dollar growth in our buying and occupancy expense will be in the mid-single-digit range for the remainder of this year and going into next year. So that would be how I would outline our thinking about gross margin rates. Thanks."

Retail sales in local currencies are up significantly to last year and broadly in line with the increases that we saw in the previous quarter.

It's a mix of owned retail in the U.K., retail royalty streams that come from our franchise businesses and wholesale income that comes through travel retail. So it's 3 things in that part. The -- those recorded revenues have been up significantly to last year but have been impacted by really 3 things. The first is FX headwinds, which had about 6 points of impact. The second is delays to some store openings versus the prior year. We still have over 50 stores to open between now and the end of January, which is a little late than I would like. And the third is the travel retail business globally has seen a little bit of slowdown. So those are impacting our revenue stream.

As we have thought about our Beauty business, we have continued to shrink the real estate in our Beauty business because we feel like it has the opportunity to be much more productive.

And that certainly is putting pressure on near term results. But we're also, in many cases, finding ways to at least partly offset some of those investments. And you should be sure that we'll continue to look for ways to work to offset those investments. But as a general matter, we will be looking to hold SG&A rates flat or get slight leverage over time. We referenced in our remarks a few weeks ago in the broader group that we're also thinking about dollar growth versus rate expansion. And as you appreciate, there's a lot of balance in that. And so -- and that certainly applies to the SG&A line as well. But as we sit here and knowing the mindset of Sharen, Nick, Martin, the other leaders in the business last, at the end of the day, we will continue to make sure we're making the right investments to grow our business but also be tough-minded about driving trade-offs to either fully fund or at least partly fund those investments.

We also see sales momentum in the business, where we're collocated with Victoria's and PINK is really strong. So there's a real relevance for that brand in the marketplace alongside the other 2 businesses that we own. The logic for keeping it, I think, is obvious and compelling. We are the number 1, number 2 and number 3 lingerie brands in the world. Having a value play underneath the Victoria's make a ton of strategic sense and so we're very committed to its future. The one bogey that we have on La Senza, of course, and we've referenced to a number of times in this call, is the FX rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, which gives us a really, really significant headwind.

Its sophisticated customers around the world who have got money to spend, who have time on their hands and it's just a terrific space to be in, particularly for beauty and accessories businesses. So we remain committed to it. I think Victoria's is now the largest stand-alone retail operator of stand-alone stores in travel retail globally, which is terrific from a standing start in just a few years. And we still see significant growth ahead of us. So we're going to continue to open 30 or 40 more travel retail doors in 2016. Has there been a slowdown in the last 3 to 6 months? Yes, there had. And I think that's primarily driven by a couple of things. The world is not what it was. There's certainly more security challenges around the world than was probably the case this time last year. The Russian customers not traveling to the extent that she was. The Chinese consumer has changed patterns of travel. So all of those things in the mix, along with generally a bit of a malaise in travel retail driven by security concerns, I think have taken the market down overall. The overall travel retail market down some probably mid single-digit would be my guess. But overall, the message is we're very, very happy with the business, and we see it as a very productive and strategically right place for us to operate."

We delivered record third quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management.

We delivered record third quarter results as we continued to deliver sales growth, merchandise margin rate improvement and sound inventory management. Earnings per share increased 25% to $0.55 versus $0.44 last year. Excluding the $0.04 negative impact from foreign exchange rates, earnings growth was 34%. As Les commented in our press release, our brands are differentiated and have high emotional content, and we can continue to deliver new, compelling merchandise in an exciting in-store experience. We remain focused on executing fundamentals and staying close to our customers. We are pleased with our month-to-date performance and we are well positioned for the most significant part of our year which is in front of us. 
To take you through the third quarter results as detailed on Page 4 of the presentation. Net sales for the quarter increased 7% to $2.482 billion. And comps increased 7%. Foreign currency negatively impacted our sales growth by about 1 percentage point. The gross margin rate increased by 80 basis points to 41.6%, driven roughly by an improvement -- driven roughly equally by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate in buying and occupancy leverage. SG&A expenses leveraged by 70 basis points. Operating income dollars grew by 19%, and our operating income rate improved by 140 basis points. 
Turning to the balance sheet on Page 8. Retail inventories per square foot at cost ended the quarter up 7% versus last year and down 6% on a 2-year basis.
Inventories reflect some early receipts at the end of the quarter and are clean, and we are well positioned. We repurchased 751,000 shares of stock in the third quarter for $61 million. At quarter end, we had $137 million remaining under our current $250 million repurchase program.
Turning to Page 11 of the presentation. Our forecast for 2015 reflects actions we are taking to grow our business. Growth in square footage increased store selling payroll driven by our efforts to improve the customer experience and investments in international expansion. It also reflects an estimated negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and a higher tax rate. Versus our previous forecast, our full year guidance reflects our third quarter peak, less the impact of incremental interest expense from our recent $1 billion 20-year note issuance of about $0.04. As a reminder, interest expense related to this debt will be about $69 million on an annual basis.
Our fourth quarter earnings forecast reflects a low single-digit comp increase. We expect a 2- to 3-point positive spread between comps and total sales. We expect the fourth quarter gross margin rate and SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. We expect fourth quarter net nonoperating expense consisting primarily of interest expense to be about $95 million, $18 million more than last year driven by the new debt.
We expect earnings per share between $1.85 and $1.95 in the fourth quarter against last year's $1.89 result. This forecast includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.05 and the incremental interest expense of about $0.04. A higher assumed effective tax rate is having a negative $0.05 impact.
Adjusting for these factors, earnings per share growth at the high end of our range is about 10%.
We expend -- expect to end the fourth quarter with inventory per square foot up mid single-digits to last year. For the full year, we are projecting positive low to mid-single-digit comps. Total sales growth will be about 1 point higher than comps due to growth in square footage and our international business. Foreign currency translation is expected to negatively impact sales growth by about a point.
We expect our full year gross margin rate to be up and the SG&A rate to be about flat to last year. Net nonoperating expenses, consisting principally of interest expense, are projected to be about $335 million. Before any discrete items, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 37.5% versus 36.3% in 2014. The higher projected tax rate in 2015 will negatively impact EPS by about $0.07.
We are forecasting weighted average shares of about 296 million in the fourth quarter and 297 million for the full year. Assuming all of these inputs, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 to be between $3.69 and $3.79. This estimate includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of about $0.12.
We are projecting 2015 CapEx of about $800 million. As you know, about 70% of our CapEx budget is for real estate and stores. The remainder relates to investments in technology, logistics and facilities. As detailed on Page 12 of the presentation, Victoria's Secret square footage in North America will increase by about 4% this year, driven by expansions at existing Victoria's Secret stores and 26 net new openings. Bath & Body Works square footage in North America will increase by about 3%, driven by 26 net new openings and 83 remodels.
Total company square footage will increase by between 3% and 4%. 
Turning to liquidity. We expect 2015 free cash flow of between $750 million and $850 million. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our free cash flow and cash position, along with the additional availability under our revolving credit facility, results in very strong liquidity, which is more than sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend and any other foreseeable needs.
Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Sharen."

Total sales increased 8% to $1.6 billion, and comps increased 7% on top of 3% last year. Operating income of $211 million was up $19 million or up 10% to last year.
Included in last year's results are approximately $36 million in apparel sales in the direct channel, which we have fully exited this year. Excluding this item, our segment sales growth would have been between 2 and 3 points higher. We began the quarter with successful Body by Victoria and Wear Everywhere Bra launches as well as a record back-to-school result in our PINK business. That strength continued throughout the quarter as customers responded to our newness and fashion, leading to double-digit growth in our bra, panty and loungewear categories.
In regard to the Beauty business, we are in the process of a full repositioning of this category and remain committed to delivering an elevated Beauty business that is more consistent with the Victoria's Secret brand. Throughout this transition, we expect and are seeing Beauty results, which are down to last year. Merchandise margin dollars for the segment increased versus last year, driven by strength in both stores and direct. Rate was up slightly to last year. We finished the quarter with inventory levels up to last year, driven by planned strategic investments in PINK and increased Beauty inventory related to the fantasy's restage.
Now let's turn to the specific channel performance starting with stores. Sales for the quarter increased 9% to $1.3 billion and comps increased 7% on top of 3% last year. Sales growth was driven by strength in bras and panties as well as PINK loungewear. Merchandise margin dollars increased versus last year. Margin rate declined, driven by planned promotional activity, including our Angel Card reissue and unfavorable FX impact in our Canadian business.
Additionally, lower Beauty sales led to an unfavorable mix impact. Total expenses levered slightly versus last year as an improvement in the buying and occupancy rate, which partially offset by deleverage in SG&A, driven by investments in selling expense to improve the customer experience within the stores. For the quarter, operating income dollars were up to last year, and the operating income rate was down. 
Now turning to the direct channel. Our strategy to distort to core categories is working, and we were pleased with results in our direct channel. Third quarter sales were up 4% as 20% growth in our go-forward category more than offset $36 million of non-go-forward apparel. The merchandise margin rate and dollars were up to last year during the quarter as we continue to distort to the core. Operating income dollars and rate increased significantly.
In summary, we know that the majority of the season is ahead of us. And in order to deliver our goal, we are going to remain focused on our cross customer, our core business and executing with excellence. We are excited and optimistic about holiday, which starts with Black Friday next week. So happy Thanksgiving, everyone. We are positioned with a strong, fashion-right assortment and activities that will drive both self purchase and gifting. This includes our new bra launch in early December.
Following Black Friday weekend, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will air on Tuesday, December 8, 10:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, featuring musical performance by Ellie Goulding, Selena Gomez and The Weekend. Thanks. And now I'll turn the discussion over to Nick."

We were again able to increase earnings versus our record earnings last year. We were able to drive growth in sales while improving margin rates and continuing to manage inventory appropriately.
Third quarter sales of Bath & Body Works North America was $705 million, up 7% or $46 million to last year, and comps increased 6% on top of 7% last year. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses: our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and our home fragrance assortment. Merchandise margin rate for the quarter was up with gains from effective leveraging pricing and promotion being partially offset by negative impact of foreign exchange in our Canadian business.
For the quarter, operating income was $136 million, up 46% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 510 basis points to 19.3%, driven by improvements in sales, margin and SG&A expense leverage. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel, which grew sales by 20% and operating income significantly in the quarter versus last year. We ended the quarter with inventory up slightly to last year as we prepared for the fourth quarter. We remain focused on disciplined inventory and expense management, and we'll continue to make appropriate investments to drive growth in the business.
We have begun the fourth quarter of 2015 with our holiday theme featuring customer fragrance favorites as well as new winter fragrances in our 3 key businesses. We will be focused on delivering the Perfect Christmas and giving her the holiday experience that she has come to expect from Bath & Body Works, including newness in our core product categories, gifting options and an irresistible in-store experience.

As in previous calls, I should give you a brief overview of progress in our international businesses. As you know, our opportunity for international growth is significant, and we're making good progress. As detailed on Page 13 of your presentation, we've opened 93 gross international locations so far this year, 29 in the third quarter, to end the quarter with 480 stores in the segment.
Revenue increased 16% in the quarter to $92.8 million and operating income increased 13% to $18.2 million. The operating income rate decreased 50 basis points to 19.6, driven by FX headwinds. Absent the impact of FX, OI rate would have been 3 to 4 percentage points higher. Retail sales growth in local currency in the international business continues to be strong.
At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. In the U.K., we have a busy quarter ahead with another 4 stores to open to end the year with 14 stores. In the Middle East, we opened our fifth store of the year 2 weeks ago in Istanbul, bringing the total to 16 VS stores and 3 PINK stores.
Staying with Victoria's Secret, our Beauty and Accessories business continues to progress well, with 342 locations opened at the end of the quarter, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We have another 40 or so to open in Q4.
Turning to Bath & Body Works, we now have 110 international stores, and we continue to be very pleased with their performance. We expect to open another 15 or so BBW International stores in the balance of the year.
So in summary, continued progress for our international business in the third quarter, and we remain focused on the fundamentals, great execution of our brands wherever we go.

As we think about merchandise margin and related buying and occupancy expense and we've -- our thinking's been very consistent about this. We have some additional opportunity, probably not a lot in the merchandise margin rate. And the reason for that is, the most important thing is to get the product right. And from that, obviously, we get full-price selling and all good things happen. There is a little bit more opportunity or some more additional opportunity as it relates to speed and the value that, that creates. But all of that is balanced against making sure that we're providing great value to customers. And what we don't want to do is have the margin percents get too high and as a result, either limit our growth in terms of dollar growth or have the outcome where the customer doesn't feel like she's getting a terrific value. So that's really how we think about it. As we've talked about previously, we're not a company that's particularly focused on AUCs. We obviously do buy a lot of merchandise, and we're not looking to overpay. But what we're really focused on is innovation, newness, fashion, speed, product quality. That's where we spend most of our time and energy working with a great group of partners in terms of the folks that manufacture our merchandise. As it relates to buying and occupancy expenses, we are investing in our stores. And as we outlined a few weeks ago at our annual update, we're very energized and optimistic about the growth that, that will provide for the company and frankly, the strategic importance of that, if you will, in terms of ensuring those store environments remain very compelling for our customers. And as a result, the dollar growth in our buying and occupancy expense will be in the mid-single-digit range for the remainder of this year and going into next year. So that would be how I would outline our thinking about gross margin rates. Thanks."

Retail sales in local currencies are up significantly to last year and broadly in line with the increases that we saw in the previous quarter. Secondly, you look at recorded revenue, which you'll remember, is a mix of 3 things. It's a mix of owned retail in the U.K., retail royalty streams that come from our franchise businesses and wholesale income that comes through travel retail. So it's 3 things in that part. The -- those recorded revenues have been up significantly to last year but have been impacted by really 3 things. The first is FX headwinds, which had about 6 points of impact. The second is delays to some store openings versus the prior year. We still have over 50 stores to open between now and the end of January, which is a little later than I would like. And the third is that the travel retail business globally has seen a little bit of slowdown. So those are impacting our revenue stream. As far as the OI rates is concerned, I'd just remind you that, that FX, when pressured, is pretty significant. And if we adjusted for that, we'd see about 3 or 4 percentage points higher rates than we're seeing right now."

The strategic intent of taking Beauty off the lease line and closer to the cash wrap has allowed us to become more productive. Therefore, we've been stagnant a little bit in our growth category. We felt like the Beauty business was trading on the brand equity versus the opportunity to trade up, to have it really leave the category from a prestigious perspective. And as our -- base of our business was in the fantasies business, which is more of an opening price point, high unit velocity business. We're trading into more of a fine fragrance business as well as a higher in body care business.

So on SG&A expense, as a percent of sales, what our goal as a company is over time, and we've been pretty consistent in our thinking about this, is to grow expenses slower than sales. You point out in your question we've talked about, you're aware of the fact that we are investing in a more highly paid, more productive sales associate in our business. And that certainly is putting pressure on near term results. But we're also, in many cases, finding ways to at least partly offset some of those investments. And you should be sure that we'll continue to look for ways to work to offset those investments. But as a general matter, we will be looking to hold SG&A rates flat or get slight leverage over time. We referenced in our remarks a few weeks ago in the broader group that we're also thinking about dollar growth versus rate expansion. And as you appreciate, there's a lot of balance in that. And so -- and that certainly applies to the SG&A line as well. But as we sit here and knowing the mindset of Sharen, Nick, Martin, the other leaders in the business left, at the end of the day, we will continue to make sure we're making the right investments to grow our business but also be tough-minded about driving trade-offs to either fully fund or at least partly fund those investments.

Well, La Senza continues to be a work in progress, no doubt about that, but we're pretty pleased with the progress we've made. We continued to see positive sales momentum in the business. We're getting closer to the target customer, better assortments, more fashion-right, on significantly tighter inventory. So that's all really good and really positive. We also see sales momentum in the business, where we're collocated with Victoria's and PINK is really strong. So there's a real relevance for that brand in the marketplace alongside the other 2 businesses that we own. The logic for keeping it, I think, is obvious and compelling. We own the number 1, number 2 and number 3 lingerie brands in the world. Having a value play underneath the Victoria's makes a ton of strategic sense and so we're very committed to its future. But the one bogey that we have on La Senza, of course, and we've referenced it a number of times in this call, is the FX rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, which gives us a really, really significant headwind. But it is what it is. FX is outside of our control, and we continue to get better, stay focused on the customer and really lean into this key time of year."

And I think that's primarily driven by a couple of things. The world is not what it was. There's certainly more security challenges around the world than was probably the case this time last year. The Russian customer's not traveling to the extent that she was. The Chinese consumer has changed patterns of travel. So all of those things in the mix, along with generally a bit of a malaise in travel retail driven by security concerns, I think have taken the market down overall. The overall travel retail market down some probably mid single-digit would be my guess.

So in terms of the flex point on SG&A or store selling, it's not actually static, it's more dynamic. Really, the only -- at least in meaningful times of the year, important times of the year, the only fixed part of store payroll is the management complement, certainly, in lower volume periods in the year, more of the payroll is fixed, if you will. But again, we'll be looking to grow expenses lower than sales as we move forward. We are making investments in store selling. We'll give you more guidance about '16 when we give guidance in February for the coming year. But again, know that we are looking to grow expenses lower than sales. And I know it's kind of handy or helpful to have a breakpoint, but I'm just being transparent with you. It's not as simple as oh, it's 4% or 5%, because it's more dynamic than that, and we manage it in a more dynamic way than that."

I think we want to be in a position to fundamentally follow last year's pattern, but be in a position to react to the market and/or react to the customer in terms of the dynamics of that particular period. And how that relates to the online channel, we're pretty well integrated from a comparable product, comparable price, comparable promotion. And that works really, really well for us. So we'll leverage either the channel dependent upon what's really going on in the market."

What you see is that there's a big Black Friday weekend and kind of leading up to, then it kind of tranches down a little bit, and the last 2 weeks gets stronger and then continue to -- through past Christmas. I think that having seen these patterns, we've been -- we're very well positioned in our thinking, in our programs, how we're delivering merchandise to take advantage of those change in the patterns. We also have had much alignment and are still aligned within our direct channel as well as our store channel. We believe the engagement in social and how we are looking at using our social media this year will be very important. So I think that we are ready. And I think the most important thing is that you just never know. There's always something that comes up and surprises you. And because of our trying to make sure that we stay as agile as we can with our contingencies in our thinking and how we were going to operate the business in holiday, I think we're prepared for those. You never know. There are always some surprises. But we're not really starting earlier. I think we understand where the big days are and where the traffic is going to be, and that's what we're focused on."
